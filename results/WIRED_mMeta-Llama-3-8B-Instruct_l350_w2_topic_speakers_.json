And it seems like that has nothing to do with gravity, but he later begins to think about the incompatibility of gravity with his theory of relativity. So suppose the Sun were to disappear tomorrow. Some evil genius comes and just figures out a way to evaporate the Sun. In Newton's understanding of gravity, we would instantaneously know about it all the way over here at the Earth. And that's incompatible with the concept that nothing can travel faster than the speed of light. No information, not even information about the Sun, could possibly travel faster than the speed of light. So we shouldn't know about what happened to the Sun for a full eight minutes, which is the time it would take light to travel to us. And so he begins to question why gravity is so incompatible with relativity, but he already knows he's thinking about space and time in relativity. So then he gets to his general theory of relativity where he realizes if I eliminate everything but just the gravitational field of let's say the Earth and I look at how things fall and I see that they follow curves, well, then he realizes that space and time don't just contract or dilate, that they can really warp, that they can bend and that they can curve. And then he finds a way to make gravity compatible with relativity by saying if the Sun were to disappear tomorrow, the curves that the Sun imprinted in space-time would actually begin to ripple, and those are the gravitational waves, and they would change and they would flatten out, 'cause the Sun was no longer there. And that would take the light-travel time to get to us to tell us that the Sun was gone, and then we would stop orbiting and just travel along a straight line.","1":"Well I brought a little bit of a prop to explain how chirped pulse amplification works. Our short pulses are made of different colors. So I've got a colored slinky here. We probably could've called it stretched pulse amplification but that's kind of boring so we used the word chirped. The word chirped comes around because birds chirp. When the birds are singing, the notes are actually changing audio frequency with time and that's a chirp. The point is is that when all the light is squeezed together like this, it's a short pulse. And that's when it's a hammer because all of the light is now concentrated and you can imagine if this was coming along and also using a lens to focus it small, then all of that light at the focal spot, concentrate. And so that was the laser hammer. So we can't have that in the laser. So the question is what could we do? The fact that it's different colors and different colors because of dispersion, travel different speeds inside material. So we used a long fiber, 1.4 kilometers of fiber but, in fiber, the red colors really haven't got that much in common with the glass atoms and so they spend very little time interacting and they travel fast. The red is going to start traveling faster than the green, faster than the blue and, as you travel down the fiber, next thing you know, you have a long pulse and it's chirped from red at the beginning to blue at the back. And so the frequencies go hoo! Like this okay? So this is a chirped pulse and now it's a long pulse. And so, first this is what we did, we chirped it, we stretched it, then we can safely amplify it because it's not all concentrated and, after we amplify it, then we use something called a compressor and we put all of the colors back together and it was back being a short pulse but a high energy pulse. And then we really had what I like to call a laser hammer. When this laser pulse goes inside, it smacks those electrons right off the atom.","2":"That's the good news. The bad news is that it only seems to work if spacetime is ten dimensional. [chuckles] So you would say well then it's wrong. It can't be right. Spacetime is not ten-dimensional. Spacetime is four dimensional. We've observed that. But instead, we say if spacetime looks four dimensional to us, but string theory, which might be the best theory we have of quantum gravity says it must be ten dimensional, maybe we can hide those extra six dimensions somehow. So here's how we could get lucky. We could imagine that there are extra dimensions of space that are curled up somehow that are so small that we can't see them. This is actually an old idea. It goes back to Kaluza and Klein right after general relativity was invented in 1915. But there's a more recent idea that says there could actually be relatively large extra dimensions. There could be extra dimensions that are actually that big, like a millimeter across that you would not have noticed. But here's the new, exciting idea. So let's imagine, okay. This is a piece of paper. But let's imagine this is our entire world. So, in other words, our real world is three dimensional, but let's imagine that we're just idealizing it down to two dimensions, so we all live here. You and I live here. But let's imagine that we're embedded in this bigger space. So there are extra dimensions that are actually big, okay? And let's imagine that. When I say we live on this three dimensional world what I mean is imagine that the particles that you and I are made of, right, the quarks, the leptons, the electrons and everything, all the forces we know about, electromagnetism, the weak nuclear force, the strong nuclear force, imagine they can't leave this surface. This is what we call a brane. B-R-A-N-E. Have you heard this word before?"},"dialogue":{"0":"Explainer: Isn't it kind of amazing?\nExplainee: Yeah. [laughs]\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Wow.\nExplainer: Wow. [Janna and Lisa laughs] Well, let's hope it doesn't happen.\n","1":"Explainer: Okay. As opposed to the experimental side and seeing things? Okay so I'm much more, I like to see the things happening. So then the question is, what's so special about making a light that's intense enough to actually possibly blow things up? Certainly we can blow atoms up with the laser hammer and when the laser light comes in and just smacks the electrons right off the atom. And so the question really is how do you make that? Back in the 70s and into the 80s, I know that was a long time ago for you, we had big energy lasers and we had short pulse lasers, we couldn't have big energy, short pulse lasers and actually it was my supervisor and I that figured the way around that and we got something called chirped pulse amplification. Have you heard of chirped pulse amplification by any chance?\nExplainee: Vaguely.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: So the laser hammer that you were describing with other types of lasers and the one in the chirped is it still the same premise?\nExplainer: Well a lot of lasers and when lasers first came along, they were only single color. Your cat toy, would only be a single color, probably a red one and so that's just one color. And one color means that it has to really be there for the whole time. One color is one wave length of light and so it's just one wave that goes on and on and on. If you want a short pulse, you actually have to have all the colors. And if you can imagine that one point in time, and I like to say it's like a conductor of an orchestra. When you're listening to an orchestra warm up, they sound terrible, they're all playing their own notes. But when the conductor conducts them, they all play different notes but, together, it's beautiful music. So we have something in the laser called a mode locker and it's like the conductor and it says go now. And all the colors will start together but some colors are long wave length and others are shorter. So next thing you know, you have peaks meeting valleys and they cancel each other. And the more colors you can bring in, the faster that happens and the shorter the pulse you can make.\n","2":"Explainer: Mm-hmm. So we have quantum mechanics, right? The theory of atoms and so forth and how those work, and then we have gravity, and gravity doesn't seem to fit in. It's the one force of nature that we can't really easily fit into this quantum mechanical framework, so string theory is one of the best ideas.\nExplainee: Right.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: I've heard it, yeah.\nExplainer: [Sean] Do you know where it comes from?\n"},"model":{"0":"Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct","1":"Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct","2":"Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct"},"topic":{"0":"about gravity ","1":"about lasers ","2":"about dimensions "},"explainer":{"0":" professor","1":" professor","2":" professor"},"explainee":{"0":" college student","1":" college student","2":" graduate student"},"footer_context":{"0":false,"1":false,"2":false},"model_output":{"0":"that we're not falling off our chairs right now!","1":"So, chirped pulse amplification is a way to make a laser that can produce a very short, intense pulse of light.","2":"So, the idea is that the fundamental building blocks of the universe are not particles, but tiny, vibrating strings."}}
