I can answer your questions about The Business Man (short story).","1":"What is the main theme of the short story The Business Man?","2":"The story is a satire and is often interpreted as a reflection of Poe's strained relationship with his foster father John Allan, himself a successful businessman.","3":"What is the story about?","4":"The story also satirizes businesspeople in general, suggesting that their success is not due to their method of punctuality and self-discipline but because of ruthless business practices, violence, egotism, and pure chance.","5":"Is there another theme I should know about?","6":"Poe also calls to question the concept of a \"self-made man\", expressing skepticism that such a concept is possible.","7":"Did he question other things besides that?","8":"Like \"The Man That Was Used Up\", another of Poe's satires, this man is essentially hollow and worthless.","9":"Are there any other interesting aspects about this article?","10":"In \"The Business Man\", Poe also makes fun of the dubious nature of phrenology, then a popular pseudoscience.","11":"Does he make fun of anything else?","12":"In the story, the narrator asserts: \"In biography, truth is every thing, and in autobiography it is especially so. \" This is ironic considering Poe's own tendency to alter his life story; he often omitted details of his military career, and invented stories about his nonexistent travels to Greece, Turkey, and Russia."}}
