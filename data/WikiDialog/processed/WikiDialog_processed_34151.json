I can answer your questions about Torc.","1":"What's the deal with this 'Orientalizing' style?","2":"Like other elite Celtic pieces in the \"orientalizing\" style, the decoration shows Greek influence but not a classical style, and the piece may have been made by Greeks in the Celtic taste, or a \"Graeco-Etruscan workshop\", or by Celts with foreign training.","3":"Are there any other interesting aspects about this article?","4":"Spiral ribbon torcs, usually with minimal terminals, continue a Bronze Age type and are found in the Stirling Hoard from Scotland, and elsewhere: \"Although over 110 identifiable British [includes Ireland] ribbon torcs are known, the dating of these simple, flexible ornaments is elusive\", perhaps indicating \"a long-lived preference for ribbon torcs, which continued for over 1,000 years\".","5":"What are some of the terminals?","6":"The terminals were often slightly flared plain round cylinders which were folded back to hook round each other to fasten the torc at the throat.","7":"What are some of the other types of torcs?","8":"Other Celtic torcs may use various ways of forming the hoop: plain or patterned round bars, two or more bars twisted together, thin round rods (or thick wire) wound round a core, or woven gold wire.","9":"Are these made of metals?","10":"A rarer type twists a single bar with an X profile.","11":"What do you find to be the most interesting fact about this article?","12":"Except in British looped terminals, the terminals of Iron Age torcs are usually formed separately."}}
