I can answer your questions about IC 1459.","1":"What is the mass of IC 1459?","2":"Estimates of the mass of the black hole based on gas kinematics are lower, from (1-4) \u00d7 10 to 10 , although the presence of non-gravitational forces acting on the circumnuclear gas renders them less accurate.","3":"What are the different estimates?","4":"The disturbed kinematics of the circumnuclear gas may be caused by an outflow.","5":"What else is notable about the mass?","6":"In the circumnuclear region there is also dust with irregular distribution, indicating nonequilibrium motions.","7":"Are there any other interesting aspects about this article?","8":"The galaxy is characterised as low-power radio loud, with gigahertz-peaked spectrum, and has two symmetrical radio jets.","9":"Is there any other spectra?","10":"In a 3.5 year observation period, the galaxy showed little variability.","11":"What did it look like?","12":"The galaxy also has weak X-ray emission."}}
