I can answer your questions about English cricket team in Australia in 1994\u201395.","1":"What was the highlight of the English cricket team's visit to Australia in 1994\u201395?","2":"He also called for the introduction of instant replay, after a run out situation earlier in the innings had gone against the tourists, \"the technology should be used,\" he said. \"It's a fail-safe method\".","3":"What other records did they create while touring Australia?","4":"The England skipper also praised Gough's Man-of-the-match performance.","5":"What else did you find interesting?","6":"Meanwhile, Taylor was relieved to escape with a draw and retain the Ashes. \" After being bowled out for 116, it's a relief to draw the Test.","7":"Did he make any other statements while in Australia?","8":"It'll probably turn to jubilation in an hour's time.\" Amidst the failure to qualify for the final of the One-day series and a drawn match with Victoria that saw Hick continue his good form with a century but little other joy, the Daily Mirror latched onto Gooch's poor form and suggested that he might miss out on the final two Tests and end his career in anti-climax while John Woodcock criticised the declaration at Sydney that denied Hick his century and the growing friction between the Captain and Chairman of Selectors.","9":"Did he retire while on tour?","10":"As it turned out, England were forced into two changes but Gooch retained his place: Gough was already back in England and was replaced by DeFreitas, while Hick failed to recover from a back spasm that plagued him during his innings against the Victorians and Chris Lewis, playing club cricket in the area, came in for him.","11":"Were there any other changes to personnel?","12":"The hosts also made two changes, with leg-spinner Peter McIntyre replacing May, who had been unsuccessful in the first three tests but was also recovering from a hamstring pull suffered in the One-dayers and Greg Blewett also making his Test debut in place of Michael Bevan."}}
