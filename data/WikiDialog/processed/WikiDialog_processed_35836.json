I can answer your questions about Disk encryption theory.","1":"What are the main types of block cipher modes?","2":"The considerations already listed make several well-known chaining modes unsuitable: ECB mode, which cannot be tweaked, and modes that turn block ciphers into stream ciphers, such as the CTR mode.","3":"Are there any other interesting aspects about this article?","4":"These three properties do not provide any assurance of disk integrity; that is, they don't tell you whether an adversary has been modifying your ciphertext.","5":"Why is that?","6":"In part, this is because an absolute assurance of disk integrity is impossible: no matter what, an adversary could always revert the entire disk to a prior state, circumventing any such checks.","7":"Is there anything else noteable about disk integrity?","8":"If some non-absolute level of disk integrity is desired, it can be achieved within the encrypted disk on a file-by-file basis using message authentication codes.","9":"What are the modes of operation?","10":"Like most encryption schemes, block cipher-based disk encryption makes use of \"modes of operation\", which allow encrypting larger amounts of data than the ciphers' block-size (typically 128 bits).","11":"What are the modes of operation in this article?","12":"Modes are therefore rules on how to repeatedly apply the ciphers' single-block operations."}}
