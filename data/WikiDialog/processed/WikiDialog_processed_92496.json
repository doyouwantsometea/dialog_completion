I can answer your questions about History of psychology.","1":"What are some examples of the instruments used in the history of psychology?","2":"Other timing instruments were borrowed from physiology (e.g., Carl Ludwig's kymograph) and adapted for use by the Utrecht ophthalmologist Franciscus Donders (1818\u20131899) and his student Johan Jacob de Jaager in measuring the duration of simple mental decisions.","3":"Are there any other interesting aspects about this article?","4":"The 19th century was also the period in which physiology, including neurophysiology, professionalized and saw some of its most significant discoveries.","5":"Who discovered some of these important aspects?","6":"Among its leaders were Charles Bell (1774\u20131843) and Fran\u00e7ois Magendie (1783\u20131855) who independently discovered the distinction between sensory and motor nerves in the spinal column, Johannes M\u00fcller (1801\u20131855) who proposed the doctrine of specific nerve energies, Emil du Bois-Reymond (1818\u20131896) who studied the electrical basis of muscle contraction, Pierre Paul Broca (1824\u20131880) and Carl Wernicke (1848\u20131905) who identified areas of the brain responsible for different aspects of language, as well as Gustav Fritsch (1837\u20131927), Eduard Hitzig (1839\u20131907), and David Ferrier (1843\u20131924) who localized sensory and motor areas of the brain.","7":"Did any other people play a part in the history of psychology?","8":"One of the principal founders of experimental physiology, Hermann Helmholtz (1821\u20131894), conducted studies of a wide range of topics that would later be of interest to psychologists \u2013 the speed of neural transmission, the natures of sound and color, and of our perceptions of them, etc.","9":"Did you find anything else interesting?","10":"In the 1860s, while he held a position in Heidelberg, Helmholtz engaged as an assistant a young M.D. named Wilhelm Wundt.","11":"What did Wundt do?","12":"Wundt employed the equipment of the physiology laboratory \u2013 chronoscope, kymograph, and various peripheral devices \u2013 to address more complicated psychological questions than had, until then, been investigated experimentally."}}
