I can answer your questions about SuperSmart Grid.","1":"What are the different applications of a SuperSmart Grid?","2":"The concept of a wide area \"Super grid\" with centralized control and the concept of small-scale, local and decentralized smart grid are two approaches that are often perceived as being mutually exclusive alternatives.","3":"Are there any other interesting aspects about this article?","4":"The SSG aims at reconciling the two approaches and considers them complementary and necessary to realize a transition towards a fully decarbonized electricity system.","5":"What would the super grid do?","6":"The super grid features would deliver inexpensive, high capacity, low loss transmission, interconnecting producers and consumers of electricity across vast distances.","7":"What does the smart grid do?","8":"Smart grid capabilities use the local grid's transmission and distribution network to coordinate distributed generation, grid storage and consumption into a cluster that appears to the super grid as a virtual power plant.","9":"Is there anything else noteable about the different applications?","10":"The name \"SuperSmart Grid\" was invented by Antonella Battaglini and used the first time in the position paper for the energy conference in Lund in 2007.","11":"What did people think of the concept?","12":"In the context of the SuperSmart Grid, advocates use the term \"super grid\" to refer to a network super imposed on top of local grid networks and should not be confused with the proper noun \"SuperGrid\" which refers to an undeveloped technology for combining hydrogen and electricity distribution."}}
