I can answer your questions about Initiatives and referendums in the United States.","1":"What happened in 2018 with the proposed constitutional amendment in Idaho?","2":"Despite the new requirement of the signatures of 6% of the registered voters in 18 of Idaho's 35 legislative districts before May, as of mid-April 2018 the drive to put the Medicaid gap before the voters on the November ballot (by way of their amending the state constitution, yea or nay) was well on its way to gathering the prerequisite number of signatures in the prerequisite number of legislative districts, much to the surprise of pundits.","3":"What happened after they put it on the ballot?","4":"Ultimately the organizers had by the April 30 deadline delivered 60,000 signatures to county clerks' offices, which if verified are far more than the 56,192 required.","5":"Are there any other interesting aspects about this article?","6":"Some proposed reforms include paying signature gatherers by the hour, rather than by the signature (to reduce incentives for fraud) and increasing transparency by requiring major financial backers of initiatives to be disclosed to potential signatories.","7":"What other reforms are being proposed?","8":"Other proposals include having a \"cooling-off\" period after an initiative qualifies, in which the legislature can make the initiative unnecessary by passing legislation acceptable to the initiative's sponsors.","9":"Are there any other interesting aspects about this article?","10":"It has also been proposed that proxy voting be combined with initiative and referendum to form a hybrid of direct democracy and representative democracy.","11":"What is the national initiative?","12":"The national initiative is a proposal to amend the United States Constitution to allow ballot initiatives at the federal level."}}
