I can answer your questions about HippoDraw.","1":"What is the difference between HippoDraw and other graphic programs?","2":"HippoDraw HippoDraw is a powerful object-oriented statistical data analysis package written in C++, with user interaction via a Qt-based GUI and a Python-scriptable interface.","3":"Who developed the program?","4":"It is being developed by Paul Kunz at SLAC, primarily for the analysis and presentation of particle physics and astrophysics data, but can be equally well used in other fields where data handling is important.","5":"What all can you do with this program?","6":"HippoDraw can read and write files in an XML-based format, astrophysics FITS files, data objects produced by ROOT (optional), and through the Python bindings, anything that can be read\/written by Python (HDF5, for instance, with PyTables).","7":"Is the program written in C++?","8":"HippoDraw can be used as a Python extension module, allowing users to use HippoDraw data objects with the full power of the Python language.","9":"Are there any other interesting aspects about this article?","10":"This includes other scientific Python extension modules such Numeric and numarray, whose use with HippoDraw can lead to a large increase in processing speed, even for ROOT objects."}}
