I can answer your questions about Hylogenesis.","1":"What is known about the structure of the early universe?","2":"Hylogenesis Hylogenesis is a physical theory about the mechanism behind the origins of dark matter and antimatter.","3":"Who proposed this theory?","4":"It was proposed in August 2010 in a paper by Hooman Davoudiasl, David E. Morrissey, Kris Sigurdson and Sean Tulin.","5":"What are the particles involved in the theory?","6":"The theory involves a fermion X, and its antiparticle , both of which may couple into quarks in the visible sector, and into hidden particles in a hidden sector, a sector which is not part of the Standard Model.","7":"Are there any other particles?","8":"The hidden states have masses near a GeV and very weak couplings to particles in the Standard Model.","9":"What else is significant about this theory?","10":"X and respectively decay into either baryonic matter or hidden baryonic matter, and into either antibaryonic matter or hidden antibaryonic matter, violating CP and quark baryon number.","11":"Is there anything else that is notable?","12":"An excess of baryonic matter is created in the visible sector, and an excess of antimatter is created in the hidden sector."}}
