I can answer your questions about Acoustic tweezers.","1":"What are the equations of the acoustic tweezers?","2":"Substituting the perturbation series into the mass conservation and Navier-Stokes equation and using the relation of formula_47, the first-order equations can be obtained by collecting terms in first-order, Similarly, the second-order equations can be found as well,  For the first-order equations, taking the time derivation of the Navier-Stokes equation and inserting the mass conservation , a combined equation can be found:  formula_52 can be interpreted as the acoustic pressure and the velocity of the acoustic particle.","3":"what are the second order equations","4":"The second-order equations can be considered as governing equations used to describe the motion of fluid with mass source formula_53 and force source formula_54.","5":"are there any other interesting aspects about this article?","6":"Generally, the acoustic streaming is a steady mean flow, where the response time scale is much smaller than the one of the acoustic vibration.","7":"what is the formula","8":"The time-average term formula_55 is normally used to present the acoustic streaming.","9":"can you show me how to do it with an example","10":"By using formula_56, the time-average second-order equations can be obtained: In determining the acoustic streaming, the first-order equations are most important.","11":"how are the equations used in practice","12":"Since Navier-Stokes equations can only be analytically solved for simple cases, numerical methods are typically used, with the finite element method (FEM) the most common technique."}}
