I can answer your questions about Weighted correlation network analysis.","1":"what is the difference between a weighted and an unweighted network","2":"formula_12 is defined by thresholding the co-expression similarity matrix formula_13 . ' Hard' thresholding (dichotomizing) the similarity measure formula_14 results in an unweighted gene co-expression network.","3":"what about an unweighted network adjacency","4":"Specifically an unweighted network adjacency is defined to be 1 if formula_15 and 0 otherwise.","5":"what are the advantages and the disadvantages","6":"Because hard thresholding encodes gene connections in a binary fashion, it can be sensitive to the choice of the threshold and result in the loss of co-expression information.","7":"what about soft thresholding","8":"The continuous nature of the co-expression information can be preserved by employing soft thresholding, which results in a weighted network.","9":"what does wgcna do with soft thresholding","10":"Specifically, WGCNA uses the following power function assess their connection strength: formula_16, where the power formula_17 is the soft thresholding parameter.","11":"what are the default values","12":"The default values formula_18 and formula_19 are used for unsigned and signed networks, respectively."}}
