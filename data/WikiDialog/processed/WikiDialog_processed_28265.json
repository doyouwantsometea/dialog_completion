I can answer your questions about Tribal Wars.","1":"How long does it take to upgrade buildings in Tribal Wars?","2":"Each building level has a longer base time for completion, though the amount of time a building upgrade actually takes for completion is dependent upon the level of the \"Village Headquarters\" A higher HQ level provides faster building upgrades.","3":"What do higher level buildings do?","4":"Higher levels troop production buildings, such as barracks, stable, and workshop facilitate faster recruitment speeds.","5":"Are there any other interesting aspects about this article?","6":"It is not unusual for some actions to take hours, perhaps even days, to complete.","7":"Why do some actions take so long?","8":"Because the game takes place in real time many of the game's tactics are based on precision timing execution.","9":"What kind of tactics are used?","10":"For example, a common tactic to conquer an opponent's village is known as a \"noble train\" whereby an attacker sends multiple attacks in rapid succession with the first attack containing a full attack force (clearing out any defenses that may be in the village), while the subsequent attacks contain only one nobleman and a light escort, which will be able to land successfully after defenses have been eliminated.","11":"Why are there multiple attacks?","12":"This method is necessary due to the fact that conquering a village requires lowering its loyalty from 100 percent to zero and each successful attacking nobleman lowers a village's loyalty by a randomly generated amount between 20 and 35 percent, while only one nobleman can be effective in a single attack command."}}
