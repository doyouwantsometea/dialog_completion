I can answer your questions about Lucas pseudoprime.","1":"What does it mean that n is a pseudoprime?","2":"It is a good idea to check that \"n\" has no prime factors in common with \"P\" or \"Q\".","3":"Are there any other interesting aspects about this article?","4":"This method of choosing \"D\", \"P\", and \"Q\" was suggested by John Selfridge.","5":"Was there any controversy over his method?","6":"Given \"D\", \"P\", and \"Q\", there are recurrence relations that enable us to quickly compute formula_26 and formula_27 in formula_28 steps; see .","7":"What did people do with this information?","8":"To start off,  First, we can double the subscript from formula_31 to formula_32 in one step using the recurrence relations Next, we can increase the subscript by 1 using the recurrences If formula_37 is odd, replace it with formula_38; this is even so it can now be divided by 2.","9":"Did this method work well?","10":"The numerator of formula_39 is handled in the same way.","11":"Did they find any other methods?","12":"(Adding \"n\" does not change the result modulo \"n\".) Observe that, for each term that we compute in the \"U\" sequence, we compute the corresponding term in the \"V\" sequence."}}
