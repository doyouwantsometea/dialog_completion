I can answer your questions about Geometric tortoise.","1":"What is the geometric tortoise feed?","2":"Some of its more common food plants include \"Crassula ciliata\", \"Oxalis\" species, local geophyte species, such as \"Cyanella hyacinthoides\", \"Babiana angustifolia\" and \"Lachenalia contaminata\"; as well as a variety of grass species such as \"Themeda triandra\", \"Briza maxima\", \"Cynodon dactylon\", \"Ehrharta calycina\", \"Pentaschistis curvifolia\" and \"Eragrostis curvula\".","3":"Are there any other interesting aspects about this article?","4":"A failure to have the full range of these, and other specific local plant species, means that the Geometric tortoise soon dies when taken out of its natural habitat or kept in captivity.","5":"Why do they die?","6":"The specific diet, together with climate, humidity and soil differences, are the principal reasons why the species does not survive for long outside of its habitat.","7":"What is the habitat?","8":"It also means that the Geometric tortoise is restricted to south-western Cape Alluvial Fynbos and Shale Renosterveld vegetation types.","9":"Is there anything else important to know about the habitat and its restrictions?","10":"The geometric tortoise consumes at least 14 plant species as food, which includes 64% of Aspalathus species, 60% of Oxalis species and 66% of Berkheya species occur in West Coast renosterveld.","11":"What else does it consume?","12":"Since the distribution range of geometric tortoise lies within a winter rainfall area, the annual grasses, geophytes and other herbaceous taxa are important food items during winter."}}
