I can answer your questions about Recto and verso.","1":"What is the difference between Recto and Verso?","2":"Lyons (2011) argues that the term \"rectum\" \"right, correct, proper\" for the front side of the leaf derives from the use of papyrus in Late Antiquity, as a different grain ran across each side, and only one side was suitable to be written on, so that usually papyrus would carry writing only on the \"correct\", smooth side (and just in exceptional cases would there be writing on the reverse side of the leaf).","3":"What are some other differences?","4":"The terms \"recto\" and \"verso\" are also used in the codiology of manuscripts written in right-to-left scripts, like Syriac, Arabic and Hebrew.","5":"What is the opposite meaning?","6":"However, as these scripts are written in the other direction to the scripts witnessed in European codices, the recto page is to the left while the verso is to the right.","7":"Is there anything else important?","8":"The reading order of each folio remains first recto, then verso regardless of writing direction.","9":"Are there any other interesting aspects about this article?","10":"The terms are carried over into printing; \"recto-verso\" is the norm for printed books but was an important advantage of the printing press over the much older Asian woodblock printing method, which printed by rubbing from behind the page being printed, and so could only print on one side of a piece of paper.","11":"Is there anything else important?","12":"The distinction between recto and verso can be convenient in the annotation of scholarly books, particularly in bilingual edition translations."}}
