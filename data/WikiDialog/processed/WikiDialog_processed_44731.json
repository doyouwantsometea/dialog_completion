I can answer your questions about Demona.","1":"Can you give me a little more information on the modern world?","2":"Demona does function well enough in the modern world up to a point \u2014 for example, she knew how to hail a cab while in human form and used slang terms on a few occasions.","3":"Is there anything else important about the modern world?","4":"Demona at one point possessed a number of pages torn from the \"Grimorum Arcanorum\", the central and ancient spell book of magic in the \"Gargoyles\" series, of which the majority are presumably still in her possession.","5":"Are there any other interesting aspects about this article?","6":"These removed pages contain spells that can be used as formidable magical weapons that Demona can bring to bear against the Manhattan Clan and humanity in general.","7":"Have they been used in combat at all?","8":"She has thus far invoked three different spells from the Grimorum, two of which were ripped out of the book after the failure of the first.","9":"What was the first spell?","10":"The first such spell was an attempt to turn Goliath into a slave of whoever held the spell which ensnared his mind.","11":"Were there any other spells?","12":"Originally this spell was contained within the book itself, but Brooklyn tore it from its pages in order to keep her from using Goliath any further, Elisa later using the spell to order Goliath to act for the rest of his life as though he wasn't under its influence when they couldn't find a means to break the original spell."}}
