I can answer your questions about Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission.","1":"What telecommunications services did the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission manage?","2":"The commission currently has some jurisdiction over the provision of local landline telephone service in Canada.","3":"What telephone services did they manage?","4":"This is largely limited to the major incumbent carriers, such as Bell Canada and Telus, for traditional landline service (but not Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP)).","5":"What were some of the problems they encountered?","6":"It has begun the gradual deregulation of such services where, in the commission's opinion, a sufficient level of competition exists.","7":"Did they encounter any other problems?","8":"The CRTC is sometimes blamed for the current state of the mobile phone industry in Canada, in which there are only three national mobile network operators \u2013 Bell Mobility, Telus Mobility, and Rogers Wireless \u2013 as well as a handful of MVNOs operating on these networks.","9":"How did they regulate mobile phones?","10":"In fact, the commission has very little to do with the regulation of mobile phone service, outside of \"undue preference\" issues (for example, a carrier offering a superior rate or service to some subscribers and not others without a good reason).","11":"What are some of the other issues related to mobile phones?","12":"It does not regulate service rates, service quality, or other business practices, and commission approval is not necessary for wireless provider sales or mergers as in the broadcasting industry."}}
