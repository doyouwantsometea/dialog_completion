I can answer your questions about Ephippus of Olynthus.","1":"What doesmetallag\u00eas mean in regards to Ephippus of Olynthus?","2":"Athenaeus calls it in some passages \"peri t\u00eas Alexandron kai H\u00eaphaisti\u00f4nos metallag\u00eas\", and in others he has \"taph\u00eas\" or \"teleut\u00eas\" instead of \"metallag\u00eas\", so that at all events we must conclude that it contained an account of the burial of Alexander as well as of his death.","3":"Are there any other interesting aspects about this article?","4":"From the few fragments still extant, it would appear that Ephippus described more the private and personal character of his heroes than their public careers.","5":"Did anyone else write the biography?","6":"It should be remarked that by a singular mistake Suidas in his article \"Ephippus\" gives an account of Ephorus of Cumae.","7":"Did he write any other accounts?","8":"Pliny mentions one Ephippus among the authorities he consulted upon plants, and it is generally believed that he is a different person from our historian; but all the writers whom Pliny mentions along with him, belong to the period of Alexander, so that it is by no means improbable that he may be Ephippus of Olynthus.","9":"What were some of his other writings?","10":"All that is known about Ephippus and the fragments of his work, is collected by R.","11":"What did Geier say about Ephippus?","12":"Geier, in his \"Alexandri Magni Histor."}}
