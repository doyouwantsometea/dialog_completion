I can answer your questions about Limit state design.","1":"What is the difference between an ultimate limit state and an acceptable limit state?","2":"Whereas the ULS is not a physical situation but rather an agreed computational condition that must be fulfilled, among other additional criteria, in order to comply with the engineering demands for strength and stability under design loads.","3":"Are there any other interesting aspects about this article?","4":"The ULS condition is computationally checked at a certain point along the behavior function of the structural scheme, located at the upper part of its elastic zone at approximately 15% lower than the elastic limit.","5":"Do they have any other uses?","6":"That means that the ULS is a purely elastic condition, located on the behavior function far below the real Ultimate point, which is located deep within the plastic zone.","7":"Any other differences?","8":"The rationale for choosing the ULS at the upper part of the elastic zone is that as long as the ULS design criteria are fulfilled, the structure will behave in the same way under repetitive loadings, and as long as it keeps this way, it proves that the level of safety and reliability assumed as the basis for this design is properly maintained and justified, (following the probabilistic safety approach).","9":"What do you find most interesting about the article?","10":"A structure is deemed to satisfy the ultimate limit state criterion if all factored bending, shear and tensile or compressive stresses are below the factored resistances calculated for the section under consideration.","11":"How are they calculated?","12":"The factored stresses referred to are found by applying Magnification Factors to the loads on the section."}}
