I can answer your questions about Skull cup.","1":"What was the historical and contemporary use of the Skull cup?","2":"In 19th century England, the poet Lord Byron used a skull his gardener had found at Newstead Abbey as a drinking vessel. \"There had been found by the gardener, in digging, a skull that had probably belonged to some jolly monk or friar of the Abbey, about the time it was demonasteried.","3":"Why did he use it as a drinking vessel?","4":"Observing it to be of giant size, and in a perfect state of preservation, a strange fancy seized me of having it set and mounted as a drinking cup.","5":"What else did you find interesting about this article?","6":"I accordingly sent it to town, and it returned with a very high polish and of a mottled colour like tortoiseshell\".","7":"Were there any other uses?","8":"Byron even wrote a darkly witty drinking poem as if inscribed upon it, \u201cLines Inscribed upon a Cup Formed from a Skull\u201d.","9":"Is there anything else I should know?","10":"The cup, filled with claret, was passed around \"in imitation of the Goths of old\", among the Order of the Skull that Byron founded at Newstead, \"whilst many a grim joke was cut at its expense\", Byron recalled to Thomas Medwin."}}
