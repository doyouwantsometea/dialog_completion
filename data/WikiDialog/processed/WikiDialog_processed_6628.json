I can answer your questions about Extended irreversible thermodynamics.","1":"What is meant by extended irreversible thermodynamics?","2":"Extended irreversible thermodynamics Extended irreversible thermodynamics is a branch of non-equilibrium thermodynamics that goes beyond the local equilibrium hypothesis of classical irreversible thermodynamics.","3":"What is the difference between extended irreversible thermodynamics and classical irreversible thermodynamics?","4":"The space of state variables is enlarged by including the fluxes of mass, momentum and energy and eventually higher order fluxes.","5":"What are the similarities?","6":"The formalism is well-suited for describing high-frequency processes and small-length scales materials.","7":"Are there any other interesting aspects about this article?","8":"Over the last decades, many efforts have been displayed to generalize the classical laws of Fourier (heat conduction), Fick (matter diffusion), Newton (viscous flows) and Ohm (electrical transport).","9":"Why is it important to generalize them?","10":"Indeed, modern technology strives towards miniaturized devices, high frequency and strongly non-linear processes requiring for a new conceptual approach.","11":"What is the most important aspect of the article?","12":"Several classes of theories have been developed with this objective and one of them, known under the heading of \"Extended Irreversible Thermodynamics\" (EIT) has raised a particular growing interest."}}
