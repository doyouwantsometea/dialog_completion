I can answer your questions about Green woodworking.","1":"What is Green woodworking?","2":"Green woodworking Green woodworking is a form of wood craft or in broad terms, carpentry, that works \"unseasoned\" or \"green\" timber into finished items.","3":"What is unseasonable wood?","4":"Unseasoned wood is wood that has been freshly felled or preserved by storing it in a water-filled trough or pond to maintain its naturally high moisture content.","5":"Why is it better to use unseasonable wood?","6":"Green wood is much softer than seasoned timber and is therefore much easier to shape with hand tools.","7":"Is the end product stronger?","8":"As moisture leaves the unseasoned wood, shrinkage occurs and the green woodworker can use this shrinkage to ensure tight joints in their work.","9":"Is there anything else interesting about green woodworking?","10":"To enhance the effect of the shrinkage, one half of a joint may be forcibly over-dried in a simple kiln while its encapsulating component is left green.","11":"Is this technique used to make the wood last longer?","12":"The components tighten against each other as the parts exchange moisture and approach equilibrium with the surrounding environment."}}
