I can answer your questions about Arthurite.","1":"What is Arthurite?","2":"Arthurite  Arthurite is a mineral composed of divalent copper and iron ions in combination with trivalent arsenate, phosphate and sulfate ions with hydrogen and oxygen.","3":"Where is it found?","4":"Initially discovered by Sir Arthur Russell in 1954 at Hingston Down Consols mine in Calstock, Cornwall, England, arthurite is formed as a resultant mineral in the oxidation region of some copper deposits by the variation of enargite or arsenopyrite.","5":"What is the formula?","6":"The chemical formula of Arthurite is CuFe(AsO,PO,SO)(O,OH)\u20224HO.","7":"Where did the name come from?","8":"Arthurite is named after Arthur W. G. Kingsbury (1906\u20131968), a British mineralogist, and Sir Arthur Russell (1878\u20131964), a collector of minerals.","9":"Are there any other interesting aspects about this article?","10":"Arthurite was determined to be a uniquely new mineral by R.J.
