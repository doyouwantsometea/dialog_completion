I can answer your questions about Magnetofossil.","1":"What is the difference between a Magnetofossil and a Magnetometer?","2":"Researchers can examine these rock samples in a remanent magnetometer where the effects of Earth's current magnetic field is removed, to determine the remanent, or initial, magnetization of the rock sample when it was formed.","3":"What can you tell me about Magnetometers?","4":"In knowing the orientation of the rock in-situ and the remanent magnetization, researchers can determine the Earth's geomagnetic field at the time the rock was formed.","5":"What did you find most interesting about Magnetometers?","6":"This can be used as an indicator of magnetic field direction, or reversals in the Earth's magnetic field, where the Earth's north and south magnetic poles switch (which happen on average every 450,000 years).","7":"Are there any other interesting aspects about this article?","8":"There are many methods for detecting and measuring magnetofossils, although there are some issues with the identification.","9":"What are some of the issues with identification?","10":"Current research is suggesting that the trace elements found in the magnetite crystals formed in magnetotactic bacteria differ from crystals formed by other methods.","11":"Can you tell me more about the research?","12":"It has also been suggested that calcium and strontium incorporation can be used to identify magnetite inferred from magnetotactic bacteria."}}
