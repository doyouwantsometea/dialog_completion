I can answer your questions about Whale feces.","1":"What are the major benefits?","2":"Even today, despite reduction of marine mammal populations and increase in nitrogen uptake from the atmosphere and nitrogen pollution, the local clustering of marine mammals plays a significant role in maintaining the productivity in the regions they frequent.","3":"What else is significant?","4":"The enrichment is not only in primary productivity but also secondary productivity in the form of abundance in fish populations.","5":"What are the main benefits?","6":"The study assumes that whales tend to defecate more commonly in the upper part of the water column, which they frequent for breathing; additionally the feces tend to float.","7":"What else is known?","8":"Whales feed at deeper levels of the ocean where krill is found.","9":"What other benefits are there?","10":"The fecal action of whales thus reverses the usual flow of nutrients of the ocean's \"biological pump\" due to the downward flow of \"marine snow\" and other detritus from surface to bottom.","11":"Is there anything else that is interesting?","12":"The phenomenon has been termed the \"whale pump\"."}}
