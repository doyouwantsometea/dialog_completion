I can answer your questions about Minimum-weight triangulation.","1":"What is the difference between a Delaunay triangulation and a greedy triangulation?","2":"Nevertheless, for randomly distributed point sets, both the Delaunay and greedy triangulations are within a logarithmic factor of the minimum weight.","3":"Are there any other interesting aspects about this article?","4":"The hardness result of Mulzer and Rote also implies the NP-hardness of finding an approximate solution with relative approximation error at most O(1\/n).","5":"Why is it NP-hard?","6":"Thus, a fully polynomial approximation scheme for minimum weight triangulation is unlikely.","7":"What can you tell me about the hardness result?","8":"However, a quasi-polynomial approximation scheme is possible: for any constant \u03b5 > 0, a solution with approximation ratio 1 + \u03b5 can be found in quasi-polynomial time exp(O((log \"n\")).","9":"Is there anything else important?","10":"Because of the difficulty of finding the exact solutions of the minimum-weight triangulation, many authors have studied heuristics that may in some cases find the solution although they cannot be proven to work in all cases.","11":"Why do they study it?","12":"In particular, much of this research has focused on the problem of finding sets of edges that are guaranteed to belong to the minimum-weight triangulation."}}
