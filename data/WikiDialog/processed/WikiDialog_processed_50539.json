I can answer your questions about Pain in crustaceans.","1":"What is the connection between pain and crustaceans?","2":"A 2014 study on crayfish (\"Procambarus clarkii\") tested their responses in a fear paradigm, the elevated plus maze in which animals choose to walk on an elevated cross which offers both aversive and preferable conditions (in this case, two arms were lit and two were dark).","3":"what was the result of the study?","4":"Crayfish which experienced an electric shock displayed enhanced fearfulness or anxiety as demonstrated by their preference for the dark arms more than the light.","5":"Are there any other interesting aspects about this article?","6":"Furthermore, shocked crayfish had relatively higher brain serotonin concentrations coupled with elevated blood glucose, which suggests a stress response.","7":"Was there any other studies done?","8":"A follow-up study using the same species showed the intensity of the anxiety-like behaviour, presumably resulting from the pain, was dependent on the intensity of the electric shock until reaching a plateau.","9":"Did they do any other studies?","10":"Such a quantitative relationship between stress and anxiety is also a very common feature of human and vertebrate anxiety.","11":"Did they have any problems with the studies?","12":"Legislation protects some invertebrates when they are being used in research; the taxa protected varies between countries and regions."}}
