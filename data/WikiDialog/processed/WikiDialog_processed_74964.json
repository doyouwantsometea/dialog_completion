I can answer your questions about Cross-boundary subsidy.","1":"What is meant by cross-boundary subsidy?","2":"Cross-boundary subsidy Cross-boundary subsidies are caused by organisms or materials that cross or traverse habitat patch boundaries, subsidizing the resident populations.","3":"What about the effects of cross-boundary subsidy?","4":"The transferred organisms and materials may provide additional predators, prey, or nutrients to resident species, which can affect community and food web structure.","5":"Are there any other interesting aspects about this article?","6":"Cross-boundary subsidies of materials and organisms occur in landscapes composed of different habitat patch types, and so depend on characteristics of those patches and on the boundaries in between them.","7":"What anthropogenic effects are there?","8":"Human alteration of the landscape, primarily through fragmentation, has the potential to alter important cross-boundary subsidies to increasingly isolated habitat patches.","9":"What is the importance of cross-boundary subsidies?","10":"Understanding how processes that occur outside of habitat patches can affect populations within them may be important to habitat management.","11":"Did the concept of cross-boundary subsidies come about?","12":"The concept of cross-boundary subsidies developed out of a merging of ideas from the studies of landscape ecology and food web ecology."}}
