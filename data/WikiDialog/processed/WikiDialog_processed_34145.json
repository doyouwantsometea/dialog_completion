I can answer your questions about Shock waves in astrophysics.","1":"what are the different applications of shock waves","2":"Shock waves in astrophysics Shock waves are common in astrophysical environments.","3":"what are the different types of shock waves in astrophysics","4":"Because of the low ambient density, most astronomical shocks are collisionless.","5":"what does it mean that they are collisionless","6":"This means that the shocks are not formed by two-body Coulomb collisions, since the mean free path for these collisions is too large, often exceeding the size of the system.","7":"what are the different applications of collisionless shocks","8":"It is widely accepted that the mechanism driving these shocks consists of plasma instabilities, that operate on the scale of plasma skin depth, which is typically much shorter than the mean free path.","9":"what else do we know about collisionless shocks","10":"It is known that collisionless shocks are associated with extremely high energy particles, although it has not been definitively established if the high energy photons observed are emitted by protons, electrons or both.","11":"any other particles","12":"The energetic particles are in general believed to be accelerated by the Fermi acceleration mechanism."}}
