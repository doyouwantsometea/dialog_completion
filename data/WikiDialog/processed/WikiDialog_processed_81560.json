I can answer your questions about TDMoIP.","1":"What is the difference between TDM and MoIP?","2":"VoIP systems that try to be very bandwidth efficient may also add tens of milliseconds of algorithmic delay in the voice codec.","3":"Are there any other interesting aspects about this article?","4":"Historically, bad implementations have added additional, operating-system induced delays, which together with the other delays in practice sometimes approach 100 ms even before taking propagation delays into account.","5":"Is TDMoIP a better protocol?","6":"In contrast, TDMoIP maps TDM octets directly into the payload with no voice compression algorithms and no resultant algorithmic delay.","7":"Is there any other difference in how they operate?","8":"The packetization latency added by TDMoIP depends on the number of cells per packet but is typically in the single millisecond range due to the higher data rate of a complete multiplex as compared to a single VoIP flow.","9":"Do they have any other similarities?","10":"Playout delay considerations do not differ materially between TDMoIP and VoIP, however, so both work best on paths with controlled packet delay variation (strong overprovisioning or \"QoS\").","11":"Is there anything else interesting?","12":"Native TDM networks rely on hierarchical distribution of timing."}}
