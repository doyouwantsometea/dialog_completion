I can answer your questions about Homotopy type theory.","1":"What are the open problems in homotopy type theory?","2":"The participants also formulated a list of important open questions, such as whether the univalence axiom satisfies canonicity (still open, although some special cases have been resolved positively), whether the univalence axiom has nonstandard models (since answered positively by Shulman), and how to define (semi)simplicial types (still open in MLTT, although it can be done in Voevodsky's Homotopy Type System (HTS), a type theory with two equality types).","3":"Are there any other interesting aspects about this article?","4":"Soon after the Oberwolfach workshop, the \"Homotopy Type Theory website and blog\" was established, and the subject began to be popularized under that name.","5":"What did people do after the workshop?","6":"An idea of some of the important progress during this period can be obtained from the blog history.","7":"What are the different univalent foundations?","8":"The phrase \"univalent foundations\" is agreed by all to be closely related to homotopy type theory, but not everyone uses it in the same way.","9":"What are some of the foundations?","10":"It was originally used by Vladimir Voevodsky to refer to his vision of a foundational system for mathematics in which the basic objects are homotopy types, based on a type theory satisfying the univalence axiom, and formalized in a computer proof assistant.","11":"Did he have any problems?","12":"As Voevodsky's work became integrated with the community of other researchers working on homotopy type theory, \"univalent foundations\" was sometimes used interchangeably with \"homotopy type theory\", and other times to refer only to its use as a foundational system (excluding, for example, the study of model-categorical semantics or computational metatheory)."}}
