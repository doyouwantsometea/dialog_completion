I can answer your questions about Ent.","1":"What was the Ent's greatest accomplishment mentioned in the Edith Gilthon story?","2":"At the end of the story after Aragorn is crowned king, he promised Treebeard that the Ents could prosper again and spread to new lands with the threat of Mordor gone, and renew their search for the Entwives.","3":"What is the most important fact mentioned in this story?","4":"However, Treebeard lamented that forests may spread but the Ents would not, and he predicted that the few remaining Ents would remain in Fangorn forest until they slowly dwindled in number or became \"treeish\", saying: \"Sheep get like shepherds, and shepherds get like sheep. [...] But it is quicker and closer, with trees and Ents.\" Although never seen and only briefly mentioned, Entings are young Ents.","5":"Are there any other interesting aspects about this article?","6":"There are almost no descriptions of Entings, but it can be presumed from descriptions of Quickbeam (a young and hasty Ent) and Treebeard's comments about younger Ents as being more \"bendy\" than older ones, that they are much like saplings and perhaps even seedlings at their youngest.","7":"In what way are they similar?","8":"It is not at all made clear if they are born similar to the trees they shepherd, or they become that way, or even how they are born at all.","9":"Is there any other interesting fact about the Edith Gilthon story?","10":"According to Treebeard there are no Entings upon Middle-earth at the time of the Third Age, and there have not been any for quite some time.","11":"Why do they have no eggs?","12":"And there will never be any more Entings afterwards either \"as there are no Entwives\"."}}
