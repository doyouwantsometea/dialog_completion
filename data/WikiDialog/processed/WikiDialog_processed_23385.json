I can answer your questions about Paleolithic.","1":"What was the Paleolithic diet like?","2":"In general, their actual diet in the wild is about 95% plant-based, with the remaining 5% filled with insects, eggs, and baby animals.","3":"Did they hunt anything?","4":"In some ecosystems, however, chimpanzees are predatory, forming parties to hunt monkeys.","5":"Are there any other interesting aspects about this article?","6":"Some comparative studies of human and higher primate digestive tracts do suggest that humans have evolved to obtain greater amounts of calories from sources such as animal foods, allowing them to shrink the size of the gastrointestinal tract relative to body mass and to increase the brain mass instead.","7":"Did they eat a lot of plant life?","8":"Anthropologists have diverse opinions about the proportions of plant and animal foods consumed.","9":"What do you find to be the most interesting fact about their diet?","10":"Just as with still existing hunters and gatherers, there were many varied \"diets\" in different groups, and also varying through this vast amount of time.","11":"Did they eat a little or a lot of meat?","12":"Some paleolithic hunter-gatherers consumed a significant amount of meat and possibly obtained most of their food from hunting, while others are shown as a primarily plant-based diet."}}
