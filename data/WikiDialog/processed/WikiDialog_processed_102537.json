I can answer your questions about Iodine in biology.","1":"What does the chemical iodine do in the body?","2":"Iodine and thyroxine have also been shown to stimulate the spectacular apoptosis of the cells of the larval gills, tail and fins during metamorphosis in amphibians, as well as the transformation of their nervous system from that of the aquatic, herbivorous tadpole into that of the terrestrial, carnivorous adult.","3":"Are there any other interesting aspects about this article?","4":"The frog species \"Xenopus laevis\" has proven to be an ideal model organism for experimental study of the mechanisms of apoptosis and the role of iodine in developmental biology.","5":"What other roles does iodine have in the body?","6":"Moreover, iodine can add to double bonds of docosahexaenoic acid and arachidonic acid of cellular membranes, making them less reactive to free oxygen radicals.","7":"Do people have a deficiency?","8":"The U.S. Institute of Medicine (IOM) updated Estimated Average Requirements (EARs) and Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDAs) for iodine in 2000.","9":"What were the new RDAs?","10":"For people age 14 and up, the iodine RDA is 150 \u03bcg\/day; the RDA for pregnant women is 220 \u03bcg\/day and the RDA during lactation is 290 \u03bcg\/day.","11":"What about for children?","12":"For children 1\u20138 years, the RDA is 90 \u03bcg\/day; for children 8\u201313 years, 130 \u03bcg\/day."}}
