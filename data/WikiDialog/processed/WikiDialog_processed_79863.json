I can answer your questions about Protein misfolding cyclic amplification.","1":"What are the biological activities of amplification?","2":"It has been shown that PMCA is capable of detecting as little as a single molecule of oligomeric infectious PrP. PMCA possesses the ability to generate millions infectious units, starting with the equivalent to one PrP oligomer; well below the infectivity threshold.","3":"Are there any other interesting aspects about this article?","4":"This data demonstrates that PMCA has a similar power of amplification as PCR techniques used to amplify DNA.","5":"What are the differences between the two?","6":"It opens a great promise for development of a highly sensitive detection of PrP, and for understanding the molecular basis of prion replication.","7":"Have there been any successful uses of amplification?","8":"Indeed, PMCA has been used by various groups to PrP in blood of animals experimentally infected with prions during both the symptomatic and pre-symptomatic phases as well as in urine.","9":"What other uses have there been?","10":"The PMCA technology has been used by several groups to understand the molecular mechanism of prion replication, the nature of the infectious agent, the phenomenon of prion strains and species barrier, the effect of cellular components, to detect PrP in tissues and biological fluids and to screen for inhibitors against prion replication.","11":"Is amplification still used today?","12":"Recent studies by the groups of Supattapone and Ma were able to produce prion replication in vitro by PMCA using purified PrP and recombinant PrP with the sole addition of synthetic polyanions and lipids."}}
