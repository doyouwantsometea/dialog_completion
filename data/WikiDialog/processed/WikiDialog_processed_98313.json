I can answer your questions about Cirquent calculus.","1":"What is the difference between Cirquent calculus and other calculus","2":"Cirquent calculus Cirquent calculus is a proof calculus which manipulates graph-style constructs termed \"cirquents\", as opposed to the traditional tree-style objects such as formulas or sequents.","3":"what are the characteristics","4":"Cirquents come in a variety of forms, but they all share one main characteristic feature, making them different from the more traditional objects of syntactic manipulation.","5":"what is the feature","6":"This feature is the ability to explicitly account for possible sharing of subcomponents between different components.","7":"what is an example","8":"For instance, it is possible to write an expression where two subexpressions \"F\" and \"E\", while neither one is a subexpression of the other, still have a common occurrence of a subexpression \"G\" (as opposed to having two different occurrences of \"G\", one in \"F\" and one in \"E\").","9":"what is the history","10":"The approach was introduced by G. Japaridze in as an alternative proof theory capable of \u201ctaming\u201d various nontrivial fragments of his computability logic, which had otherwise resisted all axiomatization attempts within the traditional proof-theoretic frameworks.","11":"what is the etymology","12":"The origin of the term \u201ccirquent\u201d is CIRcuit+seQUENT, as the simplest form of cirquents, while resembling circuits rather than formulas, can be thought of as collections of one-sided sequents (for instance, sequents of a given level of a Gentzen-style proof tree) where some sequents may have shared elements."}}
