I can answer your questions about Renewable energy in Italy.","1":"What happened in 2005 with regards to renewable energy in Italy?","2":"The first Conto Energia resulted in the relatively small amount of 163 MW of new PV power installations, perhaps because solar power was still in its infancy in 2005.","3":"What happened after that?","4":"The second Conto Energia introduced in 2007 resulted in a massive increase of 6,791 MW of new PV power at an annual cost of \u20ac3.27 billion and was the most costly scheme.","5":"What did that do?","6":"Almost half of the total cost of the scheme is accounted for by Conto Energia 2.","7":"What did the third one do?","8":"Conto Energia 3 ran briefly resulting in 1,567 MW of installed power at an annual cost of \u20ac0.65 billion.","9":"What did the fourth one do?","10":"This was succeeded by Conto Energia 4 which resulted in the largest increase in solar capacity so far at 7,600 MW of installed power at the annual cost of \u20ac2.47 billion.","11":"What did that do?","12":"More solar capacity was added under Conto Energia 4 then took place even under Conto Energia 2 and at a lower cost."}}
