I can answer your questions about Protein folding.","1":"What is Levinthal's paradox in regards to protein folding?","2":"Levinthal's paradox is a thought experiment based on the observation that if a protein were folded by sequentially sampling of all possible conformations, it would take an astronomical amount of time to do so, even if the conformations were sampled at a rapid rate (on the nanosecond or picosecond scale).","3":"Are there any other interesting aspects about this article?","4":"Based upon the observation that proteins fold much faster than this, Levinthal then proposed that a random conformational search does not occur, and the protein must, therefore, fold through a series of meta-stable intermediate states.","5":"What do you find most interesting about the article?","6":"The configuration space of a protein during folding can be visualized as energy landscape.","7":"Is there any other interesting fact about the article?","8":"According to Joseph Bryngelson and Peter Wolynes, proteins follow the \"principle of minimal frustration\" meaning that naturally evolved proteins have optimized their folding energy landscapes., and that nature has chosen amino acid sequences so that the folded state of the protein is sufficiently stable.","9":"Did you find any other interesting aspects of the article?","10":"In addition, the acquisition of the folded state had to become a sufficiently fast process.","11":"What do you find most interesting about the article?","12":"Even though nature has reduced the level of \"frustration\" in proteins, some degree of it remains up to now as can be observed in the presence of local minima in the energy landscape of proteins."}}
