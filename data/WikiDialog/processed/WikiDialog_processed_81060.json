I can answer your questions about Visual cortex.","1":"What is the primary function of the visual cortex?","2":"Much work has been carried out on this region, as it appears to integrate local visual motion signals into the global motion of complex objects.","3":"what is the significance of the visual cortex?","4":"For example, \"lesion\" to the V5 leads to deficits in perceiving motion and processing of complex stimuli.","5":"Are there any other interesting aspects about this article?","6":"It contains many neurons selective for the motion of complex visual features (line ends, corners).","7":"What can you tell me about the V5?","8":"\"Microstimulation\" of a neuron located in the V5 affects the perception of motion.","9":"What is the V5's function in the brain?","10":"For example, if one finds a neuron with preference for upward motion in a monkey's V5 and stimulates it with an electrode, then the monkey becomes more likely to report 'upward' motion when presented with stimuli containing 'left' and 'right' as well as 'upward' components.","11":"Is there anything else I should know about the V5?","12":"There is still much controversy over the exact form of the computations carried out in area MT and some research suggests that feature motion is in fact already available at lower levels of the visual system such as V1. MT was shown to be organized in direction columns."}}
