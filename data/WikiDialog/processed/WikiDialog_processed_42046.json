I can answer your questions about WMAD.","1":"What happened with WMAD in 2005?","2":"At 12AM on December 23, 2005, WMAD launched a new contemporary country format under the branding, \"96.3 Star Country,\" beginning with a montage of its liners and jingles followed by Gretchen Wilson's \"All Jacked Up,\" the first of 10,000 songs played without interruption for commercials or DJs on \"Star Country.\" Originally using the tag line \"Now you have a choice,\" Clear Channel took an aggressive approach in promoting \"Star Country\" and in targeting the long-time country station in Madison, WWQM-FM.","3":"Did they succeed?","4":"The aggressiveness included luring away the WWQM-FM morning team of John Flint and Tammy Lee, who would helm \"Star Country's\" morning shift from November 2006 until June 2011, when they departed for San Diego's KSON.","5":"Are there any other interesting aspects about this article?","6":"The following September, WMAD tapped Tracy Dixon and Mike Heller as their new morning team; Dixon came from Clear Channel-owned KMFX-FM in Rochester, Minnesota, Heller from sister sports station WTSO (where he continued as afternoon host).","7":"What did this lead to?","8":"\"Tracy & Mike\" remained paired in mornings until they were replaced by the Premiere Networks-syndicated \"Bobby Bones Show\" in February 2013. WMAD broadcasts a multiplexed HD Radio signal.","9":"What did the multiplexed HD Radio signal do?","10":"The station's HD2 sidechannel originally aired a classic country format (\"Star Country Classics\") to complement the contemporary country music heard on WMAD's main channel. \" Star Country Classics\" was dropped in Fall 2013 in favor of a rotating succession of streams from Clear Channel's IHeartRadio platform; among the channels have been \"Global Citizen Radio\" (variety hits), \"Nashville\" (modern country), and, as of November 2014, \"Coffee Shop Radio\" (acoustic rock)."}}
