I can answer your questions about Calibration curve.","1":"What is the basic principle of a calibration curve?","2":"This yields a model described by the equation \"y = mx + y\", where y is the instrument response, m represents the sensitivity, and y is a constant that describes the background.","3":"What do you find most interesting about the article?","4":"The analyte concentration (x) of unknown samples may be calculated from this equation.","5":"Are there any other interesting aspects about this article?","6":"Many different variables can be used as the analytical signal.","7":"Can you give me an example?","8":"For instance, chromium (III) might be measured using a chemiluminescence method, in an instrument that contains a photomultiplier tube (PMT) as the detector.","9":"What would be the result of that measurement?","10":"The detector converts the light produced by the sample into a voltage, which increases with intensity of light.","11":"Is that the only thing that could be measured?","12":"The amount of light measured is the analytical signal."}}
