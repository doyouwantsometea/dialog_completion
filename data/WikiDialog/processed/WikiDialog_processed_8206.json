I can answer your questions about Hermeneutic circle.","1":"What are the historical and social contexts of the Hermeneutic circle?","2":"Thus the meaning of any sentence cannot be fully interpreted unless we know the historical circumstances of its utterance.","3":"Are there any other interesting aspects about this article?","4":"And this means that interpretation is always linked to the situation of the interpreter, because one can only construct a history from the particular set of circumstances in which one currently exists.","5":"What did others say or do in regards to the hermeneutic circle?","6":"Thus Dilthey says: \"Meaningfulness fundamentally grows out of a relation of part to whole that is grounded in the nature of living experience.\" For Dilthey, \"Meaning is not subjective; it is not projection of thought or thinking onto the object; it is a perception of a real relationship within a nexus prior to the subject-object separation in thought.\" Martin Heidegger (1927) developed the concept of the \"hermeneutic circle\" to envision a whole in terms of a reality that was situated in the detailed experience of everyday existence by an individual (the parts).","7":"Did he say anything else of note about the hermeneutic circle?","8":"So understanding was developed on the basis of \"fore-structures\" of understanding, that allow external phenomena to be interpreted in a preliminary way.","9":"Did he refer to any other works?","10":"Another instance of Heidegger's use of the hermeneutic circle occurs in his examination of \"The Origin of the Work of Art\" (1935\u20131936).","11":"What did he say in that examination?","12":"Here Heidegger argues that both artists and art works can only be understood with reference to each other, and that neither can be understood apart from 'art,' which, as well, cannot be understood apart from the former two."}}
