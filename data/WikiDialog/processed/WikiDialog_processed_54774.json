I can answer your questions about Amaranthus brownii.","1":"What is the host range of Amaranthus brownii?","2":"First recorded on the island in 1977, the increasing population density of gray bird grasshoppers led to massive defoliation on the island, leaving \"A. brownii\" at greater risk of predation.","3":"What is the impact of the host range?","4":"In 2004 alone, an estimated 400,000 gray bird grasshoppers destroyed almost 90% of the vegetation on Nihoa.","5":"Are there any other interesting aspects about this article?","6":"All these threats may have contributed to its ultimate extinction.","7":"Why did it become extinct?","8":"According to zoologist and conservationist Sheila Conant, \"A. brownii\" was important due to its uniqueness in the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands as \"the only Hawaiian endemic in this large genus which contains many economically and nutritionally important species.\" However, in more than a decade of field surveys on Nihoa, no living plants were identified. Wildlife refuge staff visited the island during the dry season at least 21 times between 1983 and 1996.","9":"What other threats did it face?","10":"Originally, botanists thought the absence of the plant in field surveys might have been explained by the time of visits During the summer months, the stems of \"A. brownii\" dried up and could not be distinguished from other herbaceous plants.","11":"Did anyone try to bring it back?","12":"However, a seven-day visit to the island in April 2006 still did not find any specimens."}}
