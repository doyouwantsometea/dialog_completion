I can answer your questions about Metrication.","1":"What was the Holy Roman Empire?","2":"At the outbreak of the French Revolution, much of modern-day Germany and Austria were part of the Holy Roman Empire which had become a loose federation of kingdoms, principalities, free cities, bishoprics and other fiefdoms, each with its own system of measurement, though in most cases such system were loosely derived from the Carolingian system instituted by Charlemagne a thousand years earlier.","3":"What happened in the Napoleonic era?","4":"During the Napoleonic era, there was a move among some of the German states to reform their systems of measurement using the prototype metre and kilogram as the basis of the new units.","5":"What happened when the system was reformed?","6":"Baden, in 1810, for example, redefined the \"Ruthe\" (rods) as being 3.0 m exactly and defined the subunits of the \"Ruthe\" as 1 \"Ruthe\" = 10 \"Fu\u00df\" (feet) = 100 \"Zoll\" (inches) = 1,000 \"Linie\" (lines) = 10,000 \"Punkt\" (points) while the \"Pfund\" was defined as being 500 g, divided into 30 Loth, each of 16.67 g.","7":"Did the reform lead to any other changes?","8":"Bavaria, in its reform of 1811, trimmed the Bavarian \"Pfund\" from 561.288 g to 560 g exactly, consisting of 32 \"Loth\", each of 17.5 g while the Prussian \"Pfund\" remained at 467.711 g.","9":"Were there any other significant changes?","10":"After the Congress of Vienna there was a degree of commercial cooperation between the various German states resulting in the setting of the German Customs Union (\"Zollverein\").","11":"Did the customs union lead to other changes?","12":"There were however still many barriers to trade until Bavaria took the lead in establishing the General German Commercial Code in 1856."}}
