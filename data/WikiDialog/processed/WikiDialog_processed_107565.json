I can answer your questions about Release (Pet Shop Boys album).","1":"What was the track list of the album Release?","2":"The original version of the album had eleven tracks but \"I Didn't Get Where I Am Today\" was removed from the album before release and later became a bonus track on the 2004 single \"Flamboyant\".","3":"What other songs were on the album?","4":"Other tracks recorded during the sessions for the album which ended up as B-sides are \"Between Two Islands\", \"Searching for the Face of Jesus\", \"Sexy Northerner\" and \"Always\".","5":"Were there any other songs?","6":"Another track, \"Time on My Hands\", appeared on the 2003 release, \"Disco 3\".","7":"Did they shoot any music videos?","8":"The directors for all three music videos for the album's singles are photographers by trade: Wolfgang Tillmans directed \"Home and Dry\" , Bruce Weber directed \"I Get Along\" (following his previous work on the \"Being Boring\" and \"Se a vida \u00e9\" videos), and Martin Parr directed \"London\".","9":"Are there any other interesting aspects about this article?","10":"The Tillmans video, consisting almost entirely of footage of mice filmed at Tottenham Court Road tube station in the London Underground, is considered by some to have significantly undermined the commercial potential of the lead single, due to being deemed nearly unplayable by MTV and other music video channels.","11":"Did they go on tour?","12":"Perhaps partly because of the modest commercial success of this album, and perhaps partly because of the habit of distancing themselves musically from their most recent work, Tennant and Lowe have since returned to their dance roots."}}
