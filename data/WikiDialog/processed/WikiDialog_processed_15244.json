I can answer your questions about PHIGS.","1":"What was the most interesting thing about the PHIGS article?","2":"unlike most graphics systems, PHIGS included a scene graph system as a part of the basic standard.","3":"Are there any other interesting aspects about this article?","4":"Models were built up in a Centralized Structure Store (CSS), a database containing a \"world\" including both the drawing \"primitives\" and their \"attributes\" (color, line style, etc.). CSSes could be shared among a number of virtual devices, known under PHIGS as \"workstations\", each of which could contain any number of \"views\".","5":"Is there anything else noteable about the article?","6":"Displaying graphics on the screen in PHIGS was a three-step process; first the model would be built into a CSS, then a workstation would be created and opened, and finally the model would be connected to the workstation.","7":"What would happen after the model was connected to the workstation?","8":"At that point the workstation would immediately render the model, and any future changes made to the model would instantly be reflected in all applicable workstation views.","9":"Is there anything else interesting about this article?","10":"PHIGS originally lacked the capability to render illuminated scenes, and was superseded by \"PHIGS+\".","11":"What did PHIGS+ do?","12":"PHIGS+ works in essentially the same manner, but added methods for lighting and filling surfaces within a 3D scene."}}
