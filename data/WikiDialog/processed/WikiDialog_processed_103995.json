I can answer your questions about Dynamin.","1":"What is known about the dynamin in terms of function?","2":"Dynamin Dynamin is a GTPase responsible for endocytosis in the eukaryotic cell.","3":"Are there any other interesting aspects about this article?","4":"Dynamin is part of the \"dynamin superfamily\", which includes classical dynamins, dynamin-like proteins, Mx proteins, OPA, mitofusins, and GBPs.","5":"What are the roles of these proteins in the cell?","6":"Members of the dynamin family are principally involved in the scission of newly formed vesicles from the membrane of one cellular compartment and their targeting to, and fusion with, another compartment, both at the cell surface (particularly caveolae internalization) as well as at the Golgi apparatus.","7":"Do they have any other roles?","8":"Dynamin family members also play a role in many processes including division of organelles, cytokinesis and microbial pathogen resistance.","9":"What else is known about dynamin?","10":"Dynamin itself is a 96 kDa enzyme, and was first isolated when researchers were attempting to isolate new microtubule-based motors from the bovine brain.","11":"What other structures are known?","12":"Dynamin has been extensively studied in the context of clathrin-coated vesicle budding from the cell membrane."}}
