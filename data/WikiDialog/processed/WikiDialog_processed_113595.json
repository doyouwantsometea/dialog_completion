I can answer your questions about AIDS (computer virus).","1":"What was the damage potential of AIDS II?","2":"Unlike other generic file infectors, AIDS II was the second known virus to employ what could be called a \"corresponding file technique\" of infection so that the original target EXE file is never changed.(The original AIDS was the first.)","3":"What does the corresponding file technique mean?","4":"The virus takes advantage of the DOS feature where if a file exists in both COM and EXE form, the COM file is executed.","5":"How can this technique cause damage?","6":"When an \"infected\" file is executed, since a corresponding COM file exists, the COM file containing the viral code is executed.","7":"What other techniques did AIDS II use?","8":"The virus first locates an uninfected EXE file in the current directory and creates a corresponding (or companion) COM file with the viral code.","9":"Is there anything else interesting?","10":"These COM files will always be 8,064 bytes in length with a file date\/time of the date\/time of infection.","11":"Does the virus rename the file it infects?","12":"After creating the new COM file, the virus then plays a loud chiptune note, and displays the following message: AIDS II then spawns to the EXE file that was attempting to be executed in the first place, and the program runs without problem."}}
