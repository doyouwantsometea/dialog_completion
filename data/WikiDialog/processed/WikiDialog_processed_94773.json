I can answer your questions about Neurotoxicity.","1":"What are the main types of neurotoxic agents?","2":"The presence of neurocognitive deficits alone is not usually considered sufficient evidence of neurotoxicity, as many substances may impair neurocognitive performance without resulting in the death of neurons.","3":"Are there any other interesting aspects about this article?","4":"This may be due to the direct action of the substance, with the impairment and neurocognitive deficits being temporary, and resolving when the substance is eliminated from the body.","5":"What are the different exposures?","6":"In some cases the level or exposure-time may be critical, with some substances only becoming neurotoxic in certain doses or time periods.","7":"What are some examples of the agents?","8":"Some of the most common naturally occurring brain toxins that lead to neurotoxicity as a result of excessive drug use are beta amyloid (A\u03b2), glutamate, dopamine, and oxygen radicals.","9":"Are there any other examples?","10":"When present in high concentrations, they can lead to neurotoxicity and death (apoptosis).","11":"What are some of the symptoms?","12":"Some of the symptoms that result from cell death include loss of motor control, cognitive deterioration and autonomic nervous system dysfunction."}}
