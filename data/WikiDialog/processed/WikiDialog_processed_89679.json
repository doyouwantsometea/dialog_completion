I can answer your questions about Europasaurus.","1":"What was the taxonomy of Europasaurus?","2":"It formed a polytomy with \"Brachiosaurus\" and the \"French \"Bothriospondylus\"\" (named \"Vouivria\") as the basalmost brachiosaurids.","3":"What were some of the similarities?","4":"Next most derived in the clade was \"Lusotitan\", with \"Giraffatitan\", \"Abydosaurus\", \"Cedarosaurus\" and \"Venenosaurus\" forming a more derived clade of brachiosaurids.","5":"Are there any other interesting aspects about this article?","6":"The \"twisted\" teeth of \"Europasaurus\" were found to be one of the unique features of Brachiosauridae, which could mean a confident referral of isolated sauropod teeth to the clade.","7":"Did they have any other features?","8":"A further phylogenetic analysis was performed on Brachiosauridae, based on that of D'Emic (2012).","9":"What did that analysis yield?","10":"This phylogeny, conducted by D'Emic \"et al.\" (2016), resolved a very similar placement of \"Europasaurus\" within Brachiosauridae, although \"Sonorasaurus\" was placed in a clade with \"Giraffatitan\", and \"Lusotitan\" was placed in a polytomy with \"Abydosaurus\" and \"Cedarosaurus\".","11":"What other similarities were there?","12":"The remaining tree was the same as in D'Emic (2012), although \"Brachiosaurus\" was collapsed into a polytomy with more derived brachiosaurids."}}
