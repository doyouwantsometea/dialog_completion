I can answer your questions about Interval tree.","1":"how do you calculate the probability of two events occurring in the same order","2":"This may not necessarily double the total memory requirement, if the intervals are stored by reference rather than by value.","3":"how to use an interval tree in c","4":"The key of each node is the interval itself, hence nodes are ordered first by low value and finally by high value, and the value of each node is the end point of the interval: To search for an interval, one walks the tree, using the key (codice_1) and high value (codice_2) to omit any branches that cannot overlap the query.","5":"example of an n-dimensional array","6":"The simplest case is a point query: where  The code to search for an interval is similar, except for the check in the middle: overlapsWith() is defined as:  Augmented trees can be extended to higher dimensions by cycling through the dimensions at each level of the tree.","7":"what are the different levels of the tree","8":"For example, for two dimensions, the odd levels of the tree might contain ranges for the \"x\"-coordinate, while the even levels contain ranges for the \"y\"-coordinate.","9":"what does a particular range mean in terms of the tree","10":"This approach effectively converts the data structure from an augmented binary tree to an augmented kd-tree, thus significantly complicating the balancing algorithms for insertions and deletions.","11":"is there a better way to do multi-dimensional arrays","12":"A simpler solution is to use nested interval trees."}}
