I can answer your questions about Fomalhaut b.","1":"What do we call Fomalhaut b?","2":"They interpret Fomalhaut b as a \"planet identified from direct imaging\" even though photons emitted from the planet itself are probably not directly detected.","3":"Are there any other interesting aspects about this article?","4":"The revival of the claim that Fomalhaut b is (possibly) a planet after it had been discounted led some to nickname the object a \"zombie planet\", although this is a non-technical term used in press material and does not appear in any peer-reviewed manuscript.","5":"What do you find most interesting about the article?","6":"Assuming that Fomalhaut b's orbit is in the same plane as the debris disk located exterior to it, it orbits Fomalhaut at a distance of approximately .","7":"What is the distance of approximately?","8":"This distance is about closer to the star than the inner edge of the debris disk.","9":"Is there anything else that is notable?","10":"The orbital separation of Fomalhaut b is larger than that for directly imaged planets around \u03b2 Pictoris and HR 8799 (8\u201370 AU). Fomalhaut b appears to be moving at about 4 kilometers per second.","11":"Is there any other information about Fomalhaut b that is important?","12":"It is unclear whether Fomalhaut b's orbit will make it cross the debris disk, cross the debris disk only in projection (i.e. it is not orbiting in the same plane as the disk), or whether its orbit is completely nested within the debris disk."}}
