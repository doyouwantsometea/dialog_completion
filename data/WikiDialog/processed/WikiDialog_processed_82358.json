I can answer your questions about R-hadron.","1":"What does it mean that the R-hadron is undergoinf undergoom at half-life?","2":"All this, together, implies that the decay of the gluino can only go through a virtual particle, a high-mass squark.","3":"Are there any other interesting aspects about this article?","4":"The mean decay time depends on the mass of the intermediate virtual particle, and in this case can be very long.","5":"Why is it virtual?","6":"This gives a unique opportunity to observe a SUSY particle directly, in a particle detector, instead of deducing it by reconstructing its decay chain or by the momentum imbalance (as in the case of the LSP).","7":"What are some other interesting aspects about this article?","8":"In other theories belonging to the SUSY family, the same role can be played by the lightest squark (usually the \"stop\", i.e. the partner of the top quark).","9":"Is there anything else noteable?","10":"In the following, for sake of illustration, the R-hadron will be assumed to originate from a gluino created in a formula_1 collision at LHC, but the observational features are completely general.","11":"What are some of the features?","12":"Since some of the sub-detectors of a typical high-energy experiment are only sensitive to charged particles, one possible signature is the disappearance of the particle (going from charge +1 or -1 to 0) or vice versa its appearance, while keeping the same trajectory (since most of the momentum is carried by the heaviest component, i.e. the supersymmetric particle inside the R-hadron)."}}
