I can answer your questions about Colorado Midland Railway.","1":"What was the difference between the divided and non-divided railway?","2":"The ascent from Colorado Springs to Divide was also severe, with several stretches of 4% grade and significant curvature.","3":"Are there any other interesting aspects about this article?","4":"The portion of the line from Leadville to Hagerman Pass provided the setting for some of the finest railroad imagery ever taken.","5":"What kind of imagery?","6":"Especially noteworthy was the work of W. H. Jackson, particularly the photos circa 1890 showing the rise over five levels and the massive wood trestle leading to the final tier.","7":"What was the most scenic route?","8":"Even after the boring of the Busk-Ivanhoe Tunnel, much of this trackage was above nine thousand feet, in a district of Colorado where the snow often does not melt entirely until June.","9":"Did they have any problems?","10":"The railroad was difficult to operate at the best of times, and in winter it was often nearly impossible: the 1899 blizzard closed the line over Hagerman Pass for 77 days and cost the company more than $73,000 (approx $2 million in 2013).","11":"Why were they divided?","12":"As great a problem as topography was, the route and terminals posed a still greater one."}}
