I can answer your questions about SHMEM.","1":"What is the difference between a supercomputer and a regular computer?","2":"SHMEM SHMEM (from Cray Research\u2019s \u201cshared memory\u201d library) is a family of parallel programming libraries, providing one-sided, RDMA, parallel-processing interfaces for low-latency distributed-memory supercomputers.","3":"What does it mean when it says symmetrical hierarchical memory?","4":"The SHMEM acronym was subsequently reverse engineered to mean \"Symmetric Hierarchical MEMory\u201d.","5":"Is there anything else interesting about this article?","6":"Later it was expanded to distributed memory parallel computer clusters, and is used as parallel programming interface or as low-level interface to build partitioned global address space (PGAS) systems and languages.","7":"What were some of the first applications built using SHMEM?","8":"\u201cLibsma\u201d, the first SHMEM library, was created by Richard Smith at Cray Research in 1993 as a set of thin interfaces to access the CRAY T3D\u2019s inter-processor-communication hardware.","9":"Who else has used SHMEM?","10":"SHMEM has been implemented by Cray Research, SGI, Cray Inc., Quadrics, HP, GSHMEM, IBM, QLogic, Mellanox, Universities of Houston and Florida; there is also open-source OpenSHMEM.","11":"What other foundations did SHMEM lay?","12":"SHMEM laid the foundations for low-latency (sub-microsecond) one-sided communication."}}
