I can answer your questions about Orgasm.","1":"What does the media say about orgasm?","2":"In 2008, they published the first complete 3D sonography of the stimulated clitoris, and republished it in 2009 with new research, demonstrating the ways in which erectile tissue of the clitoris engorges and surrounds the vagina, arguing that women may be able to achieve vaginal orgasm via stimulation of the G-spot because the highly innervated clitoris is pulled closely to the anterior wall of the vagina when the woman is sexually aroused and during vaginal penetration.","3":"Are there any other interesting aspects about this article?","4":"They assert that since the front wall of the vagina is inextricably linked with the internal parts of the clitoris, stimulating the vagina without activating the clitoris may be next to impossible.","5":"Did any studies back this up?","6":"In their 2009 published study, the \"coronal planes during perineal contraction and finger penetration demonstrated a close relationship between the root of the clitoris and the anterior vaginal wall\".","7":"What other articles did you find interesting?","8":"Buisson and Fold\u00e8s suggested \"that the special sensitivity of the lower anterior vaginal wall could be explained by pressure and movement of clitoris's root during a vaginal penetration and subsequent perineal contraction\".","9":"Where there any other studies?","10":"Supporting a distinct G-spot is a study by Rutgers University, published 2011, which was the first to map the female genitals onto the sensory portion of the brain; brain scans showed that the brain registered distinct feelings between stimulating the clitoris, the cervix and the vaginal wall \u2013 where the G-spot is reported to be \u2013 when several women stimulated themselves in a functional magnetic resonance (fMRI) machine. \"I think that the bulk of the evidence shows that the G-spot is not a particular thing,\" stated Barry Komisaruk, head of the research findings. \"It's not like saying, 'What is the thyroid gland?' The G-spot is more of a thing like New York City is a thing."}}
