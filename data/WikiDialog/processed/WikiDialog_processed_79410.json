I can answer your questions about CryoSat.","1":"What happened during the CryoSat mission?","2":"According to Mr. Yuri Bakhvalov, First Deputy Director General of the Khrunichev Space Centre, when the automatic command to switch off the second stage engine did not take effect, the second stage continued to operate until it ran out of fuel and as a consequence the planned separation of the third (Breeze-KM) stage of the rocket which carried the CryoSat satellite did not take place, and would thus have remained attached to the second stage.","3":"Did the mission end successfully?","4":"The upper rocket stages, together with the satellite, probably crashed in the Lincoln Sea.","5":"Are there any other interesting aspects about this article?","6":"Analysis of the error revealed that it was caused by faults in the programming of the rocket, which had not been detected in simulations.","7":"Were there any other missions launched during this time?","8":"After the launch failure of CryoSat, ESA immediately started to plan a replacement CryoSat mission.","9":"What problems were encountered during the mission?","10":"This included securing the industrial team which had built the original, ordering parts which have a long delivery time and establishing a funding scheme within existing budgets.","11":"Did anyone try to take over the mission?","12":"Due to the importance of the scientific goals of this satellite, there was enormous support for this, and the initial phases for CryoSat-2 were approved when ESA's Earth Observation Programme Board agreed to build a copy of the spacecraft on February 23, 2006."}}
