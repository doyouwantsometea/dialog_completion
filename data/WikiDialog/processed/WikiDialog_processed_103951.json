I can answer your questions about Photoemission electron microscopy.","1":"What is the difference between the resolution and the angular resolution of a photoemission electron microscopy?","2":"The latter is dependent on the electron-optical qualities, such as spherical aberrations, and the energy spread of the photoemitted electrons.","3":"Are there any other interesting aspects about this article?","4":"The electrons are emitted into the vacuum with an angular distribution close to a cosine square function.","5":"What do the different resolutions mean?","6":"A significant velocity component parallel to the surface will decrease the lateral resolution.","7":"What can you tell me about the angular resolution?","8":"The faster electrons, leaving the surface exactly along the center line of the PEEM, will also negatively influence the resolution due to the chromatic aberration of the cathode lens.","9":"Is there anything else important?","10":"The resolution is inversely proportional to the accelerating field strength at the surface but proportional to the energy spread of the electrons.","11":"Can you give me the equations?","12":"So resolution r is approximately: In the equation, d is the distance between the specimen and the objective, \u0394E is the distribution width of the initial electron energies and U is the accelerating voltage."}}
