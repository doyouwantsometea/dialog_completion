I can answer your questions about Soviet influence on the peace movement.","1":"What happened in the 1970s?","2":"The Federation of Conservative Students (FCS) alleged Soviet funding of CND. U.S. plans in the late 1970s and early 1980s to deploy Pershing II missiles in Western Europe in response to the Soviet SS-20 missiles were contentious, prompting Paul Nitze, the American negotiator, to suggest a compromise plan for nuclear missiles in Europe in the celebrated \"walk in the woods\" with Soviet negotiator Yuli Kvitsinsky, but the Soviets never responded.","3":"Why didn't they respond?","4":"Kvitsinsky would later write that, despite his efforts, the Soviet side was not interested in compromise, calculating instead that peace movements in the West would force the Americans to capitulate.","5":"Are there any other interesting aspects about this article?","6":"In November 1981, Norway expelled a suspected KGB agent who had offered bribes to Norwegians to get them to write letters to newspapers denouncing the deployment of new NATO missiles.","7":"What happened after that?","8":"In 1985 \"Time\" magazine noted \"the suspicions of some Western scientists that the nuclear winter hypothesis was promoted by Moscow to give antinuclear groups in the U.S. and Europe some fresh ammunition against America's arms buildup.\" Sergei Tretyakov claimed that the data behind the nuclear winter scenario was faked by the KGB and spread in the west as part of a campaign against Pershing II missiles.","9":"Did he have any evidence?","10":"He said that the first peer-reviewed paper in the development of the nuclear winter hypothesis, \"Twilight at Noon\" by Paul Crutzen and John Birks (1982), was published as a result of this KGB influence.","11":"Did anyone dispute that?","12":"Western intelligence agencies have been rather more skeptical of the extent of direct Soviet or Communist influence on non-aligned peace organisations."}}
