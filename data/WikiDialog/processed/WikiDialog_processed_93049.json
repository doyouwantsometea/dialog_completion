I can answer your questions about Scribblenauts.","1":"What were the control issues with Scribblenauts?","2":"Tringali further noted that they did not spend as much time on the stylus controls earlier in development, and would have considered sacrificing another feature, like the Nintendo Wi-Fi, to improve them.","3":"What types of control issues were there?","4":"Reviewers also identified some unexpected behavior from some objects or combinations of them, such as attempting to direct a non-player character in picking up an object, leading to an inconsistency in the difficulty of the various puzzles.","5":"Did most people find the control issues to be minor or major?","6":"Ben Kuchera of Ars Technica, in calling \"Scribblenauts\" \"a frustrating, often maddening game\", described that he often encounters puzzles that, after trying several solutions that should have worked by common sense, he eventually happened upon a less logical solution that worked.","7":"What did you find most interesting about the article?","8":"Walker considered the puzzles range \"between uninspired and simple and frustratingly obscure and fiddly\".","9":"Did the free play mode work well?","10":"Many critics experienced that after getting stumped on a puzzle, they would often resort to playing around in the free play mode. \"Edge\" magazine identified that the free play mode was more enjoyable as it masked the problems with controls, physics, and the general structure of the puzzle game that followed it, and considered what improvements in these modes could be made to create an experience closer to that of \"LittleBigPlanet\".","11":"Are there any other interesting aspects about this article?","12":"In particular for the action levels, reviewers found that they would be less likely to explore alternate solutions and fall into the pattern of using the same set of objects, making these levels repetitive towards the end."}}
