I can answer your questions about Sharston.","1":"Where was Sharston located on the Manchester road network?","2":"(next to the junction of Mullacre Road), but this was demolished in early 1973 when the M56 motorway Sharston bypass was built through the area (where the M56 connects to the nearby southern section of the M60 motorway).","3":"What was the town centre like?","4":"A new shopping precinct was built directly behind the swimming baths on Sharston Green to replace the soon-to-be demolished shops on Altrincham Road.","5":"Did that become a successful venture?","6":"The new precinct, which opened in early 1973 just before the demolition of the old shops, contained over twenty shops and a bank, as well as new premises for the Wythenshawe Labour Club public house (relocated from Greenwood Road) which was opened by former Prime Minister Harold Wilson in February 1973. However, the new Sharston Green shopping precinct suffered from poor trading from the outset and was often referred to in the local press as a \"white elephant\" which had been badly planned in all respects.","7":"What happened then?","8":"By the 1980s, most of the premises were being used for small businesses rather than shops and many premises were empty altogether.","9":"Are there any other interesting aspects about this article?","10":"In November 1990, Manchester City Council closed the swimming baths as part of a series of cost-cutting measures.","11":"What did that lead to?","12":"In May 1991, the vacant and now heavily vandalised building was targeted by arsonists."}}
