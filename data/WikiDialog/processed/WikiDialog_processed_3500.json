I can answer your questions about Cushion plant.","1":"What is the importance of watering a plant?","2":"Besides obtaining water, the plant must also retain moisture to survive in a dry and desiccating environment.","3":"How does the compact growth form help with water intake?","4":"The compact growth form of cushion plants reduces air flow over the surface of the epidermis, reducing the rate of water loss.","5":"What are some other important aspects to watering?","6":"Additionally, many cushion plants have small and fleshy leaves which reduce the surface area of the plant, which reduces transpiration and conserves water.","7":"Are there any other interesting aspects about this article?","8":"In alpine environments well above the tree line, cold is a limiting factor for growth.","9":"How do they adapt to the cold?","10":"So, by having tightly packed stems and foliage, cushion plants are able to convert and trap heat from sunlight, causing them to warm several degrees above the ambient air temperature and extend their short growing season.","11":"What other ways do they adapt?","12":"Many alpine cushion plants also have thick matted hairs that warm up and heat the air trapped in between the hairs when the sun shines."}}
