I can answer your questions about Personal genomics.","1":"What are the main aspects of the legal and social issues of personal genomics?","2":"Genetic non-discrimination laws have been enacted in some US states and at the federal level, by the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA).","3":"Are there any other interesting aspects about this article?","4":"The GINA legislation prevents discrimination by health insurers and employers, but does not apply to life insurance or long-term care insurance.","5":"What happened in regards to this in the 2000's?","6":"The passage of the Affordable Care Act in 2010 strengthened the GINA protections by prohibiting health insurance companies from denying coverage because of patient's \"pre-existing conditions\" and removing insurance issuers ability to adjust premium costs based on certain factors such as genetic diseases.","7":"What were the social issues?","8":"Given the ethical concerns about pre-symptomatic genetic testing of minors, it is likely that personal genomics will first be applied to adults who can provide consent to undergo such testing, although genome sequencing is already proving valuable for children if any symptoms are present.","9":"Did anything else happen with regards to this?","10":"There are also concerns regarding human genome research in developing countries.","11":"What were some of the concerns?","12":"The tools for conducting whole genome analyses are generally found in high-income nations, necessitating partnerships between developed and developing countries in order to study the patients afflicted with certain diseases."}}
