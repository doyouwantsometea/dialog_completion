I can answer your questions about Rocket engine.","1":"What is the exhaust speed of a rocket engine?","2":"Exhaust speeds vary, depending on the expansion ratio the nozzle is designed for, but exhaust speeds as high as ten times the speed of sound in air at sea level are not uncommon.","3":"where does the thrust come from","4":"About half of the rocket engine's thrust comes from the unbalanced pressures inside the combustion chamber, and the rest comes from the pressures acting against the inside of the nozzle (see diagram).","5":"what is the force of the engine","6":"As the gas expands (adiabatically) the pressure against the nozzle's walls forces the rocket engine in one direction while accelerating the gas in the other.","7":"what is the most commonly used nozzle","8":"The most commonly used nozzle is the de Laval nozzle, a fixed geometry nozzle with a high expansion-ratio.","9":"what gives the nozzle its shape","10":"The large bell- or cone-shaped nozzle extension beyond the throat gives the rocket engine its characteristic shape.","11":"what is the exit pressure","12":"The exit static pressure of the exhaust jet depends on the chamber pressure and the ratio of exit to throat area of the nozzle."}}
