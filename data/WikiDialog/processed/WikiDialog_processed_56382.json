I can answer your questions about Magnetotactic bacteria.","1":"Where are the magnetosomes located in the bacterial cell?","2":"However, dispersed aggregates or clusters of magnetosomes occur in some MTB, usually at one side of the cell, which often corresponds to the site of flagellar insertion.","3":"What other structures are found in the cell?","4":"Besides magnetosomes, large inclusion bodies containing elemental sulfur, polyphosphate, or poly-\u03b2-hydroxybutyrate are common in MTB.","5":"Are there any other interesting aspects about this article?","6":"The most abundant type of MTB occurring in environmental samples, especially sediments, are coccoid cells possessing two flagellar bundles on a somewhat flattened side.","7":"What do the two flagellar bundles look like?","8":"This \"bilophotrichous\" type of flagellation gave rise to the tentative genus \"\"Bilophococcus\"\" for these bacteria.","9":"What other structures are found in the cell?","10":"In contrast, two of the morphologically more conspicuous MTB, regularly observed in natural samples, but never isolated in pure culture, are the MMP and a large rod containing copious amounts of hook-shaped magnetosomes (\"Magnetobacterium bavaricum\").","11":"What are the crystalline structures?","12":"The physical development of a magnetic crystal is governed by two factors: one is moving to align the magnetic force of the molecules in conjunction with the developing crystal, while the other reduces the magnetic force of the crystal, allowing an attachment of the molecule while experiencing an opposite magnetic force."}}
