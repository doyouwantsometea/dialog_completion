I can answer your questions about Chromosome conformation capture.","1":"What are the different modes of regulation by which chromosomes can be classified?","2":"As a result, they proposed that motif pairing multiplicity (number of motifs that are paired with a given motif) is linked to interaction distance and regulatory region type.","3":"Are there any other interesting aspects about this article?","4":"In the next year, Wong published another article reporting 18,879 motif pairs in 6 human cell lines.","5":"What are the different types of motifs that were discovered?","6":"A novel contribution of this work is MotifHyades, a motif discovery tool that can be directly applied to paired sequences.","7":"What did the classified chromosomes do?","8":"The 3C-based techniques can provide insights into the chromosomal rearrangements in the cancer genomes.","9":"Did this help in the diagnosis of cancer?","10":"Moreover, they can show changes of spatial proximity for regulatory elements and their target genes, which bring deeper understanding of the structural and functional basis of the genome."}}
