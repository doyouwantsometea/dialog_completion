I can answer your questions about Stuttering.","1":"What is meant by follow-up care?","2":"\"Follow-up\" or \"maintenance\" sessions are often necessary after completion of formal intervention to prevent relapse.","3":"What is fluency shaping?","4":"Fluency shaping therapy, also known as \"speak more fluently\", \"prolonged speech\", or \"connected speech\", trains people who stutter to speak less disfluently by controlling their breathing, phonation, and articulation (lips, jaw, and tongue).","5":"What is the theory behind it?","6":"It is based on operant conditioning techniques.","7":"What are some of the techniques used in the therapy?","8":"People who stutter are trained to reduce their speaking rate by stretching vowels and consonants, and using other disfluency-reducing techniques such as continuous airflow and soft speech contacts.","9":"What is the goal of the therapy?","10":"The result is very slow, monotonic, but fluent speech, used only in the speech clinic.","11":"Does the person eventually learn to speak normally?","12":"After the person who stutters masters these skills, the speaking rate and intonation are increased gradually."}}
