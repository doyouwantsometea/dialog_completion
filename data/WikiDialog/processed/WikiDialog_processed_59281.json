I can answer your questions about Cellulose insulation.","1":"how much do you save by installing cellulose insulation in an existing wall","2":"Annual savings from insulating vary widely and depend on several factors, including insulation thickness, original wall performance, local climate, heating \/cooling use, airtightness of other building elements and so on.","3":"what do people usually save","4":"One installer claims cellulose insulation \"can save homeowners 20 to 50 percent on their utility bills\".","5":"does the insulation reduce sound","6":"Insulation reduces sound travelling through walls and between floor levels.","7":"what else does the insulation do","8":"Cellulose provides mass and damping.","9":"what does the dampening do","10":"This reduces noise in 2 ways, it reduces the lateral movement of sheetrock and attenuates the passage of sound along cavities.","11":"how does the density compare to other insulations","12":"Cellulose is approximately three times denser than fiberglass, providing a slight improvement in sound reduction."}}
