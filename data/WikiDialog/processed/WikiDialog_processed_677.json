I can answer your questions about Deportation of Afghan refugees from the United States.","1":"When do Afghans become citizens?","2":"Such people statutorily qualify as \"nationals of the United States\" after continuously residing in the United States for at least 10 years without committing (in such 10 years) any offense that triggers removability.","3":"Is there any other interesting information?","4":"This appears to be the reason why the permanent resident card (green card) is valid for 10 years.","5":"What happen in the 1970s?","6":"It was expected that all Afghan-Americans would obtain U.S. citizenship within 10 years from the date of their first lawful entry, but if that was unachievable then they would statutorily become \"nationals but not citizens of the United States\" after the successful elapse of such 10 years.","7":"What happen in 1978?","8":"Anything to the contrary will lead to \"deprivation of rights under color of law,\" which is a federal crime that entails capital punishment for the perpetrator(s).","9":"What happen in 1983?","10":"The Afghan-Americans in removal proceedings have already \"been lawfully accorded the privilege of residing permanently in the United States\" by the Attorney General, but decades later the incompetent immigration officials unconstitutionally turned these \"firmly resettled\" Americans into refugees again.","11":"What happen in 1994?","12":"Unlike other aliens in removal proceedings, these refugees have no safe country and they obviously owe permanent allegiance solely to the United States."}}
