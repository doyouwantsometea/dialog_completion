I can answer your questions about SR protein.","1":"what are the different steps in the pathway of SR protein?","2":"Elevated levels of SF2\/ASF, SC35, and SRp20 have all been associated with breast and ovarian cancer development.","3":"are there any other interesting aspects about this article?","4":"SF2\/ASF is also upregulated in lung, kidney, and liver tumors.","5":"what are the different types of sar protein?","6":"SFRS1, the gene that codes for SF2\/ASF, is a known proto-oncogene.","7":"what are the different applications of sar protein?","8":"Mutations in the ESE sequence of BRCA1 have been linked to irregular exon skipping because SF2\/ASF cannot recognize the ESE. Three SR proteins have been implicated in HIV-1, SRp75, SF2\/ASF, and SRp40.","9":"what is the function of these proteins?","10":"All three SR proteins are important for alternatively splicing the viral pre-mRNA.","11":"how are they related to HIV?","12":"HIV can also change the concentrations of specific SR proteins in the cell."}}
