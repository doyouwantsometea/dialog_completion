I can answer your questions about Fracture mechanics.","1":"In terms of pure flexural rigidity, Mode-I bending is the most common type of bending.","2":"However, this is clearly an idealization; in real-world systems, mixed-mode loading (some combination of Mode-I, Mode-II, and Mode-III loading) is applied.","3":"What are some other modes of bending?","4":"In mixed-mode loading, cracks will generally not advance straight ahead.","5":"What happens if the cracks are not straight?","6":"Several theories have been proposed to explain crack kinking and crack propagation in mixed-mode loading, and two are highlighted below.","7":"Can you explain the two theories?","8":"Consider a crack of length formula_43 housed in an infinite planar body subjected to mixed Mode-I and Mode-II loadings via uniform tension formula_14, where formula_45 is the angle between the original crack plane and the direction of applied tension and formula_46 is the angle between the original crack plane and the direction of kinking crack growth.","9":"Are there any other interesting aspects about this article?","10":"Sih, Paris, and Erdogan showed that the stress intensity factors far from the crack tips in this planar loading geometry are simply formula_47 and formula_48.","11":"What do the stress intensity factors do?","12":"Additionally, Erdogan and Sih postulated the following for this system: This postulation implies that the crack begins to extend from its tip in the direction formula_52 along which the hoop stress formula_53 is maximum."}}
