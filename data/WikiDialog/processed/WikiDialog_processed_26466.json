I can answer your questions about Epidural administration.","1":"What are the differences between Epidural analgesia and Epidural air?","2":"However, whilst evidence was accumulating that saline is preferable to air, as it was thought to be associated with a better quality of analgesia and lower incidence of post-dural-puncture headache, A systematic review in 2014 showed no difference in terms of ability to identify the epidural space or safety.","3":"What are some other differences?","4":"In addition to the loss of resistance technique, realtime observation of the advancing needle is becoming more common.","5":"What does this mean for the patient?","6":"This may be done using a portable ultrasound scanner, or with fluoroscopy (moving X-ray pictures).","7":"Are there any other interesting aspects about this article?","8":"After placement of the tip of the needle into the epidural space, a catheter is often threaded through the needle.","9":"Is the procedure successful?","10":"The needle is then withdrawn over the catheter.","11":"Is there anything else that is important to know?","12":"Generally the catheter is inserted 4\u20136 cm into the epidural space."}}
