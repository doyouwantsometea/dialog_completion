I can answer your questions about Battle of Brenta.","1":"What was the cause of the Battle of Brenta?","2":"Liutprand mentions that the horses of the Hungarians were very tired, but they had the strength to cross the river before the Italians arrived, so Brenta separated the two armies from each other.","3":"What happened during the battle?","4":"The heavily armored Italians could not pass the river so easily, so they remained on the other side, and both armies assembled their battle lines on the both sides of the river.","5":"Did they win the battle?","6":"Then the Hungarians again sent envoys to the Italian side, this time with even more alluring propositions for the Italians; in return for their safe return home, they promised to give them everything: prisoners, equipment, weapons, horses, keeping only one for each of them for their homecoming.","7":"Did they accept?","8":"To show how serious they are about this proposal, they promised that they will never return to Italy, and as guarantees for this, they will send their own sons to the Italians.","9":"Did the Hungarians ever return to Italy?","10":"With these exaggerate but still unacceptable promises (knowing that Berengar will not accept their departure after the destruction they caused, and would want to take them all prisoners), the Hungarians managed to totally convince the king that their fate depends only from his goodwill.","11":"What happened after they left?","12":"So the Italians responded harshly, threatening them, probably wanting their total surrender."}}
