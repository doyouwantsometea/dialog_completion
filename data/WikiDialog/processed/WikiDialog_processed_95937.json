I can answer your questions about Motor pool (neuroscience).","1":"What is the function of the motor pool?","2":"Primarily, this system frees higher centers of the CNS from having to signal specific contraction patterns for distinct levels of muscle contraction.","3":"What are some examples of the modulation of the motor pool?","4":"The level of synaptic input that higher centers provide to a given motor pool must determine the contraction strength, and this simplifies the process of contraction strength modulation.","5":"What are the advantages of the motor pool?","6":"This system allows for a very precise and consistent modulation of contraction strength from just increased or decreased levels of synaptic input: with additional motor units of increasing size, there will be a consistent and precise effect on the force of contraction.","7":"What are the other advantages?","8":"Another key benefit derived from the size principle is that smaller neurons will be fired more regularly and for a longer duration of time compared to larger neurons.","9":"Is there a size limit?","10":"These smaller motor units are more resistant to fatigue, and as such, are better suited to this role.","11":"Are there any other interesting aspects of this article?","12":"There are several layers of differentiation and specialization to consider in the complicated development of motor pools."}}
