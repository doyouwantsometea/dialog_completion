I can answer your questions about Zhi (excrescences).","1":"What are the main types of Zhi?","2":"Kristofer Schipper says that for Ge Hong, \"zhi\" mushrooms had \"immortalizing properties\" because they are produced from the sublimation of \"waidan\" alchemical minerals lying under the ground, notably gold and the divine cinnabar (cf. \" Mingjian yaojing\" below).","3":"Are there any other interesting aspects about this article?","4":"Mushrooms are, so to speak \"natural alchemical products, comparable to the great elixir, the quintessence derived from the transmutation of these very minerals\" (1993: 174).","5":"What are the different types of Zhi?","6":"Two of Ge Hong's descriptions are found in the \"Jiuzhuan huandan jing yaojue\" below.","7":"What early sources of Zhi are there?","8":"The 3rd or 4th century \"Taishang lingbao wufu xu\" (\u592a\u4e0a\u9748\u5bf3\u4e94\u7b26\u5e8f, The Array of the Five Numinous Treasure Talismans) is sometimes cited as another early source that mentions \"zhi\" numinous mushrooms\u2014a misunderstanding that is owing to the usage of \"wuzhi\" (\u4e94\u829d) to mean \"five plants\" rather than \"five excrescences\".","9":"What were the secondary sources of Zhi?","10":"The text has a section titled \"Fushi wuzhi zhj jing\" (\u670d\u98df\u4e94\u829d\u4e4b\u7cbe, Ingesting the Essences of the Five Plants), meaning \"plants\" since they are pine-resin (\"weixi\" \u5a01\u50d6), sesame (\"huma\" \u80e1\u9ebb), fagara (\"jiao\" \u6912), ginger (\"jiang\" \u8591), and calamus (\"changpu\" \u83d6\u84b2), Steavu translates Five Plants and notes this as one of the unambiguous and relatively rare occasions when the term \"zhi\" should be taken more generically as \"plant\" rather than \"(numinous) mushroom\" (2018: 363)."}}
