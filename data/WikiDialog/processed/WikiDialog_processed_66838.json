I can answer your questions about Colloid thruster.","1":"What is the difference between a colloid thruster and a squirter?","2":"Colloid thruster A colloid thruster (or \"electrospray thruster\") is a type of low thrust electric propulsion rocket engine that uses electrostatic acceleration of charged liquid droplets for propulsion.","3":"What are the main similarities?","4":"In a colloid thruster, charged liquid droplets are produced by an electrospray process and then accelerated by a static electric field.","5":"What kind of liquids are used in the thruster?","6":"The liquid used for this application tends to be a low-volatility ionic liquid.","7":"Are there any other interesting aspects about this article?","8":"Like other ion thrusters, its benefits include high efficiency, thrust density, and specific impulse; however it has very low total thrust, on the order of micronewtons.","9":"What would be the uses of the thruster?","10":"It provides very fine attitude control or efficient acceleration of small spacecraft over long periods of time.","11":"Have the thrusters been used in space?","12":"Eight electrospray thrusters were first used in space on the NASA ST-7 ESA LISA Pathfinder mission, to demonstrate disturbance reduction."}}
