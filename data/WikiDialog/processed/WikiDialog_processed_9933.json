I can answer your questions about Urmuz.","1":"What is Little metaphysics and astronomy by Urmuz?","2":"\"A Little Metaphysics and Astronomy\", which is structured like a treatise, opens with a pun on the creation narrative, postulating that God created fingerspelling before \"the Word\", and venturing to suggest that \"the heavenly bodies\", like abandoned children, are in fact nobody's creation, that their spin is really a form of attention seeking.","3":"What does it mean?","4":"Here, Urmuz questions the possibility of a single cause in the universe, since God's interest is in unnecessary duplications or multitudes in stars, men and fish species.","5":"Are there any other interesting aspects about this article?","6":"Beyond the jokes on scientific pretense, Vasilache reads \"A Little Metaphysics...\" as a clue to Urmuz's own disillusioned worldview, which she traces back to the suicidal warnings in Urmuz's notebooks.","7":"Was he close to suicide?","8":"She argues that such a melancholy and lonely diarist is in contrast with Urmuz's literary persona, as known from the \"Bizarre Pages\".","9":"What other interesting things happen with the little metaphysics?","10":"Likewise, Carmen Blaga describes the text as a sober meditation on \"the tragic sense of history\" and \"the fall into temporality\".","11":"Did he write any other texts?","12":"Among the last Urmuzian works to be discovered is \"Cotadi and Dragomir\"."}}
