I can answer your questions about Peristichia.","1":"What is known about Peristichia?","2":"Peristichia  Peristichia is a genus of sea snails, marine gastropod mollusks in the family Pyramidellidae, the pyrams and their allies.","3":"Are there any other interesting aspects about this article?","4":"In his original paper, Dall proposed \"Peristichia\" as a genus of dubious affinities and placed it later in the family Pyramidellidae.","5":"What was the outcome of this?","6":"Paul Bartsch, his collaborator, later thought it was a subgenus of \"Turbonilla\".","7":"What was the best outcome?","8":"Johannes Thiele does not even mention this genus in his \"Handbuch der Systematischen Weichtierkunde\". (1929).","9":"What happened after that?","10":"Wilhelm August Wenz in his \"Handbuch der Pal\u00e4ozoologie, Band 6, Gastropoda\", also thought it was probably a subgenus of \"Turbonilla\", but added a question mark.","11":"What was the question mark?","12":"However, a close examination shows that it belongs in the family Pyramidellidae, close to \"Tryptichus\" M\u00f6rch, 1875, differing from it only in having one (instead of two) basal entral spiral cords and having no columellar fold."}}
