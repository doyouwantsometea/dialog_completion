I can answer your questions about Synchronization gear.","1":"What is the difference between a machine gun and a synchronization gear?","2":"A machine gun normally fires a constant number of rounds a minute, and while this may be boosted by, for instance, strengthening and increasing the tension on a return spring, or redirecting the gasses produced by each firing, it cannot be varied at will while the gun is operating.","3":"What can you tell me about the synchronization gear?","4":"On the other hand, the propeller of an aircraft, especially before the advent of the constant-speed propeller, turned at widely differing rates of revolution per minute, depending on the throttle setting, and whether the aircraft was climbing, flying level, or diving.","5":"Is there anything else that is important?","6":"Even if it had been feasible to pick a particular point on an aircraft engine's tachometer at which a machine gun's cyclic rate would permit it to fire through the propeller, this would be very limiting.","7":"Are there any other interesting aspects about this article?","8":"In practice it was found that it was necessary for the gun to be fired in semi-automatic mode.","9":"What does that mean?","10":"As the propeller revolved, a series of \"firing impulses\" was transmitted to the gun, effectively \"pulling the trigger\", to fire a single shot.","11":"Was there any controversy?","12":"The majority of these impulses would catch the gun in the course of its firing cycle, that is, when it was \"busy\" ejecting a spent round or loading a fresh one, and would be \"wasted\"; but eventually the firing cycle was completed, and the gun was ready to fire."}}
