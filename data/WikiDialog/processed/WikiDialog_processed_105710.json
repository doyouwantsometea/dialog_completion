I can answer your questions about Martial eagle.","1":"What is the Martial eagle's habitat?","2":"The Verreaux's eagle nests in and hunts around rocky, mountainous kopje to be in close proximity to the much favored prey, rock hyraxes, which they mainly use contour-hunting (hugging the uneven ground to surprise the prey) to capture.","3":"What other animals live in the habitat?","4":"The crowned eagle dwells mainly in mature forests, building nests in large interior trees, and is primarily a perch-hunter, watching and listening for monkeys and other prey over a long period.","5":"Do the animals compete for resources?","6":"While all three are known to locally favor rock hyraxes, the nesting habitat differences where they overlap are sufficient to allow these birds not to effect one another.","7":"What is the prey species?","8":"The average prey mass of Verreaux's eagle was similar to that martial eagles, with a pair of studies showing it ranges from .","9":"Do other birds eat the prey?","10":"The mean prey mass of crowned eagles in southern Africa also appears to be similar to that of martial eagles but in west Africa (i.e.","11":"Where in West Africa?","12":"Ivory Coast) it was considerably heavier at (which may well be the highest mean prey mass for any of the world's raptors)."}}
