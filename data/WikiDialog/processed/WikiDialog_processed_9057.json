I can answer your questions about Entolimod.","1":"What is the basic overview of Entolimod?","2":"Entolimod  Entolimod (CBLB502) is being developed by Cleveland Biolabs, Inc. for dual indications under the U.S. Food & Drug Administration\u2019s (FDA) Animal Efficacy Rule as a pivotal-stage radiation countermeasure, and under the FDA\u2019s traditional drug approval pathway as a cancer treatment.","3":"Are there any other interesting aspects about this article?","4":"Entolimod is a recombinant protein that acts as an agonist of toll-like receptor 5 (TLR5), an innate immunity receptor.","5":"What does it do to the body once it's released?","6":"Entolimod activation of TLR5 triggers NF-\u03baB signaling, mobilizing an innate immune response that drives expression of numerous genes, including inhibitors of apoptosis, scavengers of reactive oxygen species, and a spectrum of protective or regenerative cytokines.","7":"Is there anything else that's interesting about the article?","8":"The FDA established the Animal Efficacy Rule in 2002 to permit the approval of certain drugs and biologics that are intended to reduce or prevent serious or life-threatening conditions based on evidence of safety from trial in healthy subjects and effectiveness from appropriate animal studies when human efficacy studies are not ethical or feasible.","9":"Why do they use this rule?","10":"Efficacy of entolimod as a radiation countermeasure has been assessed in animal models.","11":"Does it work well?","12":"These studies demonstrate that a single administration of entolimod given either before or after lethal total body irradiation leads to significant improvement in animal survival."}}
