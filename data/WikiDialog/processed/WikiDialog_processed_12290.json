I can answer your questions about Christian vegetarianism.","1":"What is another argument against Christian vegetarianism?","2":"Others interpret the permission given to Noah and his family in Genesis 9:3\u20134, not as a free pass to kill animals for food because \"no matter what you do you can never remove all the blood from the flesh of a slaughtered animal\", but as an invitation to scavenge for and eat dead animals if any are found.","3":"Are there any other interesting aspects about this article?","4":"These approaches are put under pressure, however, with the sheer number of passages which appear to presuppose the legitimacy of eating animals, and the normalcy with which meat eating is treated.","5":"What other pressures are there?","6":"Another approach to these texts is to suggest that God reluctantly permitted the eating of animals due to human sinfulness.","7":"What would that mean?","8":"In other words, God permitted humans to eat non-human animals as a concession to the Fallen state of humanity.","9":"Did God have any other interaction with animals?","10":"Richard Young raises the possibility that both the introduction of animals into the human diet, and the use of animals in religious sacrifices, were concessions to a Fallen humanity that were used to deal with humanity where it was at.","11":"Is there any other interesting information you can share?","12":"This approach allows the Christian vegetarian or vegan to take the entire Biblical witness seriously, while also holding that God's preference is for a peace and shalom throughout creation."}}
