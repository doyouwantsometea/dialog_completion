I can answer your questions about Land reform in Romania.","1":"What are the effects of the land reform in Romania?","2":"Completed in spring 1948, the reform did not significantly alter the structure of agriculture: holdings remained as fragmented as before, production of non-grain crops and animals declined, the co-operative movement was neglected, and the amount of land received by families was so small that their economic and social status hardly changed.","3":"What are some other interesting aspects about this article?","4":"In any event, the peasants did not long enjoy their new properties, as collectivisation was launched in 1949.","5":"What other reforms were carried out?","6":"The February 1991 land reform, which followed the Romanian Revolution of 1989, sought to privatise land resources that were in state hands during the Communist period.","7":"Were there any other reforms?","8":"The goal was to restitute land in state cooperatives to its pre-collectivisation owners, with families that did not own land at the time also receiving small allotments.","9":"What happened in the 1990s?","10":"Amidst an anti-Communist public mood of 1990-91, the restored interwar parties (PNL and PN\u0162CD) loudly called for restitution; initially, the governing ex-Communist National Salvation Front resisted the demand and sought to grant all rural residents 0.5 ha, but in a bid to capture the rural vote, it gave in to pressure to dismantle the collectives, although capping the size of restored properties to 10 ha.","11":"What else did they do?","12":"(The Front claimed this would promote social equity, with others claiming a political motivation: the recreation of a viable, propertied middle class in agriculture, one that could exert certain kinds of pressure on the state, was precluded.)"}}
