I can answer your questions about Negima!?.","1":"Are there any other interesting aspects about this article on Negima!??","2":"In fact, Yu Kobayashi's artwork of Setsuna as shown in the sixth episode is so crude that in the following episode, a badly-drawn Setsuna (done by Kobayashi) is seen talking to Konoka probably as a depiction of shame after Setsuna vows to Asuna to not wear a Chupacabra T-shirt and not let Konoka don one, which Konoka did. There are also two broadcast versions of the show: a pan and scan, 4:3 standard-definition version shown on TV Tokyo and a widescreen high-definition one shown on sister channel BS Japan.","3":"Why was there two versions?","4":"Even in the 4:3 version however, there are scenes meant to be shown in 16:9.","5":"What are some of the scenes?","6":"This is addressed by having the scenes letterboxed, surrounded by gold decorated mattes at the top and bottom of the screen rather than the usual plain black ones.","7":"Are the gold bars different from the black bars?","8":"Of course, these \"gold bars\" do not appear in the widescreen version, which is used in the DVD releases of the episodes (with some minor modifications).","9":"What other things do you find interesting about this article?","10":"As a remake, characters appearing from the original \"Mahou Sensei Negima\" appear in this retelling.","11":"Do they look the same?","12":"However, under Studio Shaft, the characters have taken a redesign."}}
