I can answer your questions about Hebephilia.","1":"What are the diagnostic criteria for Hebephilia?","2":"The paper concluded that the DSM-5 could better account for those data if it split the DSM-IV-TR's existing criteria for pedophilia, which focuses on sexual attraction to prepubescent children, but sets the age range at generally 13 or younger.","3":"How is the symptom measured?","4":"Blanchard suggested the criteria be split into \"pedophilia\" as sexually attracted to prepubescent children who are generally younger than 11, and \"hebephilia\" as sexual attraction to pubescent children, generally 11\u201314 years old.","5":"Are there any other interesting aspects about this article?","6":"What DSM-IV calls \"pedophilia\" would instead be termed \"pedohebephilia\", with pedophilic and hebephilic sub-types.","7":"What are the criteria for the sub types?","8":"The proposed criteria for the DSM-5 involved an adult who, for six or more months, experienced sexual attraction to prepubescent or pubescent children that was equal to or greater than their attraction to adults, and who also either found the attraction distressing, used child pornography or had sought sexual stimulation from a child, on at least three occasions in the case of the hebephilic type.","9":"What do you find most interesting about this article?","10":"The proposed criteria would have been applied to subjects aged 18 or older and who are at least five years older than children to whom they are typically attracted.","11":"Is there any other sub types?","12":"The sexual and gender identity working group justified inclusion of the use of child pornography due to the expectation that pedohebephilic individuals would deny their sexual preferences, leaving it up to the diagnosing clinician to make inferences whether their patients are more interested in children than adults."}}
