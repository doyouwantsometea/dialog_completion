I can answer your questions about Jacketed vessel.","1":"What is the jacketed vessel in chemical engineering?","2":"Jacketed vessel In chemical engineering, a jacketed vessel is a container that is designed for controlling temperature of its contents, by using a cooling or heating \"jacket\" around the vessel through which a cooling or heating fluid is circulated.","3":"what is the function of the jacket","4":"A jacket is a cavity external to the vessel that permits the uniform exchange of heat between the fluid circulating in it and the walls of the vessel.","5":"what types are there","6":"There are several types of jackets, depending on the design: Jackets can be applied to the entire surface of a vessel or just a portion of it.","7":"is there a specific type for a vertical vessel","8":"For a vertical vessel, the top head is typically left unjacketed.","9":"what are the zones for","10":"Jackets can be divided into zones, to divide the flow of the heating or cooling medium.","11":"what are the advantages of dividing the flow","12":"Advantages include: ability to direct flow to certain portions of the jacket, such as only the bottom head when minimal heating or cooling is needed and the entire jacket when maximum heating or cooling is required; ability to provide a higher volume of flow overall (zones are piped in parallel) because the pressure drop through a zone is lower than if the entire jacket is a single zone."}}
