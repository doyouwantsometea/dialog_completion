I can answer your questions about Peterborough Chronicle.","1":"What was the Peterborough Chronicle?","2":"The two Peterborough continuations sympathise with the poor, and this makes them almost unique in Latin or English history.","3":"What else is significant about the Chronicle?","4":"They also focus more on life outside of the abbey than other \"Chronicles\".","5":"Are there any other interesting aspects about this article?","6":"The general \"Chronicle\" is somewhat insular.","7":"What is insular about it?","8":"While most versions note the national events, such as a progress of the king or a change in sovereign, discussion of the countryside around the monastery is limited.","9":"What else is notable about it?","10":"Portents and omens receive coverage, but rarely do the chroniclers discuss political alliances (as the author of the second continuation does with his denunciation of the bishops who were allied with Matilda) or the legalities of monastic rule (as the author of the first continuation does in his lament over Abbot Henry).","11":"Why is this different?","12":"The monks who compiled the continuation at Peterborough were either consciously striking out in a new direction (perhaps under the direction of Abbot Martin) or continuing a type of chronicle that was confined to their own monastery (that was lost with the fire)."}}
