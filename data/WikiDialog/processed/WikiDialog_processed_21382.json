I can answer your questions about Tupper's self-referential formula.","1":"What can you tell me about Tupper's self-referential formula?","2":"Tupper's self-referential formula  Tupper's self-referential formula is a formula that visually represents itself when graphed at a specific location in the (\"x\", \"y\") plane.","3":"Where did this formula come from?","4":"The formula was defined by Jeff Tupper and appears as an example in Tupper's 2001 SIGGRAPH paper on reliable two-dimensional computer graphing algorithms.","5":"What is the name of the formula?","6":"Although the formula is called \"self-referential\", Tupper did not name it as such.","7":"What is the formula in terms of symbols?","8":"The formula is an inequality defined as:  or, as plaintext, where \u230a \u230b denotes the floor function, and mod is the modulo operation.","9":"What does the formula look like when graphed?","10":"Let \"k\" equal the following 543-digit integer: If one graphs the set of points (\"x\", \"y\") in 0 \u2264 \"x\" < 106 and \"k\" \u2264 \"y\" < \"k\" + 17 satisfying the inequality given above, the resulting graph looks like this (the axes in this plot have been reversed, otherwise the picture would be upside-down and mirrored): The formula is a general-purpose method of decoding a bitmap stored in the constant \"k\", and it could actually be used to draw any other image.","11":"Are there any other interesting aspects about this article?","12":"When applied to the unbounded positive range 0 \u2264 \"y\", the formula tiles a vertical swath of the plane with a pattern that contains all possible 17-pixel-tall bitmaps."}}
