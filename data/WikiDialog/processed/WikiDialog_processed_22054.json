I can answer your questions about Spanish and Portuguese Jews.","1":"What was the French Revolutionary War about?","2":"In pre-Revolutionary France, the Portuguese Jews were one of three tolerated Jewish communities, the other two being the Ashkenazi Jews of Alsace-Lorraine and the Jews of the former Papal enclave of Comtat Venaissin; all three groups were emancipated at the French Revolution.","3":"What are some interesting aspects about this article?","4":"The third community originally had their own Proven\u00e7al rite, but adopted the Spanish and Portuguese rite shortly after the French Revolution and the incorporation of Comtat Venaissin into France.","5":"Is there anything else that is notable?","6":"Today there are still a few Spanish and Portuguese communities in Bordeaux and Bayonne, and one in Paris, but in all these communities (and still more among French Jews generally) any surviving Spanish and Portuguese Jews are greatly outnumbered by recent Sephardic migrants of North African origin.","7":"What happened in the end?","8":"During the Spanish occupation of the Netherlands, converso merchants had a strong trading presence there.","9":"When did this take place?","10":"When the Dutch Republic gained independence in 1581, the Dutch retained trading links with Portugal rather than Spain, as Spain was regarded as a hostile power.","11":"Is there anything else that is important?","12":"Since there were penal laws against Catholics, and Catholicism was regarded with greater hostility than Judaism, New Christian conversos (technically Catholics, as that was the Christian tradition they were forced into) were encouraged by the Dutch to \"come out\" openly as Jews."}}
