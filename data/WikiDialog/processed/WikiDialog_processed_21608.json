I can answer your questions about Guided bone and tissue regeneration.","1":"What is the advantage of using a membrane?","2":"There is no need for a second surgery to remove the membrane, this will prevent any disruption to the healing process of the regenerated tissues.","3":"What are the types of membranes?","4":"A synthetic resorbable membrane indicated an amount of stable augmented bone similar to that of a collagen resorbable membrane.","5":"Are there any other interesting aspects about this article?","6":"These are the results obtained based on a randomised clinical trial done to compare the stability of augmented bone between a synthetic resorbable membrane and a collagen membrane with guide bone regeneration simultaneous with dental implant placement in the aesthetic zone in terms of facial bone thickness.","7":"What are the success factors?","8":"Success depends on osteoblasts being present at the site, there must be a sufficient blood supply , graft must be stabilised during healing and soft tissue must not be under tension.","9":"What are the uses?","10":"is There are several uses of bone regeneration: Contraindication include:  Potential complications include:"}}
