I can answer your questions about Rev (HIV).","1":"What is the function of Rev in HIV?","2":"On the other hand, unspliced and incompletely spliced mRNAs which code for the late, structural proteins are Rev-dependent.","3":"Are there any other interesting aspects about this article?","4":"The Rev protein is expressed as an early gene from completely spliced transcripts, so the expression of late phase structural proteins cannot occur until an initial amount of Rev is produced.","5":"Is there anything else noteable about the function of Rev in HIV?","6":"Since Rev is absolutely necessary for HIV-1 replication and it is expressed early on in infection, it has been suggested that Rev is a good target for antiviral therapies.","7":"Did you find anything else interesting?","8":"Leptomycin B (LMB) binds to CRM1 which prevents the formation of the complex required for export(CRM1\/NES\/RanGTP\/RRE) and ultimately reduces the production of incompletely spliced RNAs.","9":"What do you find the most interesting fact about this article?","10":"Therefore, structural proteins, which are necessary for virion assembly, are not produced.","11":"Did you find any other interesting aspects?","12":"It has been shown that various organic compounds have the ability to target the Rev\/RRE interaction."}}
