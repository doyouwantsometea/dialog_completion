I can answer your questions about Cardiac excitation-contraction coupling.","1":"What is the ANS trying to accomplish?","2":"Heart rate is affected by nerves.","3":"How is ANS trying to affect the heart rate?","4":"Sympathetic nerves, coming from the spinal cord, increase heart rate, whereas parasympathetic nerves (for example the vagus nerves) work to decrease it.","5":"What are some of the methods ANS uses to increase heart rate?","6":"Sympathetic nerves work by releasing a protein (neurotransmitter) called noradrenaline which binds to a specific receptor (beta 1 adrenoceptor) located in the sarcolemma and the t-tubule membrane of cardiac cells.","7":"What does it do once itbinds to the receptor?","8":"This activates a protein, called a G-protein and results in a series of reactions (known as a cyclic AMP pathway) that leads to the production of a molecule called cAMP (cyclic adenosine monophosphate).","9":"What role does cAMP play in the ANS?","10":"In the SAN cAMP binds to an ion channel involved in action potential initiation, speeding up the production of the action potential (see sinoatrial node for more detail).","11":"What other proteins are important for ANS to function properly?","12":"cAMP also, activates a protein called protein kinase A (PKA)."}}
