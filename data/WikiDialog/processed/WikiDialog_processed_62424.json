I can answer your questions about Diesel exhaust.","1":"What is meant by black smoke?","2":"The full load limit of a diesel engine in normal service is defined by the \"black smoke limit\", beyond which point the fuel cannot be completely burned.","3":"Are there any other interesting aspects about this article?","4":"As the \"black smoke limit\" is still considerably lean of stoichiometric, it is possible to obtain more power by exceeding it, but the resultant inefficient combustion means that the extra power comes at the price of reduced combustion efficiency, high fuel consumption and dense clouds of smoke.","5":"Is there a way around this?","6":"This is only done in high performance applications where these disadvantages are of little concern.","7":"What else does the article say about starting the engine?","8":"When starting from cold, the engine's combustion efficiency is reduced because the cold engine block draws heat out of the cylinder in the compression stroke.","9":"Is there a way to get the engine to start without producing black smoke?","10":"The result is that fuel is not burned fully, resulting in blue and white smoke and lower power outputs until the engine has warmed.","11":"What other issues are there with starting the engine?","12":"This is especially the case with indirect injection engines, which are less thermally efficient."}}
