I can answer your questions about Dunstable Priory.","1":"What are the remains of Dunstable Priory?","2":"The Dunstable Priory clock was one of the oldest mechanical clocks in England, built in 1283.","3":"Where was the clock located?","4":"Accounts say it was installed above the rood screen.","5":"Is there anything else of significance?","6":"Of the fourteenth century there are only a few scanty notices, the only events told at any length being those connected with the Peasants' Revolt in 1381, when the prior, Thomas Marshall, appears by his courage and moderation to have saved his own house from serious loss, and his burghers from punishment.","7":"What happened after Thomas Marshall?","8":"In 1349 an attempt was made by Thomas de Beauchamp, Earl of Warwick, and marshal of the kingdom, to prove that the prior held his lands by barony; but the jury which was summoned at that time declared upon oath that the lands had always been held in pure and perpetual alms.","9":"Are there any other interesting aspects about this article?","10":"Henry VI visited Dunstable in 1459, but there is no record of his relations with the priory; its history during the fifteenth century is not recorded in any way.","11":"Was there ever any other activity?","12":"But in the sixteenth century it was again connected with an important historical event, when on 23 May 1533, in the Lady Chapel of the conventual church at Dunstable, Archbishop Cranmer together with and the bishops of Winchester, London, Bath and Lincoln pronounced the marriage between Henry VIII and Catherine of Aragon to be null and void. The location arose as Catherine was then residing at nearby Ampthill, some 12 miles to the north."}}
