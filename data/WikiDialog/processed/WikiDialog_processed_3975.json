I can answer your questions about Bi-elliptic transfer.","1":"What is the difference between a Bi-elliptic transfer and a normal mode of the same orbit?","2":"Therefore:  and finally:  The figure shows the total formula_23 required to transfer from a circular orbit of radius formula_7 to another circular orbit of radius formula_8.","3":"What are the critical points in the orbits?","4":"The formula_23 is shown normalized to the orbital speed in the initial orbit, formula_33, and is plotted as a function of the ratio of the radii of the final and initial orbits, formula_34; this is done so that the comparison is general (i.e. not dependent of the specific values of formula_7 and formula_8, only on their ratio).","5":"Are there any other interesting aspects about this article?","6":"The thick black curve indicates the formula_23 for the Hohmann transfer, while the thinner colored curves correspond to bi-elliptic transfers with varying values of the parameter formula_38, defined as the apoapsis radius formula_1 of the elliptic auxiliary orbit normalized to the radius of the initial orbit, and indicated next to the curves.","7":"What do the curves have in common?","8":"The inset shows a close-up of the region where the bi-elliptic curves cross the Hohmann curve for the first time.","9":"Is there anything else that is important?","10":"One sees that the Hohmann transfer is always more efficient if the ratio of radii formula_40 is smaller than 11.94.","11":"Why is that?","12":"On the other hand, if the radius of the final orbit is more than 15.58 times larger than the radius of the initial orbit, then any bi-elliptic transfer, regardless of its apoapsis radius (as long as it's larger than the radius of the final orbit), requires less formula_23 than a Hohmann transfer."}}
