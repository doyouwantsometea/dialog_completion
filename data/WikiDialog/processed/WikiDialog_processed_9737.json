I can answer your questions about Vertical clinging and leaping.","1":"What adaptations did the primates have to possess for vertical clinging and leaping?","2":"Locomotion and movement are the main contributing factors to primate's body shape and structure, thus the anatomy of vertical climbers and leapers is highly specialized to enable them to move effectively within their arboreal habitat.","3":"What part of their anatomy is specialized for climbing?","4":"Features found in the hips, knees, feet, hands, arms, and tails are specialized to facilitate climbing and leaping in primates, and aids in other postures such as tail suspensions and foot hanging.","5":"What else is interesting about this article?","6":"With the features described, these primates can move through trees efficiently and obtain food easily.","7":"What do you find most interesting about this article?","8":"Body size also has a direct correlation to how fast and how far a primate can leap.","9":"Are there any other interesting aspects about this article?","10":"There are other musculoskeletal specializations that differentiate VCL dependent primates, such as their hip joints and muscles.","11":"What part of their anatomy is responsible for the VCL?","12":"Leaping primates have more proximally positioned lesser and third trochanters, and have relatively large muscles for hip extensors, knee extensors or ankle plantar flexors."}}
