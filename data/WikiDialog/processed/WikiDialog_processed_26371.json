I can answer your questions about IBM FlashSystem.","1":"What is the meaning of IBM FlashSystem?","2":"IBM FlashSystem IBM FlashSystem products are enterprise computer data storage systems that store data on flash memory.","3":"Are there any other interesting aspects about this article?","4":"Unlike storage systems that use standard solid-state drives, IBM FlashSystem products incorporate custom hardware based on technology from the 2012 IBM acquisition of Texas Memory Systems.","5":"What was the relation between Texas Memory Systems and IBM FlashSystem?","6":"The IBM FlashSystem architecture was originally developed by Texas Memory Systems (TMS) as their RamSan product line.","7":"Who was Texas Memory Systems?","8":"TMS was a small private company founded in 1978 and based in Houston, Texas that supplied solid-state drive products to the market longer than any other company. The TMS RamSan line of enterprise solid state storage products was first launched in the early 2000s, and over seven RamSan technology generations were released through 2012, when TMS was acquired by IBM.","9":"What were the different generations of RamSan?","10":"As RamSan technology evolved, TMS adapted the systems to different storage media (DRAM, single-level cell flash memory, and multi-level cell flash memory) and external storage area network interfaces (Fibre Channel and InfiniBand), but the core system design principles remained relatively constant: custom hardware with a shared internal network to maximize speed, particularly latency.","11":"Which of the products had been discontinued?","12":"The last RamSan products available were the RamSan-710, RamSan-810, RamSan-720, and RamSan-820 systems, which were replaced directly with corresponding IBM FlashSystem products in 2013."}}
