I can answer your questions about Immunotransplant.","1":"What is T cell homeostasis?","2":"The total cohort of T cells in an organism maintain homeostasis \u2013 a consistent total number of T cells in the peripheral blood.","3":"how does the body do this?","4":"Transient elevations in peripheral blood T cell counts cause the whole population to diminish, transient depletions cause the whole population to proliferate, generally maintaining a roughly total T cell count.","5":"Are there any other interesting aspects about this article?","6":"The latter situation \u2013lymphodepletion\u2013 has been studied extensively and the proliferation of mature T cells upon transfer into the lymphopenic host is referred to as \u201clymphodepletion-induced\u201d or \u201chomeostatic\u201d proliferation.","7":"what is the significance of this?","8":"It has been shown that homeostatic proliferation induces not only quantitative changes in T cell cohorts, but qualitative changes as well, such as increased function and the development of a memory-cell phenotype.","9":"what is the cause of this?","10":"The mechanism of these changes has been shown to be primarily due to upregulation of a group of cytokines including IL-7 and IL-15 induced by lymphodepletion.","11":"is there any other interesting information?","12":"Additionally, lymphodepletion is a non-selective method of eliminating several known regulatory, or immunosuppressive, subsets of immune cells, such as regulatory T cells."}}
