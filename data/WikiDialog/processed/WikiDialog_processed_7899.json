I can answer your questions about I2O.","1":"What is I2O?","2":"I2O Intelligent Input\/Output (I2O) is a defunct computer input\/output (I\/O) specification.","3":"What was it for?","4":"I2O was originally designed to make use of the Intel i960 microprocessor as the I\/O offload engine, bringing channel I\/O to the PC.","5":"Are there any other interesting aspects about this article?","6":"I2O emerged from Intel in the mid 1990s with the publication of the I2O specification in 1996 by the Intelligent I\/O Special Interest Group, which dissolved as of 13 October 2000.","7":"What did it consist of?","8":"I2O's principal architectural components included the I\/O processor (IOP) and a split device driver model, with an OSM (OS Module) running in the host operating system and a HDM (Hardware Device Module) running on the I\/O processor.","9":"What did it do?","10":"This formally separated OS-specific driver functionality from the underlying device, and the two software components used message passing for communications.","11":"Why is this significant?","12":"This split is suggestive of another initiative in which Intel participated at the time, the Uniform Driver Interface (UDI), which sought to establish a common device driver interface spanning multiple software platforms."}}
