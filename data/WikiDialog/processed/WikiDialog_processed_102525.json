I can answer your questions about Jatropha biodiesel in India.","1":"What is the potential of the jatropha biodiesel industry in India?","2":"Jatropha biodiesel in India Biofuel development in India centres mainly around the cultivation and processing of Jatropha plant seeds which are very rich in oil (40%).","3":"What are the drivers for this?","4":"The drivers for this are historic, functional, economic, environmental, moral and political.","5":"Are there any other interesting aspects about this article?","6":"Jatropha oil has been used in India for several decades as biodiesel for the diesel fuel requirements of remote rural and forest communities; jatropha oil can be used directly after extraction (i.e. without refining) in diesel generators and engines.","7":"What else does it do?","8":"Jatropha has the potential to provide economic benefits at the local level since under suitable management it has the potential to grow in dry marginal non-agricultural lands, thereby allowing villagers and farmers to leverage non-farm land for income generation.","9":"What other benefits are there?","10":"As well, increased Jatropha oil production delivers economic benefits to India on the macroeconomic or national level as it reduces the nation's fossil fuel import bill for diesel production (the main transportation fuel used in the country); minimising the expenditure of India's foreign-currency reserves for fuel allowing India to increase its growing foreign currency reserves (which can be better spent on capital expenditures for industrial inputs and production).","11":"Is there anything else of importance?","12":"And since Jatropha oil is carbon-neutral, large-scale production will improve the country's carbon emissions profile."}}
