I can answer your questions about Social learning in animals.","1":"What is social learning in regards to Rats?","2":"Eventually, the researchers determined that naive adult rats could learn to strip pine cones efficiently if presented with an already partially stripped cone.","3":"Why is this significant?","4":"This is consistent with opportunity providing because experienced individuals inadvertently provide naive rats with partially stripped cones that facilitate their learning without altering the experienced rats' behavior.","5":"Are there any other interesting aspects about this article?","6":"Opportunity providing has also been found to be important in the acquisition of tool use by chimpanzees, in which a mother chimpanzee may contribute to the development of her offspring's nut cracking technique by leaving \"hammer\", either hard wood or rocks, and nuts in the nest.","7":"Is there anything else notable?","8":"The infant is thus given the chance to use the hammer in the \u201cproper\u201d context.","9":"Who does the chimpanzee learn from?","10":"The mother chimpanzee may provide this opportunity unknowing or actively depending on the situation.","11":"What is another example of social learning?","12":"In stimulus enhancement, a demonstrator exposes an observer to a particular stimulus, leading to the observer learning the relationship between a stimulus and its result."}}
