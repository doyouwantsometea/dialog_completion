I can answer your questions about Consciousness.","1":"What did the experts say at the Francis Crick Memorial Conference?","2":"On July 7, 2012, eminent scientists from different branches of neuroscience gathered at the University of Cambridge to celebrate the Francis Crick Memorial Conference, which deals with consciousness in humans and pre-linguistic consciousness in nonhuman animals.","3":"Anything else interesting?","4":"After the conference, they signed in the presence of Stephen Hawking, the 'Cambridge Declaration on Consciousness', which summarizes the most important findings of the survey: \"We decided to reach a consensus and make a statement directed to the public that is not scientific.","5":"What did the public say about the conference?","6":"It's obvious to everyone in this room that animals have consciousness, but it is not obvious to the rest of the world.","7":"What did the rest of the world say?","8":"It is not obvious to the rest of the Western world or the Far East.","9":"What did the Far East say?","10":"It is not obvious to the society.\" \"Convergent evidence indicates that non-human animals [...], including all mammals and birds, and other creatures, [...] have the necessary neural substrates of consciousness and the capacity to exhibit intentional behaviors.\" The idea of an artifact made conscious is an ancient theme of mythology, appearing for example in the Greek myth of Pygmalion, who carved a statue that was magically brought to life, and in medieval Jewish stories of the Golem, a magically animated homunculus built of clay.","11":"Are there any other interesting aspects about this article?","12":"However, the possibility of actually constructing a conscious machine was probably first discussed by Ada Lovelace, in a set of notes written in 1842 about the Analytical Engine invented by Charles Babbage, a precursor (never built) to modern electronic computers."}}
