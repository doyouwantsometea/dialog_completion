I can answer your questions about Subject\u2013auxiliary inversion.","1":"What is Subject\u2013auxiliary inversion?","2":"Subject\u2013auxiliary inversion Subject\u2013auxiliary inversion (also called subject\u2013operator inversion) is a frequently occurring type of inversion in English, whereby a finite auxiliary verb \u2013 taken here to include finite forms of the copula \"be\" \u2013 appears to \"invert\" (change places) with the subject.","3":"What is the inversion?","4":"The word order is therefore Aux-S (auxiliary\u2013subject), which is the opposite of the canonical SV (subject\u2013verb) order of declarative clauses in English.","5":"Are there any other interesting aspects about this article?","6":"The most frequent use of subject\u2013auxiliary inversion in English is in the formation of questions, although it also has other uses, including the formation of condition clauses, and in the syntax of sentences beginning with negative expressions (negative inversion).","7":"Is there anything else noteable?","8":"In certain types of English sentences, inversion is also possible with verbs other than auxiliaries; these are described in the article on subject-verb inversion.","9":"What is the difference between the two?","10":"Subject\u2013 auxiliary inversion involves placing the subject after a finite auxiliary verb, rather than before it as is the case in typical declarative sentences (the canonical word order of English being subject\u2013verb\u2013object).","11":"Any other interesting information?","12":"The auxiliary verbs which may participate in such inversion (e.g. \"is\", \"can\", \"have\", \"will\", etc.) are described at English auxiliaries and contractions."}}
