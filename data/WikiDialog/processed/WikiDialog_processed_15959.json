I can answer your questions about Reinforced concrete.","1":"What is meant by balanced reinforced concrete beam?","2":"A balanced-reinforced beam is one in which both the compressive and tensile zones reach yielding at the same imposed load on the beam, and the concrete will crush and the tensile steel will yield at the same time.","3":"Are there any other interesting aspects about this article?","4":"This design criterion is however as risky as over-reinforced concrete, because failure is sudden as the concrete crushes at the same time of the tensile steel yields, which gives a very little warning of distress in tension failure.","5":"Is there anything else?","6":"Steel-reinforced concrete moment-carrying elements should normally be designed to be under-reinforced so that users of the structure will receive warning of impending collapse.","7":"What is the characteristic strength?","8":"The characteristic strength is the strength of a material where less than 5% of the specimen shows lower strength.","9":"What is the design strength?","10":"The design strength or nominal strength is the strength of a material, including a material-safety factor.","11":"What is the safety factor?","12":"The value of the safety factor generally ranges from 0.75 to 0.85 in Permissible stress design."}}
