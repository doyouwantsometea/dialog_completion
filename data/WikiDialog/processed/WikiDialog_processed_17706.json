I can answer your questions about Section 25 of the Constitution of Australia.","1":"What is the effect of Section 25?","2":"Despite the section's intention to deter disenfranchisement on the basis of race, in practice it has been of little effect.","3":"Why is it of little effect?","4":"The existence of section 127 in the Constitution, which excluded Aboriginal people from being counted in population data, meant that the exclusion of Aboriginal people from state franchise had no effect on a state's population in applying section 24 to determine the make-up of the House of Representatives.","5":"What are some other reasons it has little effect?","6":"Likewise, it had little effect on exclusion of other races, such as Queensland's exclusion of Aboriginal populations of other nations, as they were either insignificant in number in relation to the broader population or could be excluded by other means, such as on the basis of nationality, which would not trigger section 25.","7":"Have there been any changes to Section 25?","8":"By the time section 127 was repealed, allowing the Aboriginal population to be counted in determining representation in federal parliament, all states already included Aboriginal people in their respective franchises.","9":"Are there any other interesting aspects about this article?","10":"There has been no direct High Court judgements relating to the application of section 25.","11":"Why has it been rarely used?","12":"This is largely because its existence has always been of little to no effect, and because any dispute over its application is unlikely to have been in relation to a population large enough to have any effect on the representation numbers in Parliament."}}
