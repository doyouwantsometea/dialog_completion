I can answer your questions about Amazons.","1":"Where did the Amazons settle?","2":"Strabo writes that the original home of the Amazons was in Themiscyra and the plains about Thermodon and the mountains that lie above them, but were later driven out of these places, and during his time they were said to live in the mountains above Caucasian Albania (not to be confused with the modern Albania), but he also states that some others, among them Metrodorus of Scepsis and Hypsicrates, say that after Themiscyra, the Amazons traveled and lived on the borders of the Gargarians, in the northerly foothills of those parts of the Caucasian Mountains which are called Ceraunian.","3":"Did they have any other settlements?","4":"Diodorus giving the account of Dionysius of Mitylene, who, on his part, drew on Thymoetas states that before the Amazons of the Thermodon there were, much earlier in time, the Amazons of Libya.","5":"Where did they go after Libya?","6":"These Amazons started from Libya passed through Egypt and Syria, and stopped at the Ca\u00efcus in Aeolis, near which they founded several cities.","7":"What other settlements did they found?","8":"Later, he says, they established Mitylene a little way beyond the Ca\u00efcus.","9":"Did they stay in those places, or eventually move on?","10":"Aeschylus, in \"Prometheus Bound\", places the original home of the Amazons in the country about Lake Maeotis and they later moved to Themiscyra on the Thermodon.","11":"Are there any other interesting aspects about this article?","12":"According to Pseudo-Plutarch, the Amazons lived in and about the Tanais () river (modern Don river), formerly called the Amazonian or Amazon () river, because the Amazons bathed themselves therein."}}
