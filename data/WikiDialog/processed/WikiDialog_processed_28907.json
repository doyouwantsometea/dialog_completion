I can answer your questions about Identification friend or foe.","1":"What were the early developments in IFF?","2":"Already before the deployment of their Chain Home radar system (CH), the RAF had considered the problem of IFF.","3":"Are there any other interesting aspects about this article?","4":"Robert Watson-Watt had filed patents on such systems in 1935 and 1936. By 1938, researchers at Bawdsey Manor began experiments with \"reflectors\" consisting of dipole antennas tuned to resonate to the primary frequency of the CH radars.","5":"What did this do?","6":"When a pulse from the CH transmitter hit the aircraft, the antennas would resonate for a short time, increasing the amount of energy returned to the CH receiver.","7":"What did they do next?","8":"The antenna was connected to a motorized switch that periodically shorted it out, preventing it from producing a signal.","9":"What did this cause?","10":"This caused the return on the CH set to periodically lengthen and shorten as the antenna was turned on and off.","11":"Was this successful?","12":"In practice, the system was found to be too unreliable to use; the return was highly dependent on the direction the aircraft was moving relative to the CH station, and often returned little or no additional signal."}}
