I can answer your questions about Nutmeg.","1":"What happened to nutmeg in the 16th century?","2":"The British skilfully negotiated with the village leaders on the island Rhun to protect them from the Dutch in exchange for a monopoly on their nutmeg.","3":"Was anyone successful with this?","4":"The village leader of Rhun accepted King James I of England as their sovereign, but the English presence on Rhun only lasted until 1624.","5":"What happened after it lasted until 1624?","6":"Control of the Banda Islands continued to be contested until 1667 when, in the Treaty of Breda, the British ceded Rhun to the Dutch in exchange for the island of Manhattan and its city New Amsterdam (later New York) in North America.","7":"What happened after the treaty was over?","8":"As a result of the Dutch interregnum during the Napoleonic Wars, the British temporarily took control of the Banda Islands from the Dutch and transplanted nutmeg trees, complete with soil, to Sri Lanka, Penang, Bencoolen, and Singapore.","9":"Did the trees do well there?","10":"(There is evidence that the tree existed in Sri Lanka even before this.) From these locations they were transplanted to their other colonial holdings elsewhere, notably Zanzibar and Grenada.","11":"Are there any other interesting aspects about this article?","12":"The national flag of Grenada, adopted in 1974, shows a stylised split-open nutmeg fruit."}}
