I can answer your questions about Red-naped sapsucker.","1":"Where does the Red-naped sapsucker nest?","2":"(Sphyrapicus nuchalis) nests have been described primarily in trembling aspen (\"Populus tremuloides\") with decay-softened wood.","3":"Why do they choose trembling aspen?","4":"Heart-wood decay is reported to infect the roots of most aspens that red-naped sapsuckers choose to excavate for nesting.","5":"What else is interesting about their nesting?","6":"Red-naped sapsuckers typically excavate their first cavity relatively close to the ground and over subsequent years make progressively higher excavations.","7":"Do the excavations get bigger every year?","8":"Most (68%) nest trees were live and 75% had broken tops.","9":"Do they use any other plants?","10":"Western larch (Larix occidentalis) and birch were greatly over utilized compared to their availability."}}
