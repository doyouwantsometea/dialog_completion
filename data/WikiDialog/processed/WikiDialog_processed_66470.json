I can answer your questions about Coup of June 1907.","1":"What are the Fundamental Laws of the Russian Empire?","2":"The Fundamental Law did permit the Tsar to implement or change new laws without the Duma's consent, in intervals between sessions of the Duma (which is when the \"coup\" law was enacted), but these were supposed to be submitted to the new Duma within two months, and were subject to that Duma's power to suspend or repeal them.","3":"Did the Duma have the power to suspend or repeal any of his laws?","4":"Furthermore, no such edict could ever make any changes in the Fundamental Law itself, which required not just the emperor's initiative but also the Duma's approval.","5":"Did he have any other powers?","6":"Hence, the Tsar's new electoral statute had been enacted contrary to his own Fundamental Law.","7":"What problems did this cause for him?","8":"This raised the question of whether Russia was fundamentally a state ruled under an immutable organic statute (the Fundamental Law), or one still ruled by an all-powerful monarch.","9":"Are there any other interesting aspects about this article?","10":"The Tsar's government countered by insisting that since the Emperor had granted the Fundamental Law to begin with, he had the God-given right to unilaterally alter it (even though the Fundamental Law clearly said otherwise) in extraordinary instances, such as Nicholas claimed this to be.","11":"What did Nicholas say to justify his actions?","12":"The manifesto of June 3, 1907 announcing this change specifically appealed to the Tsar's \"historical authority\" as the legal basis for these changes, which Nicholas asserted \"cannot be enacted through the ordinary legislative route\" since the Second Duma had been \"pronounced unsatisfactory\" by him."}}
