I can answer your questions about VisIt.","1":"What is VisIt used for?","2":"Target use cases include data exploration, comparative analysis, visual debugging, quantitative analysis, and presentation graphics.","3":"Is VisIt a program?","4":"The VisIt product delivers the efforts of many software developers in a single package.","5":"What is VisIt composed of?","6":"First, VisIt leverages several third party libraries: the Qt widget library for its user interface, the Python programming language for a command line interpreter, and the Visualization ToolKit (VTK) library for its data model and many of its visualization algorithms.","7":"What else is VisIt composed of?","8":"On top of that, an additional fifty man-years worth of effort have been devoted to the development of VisIt itself.","9":"What did the additional 50 man-years do?","10":"The VisIt-specific effort has largely been focused on parallelization for large data sets, user interface, implementing custom data analysis routines, addressing non-standard data models (such as adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) and mixed materials zones), and creating a robust overall product.","11":"How large is VisIt?","12":"VisIt consists over one and a half million lines of code, and its third party libraries have an additional million lines of code."}}
