I can answer your questions about Marie-Joseph Ch\u00e9nier.","1":"What happened in 1792 to Marie-Joseph Ch\u00e9nier?","2":"In 1792 he produced his \"Ca\u00efus Gracchus\", which was even more revolutionary in tone than its predecessors.","3":"What was the Ca \u2047 us Gracchus?","4":"It was nevertheless proscribed in the next year at the instance of the Montagnard deputy Albitte, for the anti-anarchical hemistich \"Des lois et non du sang\" (\"Laws, and not blood\"); \"F\u00e9nelon\" (1793) was suspended after a few representations; and in 1794 \"Timol\u00e9on\", set to Etienne M\u00e9hul's music, was also proscribed.","5":"What happened with Timoleon?","6":"This piece was played after the Reign of Terror, but the fratricide of \"Timol\u00e9on\" became the text for insinuations to the effect that by his silence Joseph Ch\u00e9nier had connived at the judicial murder of his brother, Andr\u00e9, whom Joseph's enemies alluded to as Abel.","7":"Are there any other interesting aspects about this article?","8":"In fact, after some fruitless attempts to save his brother, variously related by his biographers, Joseph became aware that Andr\u00e9's only chance of safety lay in being forgotten by the authorities, and that ill-advised intervention would only hasten the end.","9":"What did he do after that?","10":"Joseph Ch\u00e9nier had been a member of the National Convention and had voted for the death of Louis XVI; he belonged to the committees of general security, and of public safety.","11":"Did he get in trouble?","12":"He was, nevertheless, suspected of moderate sentiments, and before the end of the Terror had become a marked man."}}
