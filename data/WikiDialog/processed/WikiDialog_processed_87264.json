I can answer your questions about Migrant workers in the Gulf Cooperation Council region.","1":"What are the main obstacles to migrant workers in the Gulf Cooperation Council region?","2":"Starting in the 1980s, Persian Gulf countries have implemented policies focused on nationalisation of the workforce and limiting the influx of foreign labor - so-called \"Gulfization policies\".","3":"Are there any other obstacles?","4":"These policies were adopted because of the perceived threat that a large number migrants posed, combined with high levels of unemployment of nationals.","5":"Are any of these policies or programs being changed or repealed?","6":"Over the years, these policies have been adjusted and amended to provide a better fit to the situation at hand.","7":"What are some of the more recent obstacles?","8":"These policies have focused both on the supply of foreign labor and the demand of foreign labour.","9":"What types of the obstacles relate to the supply of foreign labor?","10":"Examples of the former include increasing the costs of living, for example through indirect taxes, cracking down on migrant workers illegally residing in the GCC countries, and restricting visa and work permit rules and visa trading.","11":"What types of obstacles relate to the demand for foreign labor?","12":"Examples of policies limiting the demand for foreign labour include financial incentives for employers to hire nationals, training and schooling of nationals, increasing the costs of hiring migrant workers, excluding migrant workers from certain specific sectors and placing quotas on the employment of nationals and migrant workers."}}
