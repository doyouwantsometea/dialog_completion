I can answer your questions about RDE-1.","1":"What is the function of RDE-1?","2":"RDE-1  RDE-1 (\"R\"NAi-\"DE\"fective \"1\") is a primary Argonaute protein required for RNA-mediated interference (RNAi) in \"Caenorhabditis elegans\".","3":"Are there any other interesting aspects about this article?","4":"The rde-1 gene locus was first characterized in \"C. elegans\" mutants resistant to RNAi, and is a member of a highly conserved Piwi gene family that includes plant, Drosophila, and vertebrate homologs.","5":"What does it do inside the cell?","6":"Upon uptake into the cell, exogenous trigger dsRNA is bound by RDE-4 and cleaved into 21-25nt primary siRNA by a Dicer complex that includes RDE-1.","7":"What else does it do?","8":"Primary siRNA binding to RDE-1 then promotes the formation of the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC).","9":"Is there anything else noteworthy about its function?","10":"Unlike in other Argonautes characterized in Drosophila and humans, the catalytic RNase H motif in RDE-1 has not been shown to exhibit Slicer activity of the target transcript.","11":"Why doesn't it have that activity?","12":"Instead, RNase H activity in RDE-1 is primarily facilitates siRNA maturation through cleavage of the passenger strand."}}
