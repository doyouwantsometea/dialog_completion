I can answer your questions about Egg donation.","1":"What is the basic payment for an egg donor?","2":"In other words, if they complete the cycle, they will be paid the agreed price regardless of how many (or how few) eggs are retrieved.","3":"Are there any other interesting aspects about this article?","4":"In countries that prohibit compensation there is an extreme dearth of young women willing to go through this procedure.","5":"Why is there a dearth of young women?","6":"Additionally, in most countries where it is legal and compensated, the law places a cap on the compensation and that cap tends to be in the vicinity of $1000\u2013$2000.","7":"Is there anything else that is notable about the payment?","8":"In the US, no law caps the compensation, but the American Society for Reproductive Medicine requires member clinics to abide by their standards, which provide that \"sums of $5,000 or more require justification and sums above $10,000 are not appropriate.\" The \"justification\" for payments over $5000 may include previous successful donations, unusually good family health history, or membership in minority ethnicities for which it is more difficult to find donors.","9":"What else does the article say about payment?","10":"As a result of these legal and financial differences around the world, egg donation in the US is much more expensive than it is in other countries.","11":"Is there an example of what it would cost?","12":"For instance, at one top US clinic it costs more than $26,000 plus the donor's medications (another several thousand dollars)."}}
