I can answer your questions about Uniforms of the Canadian Armed Forces.","1":"What was the main change to the uniform of the Canadian Armed Forces?","2":"The Canadian Army later replaced work dress with \"No. 4 (Garrison) Dress\", which consisted of the old-style work dress pants, a disruptive-pattern jacket, a black web belt, a short-sleeve summer Service Dress shirt with the collar open and over the jacket collar, and high paratrooper-style garrison boots.","3":"What other changes were made to the uniform?","4":"The rifle-green crew-neck combat sweater doubled as a sweater for wear with Service Dress and Garrison Dress.","5":"Were there any other changes?","6":"Due to concerns over the number of uniforms Army personnel had to carry with them on postings and taskings, the tan summer DEU was eventually retired, and the winter uniform mandated for year-round wear.","7":"Were the changes popular?","8":"The garrison dress uniform was not popular with the combat arms, as the boots were easily scuffed, especially when doing manual labour; the jacket was heavily lined and restrictive; the belt was designed to ride very high on the body and served no practical purpose.","9":"Is there anything else interesting?","10":"Army troops generally eschewed garrison dress for the combat uniform when possible, even in garrison.","11":"Why did they do that?","12":"Land Force Western Area actually instructed its units to wear the combat uniform instead, and Land Force Command later adopted the practice across the rest of the country, authorizing combat uniform for all occasions where garrison dress was deemed appropriate."}}
