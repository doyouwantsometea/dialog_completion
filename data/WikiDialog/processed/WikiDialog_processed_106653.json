I can answer your questions about Laws of Duplicate Bridge.","1":"What is meant by playing out of turn?","2":"An \"opening lead\" out of turn (law 54) is perhaps the most frequent infraction.","3":"What are some consequences of playing out of turn?","4":"If the wrong defender makes the opening lead, the to-be-declarer has the following options:  Unauthorized information (UI) (law 16) is any information that a player obtains by means of:  Reception of unauthorized information is not an infraction \"per se\".","5":"Are there any other interesting aspects about this article?","6":"However, the player who (\"might have\") received it has severe limitation that (s)he may not act on the basis of it (even if the action is reasonable), but must select a \"logical alternative\" instead.","7":"What is a logical alternative?","8":"The definition of \"logical alternative\" is fairly strict, and includes all but practically inadmissible alternative actions.","9":"What are some examples of logical alternatives?","10":"However, in the (fairly unlikely) event that the logical alternative becomes a successful one rather than the action suggested by the UI, no further redress is given to the non-offending side.","11":"Are there any other interesting aspects about this article?","12":"The exception is when the player receives a UI inadvertently, as by overhearing remarks at other tables."}}
