I can answer your questions about Treaty of Beaufort.","1":"What happened at the ratification of the Treaty of Beaufort?","2":"The first \"Georgia v. South Carolina\" case in 1922 was regarding the islands in the Tugaloo, which was not explicitly named in the treaty because that was prior to its discovery.","3":"What happened with the dispute?","4":"Although the treaty prescribes the northerly branch as the boundary, and the Chattooga flows in a perpendicular direction (putting Rabun County, Georgia on the north side and Oconee County, South Carolina on the south), Georgia was given the islands as in the lower rivers.","5":"Was there any other instances of dispute?","6":"The second case of the same name was in 1989 and was more complex, regarding a Georgia island that had become a South Carolina peninsula due to dredging.","7":"What happened with that dispute?","8":"Although South Carolina was in adverse possession of the land, Georgia lost this case due to acquiescence, rather than as a matter of the treaty's wording.","9":"Was there any other instances of dispute?","10":"An 1876 case, \"South Carolina v. Georgia\", was about dredging for navigation around an island in the river at the port city of Savannah, and not about the boundary location.","11":"What happened with that dispute?","12":"Georgia won this case, allowing it to widen the shipping channel on the Savannah side at the expense of water flow to the South Carolina boundary side."}}
