I can answer your questions about Cosmic dust.","1":"What are the main types of dust in terms of cosmic dust?","2":"The arguments are that: given an observed typical grain diameter \"a\", the time for a grain to attain \"a\", and given the temperature of interstellar gas, it would take considerably longer than the age of the Universe for interstellar grains to form.","3":"Are there any other interesting aspects about this article?","4":"On the other hand, grains are seen to have recently formed in the vicinity of nearby stars, in nova and supernova ejecta, and in R Coronae Borealis variable stars which seem to eject discrete clouds containing both gas and dust.","5":"What are the different types of dust that have been seen?","6":"So mass loss from stars is unquestionably where the refractory cores of grains formed.","7":"What do you find to be the most interesting fact about this article?","8":"Most dust in the Solar System is highly processed dust, recycled from the material out of which the Solar System formed and subsequently collected in the planetesimals, and leftover solid material such as comets and asteroids, and reformed in each of those bodies' collisional lifetimes.","9":"What are the different elements of the dust?","10":"During the Solar System's formation history, the most abundant element was (and still is) H. The metallic elements: magnesium, silicon, and iron, which are the principal ingredients of rocky planets, condensed into solids at the highest temperatures of the planetary disk.","11":"Is there any other types of dust mentioned in the article?","12":"Some molecules such as CO, N, NH, and free oxygen, existed in a gas phase."}}
