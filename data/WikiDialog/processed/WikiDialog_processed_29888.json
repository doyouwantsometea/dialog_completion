I can answer your questions about GWAS Central.","1":"What companies sponsored GWAS Central?","2":"Corporate support was provided by Pfizer and GlaxoSmithKline.","3":"Are there any other interesting aspects about this article?","4":"The version released in November 2001 was renamed the Human Genome Variation database (HGVbase), as this was a better reflection of the scope of the database and its emphasis on collection from many different laboratories.","5":"Why was it renamed?","6":"In addition this also highlighted its new role as a central repository for data collection efforts in collaboration with the Human Genome Variation Society.","7":"Was it successful?","8":"HGVbase was scaled back in 2004 to simply provide an alternative representation of the full marker list from dbSNP, but development continued on its successor: the Human Genome Variation Genotype-to-Phenotype database (HGVbaseG2P), in many ways the natural evolution of HGVbase into a central database for summary-level genetic association data.","9":"Who else sponsored it?","10":"The work was originally funded by GlaxoSmithKline, the University of Leicester, and the European Community's Sixth Framework Programme ('INFOBIOMED' Network of Excellence), but the GEN2PHEN project became the main source of funds in 2008.","11":"What did it do?","12":"Early work in the project involved devising a powerful way of modeling phenotype and genotype- phenotype data, which itself was adopted and adapted to become the global standard Phenotype And Genotype Experiment Object model."}}
