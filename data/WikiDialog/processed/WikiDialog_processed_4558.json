I can answer your questions about War of 1812.","1":"When did the British relinquish their claim to British North America?","2":"They made the demand as late as the fall of 1814 at the peace conference, but they lost control of western Ontario in 1813 at key battles on and around Lake Erie.","3":"Why did they relinquish their claim?","4":"These battles destroyed the Indian confederacy which had been the main ally of the British in that region, weakening its negotiating position.","5":"What happened after they dropped their claim?","6":"Much of the area remained under British or British-allied Indian control until the end of the war, but the British dropped the demands.","7":"Is there anything else interesting?","8":"American expansion into the Northwest Territory had been obstructed by various Indian tribes since the end of the Revolution\u2014\u2014tribes who were supplied and encouraged by the British\u2014and Americans on the western frontier demanded that the British cease their interference.","9":"What did they do ?","10":"In June 1812, secretary of state James Monroe said, \"It might be necessary to invade Canada, not as an object of the war but as a means to bring it to a satisfactory conclusion.\" Speaker Henry Clay repeated the same argument.","11":"What was the outcome of the war?","12":"Canada was the only British possession that the Americans could easily attack, and capturing it would secure a bargaining chip which could then be used to force Britain to back down on the maritime issues."}}
