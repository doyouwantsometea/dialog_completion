I can answer your questions about Rockslide.","1":"what are the main causes of mass wasting?","2":"Therefore, anything that erodes or impedes the mountain's ability to resist this force may be one of the causes of mass-wasting.","3":"what are the other causes?","4":"While a major event such as an earthquake can cause large rockslides to happen, a majority of slides occur due to a combination of gravitational pressure and erosional influences.","5":"what are the main erosional influences?","6":"Amongst these erosional properties, water is arguably the most effective geologic agent that causes mass-wasting events to occur.","7":"how does water cause mass wasting?","8":"Water aids in the downslope movement of surface material by adding weight to the soil and by filling pores which tends to push apart individual grains, decreasing the resistance of the material to movement.","9":"Are there any other interesting aspects about this article?","10":"While these processes can cause a slide to happen, the speed and potential devastation of a rockslide is often determined by the severity of steepness presented by the failing slope.","11":"what is the most important fact in this article?","12":"With increasing populations in rural areas around the world, the hazards presented by potential rock slides are becoming more of a pressing issue moving forward."}}
