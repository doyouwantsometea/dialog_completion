I can answer your questions about Polar motion.","1":"What does the stability of the Polar Motion signal mean?","2":"Moreover, the observed stability of the annual component argues against any hypothesis of a variable Chandler resonance frequency.","3":"Are there any other interesting aspects about this article?","4":"One possible explanation for the observed frequency-amplitude behavior would be a forced, but slowly changing quasi-periodic excitation by interannually varying atmospheric dynamics.","5":"Is there any evidence to support this claim?","6":"Indeed, a quasi-14 month period has been found in coupled ocean-atmosphere general circulation models, and a regional 14-month signal in regional sea surface temperature has been observed.","7":"What would you argue against this stability?","8":"To describe such behavior theoretically, one starts with the Euler equation with pressure loading as in eq.(3), however now with a slowly changing frequency \u03bd, and replaces the frequency \u03bd by a complex frequency \u03bd + i\u03bd, where \u03bd simulates dissipation due to the elastic reaction of the Earth's interior.","9":"What does it mean for the polar motion?","10":"As in Figure 2, the result is the sum of a prograde and a retrograde circular polarized wave.","11":"Can you explain the significance of this?","12":"For frequencies \u03bd < 0.9 the retrograde wave can be neglected, and there remains the circular propagating prograde wave where the vector of polar motion moves on a circle in anti-clockwise direction."}}
