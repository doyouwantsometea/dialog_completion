I can answer your questions about D-Bus.","1":"What is the difference between D-Bus and other inter-process communication (IPC) mechanisms?","2":"In this regard, D-Bus is closer to an RPC mechanism than to a classic IPC mechanism, with its own type definition system and its own marshaling.","3":"What is the structure of the messages?","4":"The bus supports two modes of interchanging messages between a client and a service process: Every D-Bus message consists of a header and a body.","5":"What is in the message?","6":"The header is formed by several fields that identify the type of message, the sender, as well as information required to deliver the message to its recipient (destination bus name, object path, method or signal name, interface name, etc.). The body contains the data payload that the receiver process interprets \u2014for instance the input or output arguments.","7":"Are the messages in a special format?","8":"All the data is encoded in a well known binary format called the \"wire format\" which supports the serialization of various types, such as integers and floating-point numbers, strings, compound types, and so on, also referred to as marshaling.","9":"Is there anything else I should know about the messages?","10":"The D-Bus specification defines the wire protocol: how to build the D-Bus messages to be exchanged between processes within a D-Bus connection.","11":"What does it not define?","12":"However, it does not define the underlying transport method for delivering these messages."}}
