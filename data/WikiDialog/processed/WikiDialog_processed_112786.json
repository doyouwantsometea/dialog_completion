I can answer your questions about Galaxy.","1":"What is the Local Group of galaxies?","2":"The Local Group itself is a part of a cloud-like structure within the Virgo Supercluster, a large, extended structure of groups and clusters of galaxies centered on the Virgo Cluster.","3":"Are there any other interesting aspects about this article?","4":"And the Virgo Supercluster itself is a part of the Pisces-Cetus Supercluster Complex, a giant galaxy filament.","5":"What do you find most interesting about the local group of galaxies?","6":"The peak radiation of most stars lies in the visible spectrum, so the observation of the stars that form galaxies has been a major component of optical astronomy.","7":"Is there anything else that is interesting about this article?","8":"It is also a favorable portion of the spectrum for observing ionized H II regions, and for examining the distribution of dusty arms.","9":"What are some of the arms of the local group?","10":"The dust present in the interstellar medium is opaque to visual light.","11":"What else is the interstellar medium?","12":"It is more transparent to far-infrared, which can be used to observe the interior regions of giant molecular clouds and galactic cores in great detail."}}
