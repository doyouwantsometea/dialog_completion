I can answer your questions about Hyaluronidase.","1":"What are the difficulties in the study of hyaluronidase?","2":"Non-specific inhibitors (apigenin, sulfated glycosaminoglycans) or crude enzyme extracts have been used to test most hypotheses, making data difficult to interpret.","3":"Are there any other interesting aspects about this article?","4":"It has been hypothesized that, by helping degrade the ECM surrounding the tumor, hyaluronidases help cancer cells escape from primary tumor masses.","5":"Is there any evidence to support this?","6":"However, studies show that removal of hyaluronan from tumors prevents tumor invasion.","7":"What other difficulties are there in the study?","8":"Hyaluronidases are also thought to play a role in the process of angiogenesis, although most hyaluronidase preparations are contaminated with large amounts of angiogenic growth factors.","9":"Can you tell me more about the difficulties?","10":"Some bacteria, such as \"Staphylococcus aureus\", \"Streptococcus pyogenes\", and \"Clostridium perfringens\", produce hyaluronidase as a means of using hyaluronan as a carbon source.","11":"Is there any other difficulties?","12":"It is often speculated that \"Streptococcus\" and \"Staphylococcus\" pathogens use hyaluronidase as a virulence factor to destroy the polysaccharide that holds animal cells together, making it easier for the pathogen to spread through the tissues of the host organism, but no valid experimental data are available to support this hypothesis."}}
