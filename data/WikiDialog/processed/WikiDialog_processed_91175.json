I can answer your questions about Grammatical modifier.","1":"What is Grammatical Modifier?","2":"A head may have a number of modifiers, and these may include both premodifiers and postmodifiers.","3":"Are there any other interesting aspects about this article?","4":"For example: In this noun phrase, \"man\" is the head, \"nice\" and \"tall\" are premodifiers, and \"from Canada\" and \"whom you met\" are postmodifiers.","5":"Is there anything else noteable about pre-modifiers and post-modifiers?","6":"Notice that in English, simple adjectives are usually used as premodifiers, with occasional exceptions such as \"galore\" (which always appears after the noun) or the adjectives \"immemorial\" and \"martial\" in the phrases \"time immemorial\" and \"court martial\" (the latter comes from French, where most adjectives are postmodifiers).","7":"What other things can you tell me about the pre-modifiers?","8":"Sometimes placement of the adjective after the noun entails a change of meaning: compare \"a responsible person\" and \"the person responsible\", or \"the proper town\" (the appropriate town) and \"the town proper\" (the area of the town as properly defined).","9":"What other things can you tell me about the post-modifiers?","10":"It is sometimes possible for a modifier to be separated from its head by other words, as in \" The man came who you bumped into in the street yesterday\", where the relative clause \"who...yesterday\" is separated from the word it modifies (\"man\") by the word \"came\".","11":"Is there anything else noteable about the post-modifiers?","12":"This type of situation is especially likely in languages with free word order."}}
