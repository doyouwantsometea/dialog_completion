I can answer your questions about Generic property.","1":"What is the generic property?","2":"Generic property In mathematics, properties that hold for \"typical\" examples are called generic properties.","3":"can you give me an example?","4":"For instance, a generic property of a class of functions is one that is true of \"almost all\" of those functions, as in the statements, \"A generic polynomial does not have a root at zero,\" or \"A generic square matrix is invertible.\" As another example, a generic property of a space is a property that holds at \"almost all\" points of the space, as in the statement, \" If \"f\" : \"M\" \u2192 \"N\" is a smooth function between smooth manifolds, then a generic point of \"N\" is not a critical value of \"f\".\" (This is by Sard's theorem.)","5":"Are there any other interesting aspects about this article?","6":"There are many different notions of \"generic\" (what is meant by \"almost all\") in mathematics, with corresponding dual notions of \"almost none\" (negligible set); the two main classes are: There are several natural examples where those notions are not equal.","7":"what are some examples?","8":"For instance, the set of Liouville numbers is generic in the topological sense, but has Lebesgue measure zero.","9":"what is the topological sense?","10":"In measure theory, a generic property is one that holds almost everywhere.","11":"what is the dual concept?","12":"The dual concept is a null set, that is, a set of measure zero."}}
