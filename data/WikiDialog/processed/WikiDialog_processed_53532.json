I can answer your questions about Australian cricket team in England in 1902.","1":"What was the Fifth Test against England in terms of the Australian cricket team in England in 1902?","2":"Neville Cardus, who later wrote an article on the game he had watched as a 13-year-old, said: \"The match at the end seemed to get right out of the control of the men that were making it; it seemed to take on a being of its own, a volition of its own, and the mightiest cricketers in the land looked as though they were in the grip of a power of which they could feel the presence but whose ends they could not understand.\" Australia, who went in unchanged from the Third Test, won the toss and batted first against an England side where Lionel Palairet, Ranjitsinhji, Lockwood and Fred Tate had replaced Fry, Hirst, Jessop and Barnes.","3":"Are there any other interesting aspects about this article?","4":"The Sussex bowler Tate was given his Test debut, but it was to be his only one; nevertheless, the match is known as \"Tate's match\".","5":"Why is it known as Tate's match?","6":"He dropped a crucial catch, and was last man out when England heeded only four more runs to win.","7":"What happened after that?","8":"In the 1903 Wisden, it is claimed that leaving out Hirst for Tate was a \"blunder\", though the decision was inspired by a rain-affected wicket.","9":"Was anyone else dropped out of the team?","10":"Likewise, not selecting Jessop was called \"a mistake\".","11":"Did they win the match?","12":"According to Barker and Rosenwater England did well to get so close to winning as they did, Australia gaining a large advantage from batting first."}}
