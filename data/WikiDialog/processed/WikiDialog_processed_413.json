I can answer your questions about Axiom of choice.","1":"What is meant by the axiom of choice?","2":"Bertrand Russell coined an analogy: for any (even infinite) collection of pairs of shoes, one can pick out the left shoe from each pair to obtain an appropriate selection; this makes it possible to directly define a choice function.","3":"Are there any other interesting aspects about this article?","4":"For an \"infinite\" collection of pairs of socks (assumed to have no distinguishing features), there is no obvious way to make a function that selects one sock from each pair, without invoking the axiom of choice.","5":"Is there anything else noteable about the axiom of choice?","6":"Although originally controversial, the axiom of choice is now used without reservation by most mathematicians, and it is included in the standard form of axiomatic set theory, Zermelo\u2013Fraenkel set theory with the axiom of choice (ZFC).","7":"Why is it used?","8":"One motivation for this use is that a number of generally accepted mathematical results, such as Tychonoff's theorem, require the axiom of choice for their proofs.","9":"Is there anything else that is interesting?","10":"Contemporary set theorists also study axioms that are not compatible with the axiom of choice, such as the axiom of determinacy.","11":"Is it compatible with other axioms?","12":"The axiom of choice is avoided in some varieties of constructive mathematics, although there are varieties of constructive mathematics in which the axiom of choice is embraced."}}
