I can answer your questions about Constant fraction discriminator.","1":"What is the difference between a CFT and an IFFT?","2":"Constant fraction discriminator A constant fraction discriminator (CFD) is an electronic signal processing device, designed to mimic the mathematical operation of finding a maximum of a pulse by finding the zero of its slope.","3":"Why is the CFT used?","4":"Some signals do not have a sharp maximum, but short rise times formula_1.","5":"Where else is the CFT used?","6":"Typical input signals for CFDs are pulses from plastic scintillation counters, such as those used for lifetime measurement in positron annihilation experiments.","7":"What about the IFFT?","8":"The scintillator pulses have identical rise times that are much longer than the desired temporal resolution.","9":"What are some other interesting aspects of this article?","10":"This forbids simple threshold triggering, which causes a dependence of the trigger time on the signal's peak height, an effect called \"time walk\" (see diagram).","11":"Any other interesting information?","12":"Identical rise times and peak shapes permit triggering not on a fixed threshold but on a \"constant fraction\" of the total peak height, yielding trigger times independent from peak heights."}}
