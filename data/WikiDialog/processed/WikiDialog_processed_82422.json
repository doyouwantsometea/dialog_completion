I can answer your questions about Edward the Elder.","1":"What did Edward the Elder accomplish?","2":"By the end of the 910s he ruled Wessex, Mercia and East Anglia, and only Northumbria remained under Viking rule.","3":"When did Edward the Elder die?","4":"In 924 he faced a Mercian and Welsh revolt at Chester, and after putting it down he died at Farndon in Cheshire on 17 July 924.","5":"Are there any other interesting aspects about this article?","6":"He was succeeded by his eldest son \u00c6thelstan. Edward was admired by medieval chroniclers, and in the view of William of Malmesbury, he was \"much inferior to his father in the cultivation of letters\" but \"incomparably more glorious in the power of his rule\".","7":"Is there anything else of significance?","8":"He was largely ignored by modern historians until the 1990s, and Nick Higham described him as \"perhaps the most neglected of English kings\", partly because few primary sources for his reign survive.","9":"What happened in the 1990s?","10":"His reputation rose in the late twentieth century and he is now seen as destroying the power of the Vikings in southern England while laying the foundations for a south-centred united English kingdom.","11":"Is there anything else of note?","12":"Mercia was the dominant kingdom in southern England in the eighth century and maintained its position until it suffered a decisive defeat by Wessex at the Battle of Ellandun in 825."}}
