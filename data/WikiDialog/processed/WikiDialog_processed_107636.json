I can answer your questions about Dietary biology of the golden eagle.","1":"What is the importance of rodents in the golden eagle's diet?","2":"In fact, it makes up a significant portion (sometimes a majority) of the diet in winter, when ground squirrels are in hibernation and rabbits and hares tend to be at population lows.","3":"Are there any other interesting aspects about this article?","4":"In the Greater Yellowstone area, the golden eagle was one of the most frequent scavengers to attend wolf kill-sites in winter but, unlike common ravens (\"Corvus corax\") and bald eagles, were not frequent at kills left out by human hunters.","5":"What did you find most interesting about the article?","6":"In many parts of the range (i.e. Alberta, Scotland, Spain, etc.) carrion was readily fed to the young during the breeding season.","7":"Did they only eat rodents?","8":"Golden eagles are opportunists and virtually any animal of a reasonable size may be predated.","9":"What else did they eat?","10":"Well over 400 species of vertebrate have been recorded as prey.","11":"Did they choose between any other animals?","12":"Prey selection is largely determined by the local availability and abundance of prey species."}}
