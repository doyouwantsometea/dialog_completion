I can answer your questions about HKS-1.","1":"What are the main characteristics of the HKS-1?","2":"HKS-1 The HKS-1 was a German 19 span high performance two seat sailplane, designed around 1950 to use recent advances in laminar flow airfoils.","3":"what are the characteristics of the plane?","4":"To avoid premature transition from laminar flow caused by surface interruptions, the HKS-1 dispensed with hinged ailerons, flaps and spoilers and replaced them with a flexible trailing edge.","5":"was the plane successful?","6":"Two were built, setting several records.","7":"Are there any other interesting aspects about this article?","8":"Any aerodynamic approach that decreased wing drag was welcomed by sailplane designers, who reduced lift-induced drag with high aspect ratio wings.","9":"what other drag was there?","10":"Profile drag was reduced by maintaining laminar flow over as much of the wing as possible.","11":"was it easy to do?","12":"The NACA 6-series profiles of the late 1930s suggested that laminar flow might be maintained as far back as 70% chord, though military experience during World War II showed that much less ambitious targets were hard to achieve with riveted surfaces on wings with gaps for control surfaces, armament, service hatches etc."}}
