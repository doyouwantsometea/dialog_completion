I can answer your questions about Greatest Hits on Monument.","1":"What was the critical reception of the album Greatest Hits on Monument?","2":"Allmusic reviewer Stephen Thomas Erlewine gave the album two and a half out five stars, saying that fans did not like these recordings, stating \"It's easy to see why fans of pure country -- the kind of music Connie Smith effortlessly made during the '60s -- are not crazy about her late-'70s recordings for Monument.","3":"What are some of the songs on the album?","4":"Once she signed with the label in 1977, country was pretty much a thing of the past for her, as she delved not just into country-pop, but into heavily produced adult contemporary ballads and big, shiny disco-influenced pop numbers -- surely not the kind of thing to please purists. \" Erlewine also said that he did not find the music similar to that of the Urban Cowboy movement in country music around that time, saying, \"... it's not a very good showcase for her talents, nor is it very good as crossover pop -- it's too square and middle of the road, making the urban cowboy bubbling up at the time seem risky and edgy.\" Slipcue.com also reviewed the album and was also not pleased with it.","5":"What did Slipcue.com say about the album?","6":"The website stated that there was \"better material buried on her various late-'70s Monument LPs\" (\"Pure Connie Smith\" and \"New Horizons\").","7":"Did the critics have any other reviews of the album?","8":"The website concluded that the music was, \"Definitely not her best material, and also not well-chosen from this particular era...","9":"What other reviews did the album receive?","10":"You're much better off searching out the old, original albums.\""}}
