I can answer your questions about Extrachromosomal DNA.","1":"What is the difference between mtDNA and ncRNA?","2":"While most of the 3-base sequences in the mtDNA of these organisms do code for the same amino acids as those of the nuclear genetic code, there are some mtDNA sequences that code for amino acids different from those of their nuclear DNA counterparts.","3":"Are there any other interesting aspects about this article?","4":"The coding differences are thought to be a result of chemical modifications in the transfer RNAs that interact with the messenger RNAs produced as a result of transcribing the mtDNA sequences.","5":"Do all plants have extrachromosomal DNA?","6":"Eukaryotic chloroplasts, as well as the other plant plastids, also contain extrachromosomal DNA molecules.","7":"Is the DNA harmful to the plant?","8":"Most chloroplasts house all of their genetic material in a single ringed chromosome, however in some species there is evidence of multiple smaller ringed plasmids.","9":"Can you tell me more about the ringed plasmids?","10":"A recent theory that questions the current standard model of ring shaped chloroplast DNA (cpDNA), suggests that cpDNA may more commonly take a linear shape.","11":"Is there anything else that is important to know about the cpDNA?","12":"A single molecule of cpDNA can contain anywhere from 100-200 genes and varies in size from species to species."}}
