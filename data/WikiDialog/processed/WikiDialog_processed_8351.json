I can answer your questions about Granger causality.","1":"What is Granger causality?","2":"If the prediction is made worse by excluding the target neuron, then we say it has a \u201cg-causal\u201d relationship with the current neuron.","3":"Are there any other interesting aspects about this article?","4":"Previous Granger-causality methods could only operate on continuous-valued data so the analysis of neural spike train recordings involved transformations that ultimately altered the stochastic properties of the data, indirectly altering the validity of the conclusions that could be drawn from it.","5":"What did the new framework do?","6":"In 2011, however, a new general-purpose Granger-causality framework was proposed that could directly operate on any modality, including neural-spike trains.","7":"How did it work?","8":"Neural spike train data can be modeled as a point-process.","9":"What is a point process?","10":"A temporal point process is a stochastic time-series of binary events that occurs in continuous time.","11":"What can you tell me about it?","12":"It can only take on two values at each point in time, indicating whether or not an event has actually occurred."}}
