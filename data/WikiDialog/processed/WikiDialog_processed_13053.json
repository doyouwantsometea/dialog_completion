I can answer your questions about Mesolithic.","1":"What are the different Mesolithic types?","2":"As \"Mesolithic\" suggests an intermediate period, followed by the Neolithic, some authors prefer the term \"Epipaleolithic\" for hunter-gatherer cultures who are not succeeded by agricultural traditions, reserving \"Mesolithic\" for cultures who are clearly succeeded by the Neolithic Revolution, such as the Natufian culture.","3":"Are there any other interesting aspects about this article?","4":"Other authors use \"Mesolithic\" as a generic term for post-LGM hunter-gatherer cultures, whether they are transitional towards agriculture or not.","5":"Why do they argue about the terms?","6":"In addition, terminology appears to differ between archaeological sub-disciplines, with \"Mesolithic\" being widely used in European archaeology, while \"Epipalaeolithic\" is more common in Near Eastern archaeology.","7":"What are some of the examples of the types of Mesolithic?","8":"The Balkan Mesolithic begins around 15,000 years ago.","9":"What other types are there?","10":"In Western Europe, the Early Mesolithic, or Azilian, begins about 14,000 years ago, in the Franco-Cantabrian region of northern Spain and southern France.","11":"Are there any other interesting aspects about this article?","12":"In other parts of Europe, the Mesolithic begins by 11,500 years ago (the beginning Holocene), and it ends with the introduction of farming, depending on the region between c. 8,500 and 5,500 years ago."}}
