I can answer your questions about \u00d6sterl\u00e5nggatan.","1":"What is the main building of  \u2047 sterl \u2047 nggatan?","2":"Behind the front door is an entrance hall featuring a richly profiled sandstone column carrying a cross-vault.","3":"Are there any other interesting aspects about this article?","4":"The fa\u00e7ade of Number 24 dates back to 1862, the shutters and wooden panels from that time however replaced by the rough-cast plaster probably in 1945, and the windows enlarged since.","5":"What happened in 1973?","6":"The rusticated fa\u00e7ade of Number 26 dates back to the enlargement in 1846, at the time it was however perfectly symmetric, a balance manipulated in 1973 when the enlarged opening and wooden panel of the restaurant entrance was added.","7":"Is there anything else you can share about the main building?","8":"The northern door, still featuring some original details, gives a fair impression of what the fa\u00e7ade looked like in the 19th century.","9":"Is there anything else you can share about the history of the building?","10":"The fa\u00e7ade of Number 28, arguably one of the oldest still existent residential properties in Stockholm, is mostly from 1874 with some details replaced in 1969. Seemingly old-fashion, the fa\u00e7ade of Number 39-41 had both a cornice and channelled rustication until 1967, presumably similar to that of N.26, while the portal and doors are from the late 19th century.","11":"What else can you share about the neighborhood?","12":"Like most of the blocks on this side of the street, this one is standing on land fillings containing historical layers stretching down more than 15 metres, the sliding and compression of which have resulted in the buildings sinking with about 0.5 metres per century, and the 6\u2013 to 8-metre-long piling from the 15th century leaning some 20 degrees towards the waterfront."}}
