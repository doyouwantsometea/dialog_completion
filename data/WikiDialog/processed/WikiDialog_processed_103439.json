I can answer your questions about Endoscopic thoracic sympathectomy.","1":"What are the complications of Endoscopic thoracic sympathectomy?","2":"Pneumothorax (collapsed lung) can occur (2% of patients).","3":"What other complications are there?","4":"Compensatory hyperhidrosis (or reflex hyperhidrosis) is common over the long term.","5":"Is it always severe?","6":"The rates of severe compensatory sweating vary widely between studies, ranging from as high as 92% of patients.","7":"Is there anything else I should know about the complications?","8":"Of those patients that develop this side effect, about a quarter in one study said it was a major and disabling problem.","9":"Can you tell me more about the severe side effects?","10":"A severe possible consequence of thoracic sympathectomy is corposcindosis (split-body syndrome), in which the patient feels that he or she is living in two separate bodies, because sympathetic nerve function has been divided into two distinct regions, one dead, and the other hyperactive.","11":"Are there any other severe side effects?","12":"Additionally, the following side effects have all been reported by patients: Chronic muscular pain, numbness and weakness of the limbs, Horner's Syndrome, anhidrosis (inability to sweat), hyperthermia (exacerbated by anhidrosis and systemic thermoregulatory dysfunction), neuralgia, paraesthesia, fatigue and amotivationality, breathing difficulties, substantially diminished physiological\/chemical reaction to internal and environmental stimuli, somatosensory malfunction, aberrant physiological reaction to stress and exertion, Raynaud\u2019s disease (albeit a possible indication for surgery), reflex hyperhidrosis, altered\/erratic blood pressure and circulation, defective fight or flight response system, loss of adrenaline, eczema and other skin conditions resulting from exceptionally dry skin, rhinitis, gustatory sweating (also known as Frey's syndrome)."}}
