I can answer your questions about Extended theories of gravity.","1":"What is meant by extended theories of gravity?","2":"Extended theories of gravity Extended theories of gravity are alternative theories of gravity developed from the exact starting points investigated first by Einstein and Hilbert.","3":"Are there any other interesting aspects about this article?","4":"These are theories describing gravity, which are metric theory, \"a linear connection\" or related affine theories, or metric-affine gravitation theory.","5":"Can you explain that a little more?","6":"Rather than trying to discover correct calculations for the matter side of the Einstein field equations; which include inflation, dark energy, dark matter, large-scale structure, and possibly quantum gravity; it is proposed, instead, to change the gravitational side of the equation.","7":"What are some of the examples of the theories?","8":"One such theory is also an extension to general relativity and Newton's Universal gravity law (formula_1), first proposed in 2010 by the Mexican astronomers Xavier Hern\u00e1ndez Doring, Sergio Mendoza Ramos et al., researchers at the Astronomy Institute, at the National Autonomous University of Mexico.","9":"Was it well received?","10":"This theory is in accordance with observations of kinematics of the solar system, extended binary stars, and all types of galaxies and galactic groups and clouds.","11":"Did it have any issues?","12":"It also reproduces the gravitational lensing effect with out the need of postulating dark matter."}}
