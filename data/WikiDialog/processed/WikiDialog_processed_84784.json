I can answer your questions about Geometric algebra.","1":"what is the difference between a scalar product and a duo?","2":"have the same expression formula_288 as rotation in Euclidean space, where formula_289 is the bivector generated by the time and the space directions involved, whereas in the Euclidean case it is the bivector generated by the two space directions, strengthening the \"analogy\" to almost identity.","3":"Are there any other interesting aspects about this article?","4":"The Dirac matrices are a representation of formula_90, showing the equivalence with matrix representations used by physicists.","5":"What are some of the models?","6":"The first model here is formula_291, the GA version of homogeneous coordinates used in projective geometry.","7":"Is there anything else that is important?","8":"Here a vector represents a point and an outer product of vectors an oriented length yet we may work with the algebra in just the same way as in formula_88.","9":"Is there anything else that is interesting?","10":"However, a useful inner product cannot be defined in the space and so there is no geometric product either leaving only outer product and non-metric uses of duality such as meet and join.","11":"Is there any other models?","12":"Nevertheless, there has been investigation of 4-dimensional alternatives to the full 5-dimensional CGA for limited geometries such as rigid body movements."}}
