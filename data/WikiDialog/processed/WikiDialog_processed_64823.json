I can answer your questions about Polarization (waves).","1":"how to make circular polarization of light","2":"Thus is circular polarization created in practice, starting with linearly polarized light and employing a quarter-wave plate to introduce such a phase shift. The result of two such phase-shifted components in causing a rotating electric field vector is depicted in the animation on the right.","3":"what can you tell me about the result","4":"Note that circular or elliptical polarization can involve either a clockwise or counterclockwise rotation of the field.","5":"what are the properties","6":"These correspond to distinct polarization states, such as the two circular polarizations shown above.","7":"what about the axes","8":"Of course the orientation of the \"x\" and \"y\" axes used in this description is arbitrary.","9":"why are they used","10":"The choice of such a coordinate system and viewing the polarization ellipse in terms of the \"x\" and \"y\" polarization components, corresponds to the definition of the Jones vector (below) in terms of those basis polarizations.","11":"what about the system","12":"One would typically choose axes to suit a particular problem such as \"x\" being in the plane of incidence."}}
