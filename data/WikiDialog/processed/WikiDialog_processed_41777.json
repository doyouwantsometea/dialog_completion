I can answer your questions about False consensus effect.","1":"What is meant by the false consensus effect?","2":"On the other hand, someone in the same situation who makes an internal attribution (perhaps a film aficionado who is well-aware of his or her especially high standards) will realize the subjectivity of the experience and will be drawn to the opposite conclusion; their estimation of consensus with their experience will be much lower.","3":"Are there any other interesting aspects about this article?","4":"Although they result in two opposite outcomes, both paths of attribution rely on an initial assumption which then leads to a \"logical\" conclusion.","5":"What is the most important aspect of this effect?","6":"By this logic, then, it can be said that the false-consensus effect is really a reflection of the fundamental attribution error (specifically the actor-observer bias), in which people prefer external\/situational attributions over internal\/dispositional ones to justify their own behaviors.","7":"Has further study been done on this effect?","8":"In a study done by Fox, Yinon, and Mayraz, researchers were attempting to determine whether or not the levels of the false-consensus effect changed in different age groups.","9":"What did they do in that study?","10":"In order to come to a conclusion, it was necessary for the researchers to split their participants into four different age groups.","11":"What other aspects of the study are notable?","12":"Two hundred participants were used, and gender was not considered to be a factor."}}
