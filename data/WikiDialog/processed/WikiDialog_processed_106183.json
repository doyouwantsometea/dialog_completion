I can answer your questions about Broken Hearts.","1":"What was the running gag with the original Broken Hearts?","2":"Later, however, Scott quoted a joke by F. C. Burnand about going to see \"Broken Parts\".","3":"Are there any other interesting aspects about this article?","4":"Gilbert was hurt and called Scott's remark \"Most offensive, and likely to cause a great deal of injury to my play.\" The play opened on 9 December 1875, running for three months until 10 March 1875, receiving around 79 performances.","5":"Was it a hit?","6":"It was generally well reviewed, although it did not catch on with audiences and was not a financial success, but it remained one of Gilbert's two favourites among all the plays he had written (the other was \"Gretchen\", an adaptation of the Faust legend).","7":"What was the most interesting part for you?","8":"Later, Gilbert had a line from the play engraved on the sun-dial at his home, Grim's Dyke: \"even Time is hastening to its end.\" At the time \"Broken Hearts\" was written, Gilbert and Sullivan had already produced their hit one-act comic opera \"Trial by Jury\" as well as their burlesque-style opera, \"Thespis\", and their producer Richard D'Oyly Carte was seeking funding to bring them together again.","9":"Did they ever come back together?","10":"But funding was slow in coming, and both Gilbert and Arthur Sullivan were still producing a considerable amount of work separately: Gilbert produced two other plays that year, for instance.","11":"What did they do next?","12":"However, four years after \"Broken Hearts\", \"H.M.S. Pinafore\" would become such a runaway hit that Gilbert would only produce five theatrical works away from Sullivan in the eleven years following."}}
