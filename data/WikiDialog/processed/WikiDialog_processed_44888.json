I can answer your questions about Utricularia inflata.","1":"What is the potential impact of Utricularia inflata on the environment?","2":"In this case, \"U. inflata\" could indirectly change the biogeochemical cycle in the Adirondack lakes by hindering the growth of native isoetid macrophytes and subsequently having a negative effect on the proper balance of sediment chemistry.","3":"Are there any other interesting aspects about this article?","4":"The consequence of this may include enhanced growth of algae and other changes to the ecology of the freshwater ecosystems that it may invade.","5":"Where did U. inflata invade?","6":"Even earlier than the collections in Massachusetts and New York, a population of \"U. inflata\" was located in Horseshoe Lake in Kitsap County, Washington in 1980.","7":"Was Washington effected by U. inflata?","8":"Since then, further specimens of \"U. inflata\" have been recorded from other Puget Sound area lakes in Kitsap, Mason, Pierce, and Thurston counties.","9":"What other impact did U. inflata have on the environment?","10":"One population has even been recorded from the more southern Silver Lake in Cowlitz County.","11":"Was there anything to be done about U. inflata?","12":"Information on this species in Washington State provided by the state's Department of Ecology includes a statement that \"U. inflata\"'s presence in Horseshoe Lake was \"probably the result of a discarded aquarium."}}
