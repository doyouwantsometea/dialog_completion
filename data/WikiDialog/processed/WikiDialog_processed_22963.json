I can answer your questions about MOSAIC threat assessment systems.","1":"What is the biggest strength of the MOSAIC threat assessment system?","2":"The consistent way in which MOSAIC methodically guides an evaluation and documents the findings is what sets it apart.","3":"what are the weaknesses of the system?","4":"In fact, since it places less emphasis on the presence (or lack) of a direct threat, as well as any denials of intent that are uttered in an interview, MOSAIC forces the investigator to look at all of the factors present in the situation.","5":"what is an example of the system in use?","6":"In the mid-nineties, Ted Calhoun of the United States Marshals Service undertook a research project about threats and attacks on federal judges.","7":"what did the research yield?","8":"He studied and analyzed more than 3,000 cases of threats against Federal judges and prosecutors.","9":"Are there any other interesting aspects about this article?","10":"Calhoun felt that these threats \u2013 often made by people whose lives were directly affected by the court \u2013 were inherently different from threats to other public figures, with whom the threateners rarely had any real contact.","11":"was the system improved?","12":"The marshals service selected the MOSAIC method for applying Calhoun's research, and Gavin de Becker & Associates was commissioned to co-develop a new system: MOSAIC for Assessment of Threats to Judges (MAJ)."}}
