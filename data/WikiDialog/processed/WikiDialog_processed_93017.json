I can answer your questions about Mask (computing).","1":"What is the meaning of Mask in computer science?","2":"Mask (computing) In computer science, a mask or bitmask is data that is used for bitwise operations, particularly in a bit field.","3":"what is the significance of mask in computer science?","4":"Using a mask, multiple bits in a byte, nibble, word etc. can be set either on, off or inverted from on to off (or vice versa) in a single bitwise operation.","5":"what are the different operations performed by mask?","6":"To turn certain bits on, the bitwise codice_2 operation can be used, following the principle that codice_3 and codice_4. Therefore, to make sure a bit is on, codice_2 can be used with a codice_1.","7":"what other operations are performed by mask?","8":"To leave a bit unchanged, codice_2 is used with a codice_8.","9":"what is the example of mask?","10":"Example: Masking \"on\" the higher nibble (bits 4, 5, 6, 7) the lower nibble (bits 0, 1, 2, 3) unchanged.","11":"what else is known about mask?","12":"More often in practice bits are \"masked \"off\"\" (or masked to codice_8) than \"masked \"on\"\" (or masked to codice_1)."}}
