Decisions, Texts and Tables, is left to the manufacturers themselves.","5":"Are there any other interesting aspects about this article?","6":"Headspace is not checked, even on rimless cartridges with taper.","7":"why is that?","8":"The view is that in the very unlikely case (according to the current quality standards) the cartridge is too long, once pressed by the bolt, the pressure will rise too high causing rejection.","9":"what about if it's too short?","10":"If it is too short, firing will fail also causing rejection.","11":"what other things are checked?","12":"The manufacturers do make velocity measurements, however."}}
