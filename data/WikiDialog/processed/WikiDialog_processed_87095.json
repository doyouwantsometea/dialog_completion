I can answer your questions about Octopamine (neurotransmitter).","1":"What is the function of Octopamine in the brain?","2":"Octopamine was first discovered by Italian scientist Vittorio Erspamer in 1948 in the salivary glands of the octopus and has since been found to act as a neurotransmitter, neurohormone and neuromodulator in invertebrates.","3":"is there any intresting information on the article?","4":"Although Erspamer discovered its natural occurrence and named it, octopamine had actually existed for many years as a pharmaceutical product.","5":"what is the importance of octopamine?","6":"It is widely used in energy-demanding behaviors by all insects, crustaceans (crabs, lobsters, crayfish), and spiders.","7":"what kind of energy-demanding behaviors?","8":"Such behaviors include flying, egg-laying, and jumping.","9":"is there any other functions of octopamine?","10":"Octopamine acts as the insect equivalent of norepinephrine and has been implicated in regulating aggression in invertebrates, with different effects on different species.","11":"what is the mecanism of action of octopamine?","12":"Studies have shown that reducing the neurotransmitter octopamine and preventing coding of tyramine beta hydroxylase (an enzyme that converts tyramine to octopamine) decreases aggression in Drosophila without influencing other behaviors."}}
