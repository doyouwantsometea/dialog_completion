I can answer your questions about Gnathostomata.","1":"What was the most recent evolution of Gnathostomata?","2":"Newer research suggests that a branch of Placoderms was most likely the ancestor of present-day gnathostomes.","3":"Are there any other interesting aspects about this article?","4":"A 419-million-year-old fossil of a placoderm named \"Entelognathus\" had a bony skeleton and anatomical details associated with cartilaginous and bony fish, demonstrating that the absence of a bony skeleton in Chondrichthyes is a derived trait.","5":"What other things have been known to happen with Gnathostomata?","6":"The fossil findings of primitive bony fishes such as \"Guiyu oneiros\" and \"Psarolepis\", which lived contemporaneously with \"Entelognathus\" and had pelvic girdles more in common with placoderms than with other bony fish, show that it was a relative rather than a direct ancestor of the extant gnathostomes.","7":"What would you say is the most recent evolution?","8":"It also indicates that spiny sharks and Chondrichthyes represent a single sister group to the bony fishes.","9":"What other findings were made?","10":"Fossils findings of juvenile placoderms, which had true teeth that grew on the surface of the jawbone and had no roots, making it impossible to replace or regrow as they broke or wore down as they grew older, proves the common ancestor of all gnathostomes had teeth and place the origin of teeth along with, or soon after, the evolution of jaws.","11":"What other interesting aspects are there?","12":"Late Ordovician-aged microfossils of what have been identified as scales of either acanthodians or \"shark-like fishes\", may mark Gnathostomata's first appearance in the fossil record."}}
