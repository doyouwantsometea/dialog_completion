I can answer your questions about Alcubierre drive.","1":"What are the main problems with the Alcubierre drive?","2":"Moreover, according to Serguei Krasnikov, generating a bubble in a previously flat space for a \"one-way\" FTL trip requires forcing the exotic matter to move at local faster-than-light speeds, something that would require the existence of tachyons, although Krasnikov also notes that when the spacetime is not flat from the outset, a similar result could be achieved without tachyons by placing in advance some devices along the travel path and programming them to come into operation at preassigned moments and to operate in a preassigned manner.","3":"Are there any other interesting aspects about this article?","4":"Some suggested methods avoid the problem of tachyonic motion, but would probably generate a naked singularity at the front of the bubble.","5":"Could you explain the significance of the naked singularity?","6":"Allen Everett and Thomas Roman comment on Krasnikov's finding: [The finding] does not mean that Alcubierre bubbles, if it were possible to create them, could not be used as a means of superluminal travel.","7":"What does it mean then?","8":"It only means that the actions required to change the metric and create the bubble must be taken beforehand by some observer whose forward light cone contains the entire trajectory of the bubble.","9":"Is there an example of the drive in action?","10":"For example, if one wanted to travel to Deneb (2,600 light years away) and arrive less than 2,600 years in the future according to external clocks, it would be required that someone had already begun work on warping the space from Earth to Deneb at least 2,600 years ago:"}}
