I can answer your questions about EndeavourOS.","1":"What is EndeavourOS?","2":"Since RebornOS, another Antergos derivative, already took the road Antergos travelled, the team came up with the idea to create an almost close to Arch system with a friendly and supportive community at its core.","3":"What is the most important feature of EndeavourOS?","4":"This meant discarding preinstalled apps and packages, like a email client or an office suite from the repository and making the terminal the visible heart of the system again.","5":"Are there any other interesting aspects about this article?","6":"This plan received mixed reviews within the community, especially the exclusion of Pamac, a popular GUI wrapper for Pacman the packagemanager for Arch-Linux, in the repo.","7":"What is the most important fact in this article?","8":"The main idea is to give the user freedom to create a system to their specific needs and getting to learn the system by installing the desired packages themselves, with the help from the friendly and warm community.","9":"What else did you find interesting?","10":"With their new philosophy, the team has made a conscious choice to target a specific audience that either already knew Arch Linux, but wanted a fast and simple install, or the \"distro-hoppers\" who already had some Linux knowledge but wanted to explore Arch Linux without the technical install procedure of the base distribution.","11":"Does it have any other features?","12":"By not shipping a GUI package manager by default, the team is convinced that the user will be more aware of what they are installing and therefore have more control on the installed system."}}
