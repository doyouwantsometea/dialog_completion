I can answer your questions about Microplate.","1":"What is the purpose of the Microplate?","2":"The surfaces of these products are modified using an oxygen plasma discharge to make their surfaces more hydrophilic so that it becomes easier for adherent cells to grow on the surface which would otherwise be strongly hydrophobic.","3":"Are there any other interesting aspects about this article?","4":"A number of companies have developed robots to specifically handle microplates.","5":"What do the robots do?","6":"These robots may be liquid handlers which aspirate or dispense liquid samples from and to these plates, or \"plate movers\" which transport them between instruments, plate stackers which store microplates during these processes, plate hotels for longer term storage, plate washers for processing plates, plate thermal sealers for applying heat seals, de-sealers for removing heat seals, or microplate incubators to ensure constant temperature during testing.","7":"What other uses are there for the microplates?","8":"Instrument companies have designed plate readers which can detect specific biological, chemical or physical events in samples stored in these plates.","9":"Are the plates expensive?","10":"Microtiter are manufactured in a variety of materials.","11":"What are some of the materials?","12":"The most common is polystyrene, used for most optical detection microplates."}}
