I can answer your questions about Servo (radio control).","1":"What is the difference between PWM and servo?","2":"The two types are both PWM because the servo responds to the width of the pulse.","3":"what is the order of operations?","4":"However, in the first case a servo may also be sensitive to pulse order.","5":"how many wires are there?","6":"The servo is controlled by three wires: ground, power, and control.","7":"what is the function of the third wire?","8":"The servo will move based on the pulses sent over the control wire, which set the angle of the actuator arm.","9":"how fast does the servo respond?","10":"The servo expects a pulse every 20 ms in order to gain correct information about the angle.","11":"what is the range of motion?","12":"The width of the servo pulse dictates the range of the servo's angular motion."}}
