I can answer your questions about Bacterial taxonomy.","1":"What are the different steps in the process of bacterial identification?","2":"The quickest way to identify to match an isolated strain to a species or genus today is done by amplifying it's 16S gene with universal primers and sequence the 1.4kb amplicon and submit it to a specialised web-based identification database, namely either Ribosomal Database Project, which align the sequence to other 16S sequences using infernal, a secondary structure bases global alignment, or ARB SILVA, which aligns sequences via SINA (SILVA incremental aligner), which does a local alignment of a seed and extends it .","3":"Are there any other interesting aspects about this article?","4":"Several identification methods exists:  The minimal standards for describing a new species depend on which group the species belongs to.","5":"What is the importance of bacterial identification?","6":"\"c.f.\" Candidatus is a component of the taxonomic name for a bacterium that cannot be maintained in a Bacteriology Culture Collection.","7":"What do you find most interesting about this article?","8":"It is an interim taxonomic status for noncultivable organisms. e.g. \"Candidatus Pelagibacter ubique\" Bacteria divide asexually and for the most part do not show regionalisms (\"Everything is everywhere\"), therefore the concept of species, which works best for animals, becomes entirely a matter of judgement.","9":"Is there any other interesting information I should know?","10":"The number of named species of bacteria and archaea (approximately 13,000) is surprisingly small considering their early evolution, genetic diversity and residence in all ecosystems.","11":"Why is there a small number of named species?","12":"The reason for this is the differences in species concepts between the \"bacteria\" and macro-organisms, the difficulties in growing\/characterising in pure culture (a prerequisite to naming new species, \"vide supra\") and extensive horizontal gene transfer blurring the distinction of species."}}
