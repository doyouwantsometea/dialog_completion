I can answer your questions about Amtrak's 25 Hz traction power system.","1":"What are the differences between the 125 kV and the 25 Hz system?","2":"From 1918 onward, outdoor stations were used and when the main line electrification began in 1928 the stations became large open air structures using lattice steel frameworks to mount the 132 kV terminations and switchgear.","3":"Are there any other interesting aspects about this article?","4":"By 1935 new stations were connected to remote supervision systems allowing power directors to open and close switches and breakers from central offices without having to go through the tower operators.","5":"Do they still use this system today?","6":"Today about 55 substations are part of Amtrak's network.","7":"How are the substations designed?","8":"Substations are spaced on average apart and feed 12 kV catenary circuits in both directions along the line.","9":"What are the major substations that they have?","10":"Thus the catenary is segmented (via section breaks, also called 'sectionalizations' by the PRR) at each substation, and each substation feeds both sides of a catenary's section break.","11":"Is there anything else that is important about the substations?","12":"A train traveling between two substations draws power through both transformers."}}
