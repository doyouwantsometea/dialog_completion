I can answer your questions about Geology of Minnesota.","1":"What geological processes shaped Minnesota's landscape?","2":"They also formed a number of proglacial lakes, which contributed to the state's topography and soils.","3":"What are some of the state's scenic wonders?","4":"Principal among these lakes was Lake Agassiz, a massive lake with a volume rivaling that of all the present Great Lakes combined.","5":"Are there any other scenic wonders?","6":"Dammed by the northern ice sheet, this lake's immense flow found an outlet in glacial River Warren, which drained south across the Traverse Gap through the valleys now occupied by the Minnesota and Mississippi Rivers.","7":"What other geological features are interesting about the state's landscape?","8":"Eventually, the ice sheet melted, and the Red River gave Lake Agassiz a northern outlet toward Hudson Bay.","9":"What happened after the ice sheet melted?","10":"As the lake drained away its bed became peatlands and a fertile plain.","11":"Did the state go through any other geological changes?","12":"Similarly, Glacial Lake Duluth, in the basin of Lake Superior, was dammed by a glacier; it drained down the ancient course of the Midcontinental Rift to the St."}}
