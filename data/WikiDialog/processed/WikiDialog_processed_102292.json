I can answer your questions about Memorial reconstruction.","1":"What are the main criticisms of the Securing the text theory?","2":"The theory has, however, been criticised on various grounds; that it is not based on serious research into the way actors actually remember or misremember lines; that texts may have been \"stolen\" by other means; and that the so-called \"bad\" quartos are early or alternative versions of plays that were later revised.","3":"When did this theory first appear?","4":"The theory first appeared during the 19th century, and it was more fully defined by W. W. Greg in 1909, when he analysed the quarto text of \"The Merry Wives of Windsor\" by systematically comparing the divergences from the Folio version.","5":"What did he conclude?","6":"He concluded that scenes with the character of the Host are much closer to the Folio version than the other scenes are.","7":"What did he deduce?","8":"He therefore deduced that the actor playing the Host had played a significant role in creating the text of the quarto publication.","9":"Where did this theory appear next?","10":"In 1915, Henry David Gray analysed the first quarto of \"Hamlet\" using the same method.","11":"What did he conclude?","12":"He concluded that the actor who played Marcellus was responsible for the reconstruction."}}
