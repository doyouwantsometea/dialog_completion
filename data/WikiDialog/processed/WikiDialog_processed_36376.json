I can answer your questions about Thermophotonics.","1":"What is Thermophotonics?","2":"Thermophotonics  Thermophotonics (often abbreviated as TPX) is a concept for generating usable power from heat which shares some features of thermophotovoltaic (TPV) power generation.","3":"Who proposed the idea?","4":"\" Thermophotonics\" was first publicly proposed by solar photovoltaic researcher Martin Green in 2000.","5":"Have ther been any devices made?","6":"However, no TPX device is known to have been demonstrated to date, apparently because of the stringent requirement on the emitter efficiency.","7":"What are the basic principles?","8":"A TPX system consists of a light-emitting diode (LED) (though other types of emitters are conceivable), a photovoltaic (PV) cell, an optical coupling between the two, and an electronic control circuit.","9":"How does the system work?","10":"The LED is heated to a temperature higher than the PV temperature by an external heat source.","11":"Is there anything else interesting about this article?","12":"If no power is applied to the LED, the system functions much like a very inefficient TPV system, but if a forward bias is applied at some fraction of the bandgap potential, an increased number of electron-hole pairs (EHPs) will be thermally excited to the bandgap energy."}}
