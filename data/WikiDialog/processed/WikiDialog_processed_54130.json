I can answer your questions about Bathers at Asni\u00e8res.","1":"What is meant by perceptual colours?","2":"In this way, colour perception was explained as a complex, interpretive process, rather than a static and simple record of visual data.","3":"Did Seurat experiment with perceptual colours?","4":"Seurat\u2019s response to the theories in these writings is widely evident in the Bathers, most obviously in such areas as those of the torso and legs of the man seated centre-left on the persimmon-orange cushion, and of the central figure as his back contrasts with light blue water and his arm contrasts with water of a darker hue.","5":"What was Seurat's life like in 1882?","6":"In 1882 Seurat rented a small studio in the rue Chabrol close to his family\u2019s home.","7":"What did he paint in the studio?","8":"\" Bathers at Asni\u00e8res\" was painted in this studio, on a canvas identical in size to that part of \"A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte\" that excludes the painted border.","9":"Did he have any other paintings?","10":"Following the rejection of the \"Bathers\" by the jury of the Salon of 1884, Seurat joined forces with some like-minded artists to become a founder members of the \"Groupe des Artistes Ind\u00e9pendants\".","11":"What did the Groupe do?","12":"This institution held its first exhibition\u2014the \"Salon de Artistes Ind\u00e9pendants\"\u2014between May 15th and July 1st, 1884 at a temporary building in the place du Carrousel, adjacent to the Louvre."}}
