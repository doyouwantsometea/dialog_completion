I can answer your questions about Linear utility.","1":"What is the difference between competitive equilibrium and non competitive equilibrium?","2":"Competitive equilibrium with equal incomes (CEEI) is a special kind of competitive equilibrium, in which the budget of all agents is the same. I.e, for every two agents formula_17 and formula_73: The CEEI allocation is important because it is guaranteed to be envy-free: the bundle formula_75 gives agent formula_17 a maximum utility among of all the bundles with the same price, so in particular it gives him at least as much utility as the bundle formula_77.","3":"Are there any other interesting aspects about this article?","4":"One way to achieve a CEEI is to give all agents the same initial endowment, i.e., for every formula_17 and formula_73: (if there are formula_81 agents then every agent receives exactly formula_82 of the quantity of every good).","5":"Is there any other ways to achieve a CEEI?","6":"In such an allocation, no subsets of agents are self-sufficient.","7":"Can you give me an example?","8":"Hence, as a corollary of Gale's theorem:  In all examples below, there are two agents - Alice and George, and two goods - apples (x) and guavas (y).","9":"What are some of the examples?","10":"A. Unique equilibrium : the utility functions are: The total endowment is formula_85.","11":"What is the non competitive equilibrium?","12":"Without loss of generality, we can normalize the price vector such that formula_86."}}
