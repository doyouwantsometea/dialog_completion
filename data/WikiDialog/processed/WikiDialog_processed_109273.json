I can answer your questions about Acetylide.","1":"What are some examples of acetylide?","2":"Lithium amide, LiHMDS, or organolithium reagents, such as butyllithium, are frequently used form lithium acetylides:  Sodium or potassium acetylides can be prepared from various inorganic reagents (e.g. sodium amide) or from their elemental metals, often at room temperature and atmospheric pressure.","3":"Are there any other examples?","4":"Copper(I) acetylide can be prepared by passing acetylene through an aqueous solution of copper(I) chloride because of a low solubility equilibrium.","5":"Are there any other examples?","6":"Similarly, silver acetylides can be obtained from silver nitrate.","7":"Are there any other examples?","8":"Calcium carbide is prepared by heating carbon with lime CaO at approximately 2,000 \u00b0C.","9":"Are there any other examples?","10":"A similar process is used to produce lithium carbide.","11":"What are some other important aspects?","12":"Acetylides of the type RCM are widely used in alkynylations in organic chemistry."}}
