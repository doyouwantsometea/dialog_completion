I can answer your questions about Sciurognathi.","1":"What are the different species of rodents included in the order Sciurognathi?","2":"Sciurognathi  Sciurognathi is a suborder of rodents that includes squirrels, chipmunks, beavers, and many types of mice.","3":"What do the rodents have in common?","4":"The group is characterized by a specific shape to the lower jaw.","5":"What is the lowest jaw shaped like?","6":"In sciurognaths, the angular process of the jaw is in the same plane as the root of the incisors.","7":"Is the top of the head shaped differently?","8":"This is in contrast to the suborder Hystricognathi where the angular process is outside the plane formed at the root of the incisor due to the presence of a shelf for muscle attachment.","9":"Are there any other interesting aspects about this article?","10":"The sciurognathous condition is considered to be the primitive condition in rodents, and is therefore not a good character for cladistic analysis.","11":"Why is it not a good character for cladistic analysis?","12":"Although hystricognaths are almost universally accepted as representing a real evolutionary grouping, most researchers do not consider Sciurognathi as an equally valid group."}}
