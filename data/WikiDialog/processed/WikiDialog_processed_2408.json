I can answer your questions about Origin of the domestic dog.","1":"the ancient dog was probably domesticated by accident when its ancestors were brought to the Americas by early humans","2":"The same process may also apply to other domesticated animals.","3":"what did the change in DNA lead to","4":"In 2014, a whole genome study of the DNA differences between wolves and dogs found that dogs did not show a reduced fear response but did show greater synaptic plasticity.","5":"what does the greater synaptic plasticity lead to","6":"Synaptic plasticity is widely believed to be the cellular correlate of learning and memory, and this change may have altered the learning and memory abilities of dogs in comparison to wolves.","7":"how are the abilities different today","8":"Unlike other domestic species which were primarily selected for production-related traits, dogs were initially selected for their behaviors.","9":"how many genes are different","10":"In 2016, a study found that there were only 11 fixed genes that showed variation between wolves and dogs.","11":"why are there only 11","12":"These gene variations were unlikely to have been the result of natural evolution, and indicate selection on both morphology and behavior during dog domestication."}}
