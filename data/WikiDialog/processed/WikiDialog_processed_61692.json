I can answer your questions about Hull speed.","1":"What is meant by hull speed?","2":"Hull speed Hull speed or displacement speed is the speed at which the wavelength of a vessel's bow wave is equal to the waterline length of the vessel.","3":"Are there any other interesting aspects about this article?","4":"As boat speed increases from rest, the wavelength of the bow wave increases, and usually its crest-to-trough dimension (height) increases as well.","5":"What happens if the speed is exceeded?","6":"When hull speed is exceeded, a vessel in displacement mode will appear to be climbing up the back of its bow wave.","7":"What happens to the vessel then?","8":"From a technical perspective, at hull speed the bow and stern waves interfere constructively, creating relatively large waves, and thus a relatively large value of wave drag.","9":"Is there anything else of note about hull speed?","10":"Though the term \"hull speed\" seems to suggest that it is some sort of \"speed limit\" for a boat, in fact drag for a displacement hull increases smoothly and at an increasing rate with speed as hull speed is approached and exceeded, often with no noticeable inflection at hull speed.","11":"What are some other important aspects of it?","12":"The concept of hull speed is not used in modern naval architecture, where considerations of speed\/length ratio or Froude number are considered more helpful."}}
