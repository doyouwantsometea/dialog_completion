I can answer your questions about All Creatures Great and Small (TV series).","1":"What was the casting director for the show All Creatures Great and Small?","2":"\"He will, indeed, only allow us to use what is written.","3":"What was the producers role in the show?","4":"Which, I think, is fair.\" \"Only days after finishing \"A Very Peculiar Practice\", I was back in Yorkshire to film a second \"All Creatures\" Christmas Special,\" remembered Peter Davison.","5":"What are some of the episodes of All Creatures Great and Small?","6":"\"I can't remember when the idea of making another series of the show came up, but it was probably long before anyone mentioned it to the actors.","7":"Did the actors like the show?","8":"Not that we raised too many eyebrows; I felt I had done enough other work to prove to myself that Tristan hadn't hindered my prospects.","9":"Did the show help the actors careers?","10":"Quite the reverse, as \"Doctor Who\" had proved : Tristan was a stepping stone to other parts.\" \"By the end of 1986, it was agreed that the original cast, minus Carol Drinkwater, would re-assemble to film another series,\" continued Davison.","11":"When did filming begin for the second series?","12":"\"The date was set for the spring of the following year, dangerously close to the date set for a second series of \"A Very Peculiar Practice\".\"  Three years later, the programme was indeed revived, after Sellars was able to persuade Wight to allow new scripts to be written around the existing characters, but not directly based on the Herriot books, with some story lines repeated from the first run."}}
