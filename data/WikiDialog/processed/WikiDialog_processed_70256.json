I can answer your questions about Free-form deformation.","1":"What is Free-form deformation?","2":"Free-form deformation In computer graphics, free-form deformation (FFD) is a geometric technique used to model simple deformations of rigid objects.","3":"How does it work?","4":"It is based on the idea of enclosing an object within a cube or another hull object, and transforming the object within the hull as the hull is deformed.","5":"Is there anything else interesting about it?","6":"Deformation of the hull is based on the concept of so-called \"hyper-patches\", which are three-dimensional analogs of parametric curves such as B\u00e9zier curves, B-splines, or NURBs.","7":"Who created it?","8":"The technique was first described by Thomas W. Sederberg and Scott R.","9":"When was it created?","10":"Parry in 1986, and is based on an earlier technique by Alan Barr.","11":"Did anyone else use it?","12":"It was extended by Coquillart to a technique described as \"extended free-form deformation\", which refines the hull object by introducing additional geometry or by using different hull objects such as cylinders and prisms."}}
