I can answer your questions about L-function.","1":"What is L-function?","2":"L-function In mathematics, an L-function is a meromorphic function on the complex plane, associated to one out of several categories of mathematical objects.","3":"Are there any other interesting aspects about this article?","4":"An L-series is a Dirichlet series, usually convergent on a half-plane, that may give rise to an L-function via analytic continuation.","5":"What did you find the most interesting fact about the L-function?","6":"The theory of \"L\"-functions has become a very substantial, and still largely conjectural, part of contemporary analytic number theory.","7":"Why is it so important?","8":"In it, broad generalisations of the Riemann zeta function and the \"L\"-series for a Dirichlet character are constructed, and their general properties, in most cases still out of reach of proof, are set out in a systematic way.","9":"Did you find any other interesting aspects of the L-function?","10":"We distinguish at the outset between the L-series, an infinite series representation (for example the Dirichlet series for the Riemann zeta function), and the L-function, the function in the complex plane that is its analytic continuation.","11":"Are they the same?","12":"The general constructions start with an \"L\"-series, defined first as a Dirichlet series, and then by an expansion as an Euler product indexed by prime numbers."}}
