I can answer your questions about Dan-Air Engineering.","1":"What were some of the difficulties faced by Dan-Air Engineering?","2":"When the fledgling airline moved its operating base to Blackbushe in 1955, it continued to face a shortage of adequate maintenance facilities as Airwork, Britavia, Eagle, Silver City and Westminster Airways, whose presence at the airport predated Dan-Air's, had already occupied most of the available hangar space.","3":"Why were they not able to find a solution to the problem?","4":"Blackbushe's lack of space resulted from its earlier use as a military airfield where no provision had been made for future commercial operations.","5":"Are there any other interesting aspects about this article?","6":"The airport's biggest drawback was its location on both sides of the A30 along the Hampshire-Surrey county border, with the terminal and apron to the north and the maintenance area to the south, and taxiways as well as one of the runways crossing it.","7":"What were the effects of this?","8":"This arrangement necessitated frequent closures of the busy road on account of aircraft moving across it, thereby preventing the efficient use of both road and airport as well as ruling out the latter's expansion.) At the time, Lasham Airfield was in excellent condition, featuring a newly resurfaced runway and a large, empty hangar.","9":"Why did they decide to move?","10":"(The Air Ministry had decided to upgrade the airfield following the end of the Berlin Airlift in preparation for further Cold War tensions.)","11":"Did they have any other issues?","12":"Eventually, Davies and Newman, the parent company of both the airline and its new engineering offshoot, managed to negotiate a 21-year lease of the airfield's maintenance facilities with the Air Ministry."}}
