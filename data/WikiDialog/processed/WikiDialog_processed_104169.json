I can answer your questions about Lexical definition.","1":"What is the lexical definition of a term?","2":"Lexical definition The lexical definition of a term, also known as the dictionary definition, is the meaning of the term in common usage.","3":"Why is it called that?","4":"As its other name implies, this is the sort of definition one is likely to find in the dictionary.","5":"Are there any other interesting aspects about this article?","6":"A lexical definition is usually the type expected from a request for definition, and it is generally expected that such a definition will be stated as simply as possible in order to convey information to the widest audience.","7":"Is there anything else noteable?","8":"Note that a lexical definition is \"descriptive\", reporting actual usage within speakers of a language, and changes with changing usage of the term, rather than \"prescriptive\", which would be to stick with a version regarded as \"correct\", regardless of drift in accepted meaning.","9":"What tends to be the most common definition?","10":"They tend to be inclusive, attempting to capture everything the term is used to refer to, and as such are often too vague for many purposes.","11":"Is there anything else noteable?","12":"When the breadth or vagueness of a lexical definition is unacceptable, a precising definition or a stipulative definition is often used."}}
