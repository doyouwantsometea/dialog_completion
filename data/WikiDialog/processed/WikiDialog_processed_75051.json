I can answer your questions about Type 16 maneuver combat vehicle.","1":"What are the weaknesses of the Type 16 MCV?","2":"Since the MCV is designed only for defending against enemy invasion of the home islands, it is unlikely to find itself fighting a lengthy counter-insurgency campaign in a foreign nation, or encountering enemy minefields while spearheading an invasion of an enemy power.","3":"Are there any other interesting aspects about this article?","4":"The main gun is manually loaded as a cost-saving measure.","5":"Is there anything else that is interesting?","6":"Some critics have expressed doubts about its effectiveness due to this strain on the crew in hot conditions, as the vehicle does not have air conditioning.","7":"What other concerns were expressed?","8":"Concerns have also been expressed by some about what they perceive as a shortfall in the MCV's off-road capability.","9":"Did they have any other weaknesses?","10":"In 2009 resistance testing of the shielding against HEAT rounds was conducted using the Carl Gustav M2; and against regular kinetic ammunition the frontal shield was developed to resist shots from 20 mm to 30 mm autocannons while the side armor was deemed sufficient to resist 12.7 mm heavy machine gun fire.","11":"Did they have any other uses?","12":"The Technical Research & Development Institute of Japan's Ministry of Defense had made several prototype vehicles since 2008. They unveiled their fourth of what were initially called \"mobile combat vehicle\" prototypes on 9 October 2013. JGSDF service Acceptance tests were scheduled to begin in 2014 or 2015, with initial operational deployment by the JGSDF planned for 2016. 99 MCVs were originally planned to be introduced by the end of FY 2018."}}
