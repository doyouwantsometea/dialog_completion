I can answer your questions about Density functional theory.","1":"What is the difference between density functional theory and other theories?","2":"As usual in many-body electronic structure calculations, the nuclei of the treated molecules or clusters are seen as fixed (the Born\u2013Oppenheimer approximation), generating a static external potential in which the electrons are moving.","3":"Are there any other interesting aspects about this article?","4":"A stationary electronic state is then described by a wavefunction satisfying the many-electron time-independent Schr\u00f6dinger equation  where, for the -electron system, is the Hamiltonian, is the total energy, is the kinetic energy, is the potential energy from the external field due to positively charged nuclei, and is the electron\u2013electron interaction energy.","5":"Is the theory the same for every single electron?","6":"The operators and are called universal operators as they are the same for any -electron system, while is system-dependent.","7":"Why is the theory not separable?","8":"This complicated many-particle equation is not separable into simpler single-particle equations because of the interaction term .","9":"How do you use this theory?","10":"There are many sophisticated methods for solving the many-body Schr\u00f6dinger equation based on the expansion of the wavefunction in Slater determinants.","11":"What are some of the methods?","12":"While the simplest one is the Hartree\u2013 Fock method, more sophisticated approaches are usually categorized as post-Hartree\u2013Fock methods."}}
