I can answer your questions about Dendrogram.","1":"What is the meaning of Dendrogram?","2":"Dendrogram A dendrogram is a diagram representing a tree.","3":"What are the different types of dendrograms?","4":"This diagrammatic representation is frequently used in different contexts: The name \"dendrogram\" derives from the two ancient greek words (), meaning \"tree\", and (), meaning \"drawing, mathematical figure\".","5":"What are the examples of dendrograms?","6":"For a clustering example, suppose that five taxa (formula_1 to formula_2) have been clustered by UPGMA based on a matrix of genetic distances.","7":"What would be the dendrogram like in this example?","8":"The hierarchical clustering dendrogram would show a column of five nodes representing the initial data (here individual taxa), and the remaining nodes represent the clusters to which the data belong, with the arrows representing the distance (dissimilarity).","9":"What other features make the dendrograms different?","10":"The distance between merged clusters is monotone, increasing with the level of the merger: the height of each node in the plot is proportional to the value of the intergroup dissimilarity between its two daughters (the nodes on the right representing individual observations all plotted at zero height)."}}
