I can answer your questions about Ununennium.","1":"Are there any other interesting aspects about this article on Ununennium?","2":"Some heavier isotopes may be more stable; Fricke and Waber predicted Uue to be the most stable ununennium isotope in 1971.","3":"Why are they more stable?","4":"This has consequences for the synthesis of ununennium, as isotopes with half-lives below one microsecond would decay before reaching the detector, and the heavier isotopes cannot be synthesised by the collision of any known usable target and projectile nuclei.","5":"What else do you find interesting about this article?","6":"Nevertheless, new theoretical models show that the expected gap in energy between the proton orbitals 2f (filled at element 114) and 2f (filled at element 120) is smaller than expected, so that element 114 no longer appears to be a stable spherical closed nuclear shell, and this energy gap may increase the stability of elements 119 and 120.","7":"Did they find any others?","8":"The next doubly magic nucleus is now expected to be around the spherical Ubb (element 122), but the expected low half-life and low production cross section of this nuclide makes its synthesis challenging.","9":"Is there any other interesting aspects?","10":"Being the first period 8 element , ununennium is predicted to be an alkali metal, taking its place in the periodic table below lithium, sodium, potassium, rubidium, caesium, and francium.","11":"Why is that?","12":"Each of these elements has one valence electron in the outermost s-orbital (valence electron configuration \"n\"s), which is easily lost in chemical reactions to form the +1 oxidation state: thus the alkali metals are very reactive elements."}}
