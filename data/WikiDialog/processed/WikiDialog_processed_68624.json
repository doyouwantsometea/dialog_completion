I can answer your questions about Opportunistic encryption.","1":"What is the difference between opportunistic encryption and other types of confidentiality?","2":"Opportunistic encryption Opportunistic encryption (OE) refers to any system that, when connecting to another system, attempts to encrypt the communications channel, otherwise falling back to unencrypted communications.","3":"What are the advantages of this?","4":"This method requires no pre-arrangement between the two systems.","5":"What are the limitations?","6":"Opportunistic encryption can be used to combat passive wiretapping. (An \"active\" wiretapper, on the other hand, can disrupt encryption negotiation to either force an unencrypted channel or perform a man-in-the-middle attack on the encrypted link.) It does not provide a strong level of security as authentication may be difficult to establish and secure communications are not mandatory.","7":"What does it do for the future?","8":"However, it does make the encryption of most Internet traffic easy to implement, which removes a significant impediment to the mass adoption of Internet traffic security.","9":"Are there any other interesting aspects about this article?","10":"Opportunistic encryption on the Internet is described in \"Opportunistic Encryption using the Internet Key Exchange (IKE)\", \"Opportunistic Security: Some Protection Most of the Time\", and in RFC 8164\"Opportunistic Security for HTTP\/2\".","11":"Who developed this?","12":"The FreeS\/WAN project was one of the early proponents of OE."}}
