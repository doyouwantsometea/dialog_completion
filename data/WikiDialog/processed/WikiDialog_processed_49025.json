I can answer your questions about Metformin.","1":"What are the main causes of lactic acidosis?","2":"Common causes include alcoholism (due to depletion of NAD+ stores), heart failure and respiratory disease (due to inadequate tissue oxygenation); the most common cause is kidney disease.","3":"how does metformin contribute to lactic acidosis?","4":"Metformin has been suggested as increasing production of lactate in the large intestine, which could potentially contribute to lactic acidosis in those with risk factors.","5":"what are some of the risk factors?","6":"However, the clinical significance of this is unknown, and the risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis is most commonly attributed to decreased hepatic uptake rather than increased intestinal production.","7":"Are there any other interesting aspects about this article?","8":"The risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis is also increased by massive overdose of metformin, although even quite large doses are often not fatal.","9":"what are some of the symptoms?","10":"The most common symptoms following overdose include vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, tachycardia, drowsiness, and, rarely, hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia.","11":"how is it treated?","12":"Treatment of metformin overdose is generally supportive, as no specific antidote is known."}}
