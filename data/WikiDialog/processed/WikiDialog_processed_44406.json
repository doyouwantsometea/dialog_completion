I can answer your questions about Phengaris rebeli.","1":"What do you find most interesting about the Phengaris rebeli article?","2":"Several researchers argue that \"P. rebeli\" has not evolved into a separate species from \"Phengaris alcon\" and that any variation between the two groups is due to intraspecific variation.","3":"What does it mean that it's not evolved into a separate species?","4":"Both species share a similar adult morphology, DNA and allozymes.","5":"Are there any other interesting aspects about this article?","6":"Furthermore, they both have similar methods of parasitizing the host ant: they act as parasitic \"cuckoos\" within the ant nest and feed upon the ants' regurgitation.","7":"Do they eat anything else?","8":"This is compared to the alternative method of predation used by \"Maculinea arion\".","9":"What other similarities do they have?","10":"To test this hypothesis, researchers examined how each species utilized the host ants. \" M. schencki\" and \"M. sabuleti\" are parasitized by \"P. rebeli\" while \"M. salina\" and \"M. vandeli\" are parasitized by \"P. alcon\". \" M. scabrinodis\" is parasitized by both \"P. rebeli\" and \"P. alcon\"; however, \"P. alcon\" is far more likely than \"P. rebeli\" to parasitize \"M. scabrinodis\".","11":"What other differences were there?","12":"Researchers found that in general, \"P. alcon\" was far more likely to parasitize the host ant than \"P. rebeli\"; however, ant nests that supported \"P. alcon\" were much smaller and supported lower populations than ant nests that supported \"P. rebeli\". \"P. rebeli\" are noted for their large blue wings, with the males displaying a violet blue shade and the females displaying blue basal areas interspersed with brown spots, similar to other butterflies in the genus."}}
