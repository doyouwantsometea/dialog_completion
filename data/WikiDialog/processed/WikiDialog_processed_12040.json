I can answer your questions about Emerin.","1":"What is the function of Emerin?","2":"Emerin appears to be involved in mechanotransduction, as emerin-deficient mouse fibroblasts failed to transduce normal mechanosensitive gene expression responses to strain stimuli.","3":"Are there any other interesting aspects about this article?","4":"In cardiac muscle, emerin is also found complexed to beta-catenin at adherens junctions of intercalated discs, and cardiomyocytes from hearts lacking emerin showed beta-catenin redistribution as well as perturbed intercalated disc architecture and myocyte shape.","5":"What is the significance of this?","6":"This interaction appears to be regulated by glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta.","7":"Is there anything else that is interesting?","8":"Mutations in emerin cause X-linked recessive Emery\u2013Dreifuss muscular dystrophy, which is characterized by early contractures in the Achilles tendons, elbows and post-cervical muscles; muscle weakness proximal in the upper limbs and distal in lower limbs; along with cardiac conduction defects that range from sinus bradycardia, PR prolongation to complete heart block.","9":"Is there any treatment or cure?","10":"In these patients, immunostaining of emerin is lost in various tissues, including muscle, skin fibroblasts, and leukocytes, however diagnostic protocols involve mutational analysis rather than protein staining.","11":"What else do we know about the mutations?","12":"In nearly all cases, mutations result in a complete deletion, or undetectable levels, of emerin protein."}}
