I can answer your questions about Orientalism (book).","1":"What did you find most interesting about Orientalism?","2":"Moreover, that by unduly concentrating on British and French Orientalism, Said ignored the domination of 19th century Oriental studies by German and Hungarian academics and intellectuals, whose countries did not possess an Eastern empire.","3":"Did you finish the book?","4":"Irwin's book was later criticized by Amir Taheri, writing in Asharq Al-Awsat, when he listed a number of factual and editing errors that Irwin makes in the book, also noting a number of prominent Orientalists left unmentioned.","5":"What did you do next?","6":"American scholar of religion Jason \u0100nanda Josephson has argued that data from Japan complicates Said's thesis about Orientalism as a field linked to imperial power.","7":"What about Japan?","8":"Not only did Europeans study Japan without any hope of colonizing it, but Japanese academics played a prominent role as informants and interlocutors in this academic discipline, providing information both on their own practices and history and on the history of China.","9":"Are there any other interesting aspects about this article?","10":"Moreover, Josephson has documented that European conferences on East Asia predate European conferences on the Middle East described by Said, necessitating an alternative chronology of Western academic interest in the Orient.","11":"Is there any other interesting aspects?","12":"In the article \"Said's Splash\" (2001) , Martin Kramer said that, fifteen years after publication of \"Orientalism\" (1978), the UCLA historian Nikki Keddie (whom Said praised in \"Covering Islam\", 1981) who originally had praised \"Orientalism\" as an 'important, and, in many ways, positive' book, had changed her mind."}}
