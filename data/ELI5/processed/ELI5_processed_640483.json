(Regulation vs. Open Market)","3":"Regulation doesn't necessarily entail left wing, they outlawed labor unions and striking.  Left wing ideologies generally favor workers rights over those of capital owners.","4":"Interesting. So it's sort of policy combined with idealogy that places it in its place. I was too rigid in my understanding. I just looked at policy alone.","5":"You were looking at just economic policy, there are policies other than economic - namely social and foreign.  However, even in their economic policy the Nazi party wasn't left of center in most areas."}}
