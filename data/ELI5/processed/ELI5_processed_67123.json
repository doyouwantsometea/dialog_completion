Like if I sleep in for like 10-15 hours then I feel  like I had a hangover even if I don't drink. But if I get 5-6 hours I feel much more refreshed though sometimes I still get tired. Lockdown has wrecked my sleep schedule, lol.","2":"Yea Same, and I think the sleep schedule for me was the issue so I'm fixing it.","3":"There could also be other problems. Sometimes your diet, exercise schedule and other life habits can cause problems with sleep. Maybe you have stress or anxiety that are causing interruptions with sleep? Or insomnia? Smoking, drinking, and drugs can also interrupt it. They say to not take naps or drink caffeine after 12 in the afternoon though I usually do, lol. You could try taking sleeping pills, drinking warm milk before bed sometimes helps. Sometimes I stay up all night to reset my sleep schedule. You could try that too.","4":"Yea, I have a list of things Imma try.","5":"Good luck!","6":"Ty!"}}
