Either way, communication is interpersonal, not personal.  Someone making a statement that implies you aren't truly a member of a group you identify with is going to get a negative reaction.  And if it is just of biographical import, and not objective, why make the comment?","2":"I mean, we discuss subjective things all the time. We debate the quality of a movie, even though it is subjective. So why couldn't we debate what constitutes a true movie lover?","3":"Then it is more than just a personal conception.","4":"No. Just because it's personal doesn't mean there's no value in debating it.","5":"Yes, all debate is interpersonal, unless you are talking to yourself.","6":"It is an interpersonal thing here. The conception may be personal to you, but you feel like sharing it with others, and you may even believe they could benefit from it.","7":"I can only recall people making the fallacy in question a few times, but in all cases, it was to put somebody else down, or prop themselves up (by making themselves seem superior, or by clinging to their beliefs in the face of reasoning); never was it to benefit others.","8":"But what you are describing doesn't sound like a fallacy. It seems similar to my foreign movies example. Those people really believe that they fit certain requirement that places them in a superior category. So there's no fallacy involved. You may say they are a dick, maybe, but they aren't using any illogical reasoning.","9":"They aren't using reasoning at all, just like in your example.  They are just making stuff up.","10":"Which means it can't be a fallacy. Making stuff up is just laying out a premise. It's neither logical or illogical. It's just a premise."}}
