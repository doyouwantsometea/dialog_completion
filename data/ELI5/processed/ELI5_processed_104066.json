If neither party can agree on what the terms of a debate even mean then no logical arguments can commence.","2":"Hence my question: why are those types of situation considered a fallacy, when in reality they are just a case of someone having a subjective definition, which they then have to explain more clearly when other people don't get what they are talking about?","3":"It's not a fallacy if you are arguing something subjective because if it is subjective then it is illogical. No True Scotsman can only apply if the assertion is something that can be disproven because NTS is applied when the assertion is changed to exclude the offending proof. Likewise, if you clarify your position it is also not No True Scotsman. However; if you argue something to objectively be the case... You know what, let's change the example slightly to be less ambiguous:     \"No person born in Edinburgh likes eggs\"   \"I was born in Edinburgh and I like eggs\"   \"No TRUE person from Edinburgh likes eggs\"     Can you see where logic has broken down here?","4":"But the thing is, people who get accused of \"no true Scotsman\" are never trying to argue something objective. They are always going by some personal conception they have.  With your example, you are trying to think of something objective. It's hard to argue against where a person was born. But I doubt the person in this example would be denying that, technically, some people born in Edinburgh don't like eggs. Just like the Scotsman isn't denying that technically Scottish nationality is a thing. But they may have their own conception of what \"being born in Edinburgh\" means, which would involve both being born in Edinburgh (technically speaking) and not liking eggs.","5":"Then every time you have seen an accusation of no true scotsman it has been used incorrectly. The person in my example was arguing exactly what they said because they were literally a hypothetical person who was arguing something easy to disprove. This is literally just a textbook example.      It seems to me that you are primarily concerned with what the accusee in each example \\*meant\\* but that's not what debate is about, to the point of apologism for literal straw men. A debate is entirely logical. \"People who I consider to be Scottish do not add sugar to their porridge\" is not something anyone would ever argue.","6":"&gt; The person in my example was arguing exactly what they said because they were literally a hypothetical person who was arguing something easy to disprove.  But I don't think something like that ever happens in real life. People aren't stupid, they don't insistently deny simple facts. They just are using a personal definition that is dear to them.  So it seems to me the \"no true Scotsman\" fallacy is just a common misunderstanding of what is actually happening in people's heads. The person is talking about an abstract label that makes sense to them, and the people they are talking to may mistakenly believe they are denying reality, because they don't get what it is the person is talking about.","7":"Do me a personal favor. In all prior examples, assume that the assertions are exactly as stated. There is no basis for \"Yeah but I didn't mean it that way...\". A Scotsman is a human person from Scotland. A person born in Edinburgh is just that.  If person 1 says \"All X's are Y's\"   Then person 2 says \"X1 is an X but not a Y\"   Then person 1 says \"Then X1 is not an X because all X's are Y's\"   Where X1 exists in the subset of all X  Then JUST GOING BY INFORMATION THAT IS PRESENT, PERSON 1's ARGUMENT IS FALLACIOUS.","8":"I agree that this is a fallacy. I just don't think this is a thing people do. What generally happens is that they have a personal idea of what X stands for. Person 1 and Person 2 are not talking about the same X.","9":"The title of your post was \"Why is the No True Scotsman considered a fallacy\" and that's been repeatedly answered. Whether you think that it is realistic as regards conversations is really neither here nor there.","10":"Okay, but then you have to wonder why the fallacy is even a thing, if it hardly happens in real life.  Plus, it basically never happens in good faith. I mean, fallacies usually refer to flawed reasonings that someone may not realize is flawed. That's not the case with this particular fallacy. Someone would have to be incredibly dumb to not see that there is a problem in the reasoning you laid out above.","11":"1. Again, this falls entirely outside of the purview of your original question. 2. Your argument that the fallacy almost never happens in actual debate is pretty suspet. 3. [Logic doesn't really concern itself with the most realistic scenarios](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Monty_Hall_problem)","12":"Well I've never seen it happen myself. And it's not like you could easily prove that it is happening, unless you really engage with the person you are suspecting.  Like, what I said in my OP may easily be interpreted as an example of the fallacy. But that interpretation would be mistaken. That's why I'm suspecting the fallacy frequently is assumed incorrectly.","13":"\"I've never seen it myself\" is not an argument for \"therefore it is very rare\". Neither is \"someone might mistakenly invoke the fallacy incorrectly\" proof that \"the fallacy is frequently invoked incorrectly\".","14":"I know. But what I'm thinking is, typically the cases that get accused of the fallacy are similar to my example (or to the wikipedia example). And those types of claims generally come down to a personal belief that the person has.  It comes up all the times when people are trying to gatekeep what is a \"true fan\" or a \"true citizen\" and such. Those situations are hardly ever a fallacy. It's just that people have a set idea. Like for example someone considering that a true Star Wars fan cannot like The Last Jedi. It doesn't fit what they think a true fan would do.","15":"If someone applies the No True Scotsman fallacy to a personal opinion, then that is incorrect. This has nothing to do with the validity of the fallacy. Your position seems to be \"I don't like people using the fallacy this way\" and your evidence is \"I see it happen a lot\". These are not very robust, logically speaking (well, your opinion may be internally consistent but it's not very interesting to discuss).","16":"So you don't care whether people are actually making the fallacy or not? You are only interested in the theory of it?","17":"See now you're getting it"}}
