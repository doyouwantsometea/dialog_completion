It's a direct link between the gut and the brain, and learning a bit about that relationship will further explain why we literally feel our feelings in our gut sometimes. Be well!","2":"Thanks I dont think I've heard much about this one! I know there is alot of research coming out lately about the link between gut and everything else!","3":"It's big stuff, man! Like- ya know how some people literally feel like they're gonna shit themselves when they're super nervous? =Vagus nerve. That suck runs alllll the way down your upper and lower GI tracts. Also, did you know that our stomachs produce serotonin? It can't cross the blood-brain barrier, but it signals the vagus nerve to tell the brain *itself* to produce serotonin. This is one reason why gut health is linked to emotional health. And there's SO much more we don't even know yet! Anyway, have fun exploring all of this; great ELI5 question :)","4":"Thanks I will do my research for sure. Glad you liked the question! I dont like the reason why I decided to ask it LOL but it's one of the ways I try and handle things, by understanding what is going on","5":"Awww bless ur heart! (meant sincerely) Breakups- or whatever you're going through- can really mess with your tummy. Take care of Self!","6":"Thanks that actually makes me feel a little better!"}}
