Clean freshwater, depending on *how* you \"waste\" or contaminate it, *is* a precious resource that is very hard to reclaim.","2":"&gt;is a precious resource that is very hard to reclaim.  Why is that? I mean the water is there so why not clean it and use it?","3":"&gt; Why is that? I mean the water is there      That's the other thing. It isn't. For most people on the planet, the water is not there. It's somewhere else.        &gt;so why not clean it and use it?      This is, in a way, what sewage and wastewater treatment plants do. It's a very time-, infrastructure and resource-intensive process that cannot be provided everywhere.","4":"Well we are providing weapons to war torn nations who don't have resources for food. Surely some infrastructure can be built for ones with no access to water, right?","5":"&gt; Well we are providing weapons to war torn nations who don't have resources for food. Surely some infrastructure can be built for ones with no access to water, right?  Any project in the world is limited by the constraints of technology, resources and politics. Any call for \"Let's pool together and solve this problem\" will always incur responses of \"I don't have anything to pool\", \"That isn't even a problem\" or \"I do not care enough about this to dedicate any attention to it\".","6":"Putting aside the fancy words, water can be cleaned and provided to all it's just that we don't do it, right?","7":"&gt;it's just that we don't do it, right?  I certainly don't. Do you? Who is this \"we\"? There is no unified humanity. The world is big and complicated and full of nations, interest groups and individuals.","8":"It was like in general humanity but yeah your point is also valid, unfortunately."}}
