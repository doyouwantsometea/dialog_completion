A sport is defined as \"an activity involving physical exertion and skill in which an individual or team competes against another or others for entertainment.\" How is hockey not a sport?","2":"Define a game for me. Anything can be a sport if you call it that. But let's be honest, 99% of what we call sorts are nothing more than a contest to get more points that the opposing side. That's a game. Athletics maybe? You could make the argument that even MMA\/boxing have points and you sometimes get fighters trying to win on points. Aka Playing the game. But fighting is more a sport than a game. And hockey is more a game than a sport. ","3":"Games can be sports. It can go both ways. I just gave you a dictionary definition of a sport of which hockey meets all the criteria. You honestly can't be this stupid.","4":"Correct. I am not that stupid. You googled the definition of it, I am thinking more for myself about what it means. And I've landed on, if you're kicking\/hitting\/chasing a puck\/ball\/whatever around.. Its a game. You play a game. You don't play a fight. Best explanation I can give you as to where I'm coming from. ","5":"In that case fighting wouldn't be a sport. It would be a fight.","6":"I would agree with that. A fight is just a fight unless people are watching. Then it's better than hockey :) ","7":"Having a preference for a certain sport is fine. But that doesn't make the ones you prefer less not a sport.","8":"One of us arguing anyway. "}}
