You need your bladder kid. Google is free with internet access.     But let me humor you.    You need a bladder to empty the liquids you drink, and the liquids extracted from food you eat.   You need it for proper kidney function too.   If you don't have a bladder, then you will be fitted with a colostomy bag, essentially, so that your body can flush out the unneeded toxins and liquids.  Edit: also, pee comes from blood, your kidneys are constantly filtering the blood and the pee goes there.","2":"Of course you need kidneys, but I find the existence of smell and it's combination with evolution of anatomical structures truly fascinating.","3":"Did you even read what you posted?   It had nothing to do with smells.  Bodies smell.","4":"Oh but it does. It is the main point of it's existance.","5":"Are you high?","6":"Are you? I think you can't differentiate between the function of the kidneys and the bladder. You dont need a bladder from a physiological standpoint per se.","7":"Why are you focusing on the kidney part LOL and no I am not high I am at work.  I'm over this, you seem like you are trolling.  Look shit up before posting please.","8":"I quote: \"You need a bladder to empty the liquids you drink\""}}
