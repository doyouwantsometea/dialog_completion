If they do decide to repair through a third party repair shop because for example, they have a broken screen, they loose their warranty with Apple.","2":"but that sounds fair? If I made a table... and then sold it... then the person gets a scratch in the top so they replace the table top.. but after a few weeks the cheap new table top brakes... I wouldn't expect them to bring it back to me and cry \"it broke fix it under warranty\". This is what I don't understand!?","3":"The problem lies in the fact that Apple is very harsh when it comes to warranty, and when it's out of warranty they  charge huge amounts of money for an Apple certified repair out of warranty. So, for example, your touchid breaks because of your own fault, you accidentally pressed too hard on the touchid. So you want to have it repaired throughout a third party shop right? Well, two weeks later your camera module stops working and it's under warranty, but oh wait, Apple finds a non original touchid sensor that doesn't originally belong to your phone when it got manufactured so your warranty is void. But your battery is still broken and they won't repair it.","4":"again.. I struggle to understand this.  if you have pop'd the lid of your Iphone.. warranty has ended on the entire phone?","5":"Yes, opening your iPhone voids the warranty. And as the person told you about the John Deere stuff, Apple does the same with their screen\/touch id. If either of them is replaced by a third party shop, touch id stops working.","6":"Yes.. See that makes sense.. I understand them making something difficult to do.. but not making something impossible.   It shouldn't be easy to replace my touch ID with a knock-off.. because then everyone would do it and possibly cause harm. But it should be possible and if you are skilled enough to do it, software should support the part."}}
