What is it in their brain that responds to the high pitched sounds that way?","1":"Perhaps it has to do with it's inappropriateness and inherent selfishness from the child, who obviously doesn't know any better, that adds a bit of annoyance on top of just the pitch.","2":"I honestly can\u2019t tell if you\u2019re being sarcastic or not. Lol.","3":"Haha...I'm being completely serious. I can't help but to get annoyed at the selfishness even though I also can't hold it against them.","4":"Lol, wow, alright. Babies aren\u2019t selfish. If they are, it\u2019s unintentional. Selfishness, among many other negative, egotistical traits, I think, are learned traits that are picked up and developed over years with the right psychological surroundings.","5":"Yes, I think they are selfish, as they should be, because they can't survive on their own. I disagree that it's learned as it seems to stem naturally in children regardless of geography and gets culturally curtailed later.","6":"Yeah, you may be on to something there as well. Perhaps it\u2019s a little bit of both then? Children are born that way, but they can also develop it given how they\u2019re raised. I don\u2019t know for sure though, I\u2019m no psychologist. Just a theory."}}
