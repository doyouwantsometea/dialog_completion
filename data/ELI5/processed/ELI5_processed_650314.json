There is something like 1 billion cows. They all fart methane all day long. This is a leading cause of greenhouse gas emissions.   Also grazing farmland is much bigger than vegetable, grain, and fruit crop farmland. So more land has to be cleared to make space for all the livestock.  That being said, meat is awesome, milk is awesome. Fuck vegans. ","2":"What about all the machinery needed to harvest the crops and their gas emissions? ","3":"Doesnt come close to comparison emissions wise. Also since there can be more forest areas without livestock the extra trees would serve to offset the emissions somewhat.   Much more electricity is used in the processing of meat and other animal products than in the harvesting of crops. ","4":"But 80% of the air we breath comes from red algae in the ocean. Also what about all the insecticides they use that are killing off our Bees and the fertilizer poising our underground water streams? Forcing us to have to spend more time and energy to further process our drinkable water.","5":"Well thems the facts of it bud. If you are this interested in the topic i suggest doing your own research.  You obviously have your own opinion already formulated and are only looking to argue your side with people, and im not going to argue for the side of vegans, because like i said in my original comment 'I hate vegans'. ","6":"I'm not arguing, I'm trying to develop this topic so when others look back on it, what is said is everything there is to be said on it. Can you please restate the facts for me in bullet points?","7":"No lol"}}
