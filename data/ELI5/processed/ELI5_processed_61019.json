I know they \"don't share\", but is that a crack at aristocrats or more of a Buddhist-style respectful reference to the nobility?","1":"They need an enormous amount of power and expertise though, you cant just flip a Switch and have them run, and you certainly can\u2019t by yourself.","2":"Good thing Switzerland has a shitload of nuclear power   (Bavaria and several other regions in that area might have similar capabilities, and even if not they could just go to Switzerland)","3":"Ya but not autonomous nuclear power. Maybe you are a nuclear physicist and nuclear engineer but you still can\u2019t be in both places at once and do the maintenance","4":"Hmm, we were mainly just talking about regions trying to survive some sort of apocalypse   Yeah the Alps in general seem like a good place for that, (google alpine redoubt or national redoubt, even Mussolini had a pretty good one), and that being said the entirety of the Western World for the most part could be used. Even Svalbard north of Norway is famously thought of as a place to preserve things","5":"Not living things. Its cold and hard to grow crops. They are good at preserving things specifically because living things don't survive there well","6":"Okay well crispr and all the indoor agriculture techniques post-WWII solve all those problems   I mean they're figuring out ways to grow plants in spaceships and terraform Mars I'm sure they can do it underground in Earth","7":"If you have enough infrastructure to do so on a useful scale then you aren't in an apocalypse.","8":"What if the rest of the world on the surface,  not in bunkers, all die in a nuclear war but the Swiss (among others) are safe underground with a fully functioning society   Is that considered an apocalypse?","9":"most would call it science fiction, or total fantasy. If society is functioning then you don't need to make gold."}}
