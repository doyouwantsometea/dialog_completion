You say you're good at researching things yourself. Look up the Dunning-Kruger Effect and consider how it might apply to your perspective on this.","2":"Saying people can't do something they clearly can or saying \"but what about liars\" isn't a valid answer.","3":"If that's what you took from them, then once again, you didn't give much thought to *why* the answers were valid.","4":"I know about the Dunning-Kruger effect. I don't think I know more than doctors.... I feel like you and others are completely missing the point of the post. Doctors are involved in the process, and its only for simple day to day stuff. \"See a doctor\" would be a perfectly reasonable response. ","5":"Go back and read some of their replies and try to absorb what they're telling you: even the stuff that *seems* mundane, easy, and simple is not. There are all sorts of nuances to examinations that even they need to be concerned about missing.  They're telling you the stuff you think is easy isn't easy. You've been dismissing those comments because you don't know what you don't know about how hard it is.","6":"I don't really fully agree with this all, but my final argument is that it would be a whole hell of a lot better than simply not going to the doctor because of all the overhead involved. Being able to have access to an organized (yet simplified) process would be nice for those of us not privileged enough to just go to a doctors office outside of immediate emergencies."}}
