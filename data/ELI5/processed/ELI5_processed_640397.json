The thing preventing companies from raising prices is competition from other companies.","2":"Rent could go up by $100. And cable by $20. And gas by $2. And food by $100 a month. And insurance by $50. It would be a wash eventually wouldn\u2019t it?","3":"No. Not all customers or households would receive the same UBI (for example single people would get 1000 but married couples get 2000) so businesses would have to price competitively to maximize profits.  Even if a company's goal was to get all of the government payments, they would be competing with other companies who want the same thing.  Your rent isn't priced below $3000 a month because your landlord likes you and wants you to have money left over, they just don't want you to move to a different apartment.","4":"But now there\u2019s 5 people that can afford your apartment. More demand, less supply.","5":"Demand for housing is relatively fixed... it's determined primarily by the number of people who exist.  Your instinct that rents will increase is spot on, but it isn't as simple as \"landlords charge what they want so they get the entire increase in income.\"  More people will be able to afford your apartment, but you will be able to afford a different apartment.  Some people will spend their increased income on housing.  Some will spend it on a car, or clothes, or better food, or better education etc.  If there was only one thing to spend money on (rent) and everyone was required to spend all their income every month, rent would still not increase 1 to 1 with income because new apartments could be built to capitalize on the new available $.  Again, no one is saying prices will not increase, just that they will not increase to encompass 100% of the new income.","6":"I have zero doubt companies will do increases. Mergers Happen and they pinky promise it\u2019s the best thing for the consumer, then three years later they charge more"}}
