Now they are warning us about the heat. I don\u2019t remember ever having a power outage during any other winter or sumner unless ice took down a line or a hurricane took out a line. What changed?","1":"Texas utilities are subject to the same NERC and FERC regulations as the rest of the country. ERCOT does not have punitive authority to force measures, so they were the whipping boy for the \"winterization\" bullshit. They **were** responsible for the catastrophic pricing, however, but that was formulated into the profit motive back when de-regulation first occurred. Pricing hit $9000\/mwh in 2011 and the Texas Legislature huffed, puffed, and did nothing but implement a study, then ignore the recommendations. The winter fiasco was as much a debacle of the gas industry as generation failure, but no steps were taken to remedy them.","2":"What were the recommendations? Do you know?","3":"[https:\/\/www.ferc.gov\/sites\/default\/files\/2020-04\/08-16-11-report.pdf](https:\/\/www.ferc.gov\/sites\/default\/files\/2020-04\/08-16-11-report.pdf)  Here's the Federal report.   Just to repeat a few things I heard from the recent debacle. A wind generator in west Texas basically said, \" for me to weatherize, my costs\/mwh would go up a couple of dollars. If the other don't weatherize, they undercut my pricing and I don't sell any energy. If the requirements aren't mandatory, you can't complete.\".   When you hear about utilities not procuring enough power for the event, bear in mind that the utility pays a contract price for **scheduled power** (ie., contracted in advance). If the winter storm doesn't develop, they are still on the hook to pay for the block they reserved whether they used it or not. Sure, they can sell it on the market, but if there is no demand, they lose their ass.  The utility I retired from lost something like $80,000,000 that week, and the government did nothing to alleviate it.  It was pure market manipulation. So they will increase rates a few dollars for the next 30 years to pay it off.  So what happens if the same thing occurs next year? How far in the hole can you go?","4":"Ok. I need to read that report.    It sounds kind of crazy.   And to lose 80 million in one week? That\u2019s nuts. Was that because no one had power so they couldn\u2019t use the power created?","5":"Utilities schedule their energy use by buying \"blocks\" of energy for different times of the day. Base line energy is what's on all the time and usually the cheapest. Then as it warms up (or gets colder) the intermediate blocks are used (more expensive) and at peak you go to the peak blocks (most expensive). But under normal circumstances, peak is still maybe $30\/Mwh. When the plants started shutting down for cold related issues, utilities had to start bidding for whatever they could find. By design, that peak price was capped at $9000\/Mwh, so when the need was greatest, the price increased by x 300."}}
