Doesn't that contradict the very definition of \"infinite\"?","1":"That explains things, they don't get rigorous until 3rd year. You don't know that you don't know.","2":"That's right, look for an excuse to dismiss me again.  Cheap debaters all around","3":"You dismiss my arguments with your ignorance, I should be allowed to dismiss yours with my education.","4":"Wow. Okay. So me telling you your arguments don't prove what I'm saying is wrong is ignorant dismissal but you ignoring what I'm saying and just spatting out things that prove unrelated things is education.  Fine","5":"The rules of logic are well defined. Don't pretend to base your argument in logic if your don't understand logic.","6":"What?","7":"[Logic](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Logic)","8":"Oh fuck off. I was asking what it is exactly that is flawed in my logic. Telling me \"learn logic\" is the equivalent of \"I don't know how to prove you wrong so I'm just gonna call you dumb and run away\"","9":"the flaw in your logic was that your logic was flawed. ","10":"...what doesn't connect?","11":"Your concept of infinity. I can't analyse it logically because you never logically define it and build off of that definition to prove anything.","12":"&gt;you never logically define it  ??????  &gt;My concept of infinity is purely what the word says, \"not finite\"","13":"so from not finite, prove not comparable","14":"&gt;For all natural numbers; infinity is larger.  Lol. So they actually know they're not using actual infinity","15":"That is a definition, you are likewise defining it. I'm just giving you some help to prove that it's not comparable.","16":"I was trying to prove actual infinity isn't comparable. Turns out mathematics is aware of this and knowingly using something that's not actual infinity and calling it infinity nonetheless","17":"how is saying that infinity is larger than every finite number not make it not-finite?","18":"&gt;For all natural numbers, infinity is larger  You're equating natural numbers to infinity by comparing them","19":"so? prove I can't do that.","20":"&gt;What is comparison?   &gt;A 5m long ruler and a 2m long ruler. The first ruler is 250% the length of the second  &gt;A 4.5m long ruler and a 2m long ruler. The first is 225% the length of the second.  &gt;A 50m ruler and a 0.5m ruler. The first is 10000% the length of the second.  &gt;When one of these \"\"\"numbers is Infinite\"\"\"... Just nothing. You just can't do this.  &gt;All numbers are =0 when compared to infinity. That's illogical, therefore you can't compare infinity ","21":"&gt;You just can't do this.  what kind of proof is that? ","22":"&gt;All numbers are =0 when compared to infinity. That's illogical, therefore you can't compare infinity  Seriously?","23":"because the relative size goes to zero something is illogical? I seriously don't follow you here.","24":"&gt;because the relative size goes to zero  The relative size of EVERYTHING goes to 0. That makes everything equal everything. We don't want that in maths.","25":"relative size doesn't change absolute size.","26":"Infinity + 1 = Infinity  1 = 0","27":"your making the subtraction mistake again.","28":"Except I'm not. Infinite=Infinite and 0=0 mean the same thing so we can just replace them with each other","29":"In what world are those two expressions equivalent?","30":"... this conversation is pointless","31":"Probably, but maybe you'll get something out of it.
