What's worse, you come across as someone that has fallen for white nationalist propaganda.   The US is a shining example of the power of diversity and the necessity of immigration. In the US, half of all Fortune 500 businesses were started by immigrants or their children. Imagine the US without HALF it's economy. It would be decimated. Hell, even Trump, although he's the least popular president in US history so he's not the best example, is the son of an immigrant.","2":" &gt;You sound very confused.    About what?   &gt;What's worse, you come across as someone that has fallen for white nationalist propaganda.    The governments and media here keep saying that immigrants are good for us. How is that white nationalist?    &gt;The US is a shining example of the power of diversity and the necessity of immigration. In the US, half of all Fortune 500 businesses were started by immigrants or their children. Imagine the US without HALF it's economy. It would be decimated. Hell, even Trump, although he's the least popular president in US history so he's not the best example, is the son of an immigrant.    Wait. So half of all Fortune 500 businesses were founded by Native Americans? That's incredible.  Doesn't the US also have a huge amount of poverty, gun violence, and civil unrest though?","3":"&gt; About what?  Claiming \"migrants are so great,\" for one. Do you have quote from anyone saying this? Or are you just confused?   You also implied that all Fortune 50 companies were founded by natives. More evidence of your confusion.   &gt; How is that white nationalist?  Because you are, either willingly or not, speaking the same way about migrants as white nationalists do.   &gt; Doesn't the US also have a huge amount of poverty, gun violence, and civil unrest though?  Yeah, sort of, but mostly among people whose families have been here for generations. Immigrants have much lower crime rates than individuals born in the US.","4":"  &gt;Claiming \"migrants are so great,\" for one. Do you have quote from anyone saying this? Or are you just confused?    https:\/\/www.european-views.com\/2019\/05\/germany-learned-it-must-be-country-of-immigration-merkel-says-on-70th-constitution-anniversary\/   &gt;You also implied that all Fortune 500 companies were founded by natives. More evidence of your confusion.   Eh, no. You did. You said that half of them were founded by immigrants. Who founded the other half?    &gt;Because you are, either willingly or not, speaking the same way about migrants as white nationalists do.   How so?     &gt;Yeah, sort of, but mostly among people whose families have been here for generations. Immigrants have much lower crime rates than individuals born in the US.  Wow. So life is good for the immigrants and bad for the people who were already there?   What about the Native Americans? How did it go for them when immigrants came?","5":"&gt; https:\/\/www.european-views.com\/2019\/05\/germany-learned-it-must-be-country-of-immigration-merkel-says-on-70th-constitution-anniversary\/  Yeah, I don't see the quote in there... I see a recognition and celebration of immigration and diversity.  &gt; Who founded the other half?  Individuals that have been here for more than one generation. Native born Americans.   &gt; Wow. So life is good for the immigrants and bad for the people who were already there?  Immigrants just behave better is all.   &gt; What about the Native Americans? How did it go for them when immigrants came?  Not well. As you know, Western Civilization is founded on violence\/slavery\/genocide.","6":"You're the only one who claimed there was a quote? I tried to help you out by finding an article that has the same message from someone in power.   If we're so dangerous and genocidal then why do people want to come here? Shouldn't they be terrified of us?   And all your allusions to the \"noble savage\" are completely racist.","7":"You seem confused.","8":"That's a useful phrase for people who can't answer questions.","9":"Not all questions are created equal. And your's show a lack of clarity of thought.","10":"You can't answer these questions, what are you doing here? Proud of your lack of ability to think? Well done.","11":"another low IQ post.","12":"Thanks for answering my question.","13":"Anytime. Does it hurt that your post has zero points and has only been upvoted by 1 in 4 people?","14":"No. I don't care about upvotes. Thanks for the insight into your mindset though.","15":"I am of the mindset that those with grammatical errors in their sentence structure and an inability to articulate themselves clearly in their written responses to others are fun to fuck with because they be dumb. Thanks for continuing to allow me to play with dumb.","16":"Don't thank me, thank your thesaurus.","17":"I just downvoted your post."}}
