Never in my life has it been frowned upon to ask around. But then I worked places with clear pay guidelines like the Army and now at my union job where everyo e is on the same payscale based on which job your at that day. And hell the guy I asked about the union job was very forthright at my inquiry.  Its posts like these that make me wonder what the average age for reddit really is cause its not something I see in 20-30 somethings","2":"Almost everywhere I've worked it has been a matter of huge controversy (at least from the standpoint of the managers), and I've dipped my toes into a lot of different kinds of work.  Regarding age, I've seen a pretty wide spread between 14 and as old as mid 50's, I'm 27 myself.","3":"Thats terrible. What kind of place do you work. Maybe it depends on the type of work. Some sort of office work where you argue your salary probably would have it since they want to pay you the least you can but a union job forgoes that and everyone gets the same pay for the same job (minus if your a trainer or ERT)","4":"A lot of call centers mostly, some manufacturing and some hotels as a housekeeper. I've tried to unionize almost all of them but they always found out and either fired me or gave me the option to quit or be fired before we got too far.","5":"That just seems dumb. I know housekeeprs get bonus money based on extra rooms cleaned though and it should be clear to all what that is and what wages are made.  Employers can fire you for almost any reason. Asking wages isnt one though they can fudge some otger reason im sure. Never quit. Get fired and get unemployment especially if its a stupid call center or something that wont affect your future prospects in the field you want to end up. Employers really REALLY dont care why a crap tier minimum wage job fired you unless you broke a law.  Anyway I am just one guy. Apparently many share your experience. Sad. Good luck out there. Learn your rights!","6":"Bonus money? Not at any hotel I ever worked. Tbh they were mostly real slummy though, like \"guest literally gave birth in our hot tub and they refused to give us gloves or extra time to clean the room\" slummy. I've learned quite a bit about workers rights since then thankfully, but it's never a bad idea to keep learning.","7":"My mother works at a casino hotel. She has a quota and gets paid a bonus for each room beyond that, not much mind you like 8-12 bucks for 2, beyond her hourly\/tips. Still if you're efficient she says you can make half again your daily take just in bonus money. She says they are pretty strict though"}}
