Sperm do have senses.","2":"Thanks! Does it mean once it went through past the vagina, the environment is already safe for them?","3":"Relatively safe yes, it's a numbers game with conception. Probably the greatest factor is the motility (how good at swimming) the sperm is. Sperm can survive around 12 hours in the woman's body before dying.","4":"Alright I understand. If vagina is the real deal for sperm, that makes pregnancy without penetration seem a 0% chance of possibility despite being theoretically possible.","5":"It's not 0% though, and having a child is a lifetime commitment that changes everything so even though its less than a 1% chance, the risk is great enough to warrant extra care.","6":"Thanks for these responses. I greatly appreciate it."}}
