What benefit does alienating the lower\/working class do?","1":"Because humans are egotistical and don\u2019t give a shit about others. I am glad that I was born in Germany because in any other country my life would have ended at the age of 2.  I had leucaemia and as you can imagine the therapy costs were exorbitant. At the age of 11 I was diagnosed again and at the age of 26 I was diagnosed with a malignant carcinoma. I am quite healthy now even if my body is not as healthy as a normal persons but I am more than thankful to be alive.   You know what? The therapy costs were beyond 3 million euro but me and my family had to pay next to nothing. We wouldn\u2019t have been able to afford it. We are four people in our household and all of us earn quite well but even if we put all our earnings together for 60 years. We would still not be able to pay that amount of money.  It simply does not work without a social healthcare system.","2":"As a Brit, I completely agree. A well managed healthcare system is essential to a working society. Even in less tragic circumstances such as yours, surviving is different than living.   For what it\u2019s worth, I\u2019m glad you\u2019re here and I hope you\u2019re thriving in the way I know you deserve to, as a human, no matter your politics.","3":"Thanks a lot. I appreciate the sentiment :)","4":"Also, good profile pic! Quokkas are great","5":"Haha, yea. They're so adorable and always look happy :D"}}
