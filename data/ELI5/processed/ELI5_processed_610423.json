So unless you abolish the military and police (which I favor), there will always be pressure from lobbyists to sell more guns. That's why the NRA exists- gun manufacturers trick private owners into joining, to lobby Congress to expand the market for the manufacturers. But if you abolish the state organs of violence, there is no need for the second amendment, and no gun industries left to lobby. I applaud your attempts to end the slaughter of capitalism though.","4":"That soundsvlike an additional problem","5":"Guns aren't going anywhere until capitalism falls. Spend your energy working on the root of class conflict and the gun problem will solve itself."}}
