If there's no note happening on the beat, there's nothing to hear.  If that's an incorrect understanding, I would greatly appreciate your correction.  Amusingly enough, I actually understand the physics and neuroscience behind 'binaural beats', but it hasn't helped me understand the beats in music.","3":"Are you thinking of something like a triplet, where 3 notes are played in the normal duration of a single note?  These are always \"off beat\".","4":"I'm definitely not thinking of a triplet, because I don't know what that is.  I've been trying to understand syncopation for several years now, and what I've got so far is that it involves notes being played close to, but not on, the beat. Which presupposes that one knows when the beat happens.","5":"This [video about triplets ](https:\/\/youtu.be\/Siowg_ONsZI) explains it pretty well and let's you hear the \"off\"ness. Watch for the notes that have a \"3\" above them.","6":"Thank you! But what exactly is the 'off'ness? All of the notes are happening exactly where the score indicates that they should.","7":"The 2nd and 3rd notes of the triple are \"off\" from the normal beat of the music...yes, they are correct according to the score. The 1st note of the triplet is most often on a downbeat so it sounds like it is in the right place.   Sorry, I'm sure I'm going in the wrong direction here. If you can give us some more guidance it might trigger a better answer. I definitely know what it's like to struggle for a term re: music theory. It makes sense, but only after you've already studied lots of it."}}
