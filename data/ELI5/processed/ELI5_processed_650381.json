I know they \"don't share\", but is that a crack at aristocrats or more of a Buddhist-style respectful reference to the nobility?","1":"They are called noble gases because the ability to avoid reacting adversely when provoked or goaded is considered to be a noble trait in humans. The gases are largely unreactive to other elements, unlike the users of Reddit who are sure to poke fun at such an oddly worded question that is weakly trying to bring Philosophical discussion into the world of science.","2":"Ah, so you are by your own definition not noble","3":"Nobleness is a lifelong pursuit, it is possible to be both noble and not noble. Humans are like electrons: here, there, both, neither.","4":"That's pretty cool but is there anyway you could elaborate on that?   For example, is there anyone in either Buddhist\/Asian history or Western history who you recognize as being truly noble?   Or an example of a noble gas that is occasionally noble and occasionally not noble?","5":"Sure. With an application of some external high energy force, a noble gas can form bonds after being ionized. The most simple of which would be HeH, Helium Hydride. One Helium atom bonded to one Hydrogen atom. Probably the first compound that ever existed after the Big Bang.","6":"From the Helium Hydride wiki:   The ion was first produced in a laboratory in 1925. It is stable in isolation, but extremely reactive, and cannot be prepared in bulk, because it would react with any other molecule with which it came in contact. Noted as the strongest known\u00a0acid, its occurrence in the\u00a0interstellar medium\u00a0has been conjectured since the 1970s,[3]\u00a0and it was finally detected in April 2019.[4]  Wow that's crazy recent!"}}
