Locals do all that stuff too. I used to live there.  I like jazz, going out, eating out, bourbon st, gambling and Mardi Gras.","2":"I went because I was in military training at Keesler, and it was something we looked forward to. Lots of military people moving through the south (like me) who know they might never make it back again want to experience the city for its atmosphere and culture. Taxation was just a thought, and as you pointed out, not a very well developed one.","3":"Grew up in Biloxi :-)","4":"I honestly loved it there! If I could take the heat and the possibility of hurricanes every few years, I would seriously consider retiring there...","5":"It was better in the 90's but it's a fun place to live."}}
