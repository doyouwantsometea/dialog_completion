What is it in their brain that responds to the high pitched sounds that way?","1":"One theory that could explain some of the anger and annoyance is that the primeval part of our brain wants the noise stop because it attracts predators and puts the group in danger. I have a source somewhere but that\u2019ll take some digging...","2":"Oh wow, I didn\u2019t think of that. It makes so much sense.","3":"It was part of an article explaining that some behaviours we consider selfish or egoistic (such as having low tolerance for crying babies) are sometimes the opposite, in this case a desire to safeguard the group. And the difficulty in determining when someone is truly selfish or actin on an innate instinct.","4":"Very interesting.   So, let\u2019s say you\u2019re getting on a plane with your infant and you don\u2019t want him\/her to cause a scene because you don\u2019t want people staring, getting mad, threatening you or the baby, etc. Is that what you\u2019re talking about?","5":"Not quite. That is a more surface level, social anxiety conscious thought process. Fear of peer pressure, fear of upsetting the group. This was not about the parents, but the strangers reacting as in \u201cyour kid keeps crying and that sound will attract predators, putting you, the kid, me and everybody else in danger\u201d. The crying kid becomes a threat to the group rather than an individual needing and deserving attention. This is a base survival instinct, not a conscious thought. Often the people getting angry at crying kids for these reasons don\u2019t understand themselves why they feel this way and often feel bad about it too. The article was talking about research being done on how the lack of \u201csurvival needs\u201d in modern daily life could be resulting in people misinterpreting other peoples thought or actions as selfish or intolerant while their behavior is actually one of self-preservation (which is also selfish, but in a different way)."}}
