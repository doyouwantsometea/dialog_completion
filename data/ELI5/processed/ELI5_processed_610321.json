(Most notably online banking and govt websites)","1":"Can't say I've noticed this with my bank.   I'd guess it's around accessibility. You need to provide a service that works for the elderly, people with issues with sight such as colour blindness etc. So to provide a service that works for something like a bank it has to work for everyone. It would be pointless to provide a swish looking site that was unaccessible and could potentially lead to fines etc if you were seen to be excluding people with disabilities or a specific group of people.","2":"Thats an interesting reply, as I was prompted to ost this due to my elderly mother, who has gotten on great with technology in the past, called me as she couldn't get in to her banking.  Turned out this was because the items on the login screen are so large, you have to zoom out\/scroll sideways to fine the \"submit\" button.  Thats when I realised I've been finding this for months now, and practically given up on using such things on a phone or tablet.  Its like a return to the frames of the late 90s!","3":"And it's definitely the app and not a change to her settings?  Suppose it depends on who she banks with but there are some great examples out there of banking apps from both start ups and established banks in my opinion","4":"Its not an app. Its tge company website. This is not just banking though, its a general trend. Look at any govt website for example, they're almost impossible to navigate due to nothing but a few massive buttons.  Look at this monstrosity for example : https:\/\/www.barclaycard.co.uk\/","5":"Will do. Just need your password and log in details \ud83e\udd20"}}
