If they are hired for a job, and then they do the job, with the same time and effort as a male, then they should be paid the same for it.  Are you saying that because there are more men in positions that require certain aspects of physical labour, then all women are deserving of lesser pay?  Ultimately, if you do the job, you should be paid for it. Penis, vagina, both or neither.   I\u2019d go further, but your post history is about as misogynistic as it can get, so all the best to you, and I hope you have a nice day. Peace, love and all that.  Source: a dude.","2":"The pay is decided by the outcome, the result. If the result is less, then pay should also be less. Don't you agree? ","3":"Yes, but you are shifting the question. You assume that a female will do lower quality work, therefore deserving the pay. The question was why do women demand equal pay?  In labor positions, say if I want a deck built, and I get a deck built, then I pay for my built deck. If the person I chose to build my deck builds it well, then I pay them well. So yes, it\u2019s about quality, but penis doesn\u2019t equal quality. ","4":"The misandry is uncalled for. I will pay whoever has done a good job. Gender doesn't matter here. Like better sales, or better project management. Men are better at these jobs and get paid well. Women on the other hand lack skills and still demand \"equal\" pay, which is unfair. ","5":"Why are men better in these positions? I am an engineer, and encounter women on a daily basis, a lot of them who would be better than me in my own position. You can\u2019t say \u201call women are bad\u201d in the same way I can\u2019t say \u201call men are rapists\u201d. It\u2019s a broad and generalising statement that doesn\u2019t take into account all number  of factors. Female bodybuilders would make great bouncers in the same way male bodybuilders would, even though it\u2019s a male dominated career.  I\u2019ll keep being misanthropic as long as I like, as you feel like this blatant sexism is warranted in 20-fucking-19."}}
