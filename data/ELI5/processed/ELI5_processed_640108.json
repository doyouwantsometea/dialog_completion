If you try to stand, it's likely to go running down your leg! They do sell \"female urinating devices\" which are basically funnels which help females go standing up if they're hiking or are in the military and aren't able to squat to go.","2":"How come it would go down ur leg and not straight down if u stand up? It seems like maybe u could use a urinal if u just like push ur hips forward?","3":"There's a chance, yes. But it's unpredictable and I sure wouldn't want to take that chance. From some of my male friends I've heard that sometimes the stream from their penis might go off in a different direction instead of straight out for no apparent reason. It's a bit like that.   Also keep in mind that once females (and males) hit puberty, they start growing pubic hair which might also get in the way.","4":"Oh ya sometimes it just like goes kinda weird but it\u2019s usually easy to fix for me I guess. I didn\u2019t know that girls got it like under like that? I thought it was just like on the top ya know","5":"You mean pubic hair? Yeah it usually grows in front, on down between the legs and a little bit on the butt hole area. It's just often seen as taboo, so some women shave or wax to get rid of it. But that's her decision to make and its perfectly find to keep it all or remove it all. Shaving and waxing can hurt and cause ingrown hairs which is one reason some may not want to remove the hair.","6":"So do boys get it not just on the top to? I thought it was just be like above everything","7":"Boys definitely get it between the legs too. Again, some decide to remove the hair, and some don't.","8":"How come they don\u2019t tell us this in school? I haven\u2019t had puberty yet and I\u2019m kinda scared cus i don\u2019t rlly know what\u2019s gonna happen","9":"Now that is a good question... I know I had some sex education in school but it wasn't very good. It's a common problem in schools because people are scared to talk about it. Some of the fear is that it will encourage kids to start having sex early but I think it's important for everyone to know how the body works. Everyone has one, so why hide it?  Kids need to know what is normal and what is not normal, so if there is a problem, they can talk to a doctor. Puberty is scary with everything changing and a lot of people feel shame about it when they shouldn't. I'm glad you're asking questions ahead of time so you're a little more prepared.","10":"How come things for girls are so much more complicated but for boys it\u2019s not that much","11":"It's just how the human body is. \u00af\\_(\u30c4)_\/\u00af Can't do much about it. Lots of religions have stories that give reasons if that's something you believe in.  Although I think it is pretty flippin awesome that women can grow a child inside of her. And then feed it with her own body too. It's like a superpower.","12":"Is it ok if I message u and ask a couple questions?","13":"Yeah go ahead!"}}
