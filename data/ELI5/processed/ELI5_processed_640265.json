You can furnish a nursery for $50 from garage sales, $200 from ikea, or $5000 from pottery barn kids.  Clothe your child for $0.25 a piece from a garage sale, $3.00 a piece on sale at caters, or $50 a piece from Kissy Kissy.    You can split childcare with another family where you watch each other\u2019s kids half the time and each family has one parent working part time and watching their kids part time, or spend $2000 per month per child at a premium daycare.  Free public school or $2000 per month private school.  Kid buys their own car when they turn 16 from working, or buy your child a $20,000 car.  Have your child take out student loans vs $200,000 sending them to a private college.  Although many of these studies don\u2019t include college.","2":"Agreed, but the calculated average of $300k per child (in the US) is what people end up spending, whether they needed to or not.","3":"I have seen closer to $230,000, but regardless, much of that is disposable income that parents want to spend.  Just because the average cost of a car is high doesn\u2019t mean someone poor has to buy an expensive car, it just means people who have money like to spend it on cars.  I have the income to do so, so I spend a lot of money on my daughter because it makes me happy.  And that increases the average but others don\u2019t have to.  Basically the number is high because people want to spend money on their kids.  Nobody needs a $1000 crib.","4":"Not saying you are wrong, but is your idea that the cost to raise a child has not increased over the years, but parent's desire to spend more on them has?","5":"Sort of.  Since people are having fewer kids they have the ability to do more for the kids they do have.  Also having kids at an older age means they have more money.  Also, it inflates the cost when both parents work so they have to pay child care, but rarely does someone work if they can\u2019t make more than childcare costs.  So instead of staying home with their children, they earn $40,000 per year and pay $20,000 per year in child care.  In the end they have more money than if they stayed home with their kids, but studies like these make it look like it is costing the family $20,000 more than previous generations.    I buy a lot of stuff that would be considered for my daughter because it makes my life easier or because I get more enjoyment buying something for her than something for myself.  But all those costs go into looking like it is just expensive to have kids.","6":"Interesting. So, slightly different question. Do you think that the buying of these \"luxury\" items, things that make the parents happy but of course the kids don't know any different at first (like your example of a fancy onesie)...do you think that parents buying these things influences their kids to want\/need more when they grow up?  I get the feeling that the typical millennial doesn't want to want the fancy things our generation bought like mortgages and marriages, fancy clothes and big cars, etc but when they grow up with it, they don't know any better. Then they feel pressure to get the corporate job they never wanted, rather than the non college profession that makes them happy, but won't buy these things.  I wonder if this generation's parents are giving their kids the best, while sentencing them to want an unaffordable lifestyle later on.","7":"I think there is a difference in spoiling a child and overspending on a child.  I seriously doubt my daughter is going to end up feeling like she needs expensive things because her mom wanted her to have an expensive Easter dress or an expensive crib.  On the other hand, if I buy her a toy every time I took her to the supermarket, that probably will spoil her.  I\u2019m sure it is easier in theory than in practice, but I intend to make sure my children understand the value of money and that everything in life is a trade off.  It is possible to make more money but there are sacrifices to do so.  And while some passion projects might not earn as much, there is also a difference in making less because you choose something you love, and making less because you simply chose to be lazy."}}
