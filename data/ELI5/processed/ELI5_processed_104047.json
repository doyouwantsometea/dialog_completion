You're talking about completely fucking yourself ten ways from Sunday in order to escape something that's not even likely to happen.  Also, \"shiteating murder brigade\"? Who the hell have you been listening to?","2":"My conscience.","3":"Clearly not, if you came out the other end with \"shiteating murder brigade.\"","4":"I literally could not care less about a random reddit transphobe\u2019s opinion about my conscience. Why don\u2019t you go suck some boots or something.","5":"Ah, see, you've made a fatal flaw in your reasoning, champ.  I'm not a transphobe; far from it. Trans individuals have my sympathy; they have a tough goddamn row to hoe, and anyone who says otherwise is lying to themselves.  *However.* That doesn't mean that I think mutilating one's body is the proper response.  Now that we've cleared that up, do you want to try again?  EDIT: Secondary question, why did you come up with \"transphobe\" just because I'm philosophically disinclined towards reassignment surgery?","6":"I still think you\u2019re a transphobe, and i have no interest in what you have to say, champ.","7":"You're wrong, and I've told you why.  Care to try again?","8":"I\u2019m good, thanks. Go suck some boots and jack off to a picture of Trumps face or smthng.","9":"Ah, more flaws in your reasoning.  Shall I dissect those as well, or are you going to keep being a jackass?","10":"Pee pee poo poo","11":"Ah. This is the level you sink to.  Amazing.","12":"eat shit","13":"I don't think I will.  What I *wanted* to do was have a conversation, but apparently you're not suited for it, for whatever reason.","14":"using italics doesn\u2019t make you correct","15":"Saying \"pee pee poo poo\" doesn't make you correct.  Calling me a 'transphobe' doesn't make you correct.","16":"jsyk, every time you reply to me I make a donation to Bernie Sanders","17":"And why do you think that has an effect on me?  Waste your money the way you want to; no skin off my back.  Hell, for all you know, I support Sanders, too.","18":"Idk if it does it or not, I\u2019m just seeing how many times I can get you to reply","19":"What if I'm seeing the same thing?","20":"good for you, pee pee poo poo man","21":"That doesn't make you correct, pee pee poo poo man."}}
