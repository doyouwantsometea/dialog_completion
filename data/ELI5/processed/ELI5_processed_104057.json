Doesn't that contradict the very definition of \"infinite\"?","1":"&gt; Exactly. This doesn't solve the infinite sum, this solves the equation. The equation represents the sum, but is not the sum itself.  The solution to the equation is the sum, just as x = 2 is both the sum and the solution to 1 + 1 = x. What is so hard to grasp about this?  &gt;But cardinality of infinite sets is not Infinity itself  It's a measure of the size of infinite sets, which determines what infinites are bigger or smaller than others. This is exactly what you asked by starting this thread. You can't just dismiss the mathematics of comparing infinities because you don't understand it.","2":"&gt;The solution to the equation is the sum, just as x = 2 is both the sum and the solution to 1 + 1 = x. What is so hard to grasp about this?  ...Right, because there's no difference between the way you solve 1+1 and the way you \"solve\" an infinite sum  &gt;It's a measure of the size of infinite sets, which determines what infinites are bigger or smaller than others. This is exactly what you asked by starting this thread. You can't just dismiss the mathematics of comparing infinities because you don't understand it.  But I do understand it, what I don't understand is how mathematics acts as if what they're talking about is actual infinity. This is not infinity, not if you can compare it. Do you not understand the impossibility of comparing something impossible?","3":"I'm thinking the issue is that someone misled you about the nature of infinity and now you are at a point that you need to unlearn some wrong ideas before you'll make any progression towards a deeper understanding about the nature of infinities. Your talking as if infinity is some concept independent of mathematics when it's not. There is nothing about the nature of infinity that makes it incomparable to anything else, despite whatever you have been told.","4":"&gt;There is nothing about the nature of infinity that makes it incomparable to anything else, despite whatever you have been told.  It's not anything I've been told. In fact, I used to just believe what my math teachers said, and different sizes of infinity was one of those things. It's after becoming more skeptical that I've been able to truly thing through the concept of infinity. Realising it is impossible.  &gt;Your talking as if infinity is some concept independent of mathematics when it's not.  It is. Of course it is. Because it's impossible. How can anyone pretend to operate, study or even just imagine something impossible?","5":"Show that it's impossible then. You haven't given my any reason to believe you.","6":"If it was possible it would make sense, if it was possible, Infinite=Infinite would be true, Infinite-Infinite=0 would be true, Infinite+1=Infinite would be true and therefore 1=0 would be true.","7":"If infinite \/= infinite, then infinite +1 \/= infinite +1 and so 1 \/= 1. See, I can do it too, you haven't fixed the issue.","8":"...yeah  When did I give the impression that I thought it was 0? I think I said precisely the opposite","9":"You made the assumption in your derivation that 1 = 0 starting from inf = inf. I pointed out you made a mistake and so you didn't prove any logical fallacy.","10":"Uh... You do realise i can just erase that \"step\" and the whole thing is the exact same?","11":"No you can't, not without making another mistake. I've done enough derivations to see that.","12":"...  Infinity=Infinity  Infinity+1=Infinity  1=0","13":"How do you get rid of the infinities on each side without subtracting?","14":"Subtracting one thing from one side from the other is the same as just eliminating, ignoring, its existance.","15":"No it's not. It's shorthand for subtracting. You made a mistake, admit it and learn from it.","16":"xD  Subtracting is shorthand for ignoring. You just made a mistake, admit it and learn from it.","17":"whoa, sick burn dude...","18":"Sick burn but realise it's the same thing","19":"Sure, I admit it. I've been ignoring your dumber remarks for the sake of argument."}}
