So the job isn't the same if the result is different. ","3":"1) Show me those stats. 2) Yes it is. The act of doing the job and the outcome of the job are two separate things.","4":"So, you agree that the pay should be based on the outcome. If the outcome is less than a man, then the pay should be less than a man. It is only fair. ","5":"No I said the opposite of that.","6":"Then it is not fair, isn't it? You are demanding equal pay for an unequal outcome. ","7":"I'm not demanding anything. I think equal pay for each person doing the same job makes sense.  Are you suggesting all jobs should be paid in a similar scheme to commission based jobs? That would probably be too big an overhaul of the system, too difficult to monitor etc."}}
