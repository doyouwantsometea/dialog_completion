It just depends on how many water molecules it takes to make the most stable crystal.\u201c","3":"Oh thats nifty, thank you friend","4":"No problem. Are you into chemistry too, or just curious?","5":"Both, i love chemistry and your quesion got me all curious. If you enjoy just watching reactions and experiments i would reccomend you check out \"Nile Red\" on youtube, fantastic videos on super interesting topics","6":"I\u2018m more into analytical chemistry like HPLC, GC, MS etc. but I\u2018ll give it a shot. Thanks for recommending it."}}
