Typically the ones less open to a casual hairstyle are the more \"professional\" (e.g., law firm, banking) while \"blue collar\" (e.g., construction) are more accepting as long as it does not interfere with safety.  A number of offices have become much more casual over the past year so hairstyles vary.  Some retail are open, but some are also trying to have a consistent look to their employees to match the store (think A&amp;F, or Bath &amp; Body Works)","2":"But why do you think it isn't as acceptable for lawyers, bankers, etc? Do you think it'll ever be majorly acceptable for them?","3":"I think there is a strong sense of what they feel is professionalism - if you dress in an expensive suit and have your hair perfectly manicured it tells everyone \"look how successful I am.c\"  not tht I agree with it, but that is the general sense I have gotten over the years.","4":"But why hasn't the professionalism norm changed much","5":"Good question.  From my understanding it has been that way since those professions began.  Probably a good doctoral thesis for a sociologist!"}}
