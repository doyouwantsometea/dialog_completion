In that case, mlms make the world function......  A ponzi scheme requires there to be an exaggerated or novalue behind the product being bought or sold. If everyone just held their stocks, (thus demand for buying stocks just froze), then people would sell their stocks (potentially liquidating the company) or stock holders would then demand dividends. Either way, there is value behind the product (ownership) being exchanged...  And yes, companies do typically buy back stock during recession (the opposite of dilluting) to manage stock prices, which is based on the majority of stock holders decision.","2":"The difference with wholesalers, is that there is intrinsic value, i.e. Food, water, etc. Stocks don't have intrinsic value. And there's competition for the same objecrlt, e.g. Tomatoes. MLMs don't have competition, because you buy it from the company only.  And company buying shares back during recessions is what I mean by non-dividend shares as not being not intrinsically valuable. People only sell things that have less value while being held. So non-dividend shares are valuable like art. Whatever the buyers decides.","3":"So wholesalers.   A) there is intrinsic value, as you have partial ownership of material goods (what the company owns)   B) the competition is between companies, aka you can buy that companies stock or this companies stock. The stock values are extremely competitive within an industry.  It really feels like I'm helping you write a highschool econ paper...  Also given the way these things are being spread out, we will come back to ponzi schemes, one topic at a time (for now wholesalers or mlm","4":"But that's the key right? You own something you have no control over.  You can buy stocks between companies, but that's like selling apples and oranges. They're both fruits, but they're still different things.","5":"You didn't answer or acknowledge the limitations of being wholesales (aka mlm), so i will assume this is based on mlm.  When i buy apples directly from an orchard, i take the risk (just like buying stock) that i can sell them at a profit to grocers (who sell them to the consumers who consume them). I have no control over whether or not the grocers will buy them or not. I may end up with rotting apples because i didn't realize that people now hate apples...","6":"But that's not doing market research. Maybe the analogy is not the best to price your point, but you can easily ensure you have sales before purchasing.   Also, you have the intrinsic value of apples which you can eat (I assume you're not allergic to it). So even though you may lose some of your money (the apples rot) you're guaranteed a certain level of return regardless. Hell, even rotten apples can be turned into compost for further loss mitigation. There's so much more flexibility there.","7":"Market research also shows that stocks are valuable, so your previous point is invalid. Why would i buy stock if i knew the value was frozen?  Your analogy would make purchasing any currency in foreign currency moot. I could invest in buying yen, i can't eat that, but correctly i can use it to buy apples.... likewise for bolts, 2 by 4s, etc....","8":"Point 1. You are correct. But that's not different in investing in nike shoes or luxury bags to resell later. The value of the stock comes from perception rather than anything thay can be more objectively discerned (dividends). E.g. Nike shoes are inherently shoes, so they have a level of intrinsic value. But is it worth 1k, is a matter of perception.  Point 2. Actually that highlights my point. If you invest in yen and try to use it in another country, it is very likely most places will not accept the currency unless you are willing to trade at a decent or significant loss. So that investment makes no sense because it is unusable until converted, which requires a person willing to trade it.   Furthermore, from another comment, someone said that money is useless until spent, which I fully agree with. But the reason why money always remains valuable is because it is the only form of negotiation with the government for the world's most valuable asset: land."}}
