But, that buying is an effect, not the cause. The prices goes up because people believe that the company is worth more than what it is selling for. If a company has 100 shares (each stock is 1% ownership, and the stocks are a dollar each, then on the stock market, the company is worth 100$. If the company's balance sheet (net worth in actual assets) is worth 120$, then people will buy it (assuming no other variables) because by buying it, you get 1.20$ for 1$. As more people buy it, the availability of the stock decreases, which makes each share sell for more.   Never ever buy stock just because someone else did or that it is expensive. The value of the stock is based on the company it represents.","2":"but like I said, what does it it matter if it's extremely rare other than the fact that it's extremely rare? If you're not getting anything back from a higher valued company (other than just selling the stock, which still does not benefit the buyer), it's really just worthless though.  The answer I got from another commenter is the prospect of eventual dividends.","3":"Supply and demand affect scarcity and scarcity drives value in all markets. If i buy a stock for a dollar and sell it in a year for 3 dollars, i have realized value. If i didn't buy that 1 dollar stock, I'd have only a single dollar, not the extra 2.","4":"sure, but there also needs to be inherent value or perceived value. If I decide to draw a random squiggle with my blood on a piece of paper, that would be a very scarce object, yet I do not think that people would be paying millions for it.  So my question is, what is the inherent value of a stock that (let's assume) never returns dividends.","5":"The inherent value comes from the owned assets of the company. The company owns physical goods (land, equipment, cash, etc) stock is ownership of that company and thus ownership of the goods owned by the company.","6":"but in most cases, you don't get to sell any of those possessions though.","7":"No, instead, you can sell the stock you bought for money. Which, is in essense selling the partial ownership of those assets. It's not really different than you selling the physical goods yourself. You buy stock (partial ownership of physical goods), then you sell that ownership.","8":"but that's really my question. If you have partial ownership, then why aren't you getting dividends?   Jeff Bezos is only rich because people buy the shares he sells. If literally no one bought his shares, he would only be worth his paycheck.","9":"Because the company can either reinvest that money into the company, ideally so the company becomes more valuable. Or, it can pay out dividends. The decision comes from whether the stockholders (in aggregate) think the company can use that money to make the company more valuable than what the stockholder can normally do.   Using you example earlier, if you made hundreds of your blood paintings, you wouldn't be rich, because no one would buy them. It's basic economics at that point, partial ownership of Amazon is more valued than your paintings are.   Amazon continues to expand its services and logistics network with the money it could spend on dividends. If it paid out dividends, it wouldn't be building as many new distribution centers and becoming more valuable to its customers who buy things from amazon. By doing so, it makes amazon ownership more valuable."}}
