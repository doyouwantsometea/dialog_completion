Doesn't that contradict the very definition of \"infinite\"?","1":"the flaw in your logic was that your logic was flawed. ","2":"...what doesn't connect?","3":"Your concept of infinity. I can't analyse it logically because you never logically define it and build off of that definition to prove anything.","4":"&gt;you never logically define it  ??????  &gt;My concept of infinity is purely what the word says, \"not finite\"","5":"so from not finite, prove not comparable","6":"&gt;For all natural numbers; infinity is larger.  Lol. So they actually know they're not using actual infinity","7":"That is a definition, you are likewise defining it. I'm just giving you some help to prove that it's not comparable.","8":"I was trying to prove actual infinity isn't comparable. Turns out mathematics is aware of this and knowingly using something that's not actual infinity and calling it infinity nonetheless","9":"how is saying that infinity is larger than every finite number not make it not-finite?","10":"&gt;For all natural numbers, infinity is larger  You're equating natural numbers to infinity by comparing them","11":"so? prove I can't do that.","12":"&gt;What is comparison?   &gt;A 5m long ruler and a 2m long ruler. The first ruler is 250% the length of the second  &gt;A 4.5m long ruler and a 2m long ruler. The first is 225% the length of the second.  &gt;A 50m ruler and a 0.5m ruler. The first is 10000% the length of the second.  &gt;When one of these \"\"\"numbers is Infinite\"\"\"... Just nothing. You just can't do this.  &gt;All numbers are =0 when compared to infinity. That's illogical, therefore you can't compare infinity ","13":"&gt;You just can't do this.  what kind of proof is that? ","14":"&gt;All numbers are =0 when compared to infinity. That's illogical, therefore you can't compare infinity  Seriously?","15":"because the relative size goes to zero something is illogical? I seriously don't follow you here.","16":"&gt;because the relative size goes to zero  The relative size of EVERYTHING goes to 0. That makes everything equal everything. We don't want that in maths.","17":"relative size doesn't change absolute size.","18":"Infinity + 1 = Infinity  1 = 0","19":"your making the subtraction mistake again.","20":"Except I'm not. Infinite=Infinite and 0=0 mean the same thing so we can just replace them with each other","21":"In what world are those two expressions equivalent?","22":"... this conversation is pointless","23":"Probably, but maybe you'll get something out of it.
