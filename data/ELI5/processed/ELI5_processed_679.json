In general they take deposits from individuals and make loans, as well as offering services like credit cards.   Investment banking works more with the markets directly relating to financial securities (stocks, bonds, derivatives, etc) and financial advisory services. But investment banks do not take deposits.   Want to have your company go public and be listed on a stock exchange? The can determine a listing price and distribution. Need to issue $10B in bonds, they can partner with other firms to create the terms and get them sold. Want to merge with another company? They help with due diligence and the terms and the funding (loans, stock conversions, etc.).  Traditionally (at least since the 1933 Glass\u2013Steagall legislation) these were separate institutions. Many banks collapsed (for instance) when they used deposits to speculate on the markets. These functions are still separate but can be housed in one corporation. And most investment banks chose or were pressured to become commercial banks (at least from a regulatory perspective) after the crisis of 2008.","2":"Thanks so much for the insight! I'm working on a report where market making is relevant so I'm trying to build a proper base of understanding, this really puts me on a path. Anything else (specifically in relevance to market making) that you think I should familiarize myself with?","3":"Is this a school report? If so, is it for high school, college?","4":"Actually it's work-related, I'm putting together research that will basically play an xx 101 role for others on various topics, this being one of the more elaborate ones.","5":"Keep in mind that commercial banks and investment banks now often coexist under one holding company.  Also, the concept of Broker-Dealer is important from a regulatory perspective.   wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Broker-dealer  Regulation is a whole other ball of wax (Chinese Walls!).","6":"This is so great, thanks again!"}}
