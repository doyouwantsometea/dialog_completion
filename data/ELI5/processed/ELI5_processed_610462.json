What is it in their brain that responds to the high pitched sounds that way?","1":"As someone with sensory issues, I can confirm a screaming child triggers a stress response in me that makes me want to throw the kid in a river.","2":"Can you elaborate please? What exactly do you suffer from?","3":"I haven't been diagnosed with anything, but I'm more sensitive to sound than others. I used to sleep very badly with noises around me until I got earplugs made which made such a big difference. At work I also notice I react to noise a lot more than others.","4":"Sounds exactly like Misophonia. You should look into that if you haven\u2019t already. Also, maybe try ASMR when going to sleep. It\u2019s good for stress relaxation.","5":"That may be part of it, but I'm sure it originates from general elevated sensitivity to sound. Either way it's not really a problem except for sleep and the right earplugs solve that, so don't really need another solution"}}
