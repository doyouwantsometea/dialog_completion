So even a 100% vacuum with no particles has these particles in it. Plus, certain energy fields (eg gravity) would extend into it, and obviously gravity isn't nothing.","2":"Honestly I wouldn't doubt it if as technology gets better, we don't discover a way to remove everything from something. Or atleast observe where it's happened somewhere else. At one point we did think the earth the center of the universe, after all.","3":"Ehh maybe. but I highly doubt it. Keep in mind I don't have a background in physics, just know some stuff. But like how would we get rid of forces? I think the closest you can get is, what is in between? As in, what's in between the nuclear of an atom, and the electron. Well the only thing that can be there is the strong force. But if we can granulate that, which I'm not sure is or is not possible, what in between that?","4":"Questions that will hopefully be answered in time!","5":"Yeah, I mean, they could've already figure it out. We might be too uninformed to know lol"}}
