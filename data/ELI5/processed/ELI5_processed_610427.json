Being addicted to nicotine is a disease. Drinking isn't a disease. Being addicted to alcohol is a disease. It's when you cross into dependence or when it impacts your life is when you are now part of a disease process. I have a drink or two during the month, but I'm not an addict. That's the key point. It doesn't change my life around it. Society has just decided that alcoholism and drug use are addictions, but fuck you for it. Even though there are quite a few disease states of choice.","2":"What other things that people are addicted to are now classified as a disease? Does card collecting count?","3":"Addiction is the disease. What you are addicted to doesn't matter in terms of being a disease itself","4":"So if you\u2019re diagnosed addicted to collecting cards you\u2019re entitled to the medical and financial support to the same level of an alcoholic?","5":"Well, not really because there needs to be organizations and such for funding. Gambling and alcohol and drugs all get attention and funding, but addiction is a disease."}}
