No, it's called a disease because it meets the standard definition of a disease, as described above in other comments.  The writers of South Park are not medical experts, and you shouldn't perceive their jokes as medical opinions.","2":"As if anybody takes South Park seriously dipshit.   So because a bunch or unknown doctors call something a disease everyone just agrees. Cool.","3":"Uh, they're not \"unknown.\"  It's not like they publish or present shit under pseudonyms.  If you want, you can sit down and read a bunch of addiction medicine literature.  You could even reach out to the authors and ask them specific questions, and they would probably be happy answer them.  And yeah, doctors are generally who get to determine if something is a disease or not.","4":"You know not all doctors are the same. Some are bad at being doctors.","5":"This isn't a couple random \"bad doctors.\"  This is a general consensus in medicine.","6":"If we were having this exact same conversation in the 30s when it wasn\u2019t classified as a disease your righteous demeanour defending your incredible doctors would be a whole different story. Everything is only correct at the time the general consensus says it is. Or would you then be arguing *against* all the doctors at the time saying it should be a disease?","7":"If it met the definition of disease, then yes.  I think r\/gue or r\/changemyview is what you're looking for.  People have very clearly explained to you why it's referred to as a disease.  You were clearly never genuinely interested in an explanation, but rather have some beef with the physiology of mental illness being called a disease state.","8":"Wrong. Just trying to have a conversion where I don\u2019t suck the dick of the first answer. Get off your high horse."}}
