At a certain point it becomes impossible for humans to survive somewhere if the gravity is too strong. Some bacteria could survive at several thousand times earth's gravity, but we can only survive at a few times earth's gravity.","2":"So it's more a case of sustain human life then? Considering there are fish that have evolved to deal with the pressure of at hundreds of meters below sea level would it not also be possible of life forms having evolved to deal with much higher gravity?","3":"Yeah, it's possible. But once you get to 1000s of gs, only a few types of bacteria could live there.","4":"1000s, would the difference be so big between planets? (No mention of how large this planet is)","5":"I apologize, I didn't mean to say that a planet would have 1000s, I was just pointing out that there are still bacteria that have been shown to survive at that gravity.","6":"Article (to me at least) is quite ambiguous as to whether they mean 'can't sustain human life' or 'can't sustain life in general'."}}
