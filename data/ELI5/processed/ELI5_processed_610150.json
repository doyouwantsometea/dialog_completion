Every major business does this. Most new hires will be bombarding with training videos and employee handbooks saying unions are bad.  They can have anti-union literature and posters in break rooms. They can fire people who express pro-union sentiments and claim it was for another reason. They can threaten to do all kinds of thing. ","2":"The other guy in the thread showed me how they actually do legally prevent workers from unionizing. ","3":"I'm not sure what you mean. All the things I said above are legal. If workers follow the proper laws and procedures and vote to unionize, a company can't just say \"no\" and send the cops to slaughter everyone like they used to. They can do all sorts of things to prevent unionization or retaliate for successful or unsuccessful efforts, but they can't just say \"no\" and that's the end.","4":"They can because you cannot verify the amount of signatures needed to unionize.  Simply put- more people work at Walmart than people live in the states Vermont and New Hampshire combined. ","5":"That's wrong and doesn't make any sense, and I know because I do labor organizing","6":"You really think one person could approach over a third of the 2.2 million people that work for Walmart since they won't all agree, are you a labor board that turns a blind eye to corporations making your job null to them?","7":"I don't even know where to start. That's not how any of this works *at all.*"}}
