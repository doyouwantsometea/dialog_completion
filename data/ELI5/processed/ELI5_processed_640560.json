Mooo! COVID-19 = \"The Common Cold Scandal of 2020\" If Donald was a CEO for GM they would be zoomed in on automobile deaths and include people who die of heart attack in The backseat and also those people who die of lung cancer due to exhaust fumes, and even people who have sticker shock when they go car shopping!! You people are so easily corralled like the cows you all are. WAKE up. You have been made to believe the common cold is COVID.  Every time in your life when you were sick with fever and sore throat and took a few ibuprofen and went into work or school you killed people... Only difference is we were not using the media to hyper inflate and sensationalize it to remove a president. I don't like Donald and I would never vote for him and I can see through this scam. I guess if you hate the guy enough your willing to believe anything even if afterward you live in a cardboard box and are picking through a garbage can to eat and feed your family...  Lol","2":"Are you okay buddy?","3":"Just gets tiring watching the \"smart ones\" actually try to make a scam seem real. Of course ibdont think there is any conspiracy. Seems to me the media hypnotized the entire planet of apes that the common cold is a pandemic.. lol.  I hear a guy was hit by a bus and ran over by a car and then someone shot him and the cause of death?? COVID-19... Lol.  It gets old wjen I've seen these scams happen over and over. And the \"smart ones\" lead is into another war or some conflict that afyerward everyone wakes up and no-one owns up how they foolishly followed the narrative and didn't think for themselves.  The common cold scam..  lol","4":"Idk man, just feels more and more like someone put the writers of Southpark in charge of reality.","5":"It is funny how that episode came out four years ago and yet all of the people still believe what our media says. It's kinda silly. That is a great episode though. Ha ha"}}
