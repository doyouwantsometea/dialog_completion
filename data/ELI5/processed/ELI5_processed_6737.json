It basically boils down to the fact that they (the majority of them) don't have the mental capacity to either plan ahead or remember what they just did 5 seconds ago. It's auto pilot instinct.","2":"Bugs such as bees have plotted routes to and from sources of pollen, etc., so there has to be more of a capacity for memory\/planning than that.  Even if there isn't, if would explain the seemingly random movements of their flight patterns at times (for some bugs), but it doesn't explain their insistence on buzzing in circles around your face until you escape the area or swat it away.","3":"Well, I just told you. They do it because they're homing in on you but they don't have the brains to know that you just swatted them a second ago. They're only goal is to dodge the current swat.","4":"That wasn't the question. Homing in on you for what? Not all bugs that buzz around your face are females looking to suck your blood.   Gotta say, your coming across as condescending while not answering the actual question.","5":"Well, it's a poorly worded question and depends greatly on the bug if that's what the question is asking.","6":"Nah. It's a simple question on a subreddit where the point is to answer the question as if the person asking the question is five years old.  There are over 100 other comments on here, but you're the only one out of all of them who seems bothered by the question.  If you can't understand this simple question, as everyone else here does, maybe you're jist not qualified to be answering questions a five year old would ask.  Again, try to be less condescending, especially when you don't have the answer."}}
