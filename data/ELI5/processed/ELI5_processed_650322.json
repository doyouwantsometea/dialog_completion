Proof beyond a shadow of a doubt is not really a legal crux that occurs. There's multiple accusers with very distinct stories and timelines. It was probably a little bit of he said she said but when you have many voices for this she said side and gets easier with each voice that stands. It took so long for him to see Justice because of his power but that just meant that they were more voices to stand against him when he finally saw his day in court.","2":"&gt;Proof beyond a shadow of a doubt is not really a legal crux that occurs.  That's why I said \"beyond reasonable doubt\", which is the legal standard. And generally in crimes punishable by decades in prison the standard for what is  \"reasonable\" doubt needs to be set pretty high.  &gt;There's multiple accusers with very distinct stories and timelines. It was probably a little bit of he said she said but when you have many voices for this she said side and gets easier with each voice that stands.  They were individual cases though. It's not 1 he said 20+ she said, but 20+ he-said-she-said. Based on this logic if a moderately large group of people conspire against someone, and invent stories, they can get that person convicted. Example - I, too, saw her flying on her broom and coveting with demonic spirits - she most certainly is a witch.   So what you are saying is that there was no conclusive evidence whatsoever? That the man was convicted based on hearsay?","3":"I just want you to know that you're coming off as an abuser who's trying to defend a well-known abuser. For their own mental gymnastic games. The testimony of those women was enough to convince him. That many women are not lying and to infer as much is disgusting behavior that you need to reflect deeply on.","4":"&gt;I just want you to know that you're coming off as an abuser who's trying to defend a well-known abuser.  English common law is doomed if people are this sensitive, and disregard logic for feelings. The man, no matter what he did, was seemingly convicted based on a rumour.","5":"No he was convicted on testimony. Testimony isn't just pointing a finger. It's a long drawn out process with corroboration and it's so much more than just accusations. I'm not sensitive, I'm letting you know the opinion I've formed about you based on your comments.","6":"&gt;Testimony isn't just pointing a finger  In this case it was though. Literally women pointing their fingers saying \"he raped me\".","7":"And that's all it takes because it's true. What you're inferring is anybody who accuses rape is lying. These women are not lying just to take down a powerful man. They told the truth and the law caught up to him."}}
