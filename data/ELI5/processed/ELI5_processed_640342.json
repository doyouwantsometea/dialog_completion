This field decays rapidly, but at the time it has decayed the universe is already either very big or even infinite. Can this matter be generated out of nothing? What about the energy in the universe? Well, there's none or only a tiny amount of energy equivalent to the initial matter. All the stars you see run on debt, the debt is paid for by gravity in an expanding universe. There's literally nothing if everything would be packed together.  One more discovery that's quite recent, is that the initial conditions to forming a universe may be present inside a black hole. When a new universe is formed, it will pinch off from this one and live a separate life, unconnected to ours.","2":"The debt concept is something that\u2019s very interesting.
