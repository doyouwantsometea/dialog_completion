It can go both ways. I just gave you a dictionary definition of a sport of which hockey meets all the criteria. You honestly can't be this stupid.","2":"Correct. I am not that stupid. You googled the definition of it, I am thinking more for myself about what it means. And I've landed on, if you're kicking\/hitting\/chasing a puck\/ball\/whatever around.. Its a game. You play a game. You don't play a fight. Best explanation I can give you as to where I'm coming from. ","3":"In that case fighting wouldn't be a sport. It would be a fight.","4":"I would agree with that. A fight is just a fight unless people are watching. Then it's better than hockey :) ","5":"Having a preference for a certain sport is fine. But that doesn't make the ones you prefer less not a sport.","6":"One of us arguing anyway. "}}
