I read all your replies in this post and you are clearly coming off as asking your question in bad faith. You didn't even try to understand what that one guy replied to you and shot off with \"revisionist\" crap. The question isn't even a good one because there is a lot of material out there that explains the answer to this. I honestly can't understand if you were taught so much about it in school, how they managed to skip over that pretty important part.   It has nothing to do with mentioning Hitler in a historical context getting people upset. It's people feeling like you are fishing.","2":"Fascism is taught to be far-right in highschool. Thats a fact. And that reply was a genuine question. Get off your high horse.  Are you offended because you feel the need to defend your political affiliation like it's a football  team?  It was a valid fucking question and you resorted to outrage to try and be holier than thou. Your looking far to deep.   If you stop looking for gotchya moments and reasons to assert your superior morality over people you might not come across so miserable.  Bore off","3":"Man you don't know me lol. I haven't defended anything nor become outraged, just pointing out how much of an ass you sound like. But apparently there is no more need for me to do that, because you are doing a fine job all by yourself. You got a big \"yikes\" from me, dude. Thanks for the laugh, though.","4":"Cringe. Using \"big yikes\" unironically? American Reddit fan carbon copy #2010234932. Get off Reddit for awhile mate, it might help you develop your own personality.","5":"Sorry to trigger you so hard, man.","6":"Trigger? Thats a big yikes from me."}}
