I mean all the comments are saying you can't. Yes you absolutely can. As many pointed out the Strong Nuclear Force &gt; Electromagnetism &gt; Weak Nuclear Force &gt;  Gravity in terms of strength.  &gt;Sounds like we are right back to the start of this lesson again. Let's put some real numbers on this. The \"weak\" nuclear force is 10 to the 25th power stronger than Gravity. That's 100,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 times stronger! Electromagnetism - the force we know best - is 10 to the 36th power stronger than Gravity. That's 10,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 times stronger! The \"strong\" nuclear force is 10 to the 38th power stronger than Gravity. That's 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 times stronger!   You can split any atom with a knife. If you have enough kinetic force.   The forces involved here would be about...  Probably from 1\/10th the speed of light to some where up to 90% of it.  If you're really curious here is a old comic.  https:\/\/what-if.xkcd.com\/1\/  Basically you won't be spiting atoms with any normal actions you do in your daily life.  But if your knife flew probably 1\/10th the speed of light into anything you'd be doing nuclear fusion and there by fission.","2":"That\u2019s super interesting! So let\u2019s say we make a rocket ship and it goes 50% of speed of light, will that destroy any matter that\u2019s eligible to be destroyed?","3":"Yes the problem with building spacecraft that could theoretically go that fast is that a tiny spec and I mean a few grams of dirt hitting the spacecraft would be like you detonated a tactical nuke on it.   These type of spacecraft are called \"relativistic spacecraft\"  https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Relativistic_rocket  And if you could build these you'd basically make the ultimate death machine.  https:\/\/vocal.media\/futurism\/relativistic-kill-vehicle  These things are literally impossible to stop, you can destroy them but that does literally nothing as it's the kinetic energy that does the fusion explosions on the ground.   The only way to stop these would literally be a huge shield around the planet made out of matter. So an outerwall so to speak.","4":"That\u2019s fascinating! I didn\u2019t know that all sci fi shows lied about those parts. One more question tho, why can\u2019t the engines like die down once you come close the destination so you don\u2019t have to crash somewhere and just slow down till you can break or something","5":"Most sci fi if you notice avoids it.  Star Trek uses Defector Shields. As in some sort of shield of particles that basically vaporize the incoming dust, they also travel around by warping space so they ship isn't moving at all the space around it is. It's a difficult concept to grasp if you don't understand space-time basics. It's like they're creating a hole infront of themselves and falling into it while making a hill behind them   https:\/\/i.pinimg.com\/originals\/11\/57\/8b\/11578b9e7cb8e0f4bf02c96796dc6521.jpg  Star Wars just gives no fuck.   Star Gate uses \"hyper space\" so you go into another \"dimension\" to and then come back.  https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Interstellar_travel_in_fiction  It all depends on the show but most good shows make it realistic enough and have science advisors telling them obvious flaws.   Like in the video game Mass Effect they discovered a way to remove \"mass\" from objects and even go negative so it's possible to go faster than light, and their ships travels like normal ones would accelerating half of the trip then turning around and accelerating backwards to arrive at the destination at normal speeds. They also use shields to protect from stuff."}}
