How?","1":"Providers that join an insurance company network agree to abide by the company's rates in exchange for being in the network. They can say they want to charge $1000 for a procedure but the insurance company can specify that procedure is only worth $750. The other $250 they asked for just disappears into thin air. On my insurance plan I have a 90\/10 split for most things so I'd pay 10% of $750 (although deductibles and out of pocket max come into play), and insurance would pay the rest.  You'll often see bills that say \"insurance denied charge\". Doesn't mean they aren't paying on your behalf, but rather that they adjusted the amount the provider will receive.  It's all horribly confusing, honestly.","2":"Thank you for this explanation.  I was hoping for a good reason as to why they can get away with asking 100k if they can afford to accept 10k. Paying 750 for a procedure that costs 1000 is sensible to me, but 100k difference is staggering.","3":"The snarky answer is \"because our health system is a mess\". The real answer is \"because the hospitals and insurance companies decided they can get away with it\".  They can survive a $100K discrepancy because that's the game. They ask for way more than they expect to receive, because there's no penalty for *not* asking. Here's an interesting article on the subject. http:\/\/truecostofhealthcare.org\/hospitalization\/","4":"Thank you for the read! I can see how insurance companies work with this, but how awful for someone without coverage.","5":"Yep. This is why I support single payer, like every other civilized country on earth. Call or write your representatives :)"}}
