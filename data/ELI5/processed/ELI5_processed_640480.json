The only way women can 100% not get pregnant is by not having sex.","2":"Actually that\u2019s not true. If you really want to be technical a complete hysterectomy is 100% guarantee that you will not get pregnant","3":"Yes, so is having a castrated partner. Not really 5he point of your \"debate\"","4":"Actually I did \u2018castrate\u2019 myself via vasectomy  Why are you getting so hostile toward me? I told you I\u2019m OK with abortion. What more do you fucking want?","5":"Actualy, a vasectomy is not 100% guaranteed to prevent pregnancy, there's a chance for it to fail and for sperm to get through and the woman might still get pregnant.   I don't think I'm any more hostile than you are."}}
