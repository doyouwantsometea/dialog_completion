Whats there?","1":"I've talked to enough ladies to know that being a woman basically means \"there's a million things out there that want render me incapable of holding in urine, and one of them will eventually get me\".  Definitely better than having a fucked up uterus that's trying to kill you (from age 15 until that thing came out, her periods were basically a solid week shooting a firehose of blood out of her crotch).","2":"yeah that sounds 100% awful. as a lady, im not looking forward to surprise pee. a very similar thing happened to my mom, she doesnt get periods now but she still gets the hormones\/ cramps. being a lady sucks","3":"A good friend of mine (early 30's) was telling me she's considering a partial, and I told her about mom's experience.  Her response was \"Alek, my husband is a 7ft tall viking who has put a baby in me twice.  I already piss myself every time I breath, I've got nothing to lose\".","4":"lol thats a woman who has seen a lot. my mom got an experimental thing done on her a while back where they essentially cauterize the lining of your uterus and you cease to have periods.  needless to say it went horribly wrong, and after some time all the periods she \u201cwasn\u2019t\u201d having were actually building up inside her causing her immense pain and overall an awful time. she had to be rushed to the hospital because of the pain\/bloating. not exactly sure how they fixed it but shes period free and sterile now.","5":"Owch.  That definitely sounds like an experimental surgery I'd avoid."}}
