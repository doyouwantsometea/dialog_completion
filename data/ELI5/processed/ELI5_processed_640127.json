Do all large employers have unions?  Their employees haven't gathered enough votes from a majority of employees to unionize--pretty simple.","2":"As a Walmart associate you are trained to, upon hearing talk about unionizing, tell your nearest superior.  The person who mentioned it will get fired every time, for just mentioning it.  They do not have to even mean it, employees all know Walmart will smite your ass for accidentally saying the word union around a manager.   It's common knowledge for even people who don't work at Walmart, Walmart employees have always been fired for just talking about what a union would accomplish or for simply saying the word union in conversation with another associate.","3":"I didn't say they didn't.  So what's your question?","4":"Why won't they allow unionization?  Seems kinda dystopian considering cities in 3 states wouldn't be able to suffice without our specific Walmart.  It caters to some cities in Ohio, a couple in West Virginia, and about 6 or 7 in Kentucky where the Walmart is. ","5":"&gt; Why won't they allow unionization?  Because it would cost Walmart millions more in wages and benefits.","6":"So can they legally deny a majority vote of employees to unionize? ","7":"What have they \"denied\"?  Yes, your unionizing activities cannot be during your work hours and on their private property.  If you want to organize, in secret, on your own time and property, you're welcome to.","8":"Well what if I asked my co-workers to sign and agree to sign a pro-associate benefits group(like a union but less incriminating) proposal that was the same write up as a union paper and handed it to corporate, could they deny it as opposed to every other corporation or company? ","9":"&gt; could they deny it  I don't know what you keep calling \"deny\".  So you've got a majority of Walmart employees signed on?  You either have a union or you don't.  If you don't have a union, then you don't have any of the legal protections given to unions in the U.S.  &gt; as opposed to every other corporation or company?  I don't know what this means or why you act like Walmart is the only non-unionized employer in the U.S.","10":"Can a single store unionize? Otherwise I would have to have the same amount of people that live in New Hampshire and Vermont sign because that's how many people work for Walmart. ","11":"&gt; Can a single store unionize?  No.  Maybe a single state's stores can, I really don't know.  I'm not a labor lawyer.  &gt; Otherwise I would have to have the same amount of people that live in New Hampshire and Vermont sign because that's how many people work for Walmart.  Exactly."}}
