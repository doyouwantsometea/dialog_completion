If you are in the desert and use up all the water you have, while the water is still on earth, it ends up another place where you can\u2019t easily use it, you have to bring it back","2":"What about cleaning the water that's available? That is the salt water? And maybe installing some pipelines in desert to make it accessible to all.","3":"Yes, you can clean it and transport it, and we do, but you don\u2019t clean water and transport it for free, it\u2019s expensive, and uses other resources","4":"Is it like too costly? I mean we talk about building colonies in space when we cannot provide water to entire planet just because of lack of energy sources and it being expensive. Ain't this somewhat hypocrite?","5":"It\u2019s not too costly, but it does cost money and resource, it\u2019s a waste to use up water you don\u2019t have to use, only to then have to purify and bring it back","6":"Oh ok.. that's also a fair point."}}
