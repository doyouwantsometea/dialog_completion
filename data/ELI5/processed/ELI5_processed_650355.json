We see our space like an ant sees the surface of the earth. It seems flat but actually curves through another dimension we're not aware of. If you walk(spaceship?) long enough in one direction you'd eventually return to where you started. Total armchair cosmology fan here so don't take that as a legit answer. I like this idea cause it's one of the few I can kinda wrap my head around.   I thik recent results show that the universe is basically flat though.. so I dunno. On large scales even a tiny curvature would do it though...","2":"&gt;I thik recent results show that the universe is basically flat  This sounds so interesting...would you happen to have any articles?","3":" Recent measurements (c. 2001) by a number of ground-based and balloon-based experiments, including [MAT\/TOCO](http:\/\/wwwphy.princeton.edu\/cosmology\/mat\/), [Boomerang](http:\/\/cmb.phys.cwru.edu\/boomerang\/), [Maxima](http:\/\/cosmology.berkeley.edu\/group\/cmb\/index.html), and [DASI](http:\/\/astro.uchicago.edu\/dasi\/),  have shown that the brightest spots are about 1 degree across. Thus the  universe was known to be flat to within about 15% accuracy prior to the  WMAP results. WMAP has confirmed this result with very high accuracy  and precision. We now know (as of 2013) that the universe is flat with  only a 0.4% margin of error. This suggests that the Universe is infinite  in extent; however, since the Universe has a finite age, we can only  observe a finite volume of the Universe. All we can truly conclude is  that the Universe is much larger than the volume we can directly  observe.   &amp;#x200B;  [https:\/\/wmap.gsfc.nasa.gov\/universe\/uni\\_shape.html](https:\/\/wmap.gsfc.nasa.gov\/universe\/uni_shape.html)","4":"Incredible...thank you for the link!","5":"This is another good one. :)  https:\/\/phys.org\/news\/2011-10-flat-universe.html","6":"That's interesting!
