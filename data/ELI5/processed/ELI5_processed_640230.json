If anyone was really concerned they would be taking in their pubescent boys to the doctor for a simple vasalgel injection, costs about 150 bucks. Blocks the sperm. When the boy wants to father a child it's another simple injection to reverse, plus another 150. No side effects. Poof abortion debate solved.","2":"I\u2019d like to subscribe to your newsletter","3":"News letter? I do not have one.
