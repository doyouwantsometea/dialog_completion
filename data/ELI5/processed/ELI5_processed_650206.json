You have to grow the animal from birth. Feed it, keep it warm, etc. That takes energy.","2":"Like chopped up, wrapped up and put on the shelf","3":"That's part of it, but you need to store any foodstuff. The actual raising of the animals takes a lot more energy.","4":"They drink rain water from lakes and ponds and eat grass, how much more is there too it?","5":"The rainwater has to be cleaned, the grass only lasts a summer and has to be baled for winter or supplemented with feed that has to be made in factories. They have to be sheltered in lit and heated sheds. They have to be milked and the milk is trucked into factories to make dairy products. And so on. Farming isn't just a matter of throwing a few cows in a field and then leaving them to it till you're ready to kill them.","6":"As someone who lived on a farm, yes, yes it is that easy. When winter comes you move them to a different field somewhere warmer. End of story. The milking is done at FoodInc type places, no one does that manually anymore unless for own use. Besides you don't eat the cows you milk, those are a different breed.","7":"It doesn't matter where the milking is done, it still has to be done. The cows have to be transported and then so does the milk and the milk has to be processed and the processed milk has to be sent to the stores.","8":"I think milk is a horrible idea, our bodies haven't evolved enough to full digest it properly and it leads to other problems such as obesity "}}
