Your brain sends millions of signals and messages when you are asleep - dreams and the like. The brain moves between phases of activity, and during REM sleep actively prevents your limb muscles from moving.   Anaesthesia conversely reduces the activity of your brain. Everything slows down and high levels of anaesthesia drugs can stop all significant electrical activity in your brain (isolelectric EEG). Comas are similar and have varying levels, but in essences yout brain activity is reduced when you are in a coma.

In so much as no-one knows what being dead is like. Arguably, it's similar to brain-stem death (a type of death where the brain dies but the rest of the body carries on) but there are important differences.  First, anaesthesia is reversible. An important definition of death is its irreversibility. Second, whilst breathing is affected, volatile anesthetics (the ones you breathe in, as opposed to ones that are injected) tend not to cause complete cessation of breathing. But more importantly, anesthetics for surgery are not given at such high levels to cease brain activity. In fact, some people do sleep and do dream under anaesthesia! Very deep levels of anaesthesia are reserved for when a patient has seizures that can't stop (status epilepticus). As an aside, even deep levels of anaesthesia can't treat the rare disease of familial insomnia - a fatal disease where patients just cannot fall asleep at all. Just shows how different sleep and anaesthesia are.  However, I suspect the experience of anaesthesia is like dying. Anaesthesia removes all concept of time. I've had patients carry on a conversation with me that we were having before commencing anaesthesia, even after hours of surgery."}}
