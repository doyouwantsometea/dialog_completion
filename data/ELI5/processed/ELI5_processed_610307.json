Do we link words to pictures in our mind?","1":"Your brain stores knowledge more as abstract concepts. The word links to that concept, and the image links to that concept. See a cat and your brain identifies it as a cat then gives you the thought \"that's a cat\". See the word cat and your brain identifies the meaning of a cat and then gives you the image of a cat in your imagination. These concepts are stored without the use of either word or image, but are linked to the separate storages of the words and images, so those systems usually fire together. This is also how you can know what you want to say but not quite recall the word for it - your brain has accessed the abstract concept, but has misplaced the link between it and the word for it.","2":"surely the image is the concept? I am sure for certain, attributes of an object are linked to the image rather than its name. Like you can know what to do with a pair of scissors even if you don't know their name in english.","3":"Nope. In fact, there are people who have literally no ability to form a mental image at all, and yet who still have normal ability to understand what things mean.","4":"how so, please explain?","5":"It's not yet known exactly what causes this, we only know that people like this exist."}}
