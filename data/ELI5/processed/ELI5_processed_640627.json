It wss well before that. Skipping over that misconception on your part, diseases in the region, poltical, cultural, and religious instability in the region in more recent years (ave further back). Coupled with the fact that several african nations in generations past collapsed (for a variety of reasons, disease, famine, etc) that could have stabilized things...","2":"The black death wiped out a third of Europe. Most of Africa doesn't even have paved roads.","3":"Correct. The Black Death wiped out a 3rd of Europe. Bit that was a very quick, one-off sort of deal. Look at, for comparisons sake. But for comparisons sake, we've got things like West Nile Virus, Ebola, influenza, et cetera, the list goes on.","4":"Smallpox, tuberculosis, polio, tetanus, etc. were all deadly American diseases. Only difference is America developed vaccines.","5":"They were also in Africa. There's another point I recalled, and that's that some diseases don't do well in the cold. The bacteria freezes.

Couple that with by the point America had to deal with much of that, we already had the infrastructure, and tech, to be able to fight it."}}
