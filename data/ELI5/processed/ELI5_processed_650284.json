I know they \"don't share\", but is that a crack at aristocrats or more of a Buddhist-style respectful reference to the nobility?","1":"That\u2019s not how science works. The Schwarzschild black hole is an approximation but that does not make it wrong. For many calculations the precision afforded by this approximation is close enough and you don\u2019t need the extra complexity from considering rotation and charge. Schwarzschild knew exactly what he was describing and no one said that his model was a final explanation of all black holes.","2":"&gt;That\u2019s not how science works. The Schwarzschild black hole is an approximation but that does not make it wrong. For many calculations the precision afforded by this approximation is close enough and you don\u2019t need the extra complexity from considering rotation and charge. Schwarzschild knew exactly what he was describing and no one said that his model was a final explanation of all black holes.  So he completely ignored the merits of empirical science? And as a result thought that black holes formed from the death stars when literally the exact opposite was true, that they probably form as developing stars?   Yeah seems pretty much 100% wrong","3":"That\u2019s not correct. Firstly black holes are not formed from developing stars and whether you use the Schwarzschild or Kerr models doesn\u2019t change that. As well as that there was no empirical evidence of black holes at this point. What Schwarzschild did was solve Einstein\u2019s equations for the case of a theoretical non rotating neutral black hole. He did not present it as anything other than this. This was a necessary first step towards a more general solution of the more complex case of a rotating black hole which is more likely in reality. It wasn\u2019t until much later that we would have true empirical evidence that black holes can exist in the universe","4":"Didn't they originally theorize black holes just because you could see physically stuff either getting swallowed up or otherwise affected, so they realized it had to be some kind of physical body that also didn't really emit light?","5":"No, black holes were theorized as possible solutions to Einstein's equations long before (1916) we had the ability to detect their effects in the universe. Eventually(1972) we found bodies which seemed to behave like black holes which confirmed the theoretical predictions. As you can see we had the idea of a gravitational singularity long before we saw objects which acted in this way.","6":"Did you ever read Alexander von Humboldt's Kosmos or Edgar Allan Poe's Eureka, both of which came out in the mid-1840s?   Don't argue with me, argue with them. Read those books (I only read Eureka), and see for yourself what you think of them","7":"Those are not really relevant to what you were saying though. Poe did suggest an idea evocative of black holes however it was not a scientific description or theory, just an idea of a gravitational singularity. The point remains that there is no scientific evidence for black holes being just forming stars as was suggested earlier, and in fact there is an abundance of evidence that they are not."}}
