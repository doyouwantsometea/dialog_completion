Space and Time started a split second after the big bang.  Everything in the universe comes from it.  An analogy:. If T.V was invented in 1927, where was it before 1927.  It simply wasn't a thing.  That's what was before the big bang.  Nothingness.  Not even black.  Oneness.  That concept alone is very hard for the human mind to conceptualise.","2":"Good point. I can conceptualize the invention of TV in that \u201csomeone\u201d invented it. I can\u2019t with this because it is literally the first of everything which, for me, begs the question what \u201cinvented\u201d it. Even an answer to that question would make me asked what invented the what that invented that. Same loop. I appreciate your help very much. Thank you.","3":"It's a hard thing to conceptualise, but: there was no cause.  In quantum physics, for example, particles constantly pop in and out of exsistence, depending on measurement.  There is no cause, it just is.  When we measure it, we can see its effects, but not it's cause.  We are catching it in progress, in exsistence, because it simply happens.  The same applies to the big bang.  Don't worry, the universe is total chaos.","4":"I\u2019m fairly certain I now have a splinter headache from trying to understand how something can pop in and out of existence and that there is no cause. I absolutely take you at your word, it\u2019s just brutal to understand it in a visceral way.","5":"Reality is far, far, stranger than what we see at our level.  At the quantum level, the level of atoms, reality is very different.  Here's a good introduction to the idea of the different physics at the quantum level:  https:\/\/youtu.be\/p-MNSLsjjdo","6":"I\u2019m going to check out that video right now. I\u2019m so old I remember playing The Hitchhiker\u2019s Guide video game from the early 80s. Thank you for all your help and kindness."}}
