At all.","2":"Ok. Good.","3":"Most of the time, before someone dies, they slip into a coma like state that can last a few hours or a few days. I don\u2019t know about trauma deaths (like war\/car accident etc) but usually, people are not able to talk in the days to hours before they die.","4":"I didn\u2019t know that.","5":"If you ever have a relative in hospice, the nurse will explain to you what the stages if death look like. Its not like the movies where someone is there talking, gasps and then dies.","6":"I see. I guess I meant the question as one of those deaths we don\u2019t expect where the person trying to help knows that the other will die and is trying to get them to stop talking to save energy as if they will survive."}}
