If we send a shuttle into space and it sends images back, it is always dark. But the sun is able to provide daylight to Earth. So where is that sunlight going in space?","1":"You only see things on earth because the sunlight bounces off objects and into your eyes. In space, there's not a lot for the light to bounce off of, so the light keeps going.","2":"So if I was in the middle of space I would give it something to bounce off and would therefore provide light?","3":"Essentially. Best example I can think of is the moon. You only see the moon because the light from the sun is bouncing off of it. An example from the other direction would be stars: you can only see stars because the light being produced by those stars has travelled all the way to earth without bouncing off of anything else.","4":"That is so weird though. So there is light passing an inch to the left of the moon... but we cant see it because there is nothing there? So space isnt dark, it is actually light..? We just cant see it because it is empty.","5":"Pretty much yeah, it's dark because there's nothing to see. Everything you can see is either producing or reflecting light.","6":"Interesting.  Thanks."}}
