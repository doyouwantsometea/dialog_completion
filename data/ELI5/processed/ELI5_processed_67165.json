We don't know how consciousness happens but it is safe to assume that it is caused by material forces rather than something metaphysical.","4":"Ok, I think you and I are more on the same page than I originally thought. When I say \u201cdifferent plane\u201d I don\u2019t mean supernatural. I mean we are taping into something that is very real in this material world, something we cannot yet identify.","5":"Agreed, whatever the grand theory of consciousness turns out to be it is way beyond our current science\/technology to explain. IMO it will take a combination of quantum computing and advanced AI to come up with an algorithm that explains\/creates consciousness and no human, that isn't an android of some sort, will be able to understand it."}}
