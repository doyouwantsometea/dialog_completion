Sure it depends on farming rates and things but it's better than relying on oil from nations who are unreliable in the long term.","2":"bio fuel still emit greenhouse gasses, and you don't get a lot of energy from them.","3":"For me Bio-fuel doesn't need to be perfect I feel the same for things like solar and wind power, I see it being used for a renewable source of fuel that can reduce usage of regular oil and imports from unstable nations.  --- Some places have what's known as bio-diesel. They claim it pollutes much less CO2 than regular diesel, sure it isn't Zero but it's an improvement all the same.  only something like hydrogen fuel has zero CO2. And even than the process of making it could be harmful. (haven't researched that myself)","4":"I don't think it's even worth it, I think it requires a lot of energy to make that fuel, or that it requires so much arable land that it becomes very expensive.","5":"Arable land is an issue, In this respect Bio-fuel only works if you can grow algae or other plant source in places that doesn't have proper soil.    I often wish Vertical farms were more common but there are some companies out there now making them.   Vertical farms reduce our farming effects on acres and acres of land and can be designed to use little energy and being inside a building crops don't need pesticides or other harmful chemicals."}}
