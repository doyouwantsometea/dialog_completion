When you want paint mixed up, the base color combinations aren't as simple as utilizing RGB with displays, or CMYK with printed materials. It's usually many more base colors (colorants) that are chosen from. My current system I use has about 10 or so colorants that formulas are derived from.  The reason it can be simpler on a display is due to each pixels RGB value shining at different brightness to make a color. They're really tricking our eyes into perceiving the color, but if you look at it closely enough, it's still red, green, and blue separately.  With a printer, each amount of ink is done layered over the top of one another to create the colors you see.  With paint, the colors mix together with the base in a homogeneous mixture to create the desired color. That's why there's more options to choose from. The colors mix together, not just create the illusion of mixing, or layer to make the resulted color","2":"Oh that makes sense. Can you utilize a CMYK value at all with your 10 colorant system or am I out of luck here? I don't need to be able to hold the painted object up to a screen and have them match, I just want this pretty shade of blue in a paint can.","3":"With our machines, you cannot. And the other problem based on what I've read is that you want to take the color from a picture of the sky. That's like trying to match skin tone. There are so many colors happening at the same time to make one sense of a color, that it's impossible to pinpoint one specific color from that.","4":"Oh trust me I know that. The color I\u2019m going for is the shade that is right above when there\u2019s no clouds in my particular area of the world. It's nearly impossible to photograph properly. I managed to catch the specific shade I wanted in a tiny corner of a photograph the other day which is what I'm basing my color from","5":"The company that makes our color matching devices are supposed to be coming out with a matcher that can scan down to a pixel really soon, so there's hope"}}
