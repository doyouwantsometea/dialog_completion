Because it would cost Walmart millions more in wages and benefits.","2":"So can they legally deny a majority vote of employees to unionize? ","3":"What have they \"denied\"?  Yes, your unionizing activities cannot be during your work hours and on their private property.  If you want to organize, in secret, on your own time and property, you're welcome to.","4":"Well what if I asked my co-workers to sign and agree to sign a pro-associate benefits group(like a union but less incriminating) proposal that was the same write up as a union paper and handed it to corporate, could they deny it as opposed to every other corporation or company? ","5":"&gt; could they deny it  I don't know what you keep calling \"deny\".  So you've got a majority of Walmart employees signed on?  You either have a union or you don't.  If you don't have a union, then you don't have any of the legal protections given to unions in the U.S.  &gt; as opposed to every other corporation or company?  I don't know what this means or why you act like Walmart is the only non-unionized employer in the U.S.","6":"Can a single store unionize? Otherwise I would have to have the same amount of people that live in New Hampshire and Vermont sign because that's how many people work for Walmart. ","7":"&gt; Can a single store unionize?  No.  Maybe a single state's stores can, I really don't know.  I'm not a labor lawyer.  &gt; Otherwise I would have to have the same amount of people that live in New Hampshire and Vermont sign because that's how many people work for Walmart.  Exactly."}}
