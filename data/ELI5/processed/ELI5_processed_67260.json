Start with the equivalence principle, that acceleration and gravity are the same thing.  Now consider this  1.  You are in a box in space that has a window 2.  Someone shines a laser through the window 3.  If you are not moving relative to the source, the laser beam goes straight across your box. 4.  If you are moving at constant velocity relative to source the light beam still moves in a strait line, but will contact the other wall opposite the window \u201clower down\u201d towards the direction opposite of motion.  Here\u2019s the important one 5.  If you are accelerating relative to source, the light appears to follow a curved line through your box.  Go back to the EP.  Since gravity and acceleration are the same, light must curve under gravity.","2":"You actually took your time amd wrote this, i am very thankful to you. Fu** school they didnt teach me shit. :(","3":"It was my pleasure really.  I love this stuff even though I don't understand the math necessary to really get into it.  I was happy I saw an ELI5 and could actually answer it :)","4":"we need more people like you bro!","5":"Thanks man!"}}
