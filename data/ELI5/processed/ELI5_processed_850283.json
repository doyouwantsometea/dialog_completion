Thus; if you're increasing FICA taxes, you're going to be increasing employer payments into FICA taxes.","4":"Ok, but wouldn't this be offset by no more payments for private health coverage?","5":"Not necessarily; it's not a one-to-one shift, and generally the companies (correctly) think they can do a better job insuring their employees than the Feds can.  So in order to have the government provide the same level of healthcare, it likely will end up costing the government *more* because of how inefficient the government is at these kinds of things, in major part because the government isn't interested in a profit motive, and as a result isn't as interested in cost-savings measures.","6":"What is the evidence that government inefficiency would make the costs increase. It would seem that taking out all of the private insurance middlemen would result in much lower costs.","7":"&gt;What is the evidence that government inefficiency would make the costs increase.  Government procurement is historically prone to cost overruns, bloat, and inefficiency. You can look at military spending for an example of this.  &gt;It would seem that taking out all of the private insurance middlemen would result in much lower costs.  But in the process, you get rid of the negotiators involved in drug\/treatment cost negotiations, and instead the government will just pay whatever the cost is without thinking about it, again because the government doesn't have significant means to fight for cost savings.  We already have a very similar problem with respect to student loans; the increased cost of college education in the US is largely due to the US government being so willing to pump money into higher education through student loans without any form of price controls or cost incentives."}}
