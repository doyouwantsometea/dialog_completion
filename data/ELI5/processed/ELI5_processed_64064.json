Those other animals would live, their tools are physical. The human's tool is the brain which isn't fully developed until AFTER what would we would even consider to be adulthood","2":"Where in that do you see me say I'm thinking of a modern teenager? Early tribes had all those things I mentioned...","3":"Yes, and girls in \u201cearly tribes\u201d regularly had kids as teenagers. So we\u2019re back to square one.   You now will say they had support from mothers and aunts. So do orangutans. So do lions. I\u2019m not an anthropologist but as far as I\u2019m aware that\u2019s also true of the majority of animals that live in groups. So why is it that they\u2019re \u201ccapable\u201d of raising children but a 17 year old girl isn\u2019t?   What\u2019s your actual question again? ","4":"The original question was why does it seem like humans are the only mammals capable of having kids before actually being ready to have kids. And I got a lot of good answers to this question. You provided none of them. Some people pointed out that girls these days reach puberty much faster than they used to. Someone else pointed out that they had help which I hadn't thought of. And another person (my favorite answer) mentioned how other species have kids as soon as possible, but they usually die because they mother isn't experienced enough.  You have done nothing but argue and try to catch me in traps this whole time without actually answering the question.","5":"So you accept that the idea that humans are the only animal that reaches sexual maturity before being able to raise children, isn\u2019t actually true?","6":"Yes I do but it wasn't because of anything you said, you haven't actually adding anything constructive to this thread. And yes I did but they either said something about adulthood being a construct or about how my question isn't biological etc.","7":"Dude, how many times did I say your question wasn\u2019t biological. 7 times? 8? That was the key point I was making. ","8":"But that point didn't make sense because it is biological. Saying \"look he said it too\" doesn't make either of you more right.","9":"What is biological?  (I would urge you to phrase your answer very carefully. Probably best taking a look back through the whole conversation first as well)","10":"Biological: relating to biology or living organisms.  Biology: the study of living organisms, divided into many specialized fields that cover their morphology, physiology, anatomy, behavior, origin, and distribution.  the plants and animals of a particular area.  \"the biology of Chesapeake Bay\"  the physiology, behavior, and other qualities of a particular organism or class of organisms.  \"human biology\"    Please explain to me how what I discussed doesn't apply to biology","11":"Oh Jesus Christ, you\u2019ve actually posted the definition of \u201cbiological\u201d. Copy and pasted from the dictionary. Fuck me sideways  You said \u201cit is biological\u201d. Specifically what were you referring to by \u201cit\u201d? That\u2019s what I was I was asking about.   ","12":"The question of whether or not a 13 year old girl would be developed enough physically and mentally to raise a child on her own.","13":"The answer to that question is \u201cyes\u201d. Six or seven people have told you as much.   The reason that humans don\u2019t have children immediately after reaching puberty, is not biological.   Remember you\u2019ve accepted that your original premise, that the question was predicated on, wasn\u2019t true? Why you doing this","14":"You seem to think just because someone comments something, I take it as truth. The answer, even if my question has a false premise, is STILL biological. The entire situation is biological. We're talking about ovulation and human behavior. You just keep picking new points to try tripping me up on.","15":"If you post a thread in a question forum, and the majority of people give you the exact same answer, you don\u2019t believe them?   Yes, okay, discussion of biology was a necessary part of answering the question. It\u2019s a question that referenced puberty in mammals - it self-evidently was going to refer to biological topics. However, your question was asking for the biological reason that humans aren\u2019t ready for kids whilst animals are. The premise is false, and the reason the premise is false is due to social and not biological factors. As I\u2019ve said over and over and over. You may as well be asking \u201cwhat\u2019s the economic rationale for the earth rotating around the sun\u201d.   And for your last sentence - I\u2019m not the one trying to steer this away from a question about raising children and into a semantic debate about   I\u2019m gonna respond every single time btw. ","16":"I wouldn't say the majority of answers said the exact same thing, there was a decent mix of answers that I saw. Some made good points. And I feel like your logic is lacking. The only social answers were the ones provided once the commenter framed my question in a nonbiological way. I was still looking for biological answers. And I got some good ones. There are other factors other than \"that's just how you view it\".   And ya know what fine, go ahead and reply every time. I gotta get up and go to work tomorrow so I can't continue this much longer and I won't care enough to reply tomorrow. So give your last comment, I hope it's a good one.","17":"Woo I absolutely nailed you with that last response. Literally just repeating your own hypocritical words back to you. oh man I can\u2019t believe you handed me that opening on a plate like that, too perfect.   Have a good day in work, I hope you\u2019ve learned from all of this"}}
