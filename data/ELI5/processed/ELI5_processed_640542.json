It can also make your toddler\u2019s expressive language develop slower than his peers (gestures\/inflection\/syntax). As he gets older there is significant evidence to show that social media causes depression in young people (probably in old people too, I just only read about young people). If you set him in front of the iPad often to get some peace and quiet other parts of social and language development can be delayed.","2":"Interesting. But why? What happens inside his brain? And how is that connected to any possible repercussions.","3":"I literally just wrote a term paper kind of about this subject but I\u2019m to tired to extract and send you the sources I used right now (also it wasn\u2019t neurology heavy). Essentially all pediatricians agree that babies have no business with devices under 2 and that educational programming needs to be closely monitored. Also engaging in digital media with your kid as they get older can actually make family Bonds better (though social media interaction with your kids widens the divide) which is cool\u2014like playing video games or watching movies or a certain show every week.","4":"Well if you ever want to share your paper or some sources I\u2019d love to read them. It\u2019s always interesting how conclusions are made. I believe moderation is key with all things and if proper effort and attention is paid anything can be used as a learning tool. I certainly learn a lot while using technology productively. ","5":"I\u2019ll pm you tomorrow "}}
