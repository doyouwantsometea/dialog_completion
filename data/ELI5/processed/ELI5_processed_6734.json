Geometrically, squaring a line makes a square (thus the name) and cubing it makes a cube. This is very useful with units. You can measure the distance between the door and window in meters, but it's not useful at all for the area of the room. For an area, you need to square the meter, which represents a 2d surface. Then when you want to measure how much water is in a container, you need to go up to cubic meters, which represent a volume. Square rooting goes the other way. Distance in our world is also measured by adding together the squares of displacement in each direction and then square rooting it.   &amp;#x200B;  Another big place you'll see it is probability. The probability of flipping a coin and 5 times and getting all heads is equal to the probability of it happening once, to the power of how many times you do it. Thus (0.5\\^5).","2":" &gt;Another big place you'll see it is probability. The probability of flipping a coin and 5 times and getting all heads is equal to the probability of it happening once, to the power of how many times you do it. Thus (0.5\\^5).  Isn't that considered a factorial (which may just be a subcategory?)? I may have the term wrong but ya that makes sense, I kinda forgot about that, I can visualize that pretty well with regards to chances of \"random\" probabilities. I guess it's just hard when it comes to spatial geometry regarding circles for some reason. It makes sense with rectangles and cubes, maybe I've been over thinking it and thinking circles can't just simply use the same relative equations with a time thrown in there instead. ","3":"Factorials are more for combinations of things and ordering, whereas exponentiation and multiplication are used for getting a total probability from multiple events.","4":"Maybe I'm thinking back to when I was in school when I learned about factorials and alongside it we learned about probabilities but used some sort of !P symbol or something if that's familiar to you? Is that just a simplified framework variable to let you know it's like probabilities or what was the purpose of that when just using exponents is easy enough? ","5":"They are used for slightly different things. N! is a factorial and means N\\*(N-1)\\*(N-2)\\*...\\*1. It is very useful in probability where things are removed as you go. For example, calculating probabilities of drawing certain hands uses the factorial, as each card drawn decreases the number of cards remaining, changing the probability for the next card drawn.","6":"That's right, that's what it was, thanks.
