A movie lover is someone who loves movies. Period. When you start putting \"rules\" or \"criteria\" that excludes other people, it becomes the fallacy.   A movie lover can watch foreign films, or not and still be a movie lover. The fallacy\/gatekeeping comes in when a person starts declaring for others whether or not they are allowed to be considered a \"true movie lover\" based on their own opinion.","2":"But there's nothing fallacious about gatekeeping. You may say it's dickish or whatever, but I don't see at what point a fallacy comes in.","3":"Because gatekeeping is essentially #2 on the definition. It's fallacious to start out by defining specific parameters or definitions that are incorrect. Moving the goalposts after the fact is the most notable form of the no true Scotsman fallacy, but it's also a form of gatekeeping by excluding the counter arguments AHEAD of time.   \"Only a true Redditor knows what \"F\" means\" is a fallicious  *The\u00a0No True Scotsman\u00a0(NTS) fallacy is a\u00a0logical fallacy\u00a0that occurs when a debater defends the generalization of a group by excluding counter-examples from it. For example, it is common to argue that \"all members of [my religion] are fundamentally good\", and then to abandon all bad individuals as \"not true [my-religion]-people\". This can occur in two ways:  1) During argument, someone\u00a0re-defines the group\u00a0in order to exclude counter-examples. Instead of backing down from \"all groupmembers are X\" to \"most groupmembers are X\", the debater simply redefines the group.[2][3  2) Before argument, someone preemptively defines some group such that the group\u00a0definitionally\u00a0must be entirely \"good\" or entirely \"bad\". However, this definition was\u00a0created arbitrarily for this defensive purpose, rather than based on the actual qualities of the group.[4]*","4":"I don't see what is illogical here. Your definition is your definition.  What would be illogical if you still said \"all religious people are good\" even after being shown that some religious people are bad. But that's not what you are doing here. Since you are adding a \"true\", you are effectively creating a new definition, which is set up in such a way that it only includes good people. By re-defining things, you are keeping the logic consistent.","5":"It's illogical to base an argument on subjective false pretenses that you created yourself.   When I start out and say \"true movie lovers watch foreign films\" then I'm automatically \"gatekeeping\" and excluding large portions of movie lovers.   Even \"foreign films\" is subjective because a French foreign movie wouldn't be foreign to people in France.   Automatically starting an argument based on things that are illogical, make gatekeeping fallicious. It's not always, but one true Scotsman encompasses this very blatantly when used this way.","6":"I'm not sure why it would be illogical to debate it. We also present arguments as to why a movie is good, with the intention of starting a debate, even though it's all subjective. The idea is to express how we look at things, and maybe push others to see our perspective."}}
