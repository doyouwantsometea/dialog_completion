I dunno. Because religious people like to think no one should ever enjoy sex, so someone who's whole job is doing sexy fun stuff is inherently an evil tempting influence.  Which in turn forces most sex-work underground, where it gets mixed up with other illegal activities, further making it seem like something only \"losers\" do.  God forbid two consenting adults have fun.","4":"Yes I agree, but do you think the stigma would ever completely disappear?","5":"I hope so! I think it'd be better for everyone."}}
