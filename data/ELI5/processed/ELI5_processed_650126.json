There is such a thing as a small, neat afro, and I think you could probably pull that off in a workplace no problem, but if it gets really big and irregular you might start to have problems.  People would feel weird about saying anything, though.  A criticism of a dark-skinned person's hair could easily come out wrong.","2":"But why hasn't the norm changed afros have been popular and fashionable in the past right?","3":"Longer hair on guys has been popular (see the sixties and the eighties) but I don't think that changed professional culture very much.  The idea is, if you want to look like you're serious and mature and unaffected by fads and wild ideas, you try to look conservative.  That means suit, tie, polished shoes, and boring, un-trendy hair.  People are kind of conditioned to trust that look.","4":"Thanks, that makes sense although just a couple of clarifications... 1) why is corporate conservative in the first place? 2) how did 'that look' become the norm and why doesn't the norm change much with the times?","5":"1) First, in this context I don't mean conservative like \"anti-abortion, anti-gun-regulation, small government\".  I mean like \"cautious, traditional and resistant to change\".  People like that.  If you do things the same way they've been done for centuries, that implies you're doing them correctly, so people can trust you.  2) I think, sociologically speaking, it's a wealth and status display.  You can survive without grooming and fancy clothes, but if you polish your shoes, trim your fingernails, get someone to cut your hair, and wear a tie, it demonstrates to others that you have time and money to spare - so much that you can waste some on nonessential stuff.  Should we be impressed by people who spend money on nonessential stuff?  Maybe not, but people are, all over the world.  So people who want to be trusted are kind of stuck playing this game.","6":"But what do people think of \"high status\" people with long hair like actors, music stars, etc","7":"The rules are definitely different for creative people.  :)  Business people want an aura of \"I am reliable and trustworthy and won't do anything to surprise you\".  Artists go for pretty much the opposite: \"I'm different!  I'm fearless and innovative!  You don't know what I'll do next!\"","8":"I'm really attached to my hair though, does this mean business isn't the right career for me?","9":"I really want to believe that hair wouldn't be an obstacle...  If you can think of a way to do it without blowing your privacy, maybe put up an anonymous photo of yourself someplace?  Then go to r\/AskHR and see what some people who do interviews and hiring think.  They'll have a much clearer idea what things are like these days.","10":"Sure I'll do that, btw I didn't exactly intend if it was acceptable or not, I meant to ask if the career of business itself unsuitable for a person who believes in self expression?","11":"It probably *is* suitable just because business is so broad.  There are so many different companies, and inside those companies there are different departments, some more flexible than others.  Are there business jobs where hair could hurt your chances?  Yeah, I imagine there are.  Should you give up on business because of that?  Probably not, and I hope you don't!  [Disclaimer, because it feels like this is winding down: I've always been clean-shaven with short hair so I've never had any trouble with this, so my sense of the rules might not be the best.]","12":"Thanks a tonne \ud83d\udc4d"}}
