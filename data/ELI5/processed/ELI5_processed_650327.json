If we send a shuttle into space and it sends images back, it is always dark. But the sun is able to provide daylight to Earth. So where is that sunlight going in space?","1":"So what is happening here is the vantablack is absorbing all the light.  So there is light bouncing off the car and coming into your eye.  So it's not like there is some information coming from the car into your eyes and brains saying, 'hey its really really black right here'.  What is happening is the cells in your eye are not getting any information at all, and those cells in turn do not activate the brain in the same way.  So your brain perceives it as what we call black.  But its really just a lack of information.","2":"So it is really black in that it is a) very black and b) absorbing the light so that we are not receiving the information needed to distinguish the colour?","3":"That's right.  Remember there isn't really a real 'black'.  That is just a word we made up for what our brain does.  Pretend humans never developed eyes and we never evolved to have the sense of sight.  We have no idea of color or what things look like or anything.  Light particles are still bouncing around and being reflected off everything, everywhere, but in the case of the vantablack, when light hits that area, it just reflects less light than other surfaces. (less information is being reflected)  Another way to look at it is take a digital camera and point it at the car.  Well there is a sensitive chip in there that is like an eye.  The light hits the chip, and activate certain parts of that chip which the computer makes into an image on the screen.  The vantablack areas did not activate that part of the chip.  So the computer reads the image file and says... No data here!  and then when you look at it on the screen the computer doesn't light up that pixel and you perceive black there.","4":"That is hilarious in that when they paint a car or ball or whatever. The object isnt perceived as being there so there is a car shaped void instead.","5":"exactly.  If you look a picture of the stealth bomber (B2) its the same.  Looks like a void space in the sky.  Now with the car, I'm not sure how legal that is.  Probably varies from country to country.  But it is so weird looking I think it would be distracting.  Imagine that at night, even with headlights it would look strange.  Probably not that safe.","6":"Agreed. My brain would freak and I would lose concentration whilst driving lol"}}
