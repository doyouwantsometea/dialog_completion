So regular body cells can just heal or be replaced but if the DNA is damaged within those cells, they can't reproduce properly which is why it's so deadly? ","3":"There are a few effects; ionization will break apart biologically important molecules, which can then become \"radicals\" which can break apart more molecules or damage proteins. Too much damage to cellular structures can cause the cell to destroy itself, as can too much damage to DNA. This is why bad sunburn causes skin to peel off, the epidermal and dermal layers received enough damage to decide they need to kill themselves for the greater good. However, if DNA is damaged in certain ways, it can lead to cancer. It's not that DNA can't be repaired at all, it's that it is the \"master program\" for the cell and can be modified in ways that make the cell do things that it isn't supposed to.   You can also receive too much damage to important cells like in organs. It's actually therapeutic in some situations, such as using radioactive iodine to destroy some of a large thyroid, but many organs are not good at regenerating so the damage can hamper their functionality.","4":"Never really thought about it that way. So skin cells \"voluntarily\" end it because probably evolutionarily speaking, the ones who didn't, developed cancer more often, limiting their own baby production. I mean that's a little out there but I could see the self death mechanism being a powerful defense against potential cancer.","5":"It's not just skin, it's called apoptosis and most cells in the body can do it. It also goes beyond cancer, you don't want malfunctioning cells dumping chemicals into the rest of the body. It's an interesting process, multicellular organisms like humans aren't necessarily doing the best for individual cells, but for the whole."}}
