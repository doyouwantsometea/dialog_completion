The conception may be personal to you, but you feel like sharing it with others, and you may even believe they could benefit from it.","3":"I can only recall people making the fallacy in question a few times, but in all cases, it was to put somebody else down, or prop themselves up (by making themselves seem superior, or by clinging to their beliefs in the face of reasoning); never was it to benefit others.","4":"But what you are describing doesn't sound like a fallacy. It seems similar to my foreign movies example. Those people really believe that they fit certain requirement that places them in a superior category. So there's no fallacy involved. You may say they are a dick, maybe, but they aren't using any illogical reasoning.","5":"They aren't using reasoning at all, just like in your example.  They are just making stuff up.","6":"Which means it can't be a fallacy. Making stuff up is just laying out a premise. It's neither logical or illogical. It's just a premise."}}
