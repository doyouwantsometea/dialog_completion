You are hitting a pretty heavy argument between supporters and skeptics though so be wary.","2":"I\u2019m taking in as much as I can. It\u2019s not like I really have a say in the matter at this point. I read it worked in some cities. But long term I feel like corporations will just take whatever they can. Even if they aren\u2019t colluding they know they can raise their prices. Hell, our power companies make tens of millions a year and still are working to raise their prices to make even more millions. Now that everyone can afford it, they definitely will push it. I feel like we would temporarily get somewhere but in the end it\u2019s just the same thing. I would love to see homeless people have their basic needs taken care of like food and water. But I don\u2019t think it\u2019s realistic to say they can afford housing when the average Rent is $1500+","3":"That's true, I have read some data myself about alaska which has had a ubi program since 1980. This program showed that compared to the rest of the country alaska had reduced the cost of the average item for a household following implementation with a steady rise flowing that arose from inflation. Notably this inflation continued at a rate in line with the rest of the country meaning costs are still slightly lower in alaska than the nation at large. It was also interesting, as alaska in this time saw no significant change to full time workers as a proportion of the population but an increase in part time workers. This implies that those with good jobs were not leaving their jobs but those without were getting new ones that were mostly part time.","4":"Very interesting thanks","5":"I can pm you the study I've looked at if you're curious","6":"That would be great"}}
