So are you saying that 2019-2020 had more cases than 2020-2021? Or that 2018-2019 had more cases than 2019-2020?  If it's the former, the answer is that: the flu is spread in the same way that covid is. Since  everyone was washing their hands, wearing masks, and staying further apart, the flu wasn't being transmitted as much.  If it's the latter, then I have no idea since we started all the protection in March, which is after flu season...","2":"47 people tested positive for Influenza types A or B in 2020 in Canada as compared to 44000 or so in 2019 in all of Canada.  Go check it out on Canada.ca under Flu watch.","3":"So you didn't answer, but I assume you mean 2020-21 (which isn't over. The highest month is usually February) is lower than 2019-20.  Again, the reason is because of our precautions to covid are very effective at keeping flu number down. Influenza isn't usually a big deal, so we never go to great lengths to stop it. While Covid is very contagious, and Can result in hospitalization (influenza can too). The reason that we have been so precautious with Covid is because so many hospitals are at above 100% capacity. That was the entire point of flattening the curve, to keep the numbers at a more manageable rate for a long period of time. But people have let up on the precautions because everyone is understandably sick of the isolation","4":"I am comparing the 2019 - 2020 flu season which ended about a month ago according to Canada.ca, to the 2018 - 2019 flu season.  Now can you explain to me where did Influenza go? Is it gone forever? Can it come back? Can 47 people bring it back?","5":"The flu travels with winter. In the northern hemisphere, the season is from Oct-May and in the southern hemisphere, the season is from May-June (year, 8 months vs 6 months seems pretty unfair, but I think it's mostly because people don't live in Antarctica. Australia, South Africa, and Argentina and Chile aren't as cold as Canada or Russia).   Anyway, no, I don't think it would just go away like that. You say there's 47 reported cases in Canada, but that doesn't mean it's not in other countries, and it doesn't mean that people aren't slightly sick or asymptomatic and not going to doctors.","6":"How does it travel with the winter? Can you explain the physics of it to me?","7":"People or goods travel, the virus travels. It just sticks around more in winter weather.   Technically you could still get the flu in the summer, but it's much more unlikely. It's already pretty unlikely to get it in the outer months of the season, but outside of the season it's a lot less likely.  But right now it'll still be in the US and Canada, and in a few months it'll be more prominent in Brazil, and then next year it'll come back. And it will have mutated, just like it does every year, but hopefully we'll have predicted a correct vaccine and it won't be too bad","8":"So like where does it exist when it's not in people? For how long? There must be a way to get rid of it. One thing I know for sure is that it can't multiply unless it's in someone so if no one is sick, we can get it gone for good."}}
