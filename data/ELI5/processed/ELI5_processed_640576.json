But you need to bring more fuel to do so, which means you're heavier. Which means that you need even more fuel to burn to move at all. And that cycle just repeats--more speed = more fuel = more weight = need more fuel.","2":"So, is that the limiting factor in why we can\u2019t just, you know, zoom over to another galaxy?","3":"Pretty much.  We can go as fast as we want (with some restrictions). It just takes us a lot of energy to get up to that speed, which means a prohibitive amount of fuel.","4":"So, essentially, we have to a carry a *fuckton* of fuel to get going fast enough, but still have an equal *fuckton* of fuel to decelerate once we get there, and that would weigh so much that we would need several *fucktons* of additional fuel to compensate for the added mass, and we reach a point where it\u2019s just too many *fucktons* right?","5":"Pretty much, yeah. There's some technical stuff in there about how fast you can *really* go and how speeding up eventually starts giving significant diminishing returns, but yeah."}}
