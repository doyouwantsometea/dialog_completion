Emperor Constantine the Great made Christianity the official religion of the Empire in the fourth century A.D. And remember, \"Christianity\" here means Catholicism. Catholicism is the dominant denomination of Christianity. Protestantism is dominant in the United Kingdom and the former British colonies, such as the United States.","2":"But how did it go from being some little cult to Constantine making it the official religion in Rome?","3":"Well, Constantine's exact religious beliefs are still uncertain. We know his mother was a Christian. By the fourth century, Christianity was more than just a cult. It was a well-organized religion. Prior to Constantine, it was basically illegal to be a Christian. I think what Constantine actually did was make it perfectly legal to practice Christianity. He himself converted on his deathbed. I think it was actually Constantine's successor who made Christianity the official religion of the Empire.","4":"Right, but how did it grow so big that Constantine converted and he\/his successor make it the official religion? Like what happened between its formation yo being the official religion?","5":"The teachings of Christ were popular. There's no denying that. Like anything else, Christianity first spread by word of mouth. One community adopts, and then another, and so on. I think it's also worth noting that these early Christians were probably much more in line with Christ's teaching and did what they could to help those who had been hurt by the Roman Empire. And of course Christ was a martyr. People love a good marty. But really, there are a lot of reasons that contributed to the spread of Christianity, but the religion certainly wouldn't be where it is today had it not been adopted by the greatest power earth had ever known."}}
