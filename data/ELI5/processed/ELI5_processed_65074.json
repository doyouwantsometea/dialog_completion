Doesn't that contradict the very definition of \"infinite\"?","1":"you can't just say it's not and expect me to believe you.","2":"It's not valid because infinity is impossible","3":"not finite does not mean impossible","4":"Infinity is \u2018impossible\u2019 to define because describing or defining something requires it to have a point of differentiation with something else which is comparable; a finite quality.","5":"That doesn't make any sense at all, nor does it even attempt to justify itself.","6":"The definition is not-finite. The premise is you can't compare that which is infinite. The other premise is mathematics is getting results by operating with something they call infinite. Conclusion is what mathematics calls infinity is not infinite.","7":"&gt;The premise is you can't compare that which is infinite.  I reject your premise as baseless. Your making infinity mean something other than what it means.","8":"No, but they always come with the other, which, really, makes them the same thing","9":"you say that and expect me to believe you? My computer and the squirrel outside are incomparable but there is nothing infinite about either.","10":"But they are comparable","11":"As comparable as infinity is. You still have given me no reason to believe that infinity means the same thing as incomparable. You just expect me to believe you.","12":"&gt;As comparable as infinity is  Yikers  You could count the amount of atoms of hidrogen that are in the squirrel and the amount that are in the computer. 50 trillion vs 40 trillion? 125%.  How, exactly, do you even pretend to get a number from \"comparing\" infinity?","13":"Well, I say that X is infinity greater than Y. It works, you should try it. ","14":"???","15":"What about that confuses you?","16":"You skipped the question","17":"No I didn't. You asked how I compare infinite things to finite things and I said I say one is infinitely bigger than the other."}}
