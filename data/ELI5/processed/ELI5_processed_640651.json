Car manufacturers know you're going to do it anyway, so they overengineer their gearboxes accordingly.","2":"So you are saying that it's perfectly fine to skip gears, cars can handle it just fine? Which is what I have been saying all along, thanks for agreeing with me :).","3":"Doing things wrong is usually fine if you don't mind paying for fool-proofing.","4":"So, on the one hand, I have an engineer, numerous motoring journalists and my driving instructor telling me it's perfectly OK to skip gears. But on the other hand, there is this random person on the internet telling me it's \"wrong\" to skip gears. Hmmm, who to believe...  Seriously: you don't consider it to be possible that you are quite simply wrong on this issue?","5":"Hmm? I stopped caring when your post was removed, just been stringing you along seeing how worked up you can get about it.   Of course skipping gears is ok, it's just wrong in certain situations but not to a degree that can't be overcome by adding several hundred kilograms of metal to your vehicle."}}
