That is stupid when we have tons of evidence all around us pointing in a completely different direction","2":"There is no evidence as to what happens after you die. Anyone who has died cannot possibly tell us that.","3":"No, but there is plenty of evidence that tells us how the mind works, and none of it is compatible with some spiritual realm, och non-physical existence....","4":"None of them can explain how or why thoughts form.   So how can we possibly know they come from a spiritual realm.   Not even to mention I never said it must come from a non-physical existence. It\u2019s possible that we tap into something that exists into the very nature of our physical dimension that manifests thoughts within our minds.   Is that definitely the case? No. Is there as much evidence of this as any other hypothesis about where thoughts come from?   Yep, because apparently NO ONE ON EARTH KNOWS WHERE CONSCIOUSNESS COMES FROM OR WHAT IT IS.","5":"Its not like consciousness is some magical thing, its not even like we have free thought in the physical sense. Every decision we make is simple based on the state of all our neurons in that specific moment. If we know the speed and trajectories of all the particles in the universe, we could predict everything and anything that will ever happen.  Which brings us to an interesting conclusion, if everything can be predicted based on information in the now, can we really have conscious thought? is any decision based on free will? No.  We are the sum of our experiences and genes, nothing more nothing less. We are in a chaotic system where every tiny tiny decision or action from all of the 7billion ish humans on this planet affects every other human on the planet(butterfly effect is very real) This soup of cause and effect creates something that we interpret as free will.  we are a bunch of electrons going back and forth.","6":"&gt;Only like consciousness is some magical thing  I don\u2019t believe it\u2019s \u201cmagic\u201d at all. However, I cannot say for sure that it isn\u2019t, and neither can you, because we have no idea what causes it.  &gt;butterfly effect is very real  We don\u2019t know if the butterfly effect is real either. That\u2019s why there are different opinions regarding \u201cfate\u201d vs free will. We don\u2019t know if a butterfly flapping its wings has an effect on other events.  I see what your issue is, you have a set of preconceived notions that you are trying to pass off as \u201cfacts\u201d rather than belief. I am not hard set into my own ideas, but I can actually admit that we don\u2019t know","7":"We know what the butterfly effect is... And we know that if you could know the speed and trajectory of all matter in the universe, everything is theoretically predictable. These two are facts.","8":"&gt;you could know the speed and trajectory of all matter in the universe  But if the universe is truly infinite (which it is) we will never know all the variables because it never ends. You may be able to solve every variable that you find, but you will never find all of them.  &gt;everything is theoretically predictable  Man, only time will tell. As of right now, we cannot predict everything, we cannot even predict most things."}}
