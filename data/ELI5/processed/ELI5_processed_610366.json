The plane doesn't care if its you or a box.  They can't sell it to cargo any more than they could sell it to another person because *you lied* to them and told them that that weight was already taken.  &gt;I think that if you sold a service at a profit you sold a service at a profit  They **don't** sell the service at a profit.

Do you want me to explain what a citation is?  &gt; How about this: &gt; If you lying to them doesn't cost them money, then why are they fighting it?  I don't think they could care less about my lies, they care about profits like any other business. If I can buy a cheaper ticket, sure, that costs them money, so of course they fight it.
