Science says it needs to be done, politics is where it will be done and by who.","2":"But wouldn't science determine the best who and where?","3":"Proper nuclear waste disposal is ultimately just digging a giant hole in the ground to stuff the waste in, ideally in a place people wouldn't otherwise go digging, is geologically stable (ie, no earthquakes) with a good rock that's not going to erode away over time.  There are plenty of places like in the world. Yucca Mountain in America, Onkalo in Finland, Kimba in Australia all come to mind. Of those, only Onkalo is getting made because its the only one that hasn't gotten snagged up in local objections to building a nuclear waste dump at their feet. Because unsurprisingly locals dont particularly like the idea, they recognize that long-term disposal is necessary, but just *not here*.  You are dealing with people and you are dealing with distributing resources (in this case, nuclear waste), its political.","4":"Wouldn't science answer the first paragraph? At that point, if every spot will face objection, just pick the best spot and be done with it?","5":"I mean sure, you can do that if you happen to be a dictator."}}
