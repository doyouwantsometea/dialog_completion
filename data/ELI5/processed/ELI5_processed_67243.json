All the things I said above are legal. If workers follow the proper laws and procedures and vote to unionize, a company can't just say \"no\" and send the cops to slaughter everyone like they used to. They can do all sorts of things to prevent unionization or retaliate for successful or unsuccessful efforts, but they can't just say \"no\" and that's the end.","2":"They can because you cannot verify the amount of signatures needed to unionize.  Simply put- more people work at Walmart than people live in the states Vermont and New Hampshire combined. ","3":"That's wrong and doesn't make any sense, and I know because I do labor organizing","4":"You really think one person could approach over a third of the 2.2 million people that work for Walmart since they won't all agree, are you a labor board that turns a blind eye to corporations making your job null to them?","5":"I don't even know where to start. That's not how any of this works *at all.*"}}
