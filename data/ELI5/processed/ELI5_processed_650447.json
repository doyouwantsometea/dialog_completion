I'll use Apple. You purchased some of their shares in 2005. Their employees designed a product called an Iphone, marketed it, made it and sold millions of it and continued to innovate making their company valued at hundreds of billions of dollars because of the money it makes. You own a part of the effort the company put into this. How is this different from you buying a chicken, cooking it and selling it for more? If you sold someone a 25% share of your chicken company, then that person is entitled to 25% of the value of the company. You no longer own 100% of that company. If all you did was sell one chicken, then you need to give that person 25% of the profits from that chicken. A share isn't an IOU - it means that the owner of the share is part-owner of the company.","2":"but what does it mean to be part-owner if you're not getting dividends (part of the profits)?","3":"There are issues with corporate governance, but if someone owned 25% of the shares of a large public company (unrealistic mostly) they'd almost certainly be on the Board of Directors (BOD) and very likely the Chairman of the Board. The BOD (representatives of the shareholders - mostly large shareholders themselves) decide on the dividend policy. It is, in theory, the shareholders that decide whether or not the company pays a dividend, management can advise but the board decides.   So if a company doesn't pay dividends it is usually a joint consensus of the management and the owners (shareholders) of the company. Of course, if someone owns 0.00001% of the shares of the company, they probably cannot expect to have much say (other than voting at the AGM) in the major strategic decisions of the company.","4":"yeah, so I feel like buying non-dividend shares is more of a winner takes all system. You either buy enough to gain some control or you shouldn't bother, since you own something you have no control over, which really feels more like a gamble, though safer.","5":"The beauty of the free market is that you can make any investment decision based on any set of beliefs you have. All I can attempt is to explain how it works. If your conclusion is that A is better than B, then so be it.   It is simply odd that you make such a huge distinction between dividend and non-dividend paying shares. But you are free to do so. Hopefully if you ever intend to invest, you research the return history of various companies in recent history and validate your belief (dividend etc) against empirical performance.   At the end of the day, investing is mostly about making as much money as you can at an acceptable risk in a timeframe that fits you.","6":"True. It's not much different to buying Nike shoes or Louis Vuitton bags and reselling them for a higher price. As long as someone is willing to buy."}}
