Comparing your product to a competitor is like the basis of advertising. Saying that \u201cour shampoo is comparable to Head and Shoulders\u201d isn\u2019t an infringement of their trademark or any other sort of crime or tort.","2":"Ok hear me out, we have product \u201cDave\u201d here for $5 good product rep, following and\/or what not then there\u2019s \u201cEvil Dave\u201d right next to it for $4.29 saying it just like Dave.
