How would that transaction go? Would you give them a tiny little grain of sand sized piece of gold? Don't you think it would be dangerously easy to lose a lot of money walking around with tiny little flecks of gold?","2":"I would imagine other previous metals, to be honest","3":"So like, coins?","4":"Yup. Billets. But coins used to get shaved down. But, we can just weight them.","5":"I still don't see how this is in any way a better system. Having coins and bills with specific values seems far more convenient than whittling away at chunks of metal at a checkout counter.","6":"Coins can have specific values and easily exchanged like change. What does a central \"Fiat currency\" help us with? Isn't it just an extra system?","7":"I don't understand what you're saying"}}
