Try it instead of buying balls.","5":"I haven\u2019t played Pok\u00e9mon go since it was popular 5 years ago... I was addressing the hypocrisy of you saying someone\u2019s \u201cmade of money\u201d for pointing out the fact that you can just buy new sponges which are extremely cheap, when you have the means to buy shit for a mobile game.","6":"You must be a republican lol. \u201cYou balk at spending extra money? But look 5 years ago I think your wife bought a video game!\u201d Very sound argument, sir.","7":"Wow never been called a republican before for something so innocuous. Go boil a sponge instead of spending a buck.","8":"It\u2019s the entitled attitude that revealed you, that\u2019s why. Proudly claiming, \u201clocal man says he doesn\u2019t like spending money found to have likely spent some extra money years ago\u201d as a point is something straight out of the onion, yet here you are.","9":"Dude I was making a joke about micro purchases on a game you post about often, which are functionally meaningless compared to essentials, and when confronted about how cheap those essentials are you say \u201cI\u2019m not made of money\u201d. It was just a hypocritical comment, I\u2019m not lambasting you because you may have spent money on something years ago. Also, not that it matters, but I couldn\u2019t be farther from a republican lmao. But the fact that you somehow think calling me that is an epic comeback says a lot about you.","10":"If you think being called a republican is an insult, that\u2019s on you. If you see it as a compliment, that\u2019s also on you. If someone behaves really conservative, or really overly blindly progressive etc of course I\u2019m going to notice that shit and mention it lol","11":"Oh come on dude, you framed it as an insult don\u2019t play me like that lol. I\u2019m not going to prove my political values to you because you think someone\u2019s conservative for pointing out your hypocritical statement. I\u2019m not going around saying \u201chmmm you complain about capitalism yet participate in it??\ud83e\udd14 \ud83e\udd14\u201d","12":"You\u2019re right I can\u2019t even continue this or claim to be innocent here, I\u2019m the one that escalated you.","13":"Dope now go buy some sponges haha","14":"This was all theoretical brainstorming dork lol, \u201cI wonder what ELi5 thinks about this dumb sponge thought\u201d thank you for giving me some perspective too though; Can\u2019t engage a topic like this and then not expect varied replies lol"}}
