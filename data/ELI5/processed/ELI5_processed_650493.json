Sleep Apnea?","2":"It's prob depression, but I gotta get tested.","3":"I don\u2019t know about you, but for me, with everything happening in this crazy world, it\u2019s hard not to be depressed and not just situational depression, where you are just terribly sad! For me, it manifests In not wanting to get out of my PJs and sleeping a lot but never feeling rested and energetic, not really sad, but just kind of blah!","4":"Yea, I just have no energy and I don't have any responsibilities, I'm 14 so I can work but have no where to work so yay. So I just don't do anything.","5":"I\u2019m sorry to hear that! I\u2019m old - but I\u2019ve been battling depression since I was 12 y\/o - it\u2019s hard being that age and adults not understanding and expecting you to just \u201cget over it\u201d or the guilt trip \u201cyou are so lucky to have that broccoli, kids in Africa are starving\u201d are some of the responses I used to get from adults.  Is there someone that you can trust that you can reach out to?"}}
