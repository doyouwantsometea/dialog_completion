At the end of the day a pale person can\u2019t *avoid* tanning if they spend enough time in the sun, but somebody would need to really go out of their way in order to lighten their skin.","2":"I meant like going to the tanning salon, \"fake\" tanning, purposely laying on the sun to tan.  Moreover, it's also natural to get a paler tone if you're not in the sun.","3":"Again, even if they\u2019re using unnatural means, it\u2019s still a natural process. If done properly at least, you wouldn\u2019t notice the difference between someone who went to a tanning bed or sat in the sun for a while. With that said - spray tans are a different story, and people are pretty open about that. Take Donald Trump for example.   It\u2019s totally natural to get a paler tone if you\u2019re not in the sun, and I don\u2019t think anybody would shame you just because you didn\u2019t go out in the sun much. But at the same time, that\u2019s pretty unhealthy, and also totally different than *purposely* lightening your skin. If you\u2019re avoiding the sun just to become paler, I\u2019d be pretty concerned.","4":"why tho? I'm curious about your logic behind this. Both tanning and un-tanning happen naturally during summer and winter anyway.   Why is it concerning to go out of your way to become paler but not to go out of your way to tan? I'm curious bout the logic behind your answer.","5":"Because we need vitamin D, and sunlight plays an integral role in our sleep cycles, hormones, and just general well-being.   It\u2019s not concerning in itself to become paler, it would be concerning if somebody were avoiding sunlight. Especially if it were solely for the sake of becoming paler, as it\u2019s entirely aesthetic and would seriously fuck with you.","6":"So if people used sun block or, like in japan, clothes to cover face, it'd be fine then?","7":"I\u2019m not really sure what you\u2019re asking here?  Using sun block is a good idea, yes. UV rays can be harmful and it\u2019s good to mitigate them in some way to avoid getting a sunburn.   I know absolutely nothing about Japanese people covering their faces and what purpose it serves. Or how it could be relevant to this conversation.","8":"You seem to claim the difference is the danger of it, even though skin lightning can be achieved harmlessly.   I can't figure out a way to apply your logic and still make sense to both scenarios (tanning and lightning of the skin)   The Japanese comment was a way to illustrate how it is achieved.   TL;DR your logic doesn't make sense for both scenarios, asking you to elaborate.","9":"My reasoning was never solely based on the danger of it, I explained the harmfulness because you asked why it would be concerning if somebody went out of their way to become paler.   If you refer to my previous comments, it\u2019s about the effort it requires and if it\u2019s actually natural, *as well as* the danger it poses. Tanning is a natural process and often incurs few risks, and can also be done effortlessly. Lightening your skin is not a natural process, you would need to go out of your way to accomplish it, and (to my knowledge) would be harmful in any way that you go about it.  I\u2019m also still stumped on the relevance of your Japan example.","10":"You can cover your skin with cloth such that you don't get tanned by the sun when you go to the beach, this is harmless. What I just said is an example of a harmless way to prevent tanning.   Does it make sense to you now?","11":"You\u2019re talking about preventing tanning vs actively lightening one\u2019s skin.   No, it doesn\u2019t make sense to me, because it\u2019s completely irrelevant. Don\u2019t patronize me, dickhead.","12":"huh?","13":"I\u2019m saying there\u2019s a distinction between *avoiding getting too much sun* and *going out of your way to lighten your skin*. Even if you go to the beach with cloth over your skin, you\u2019ll still be exposed to the sunlight, and it\u2019ll still make you darker. Just the same as how you can get a sunburn through the clouds. The only way to actively make your skin lighter would be to avoid sunlight altogether, and if there are alternative methods, just as someone else mentioned, they\u2019d likely be very unhealthy for you or your skin.","14":"What makes you assume that covering your skin with clothe doesn't prevent tanning? Literally people get the \"trucker\" tan this way?  And in any case, the risk for tanning and skin lightning seem to be pretty up there anyway, so not sure hot his is relevant?","15":"https:\/\/goodlookingtan.com\/can-you-tan-through-clothing\/  &gt;\u201dCan you tan through clothing? The simple answer is yes, you can. While all materials are different, clothes should not be relied on to prevent the sun\u2019s harmful rays from reaching your skin.\u201d  *You\u2019re not sure how this is relevant?* Go back and reread our argument my guy, my argument has stayed pretty consistent while yours has been hardly coherent.","16":"Yeah totally, specially with the insult, lol","17":"I edited it out already because I realized it was immature, but you were absolutely being patronizing while barely putting up any sort of argument, you were misguidedly condescending and it made me want to insult you. My apologies. Anyway, considering your last couple replies, it looks like we\u2019re done here. Have a nice day.","18":"Good night!"}}
