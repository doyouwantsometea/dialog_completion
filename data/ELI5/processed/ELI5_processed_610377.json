The act of doing the job and the outcome of the job are two separate things.","2":"So, you agree that the pay should be based on the outcome. If the outcome is less than a man, then the pay should be less than a man. It is only fair. ","3":"No I said the opposite of that.","4":"Then it is not fair, isn't it? You are demanding equal pay for an unequal outcome. ","5":"I'm not demanding anything. I think equal pay for each person doing the same job makes sense.  Are you suggesting all jobs should be paid in a similar scheme to commission based jobs? That would probably be too big an overhaul of the system, too difficult to monitor etc."}}
