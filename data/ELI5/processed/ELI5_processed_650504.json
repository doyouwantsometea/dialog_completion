Do chemical reactions still happen on\/inside them? Can heat escape?","1":"That is one of the toughest questions in physics!  Nobody really knows what happens inside the event horizon of a black hole - light can't get out, and we can't see in. There are many theories about what does occur inside.  But, to give you a little experience of what might happen in the black hole - let's pretend that a squirt gun full of water is shot straight up - and pretend that the water comes out at the speed of light - the gravity of the black hole slows down the water and stops it in mid-air then it falls back and rains all over you - just like light can't get out of that hole.  As for chemical reactions? Nobody knows.","2":"So it happens so quickly we can't see anything flaring up? Thats crazy. Correct me if I'm wrong, but we only see them when they're in the middle of tearing apart a system or blocking\/warping our view of a system, right?","3":"Yes it happens super fast - the only thing we can see or study happens outside of the event horizon of the black hole itself.  Gravity is the only thing that we know of that escapes a black hole.","4":"My understanding is black holes spin super quickly, are there black holes that don't rotate about themselve?","5":"If there are any non-rotating black holes they would be very very very hard to find. The rapid rotation is one of the best ways we use to locate them."}}
