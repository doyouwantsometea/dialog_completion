The question isn't should we ask the question if we can control the answer, the question is, is the oracle *always* right regardless of the situation, to which the answer is no","2":"This seems to be simply shifting the definition, not a \"proof.\"  There are one more fundamental things I'm missing, but I can't put my finger on what they  might be.  As I wrote below in response to another attempt at an explanation, there seems to be some funny business in permitting the \"trickster\" program to change its behavior in response to the oracle program's output.  I have always thought, perhaps incorrectly, that computers behave deterministically.","3":"The program isn't changing it's behaviour, it's already been written definitively. Which of these predefined behaviours is followed depends on a variable made in the code. This is extremely common in all kinds of programming and computing, and not unique to this proof in any way","4":"But how can the oracle be making a meaningful prediction if another program is simply hard-coded to do the opposite of what the oracle says?","5":"it can't, hence a perfect oracle doesn't exist","6":"But if the proof is phrased in those terms, then it doesn't seem to be doing much work.  In other words, if I told you the following, then the result (that the oracle can't exist) wouldn't strike a reasonable person as earth-shattering:  There exists a person who can always tell you, on any given afternoon, how long you'll sleep that evening.  Additionally, once you ask that person in the afternoon how long you'll sleep that evening, you always have the power to stay up all night and blow up the person's earlier prediction\/statement.  There is something unsatisfying about this logically that I can't put my finger on.  Is this explored anywhere in discussions of the halting problem?","7":"sometimes, the most interesting part of a mathematical proof is the formalisation, and not the result. there are some very intuitive things that you \"think\" are true, that are immensly difficult to prove- even if this proof seems unsatisfying or the result seems uninteresting it is noteworthy, you can never know for sure until someone proves it, no matter how intuitive it seems"}}
