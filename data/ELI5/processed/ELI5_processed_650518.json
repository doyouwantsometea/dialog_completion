It's quite clear that this person considers that a true Scotsman shouldn't be putting sugar on his porridge. They are not moving the goalposts here, they are being quite clear from the start that this is how they define being a Scotsman.  \"A true Scotsman shouldn't be putting sugar on his porridge\" wouldn't be fallacious.  But it isn't what the person in the example actually says.  I mean, lots of fallacies work this way -- if you made your point differently, it wouldn't be a fallacy.","2":"I mean, it's clear in the first sentence that this is what they are implying. Why else would they be saying it?","3":"I think you maybe misunderstand the entire premise here.  What they're saying is literally that no Scotsman puts sugar in his porridge.  The reason they're saying it is to make the claim that putting sugar on porridge is a thing that Scots don't do.  That's why else.","4":"Why do you think they are saying that? Because it's their view of what a Scotsman should do.  If they were just stating what they believe to be a fact, then they wouldn't be revising their assertion later on, they would just acknowledge that their assertion was in fact incorrect.","5":"... er, no they wouldn\u2019t? Because they are a hypothetical figurative embodiment of fallacious reasoning, remember?  Like, that would be a reasonable thing to do. But they\u2019re engaging in a fallacy instead. Which is why they\u2019re the example of a fallacy."}}
