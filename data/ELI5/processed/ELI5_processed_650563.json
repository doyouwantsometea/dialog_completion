Most important rule is the action economy and the rest you can wing on the fly as many DMs do, look up some videos later if you want to know more. (channels of Don't stop thinking, Matt Colville, How to be a great GM and many more)  So the action economy during combat are:  -1 Action - anything you can think that takes up majority of time, it's an attack usually, dashing, hiding, casting a spell  -1 Bonus action - specific spells and class feature use this, it's not an Action, but a special type of action.  -Movement - you can move up number of feet your character has (usually it's 30 but depending on class and race you can have more or less -1 Reaction - this you can use even out of your turn. Certain spells can be triggered by a reaction (counterspell and shield come to mind) but also attacks of opportunity, which happens when you move out of your enemy's melee range","2":"Yeah bonus actions have been kinda hard to get, I understand the idea of it but how do I classify something as a bonus action or not, are they only thinge that are written down or can the players come up with bonus actions on the fly?","3":"Bonus actions are written down, certain class features and spells can only be casted as a bonus action. Some classes allow you to do more attacks with your bonus action if you already attacked with your action, kind of doing a 1 2 punch thing.  They can totally make something if it makes sense and you allow it. Common houserule is that drinking a potion is a bonus action, but in reality it's an action. Bonus action is either a follow up on something (like the attack, but only if you can, that's determined by class usually) or something but meaningful (casting a spell, using a class feature) but not something too quick and basing (pulling a lever, opening a door, which you can do as part of you movement.)   But either way you can ignore these things and change the rules,as a dm you have that privilege","4":"Ok, so as as house rule its: movement is movement plus anything really basic, action would the the main course of your turn and bonus actions are secondary\/basic\/class specific actions that either implement your action or dont interact with other players or foes (so drinking a potion is a bonus action but tossing it would be an actiom)","5":"Yes, drinking bonus, but trying to shove a potion down ones throat is an action. And basic things like opening door pulling a lever, sheathing\/unsheathing your sword as part of your movement is still going by the rules"}}
