(Child imprisonments, kidnapping, murder caught on film.. etc). How does one of the law know they\u2019re guilty, yet spend hours defending their characteristics, yet know they\u2019re wrong. All money aside.","1":"In our system everyone deserves to have someone who knows the court systems to help them through the whole process. A friend of mine is a defense lawyer. He does it because he believes the system needs to be fair.","2":"Ok. So out of fairness, to not let the accused be totally backed into a cement corner for life?","3":"He says he makes sure the prosecutor and the courts follow the rules. He has defended murderers they had a mountain of evidence on. At that point he tries to make sure everything is done correctly and his client gets a fair day in court.","4":"Got it. Thanks for your reply.   Answered so quickly, I feel silly.","5":"Don\u2019t feel silly I asked him the same thing."}}
