I know they \"don't share\", but is that a crack at aristocrats or more of a Buddhist-style respectful reference to the nobility?","1":"I realise that, thats why I'm telling you to do it yourself.  Its not a particularly rational approach to take for atomic theory, but there are good tangible ways to test it.  Heisenberg was found in a cave with holding a lump of cadmium next to an open nuclear reactor. People told him to check the math because he math was wrong. Oppenheimer showed that very very conclusively.","2":"Oppenheimer who (in addition to being hated by, among many others, Linus Pauling whose wife he unsuccessfully tried to bang), got his security clearance revoked for probably trying to sell out the Soviets, which had no hindrance at all in the progression\/advancement of nuclear weapons? No Oppenheimer and others like Einstein on the Manhattan Project were gross people who didn't know what they were doing but always tried to claim credit (true visionaries like Fermi only sided with them because the Nazis probably would have persecuted his wife, who like his coworkers, was Jewish)   No, many people think either the Nazis towards the end detonated a smaller atomic bomb which is A.) Why the Americans weren't able to nuke Japan until after Germany was 'defeated' and they had all the Nazi scientists, and B.) What the Nazis probably used as a bargaining chip to have the Western Allies of America and England tacitly  side with Germany over the Soviet Union towardd the end so the Germans could at least salvage West Germany","3":"You are totally insane if you believe any of that. Please travel, go meet people, go see the sites of these things someone has told you happened. thats such a drastic and inappropriate rewrite of history that I don't really know how to respond to it.","4":"https:\/\/www.google.com\/amp\/s\/www.independent.co.uk\/news\/world\/europe\/radioactive-nazi-atom-bomb-bernd-th-lmann-germany-amateur-treasure-hunter-a7963521.html%3famp  Unfortunately this article is only so-so, I saw another British news article a while back that was better","5":"Once again though, their plan failed because their math was wrong. They didn't have a bomb, they did have enriched uranium, they were just wrong about the quantities they needed specifically because Heisenberg did not check his math.  They had a reactor, again thats where the allies found him (holding a lump of cadmium).","6":"I've heard that too, just that the Nazis didn't add enough uranium   Do you honestly think out of all the visionary and extremely daring and outside-the-box things the Nazis tried, they wouldn't have just checked what adjusting the uranium amounts would do?   It is theoretically possible that you're right and they didn't use the right amount of uranium, but ask yourself, what if they did?","7":"No they thought they needed more than they did, the firing mechanism is where they messed up.   And ya I do, they messed up the math, partially because the guy in charge of the math hated it when people told him to check it.. You can find his notes and look at it.  If they did then they had the pieces and they just calmly decided not to use the bomb and lose the war because I guess they felt bad about the whole war thing. You are right, that makes more sense."}}
