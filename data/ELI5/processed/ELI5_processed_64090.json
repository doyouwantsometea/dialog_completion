Doesn't that contradict the very definition of \"infinite\"?","1":"Show that it's impossible then. You haven't given my any reason to believe you.","2":"If it was possible it would make sense, if it was possible, Infinite=Infinite would be true, Infinite-Infinite=0 would be true, Infinite+1=Infinite would be true and therefore 1=0 would be true.","3":"If infinite \/= infinite, then infinite +1 \/= infinite +1 and so 1 \/= 1. See, I can do it too, you haven't fixed the issue.","4":"...yeah  When did I give the impression that I thought it was 0? I think I said precisely the opposite","5":"You made the assumption in your derivation that 1 = 0 starting from inf = inf. I pointed out you made a mistake and so you didn't prove any logical fallacy.","6":"Uh... You do realise i can just erase that \"step\" and the whole thing is the exact same?","7":"No you can't, not without making another mistake. I've done enough derivations to see that.","8":"...  Infinity=Infinity  Infinity+1=Infinity  1=0","9":"How do you get rid of the infinities on each side without subtracting?","10":"Subtracting one thing from one side from the other is the same as just eliminating, ignoring, its existance.","11":"No it's not. It's shorthand for subtracting. You made a mistake, admit it and learn from it.","12":"xD  Subtracting is shorthand for ignoring. You just made a mistake, admit it and learn from it.","13":"whoa, sick burn dude...","14":"Sick burn but realise it's the same thing","15":"Sure, I admit it. I've been ignoring your dumber remarks for the sake of argument."}}
