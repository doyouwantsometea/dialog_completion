You search for other things and a computer with alot of data figures out that the type of person who searches for these 5 things but not those 8 probably is interested in this new thing.  It can be scarily accurate depending on how much data the computer has (a metric crapton in terms of Google\/Amazon)","2":"I watched a movie for the first time today and there\u2019s an ad on my instagram for a video game from the movie. I didn\u2019t google anything about it either.","3":"Where did you watch the movie?  If it's a streaming site it's a near guarantee that several advertisers know about it.  Even if it was a DVD\/cable there's a non zero chance that it's been logged somewhere because of smart features in television.  If a movie that had a surge in popularity and you are group a the type of person who would enjoy that franchise then it could just be coincidence that it was recommended on the same day.   If it was a rip from an old movie you got from a friend on a flash drive that you watched on a whim then idk man it's as much black magic to me as you at that point.","4":"It\u2019s the streaming service. So Disney + sells what I watch to ad companies?","5":"[more likely than not sadly](https:\/\/www.google.com\/amp\/s\/www.nytimes.com\/2019\/10\/25\/business\/media\/streaming-data-collection-privacy.amp.html)","6":"Thanks for the read. Yeah that pretty much sums it up. Yikes."}}
