If there is nothing happening, what is time? What would one measure, when you know that nothing is and nothing will be forever?   To me, time is just a  measurement unit for an action...from state to state.  What is interesting tho is, that if universe stops to \u201cwork\u201d as most scientists think..expanding to final total freeze. Then time really stops.  But what if our universe is just a \u201cgalaxy\u201d in a super universe. Our universe is dead, no time, but trillions lightyears away is another universe, fully working. Do we have a time, or not?:)","2":"The last question is really difficult, if you are into philosophy, I have an additional one. Can we say those other universes even exist if they are virtually unreachable and we can't even prove their existence?","3":"Exactly that. These thoughts are really hurting my brain haha. But you are right and that was mine point too. If other universe is soooo far, like, after u leave our universe, then u go 6 \u201clenghts\u201d of our universe to reach the other...does it still really exist for us?","4":"My brain is apparently too primitive to understand any of this :) Do you think those other universes have same laws of nature? Our physics is the only one which is possible or it's just bound to our (and only ours) universe?","5":"This is something that really interest me. Is it possible to have different laws of physics, or is that thing set in stone?   My personal humble opinion is, that our physical laws in this universe are the definite laws and if other universe exists, it might be different a lot, but the basic laws are the same.  I kinda hope in my heart, that there are universes, many and that the existence will \u201cnever\u201d end. What scares me the most is idea of this universe freezing and that is it..over forever. That gives me goosebumps.  Were we really that lucky to earn existence in this one occasion? I do believe 100% there is a life in our universe, and not just microscopic, larger. Is it gonna be end for everyone once this universe is done? Or is this universe shrinking and expanding as a never ending process and big-bangs are repeating?  I personally think, that it would be too much of a coincidence, if one universe exists, only once and we are born.   I do think things are repeating, or there is trillions of universes:)  Unfortunately, I dont think we will ever get answer to that."}}
