Why aren\u2019t Bats, Snakes, Apes ,Turtles...mostly all animals called living dinosaurs if there were versions of that same animal walking the earth millions of years ago?","1":"Because chickens and birds are actually directly descended from dinosaurs while mammals are descended from rat like things that lived alongside dinosaurs, and other reptiles are cousins of dinosaurs","2":"Lived alongside Dinos is what\u2019s confusing me here. So you got the Reptiles and Rat like things sharing the same earth together but only one is called a dinosaur? I just thought that meant old ass animal that was around before the comet hit.","3":"No, dinosaurs is a specific classification  And it was an asteroid not a comet","4":"I\u2019m a 33 year old man who just learned \u201cdinosaur\u201d doesn\u2019t mean what i thought I didn\u2019t since my first coloring book , I don\u2019t think I have it in me to learn the truth behind the Asteroids and Comets scandal.","5":"A comet is an icy thing in space that flies very close to the sun every few decades\/centuries and back out to the edge of the solar system. The sublimating ice is what causes the tail to form.  An asteroid is a rocky thing in space. It usually is in a stable-ish orbit and it does not sublimate"}}
