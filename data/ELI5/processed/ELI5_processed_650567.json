Yes, your unionizing activities cannot be during your work hours and on their private property.  If you want to organize, in secret, on your own time and property, you're welcome to.","2":"Well what if I asked my co-workers to sign and agree to sign a pro-associate benefits group(like a union but less incriminating) proposal that was the same write up as a union paper and handed it to corporate, could they deny it as opposed to every other corporation or company? ","3":"&gt; could they deny it  I don't know what you keep calling \"deny\".  So you've got a majority of Walmart employees signed on?  You either have a union or you don't.  If you don't have a union, then you don't have any of the legal protections given to unions in the U.S.  &gt; as opposed to every other corporation or company?  I don't know what this means or why you act like Walmart is the only non-unionized employer in the U.S.","4":"Can a single store unionize? Otherwise I would have to have the same amount of people that live in New Hampshire and Vermont sign because that's how many people work for Walmart. ","5":"&gt; Can a single store unionize?  No.  Maybe a single state's stores can, I really don't know.  I'm not a labor lawyer.  &gt; Otherwise I would have to have the same amount of people that live in New Hampshire and Vermont sign because that's how many people work for Walmart.  Exactly."}}
