Imagine a fridge that is full of cucumbers. You open the fridge and the cucumbers fall out onto the floor. Well the same principle can be applied here except the cucumbers are the sun and the fridge is a fridge. It's to do with how the light bounce of your eyes as well I think. Hope this helps.","2":"Ah I see!! Nice analogy, I love cucumbers!!","3":"As for your second query, the sun does in fact set in space. This is a lie the anti-fake moon landing film crew crowd would have you believe.","4":"I'd love to see our solar system with a nice sunset of orange and purple and reds. It would look beautiful","5":"Well if I may make a suggestion. One trick astronomers use to get different colours on their photos of space is to put a piece of cling film colored with a felt tip. you could do this and wrap it around your head and go and look at the sky. Either during the day or at night. Just do not look directly into the sun although it is safe to look at the sun through binoculars. Happy stargazing internet stranger"}}
