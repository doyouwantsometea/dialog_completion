This is a man who invented the theory of the subconscious to explain why people believed they _didn't_ want their own mothers sexually. So much nonsense passed into pop culture. Anally retentive. It's all complete nonsense from a clearly deranged man and you're giving it **way** more respect than it deserves.","2":"It seems to me you\u2019ve never read any of the work. Why is your hatred so virulent?","3":"That's a very vague and ad hominem rebuttal. To reply in kind, it seems to me you've never had a logical thought. Why is your critical thinking so absent?","4":"Not interested in your arguments.","5":"And I'm not interested in trying to rationalise the irrational nonsense Freud spouted. I'll call it out as nonsense when I come across it, thank you very much."}}
