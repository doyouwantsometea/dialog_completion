You know that term existed long before some dumb shit American think tank weaponized it? It fits perfectly in this context.  Go traveling. Leave the bizzaro bubble that is America. It will do you a world of wonders.","3":"I happen to be German and your comments make me cringe. Maybe you should travel and read more instead of asking bad-faith question on reddit to prove some point. This reeks of alt-right dogwhistles","4":"You do realise this sub revolves around explaining things to people.*like they are 5*? It could just as aptly be called *explain to me because I'm ignorant of how this works?*. I literally came here to try and get a better understanding, and if you bothered to read the thread you would see that I did.  Sorry I'm not versed on 80 year old German history.  Are you really *that* self absorbed to come to a sub like this and \"dog whistle\" to everybody how morally superior you are for know everything about the ins and outs of Germany in WWII. Do you feel better about yourself now you've asserted yourself as the political gatekeeper on who is alt-right?  Good job man. You really saved the planet with this one.","5":"It's one thing to ask questions and another to do so in bad faith. I'm obviously not the only one who sees this. And what the hell is up with accusing everyone of being condescending or feeling morally superior. You were the one who literally said:  &gt;\"How old are you?\"  &gt; \"Go traveling [...] It will do you a world of wonders\""}}
