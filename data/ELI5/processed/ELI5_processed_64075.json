Now they are warning us about the heat. I don\u2019t remember ever having a power outage during any other winter or sumner unless ice took down a line or a hurricane took out a line. What changed?","1":"Energy storage is the big problem with renewable energy. Our batteries don't have enough energy in them and they leak it too fast. Coal and gas can be burned to demand.  At this point better energy storage is probably one of the biggest hurdles.","2":"Interesting. I didn\u2019t realize the wind, solar, and hydro energies went to batteries. I guess I just thought they went to the grid directly.","3":"They do! But the problem is that sometimes you need more energy. People spend more energy on cooling during hot days, but those days aren't necessarily more windy or even sunny. People use more energy at home after they get home from work, after most of the solar energy has vanished during the winter.  On the other hand, if it is really windy or sunny at 4 am on a Tuesday, we can't store up that excess energy to use it when people wake up because of the lack of batteries.","4":"That\u2019s so crazy to me.   Doesn\u2019t it take a lot of resources to make a battery?    I am not in this field at all, but I think batteries have plastic and a fluid to help electrons flow and a source for the electrons.   So what is better? Burning the oil or coal? Or all the resources to build a solar panel or turbine and the batteries to save it?    Someone earlier said the energy from the coal and oil was used instantly.","5":"The issue is we have been having to get oil and coal from more and more obscure places, and its really dangerous work that is very bad for the environment -- fracking, for example, has awful effects on geographic stability and drinking water. Not to mention that burning them has already noticeably changed the climate and caused more intense catastrophes.  The hope is to get a breakthrough in batteries, so even if we have to use some nonrenewable resources for our batteries it is less than the constant burning of fuel. This will also have to be coupled with more sustainable industrial processes -- it takes a lot of energy to turn the airs nitrogen into the plant nitrogen with the industrial process, so either a lower energy method of that or even more sustainably using bird shit and working with doves\/pigeons would lower the amount of energy we have to use.","6":"That would be interesting.   I think I read one time that another country was burning their grocery sacks and other plastics from the recycling center for their energy and they ran out of recycled goods.   I can\u2019t imagine that burning plastic for energy would smell desirable. So why not burn avian feces as you suggested?","7":"Burning anything releases carbon dioxide. People have suggested burning things that are safer to burn than coal, like corn -- that is usually called \"biomass\" in renewable energy charts. But it still takes the basic atoms that are in more biologically useful forms in the plants and turns them mostly into \"air forms\" which are less useful and more difficult to manage, and also the amount of energy contained in corn is less than the amount of energy contained in coal by mass and volume. (Which actually has to do with calories! Although the calories available to fire are generally more than the calories available to humans. But calories are a measurement of how much energy is stored inside an object.)  What I actually meant was using bird shit as fertilizer, which is a biologically useful to biologically useful transition.","8":"Sugar has a lot of calories. Four per gram if I remember correctly. That is why sugar mills go boom from time to time.   Can we mine sugar for energy?","9":"It has a lot of calories compared to most things humans eat. Gasoline and coal have even more because they have longer carbon connections -- the more connections, the more energy. (That is very oversimplified.)  You could burn sugar for energy, but you would get less energy than burning gasoline or coal. Also burning sugar is messy -- it turns into goop and crusts on everything. Much better for eating. But again, that falls under the general \"biofuel\" category of renewable energy.","10":"So we need to find something that has a high energy level but doesn\u2019t turn into a sticky mess?   We want double or triple bonds, right?","11":"In general we mostly need lots of it, which is going to lead to a mix of bonds. But because of the greenhouse gases it's best to not burn anything at all.","12":"So what do we want to do?","13":"Better batteries and clean energy! We've looped back around haha","14":"I read once where they were making food ware (bowls, spoons, etc) out of fungus. Could we make the battery casings out of fungus so they will break down when the cells are no longer rechargeable?","15":"I don't know! It certainly sounds interesting, though.","16":"If it could hold hot soup I am sure it can hold acidic ions"}}
