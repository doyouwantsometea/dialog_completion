All organisms are just replication machines, that have gotten more and more sophisticated.","2":"But what about other complex molecules?   Aorganic molecules that does not self replicate should eventually, in a system that tends towards equlibrium, break into smaller parts and in organic terms \"die\" out leaving only basic elements, simple molecules, organic material and the product of organisms?","3":"Complex molecules can be made by adding energy in the system.   This is the theorized origin of life where simple organic molecules are naturally occurring and forms a soup where a lightning strike would have added the energy to form the first replicator molecules too simple to even be considered alive.","4":"Ohh and btw do you know any good popular scientific documentaries or videos on the subject? Watched \"first life\", but that was more on the origin of complex life, than on life itself, which interests me less.","5":"The selfish gene by Richard Dawkins"}}
