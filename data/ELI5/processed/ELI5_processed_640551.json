I'm an ex night club DJ (back in the late 80's to mid 90's) so I get random songs stuck in my head all of the time.  If they don't go away pretty quick I'll just play the whole song and be done with it.  ","2":"So apparently this is the solution. I\u2019m definitely gonna try to tomorrow when the next song gets stuck in my head lol","3":"So it's gonna be forever Or it's gonna go down in flames You can tell me when it's over If the high was worth the pain Got a long list of ex-lovers They'll tell you I'm insane 'Cause you know I love the players And you love the game  why wait?  *ducks and runs away laughing ","4":"Curse you and your Taylor swift lyrics! \ud83d\ude02 luckily I\u2019m listening to other music already so that should keep it from getting stuck in my head... *should*.","5":"LMAO.. she does have a knack for writing catchy lyrics :)  Wish I could get rich for being about as deep as a parking lot puddle ;) "}}
