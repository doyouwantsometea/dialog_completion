Why throw water at the performers as well? Isn't it a little counterproductive?","1":"It\u2019s the vileness of humans and the anonymity of a crowd. I\u2019ve seen people throw cups of beer, water and urine around a crowd.  Urine is very common. People are stood in a field waiting for a band, can\u2019t get to the toilet so pee in a cup. Then they don\u2019t want the cup of pee around them so they lob it over a crowd. It\u2019s repulsive behaviour but very common.","2":"That is horrible! Why throw urine at someone? This is genuinely distressing, I'm going to avoid festivals.","3":"It\u2019s awful. Truly, truly awful. This is only some festivals I must stress. It\u2019s also more common at camping festivals than day festivals.   People, when in crowds, can turn to animals. When you think, in a crowd of 100,000 people, it only takes 4 of 5 dick heads who think slinging piss is funny to ruin a lot of people\u2019s day.","4":"Thank you for explaining this to me, Josh! I had no idea! People really do become animalistic in crowds. I understand this now. I'll stick to quiet places like museums though! Have a good day :)","5":"I hope you never experience this at a museum! But also, don\u2019t let this put you off festivals, you\u2019d have bad luck to be hit at a festival but it\u2019s something to know before you go. I go to 3 festivals every summer for 15 years and I\u2019ve been hit once. Also, position yourself in the crowd well can help. The older I\u2019ve gotten, the more you tend to gravitate to a crowd of your age and avoid the douche bags.   Make sure to find places to enjoy live music! Gigs and concerts are great too, especially in small venues where you can find a likeminded crowd!   Good luck and have a great weekend!","6":"Thank you! You too :D"}}
