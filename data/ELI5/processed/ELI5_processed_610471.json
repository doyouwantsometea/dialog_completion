Stainless steel contains a high amount of iron. Isn't that enough to make it attracted to a magnet?","1":"Nickel and chromium are added to make it stainless; when the level is high enough it impedes the magnetic attraction.  Holy heck, I can\u2019t wait to see one of the better explanations :-)","2":"Even our blood is slightly magnetic with such little concentration of iron. So, stainless steel with more than 70% of iron should still be magnetic.","3":"Completely different forces at work in the two systems.  In stainless steel the molecules align differently which impedes the alignment of ferrous particles.  In blood everything can move and particles are free to align when I presence of a magnetic field.","4":"So, the presence of other atoms (chromium, nickel) prevents the ferrous particles (iron atoms) from aligning with the magnetic field. Is that right?","5":"That's how i understand it.  Just watch, I'll be wrong and we both learn something :-)"}}
