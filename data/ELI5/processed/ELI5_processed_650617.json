The universe is not static, and doesn\u2019t have a barrier for said galaxies to rebound off of. It is constantly accelerating expansion. For example if you drop a rock in a lake, the waves ripple outwards, not towards the rock. But if some galaxies, had a lighter mass, they would be moving faster and possibly overtake others as will happen with the Milky Way and andromeda","4":"Sorry, this makes no sense to me.  Objects ARE accelerating away from us.  That is where the theory of dark energy comes from.  We observe ourselves to be the center of the galaxy and the physics would work the exact same way.  In both theories, it can account for things accelerating towards us as objects get knocked around by gravity and other forces.  Are you saying the physics would be different?","5":"As of now, the physics behind the expansion of the universe is purely theoretical, hence the opposing views on the matter. The physics that I have learnt on this topic. According the Hubble\u2019s theory on the matter, there is no center of the universe, rather we are all accelerating away at a speed, and no matter which vantage point in the universe you took,  whether on a planet in another galaxy or earth, you would see the same effect of galaxies both blue and red shifted"}}
