It can also be said that grass is green because of all the battery acid in it.  Doesn't make it true.","2":"That's the wrong analogy. The color of anything is merely a cosmetic while we're discussing efficiency two different working methods. Besides, battery acid doesn't have anything to do with grass. It is an electrolyte that stores power. Grass is merely a lifeform that utilizes photosynthesis to turn light into energy. Completely different things.","3":"You're missing the forest for the trees...  I think intentionally.","4":"Which forest? What trees?

My point in bringing it up in the first place is that you're arguing just to be arguing. ","8":"I have been systematically refuting your points with paragraphs. You reply with illogical one liners.  Now - who is arguing for the sake for arguing?  If your answer is \"You\", then we were never on the same page to begin with and since we're not there yet either, we have wasted a lot of time and gotten absolutely nothing out of this discussion. Have a nice day.","9":"&gt;we have wasted a lot of time and gotten absolutely nothing out of this discussion.
