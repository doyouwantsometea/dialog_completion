Part of that response is to release the hormones adrenaline and cortisol into your blood stream.  Adrenaline activates the body's fight or flight response by redirecting blood from your organs to your muscles so you can take action. The sick feeling or pit in your stomach comes from the blood leaving the digestive system.  Cortisol aids in increasing the blood sugar levels, promotes more energy to the brain, and activates the body's repair mechanisms. It deactivates your appetite, reproductive system, and growth systems.  Both of these responses are great if you are running away from a physical stressor like a large predator but they don't help much when the stressor is abstract like relationship breakups, financial issues, or general life purpose questions. Chronic stress and anxiety causing constant releases of these hormones can have detrimental effects on the body.","2":"Great explanation thanks! I think chronic stress is very dangerous and I feel like I have it. Any quick suggestions?","3":"Physical activity is key. The stress response of fighting or fleeing are both physical actions. Your body rewards physical activity (yay you survived!) with natural painkillers and shuts down the stress response. But many stresses nowadays can't be physically beaten or run away from. You can trick your body by doing physical activity when you feel stressed to get those benefits.  Secondly, take some time to isolate yourself and figure out why you feel stressed. The world constantly tells us we are not attractive enough, successful enough, or having enough fun. Disconnecting ourselves from that pressure and figuring out what truly matters will help you not give a fuck about the the rest.","4":"All great words I appreciate it! And honestly I've been on and off heavy physical activity for the past 5 or 6 years and lately after graduating and starting an office job I let myself go.. the past few weeks I have been walking every day and lifting weights again and it definitely has been helping!","5":"Great work! I've been neglecting exercise after my work got busy for the last few weeks. I ended up feeling terrible from all the stress.  Going out for a run now to get back into the hang of things.","6":"Nice glad I sparked this in you! Lol"}}
