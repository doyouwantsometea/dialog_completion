And what takes place after your wisdom teeth are removed? Do they just come back?","1":"Well mine came in sideways and busted through my gums and made it hard to eat\/talk. So in my case yes, i needed them removed. There are sone people that have them and they come in like normal teeth though.","2":"Do they grow back or some different teeth take their place or nothing grows?","3":"No they dont grow back. You're born with all your teeth in your skull. They just leave holes that close up and you have no teeth in those spots ever again","4":"Woah.. so maybe im getting this wrong. Your wisdom teeth are the 4 wide teeth in the back. And those are getting removed and never coming back. Right?","5":"Correct. And correct.","6":"... dang. I actually use those teeth for eating. So i have to only use my front teeth?","7":".....no. The wisdom teeth are in the very back and they usually dont come in til your 20s or so, sometimes not at all and sometimes earlier. But they are not like your other teeth they are usually too far back to be practical and usually grow in out of alignment to your other teeth.","8":"Oh ok thats all i want to hear. Thank you!"}}
