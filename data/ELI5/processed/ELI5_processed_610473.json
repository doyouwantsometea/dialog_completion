You're free to note vote for them if you feel they don't represent you, but being \"representative of the people\" isn't a requirement.","2":"Both candidates are over 70 y.o. at the moment. People have no choice but to vote for an elderly.","3":"That's not true. People are free to not vote for any candidate if they don't like any of them, they're free to support and vote for a third party or independent candidate, and they're free to vote for a write-in.","4":"Bullshit, even if you write in your vote, there is only 2 options that are really possible in the US voting system.","5":"If you're staring at a ballot with two names, and you write in a third, that's...three.  If you mean an \\*effective\\* vote, sure, but the person I was replying to was saying you had no choice. You have several choices. Many of them (potentially all of them, depending on your point of view) may be terrible. And that'll probably be true whether the candidate is 30, 50, 70, or 150."}}
