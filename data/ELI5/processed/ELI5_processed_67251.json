How do you know which caste you are in? How does it effect everyday life?","1":"Yup. For example my ancestors used to be priests hundreds of years ago and I have one of the variation of the last name for a brahaman cast. It's a very common name so most of the people can recognise it easily enough.","2":"What caste is Patel?","3":"I assume they are part of the Vaishya cast. But again not 100% sure. I don't really care about the last name or cast. I just know a few from what I have seen or heard around me.","4":"Just asking because I\u2019ve known multiple Patel doctors.  Probably just coincidence or common like the name Smith.","5":"Yeah it's very common. Perfect comparison with Smith."}}
