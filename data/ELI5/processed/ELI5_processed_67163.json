Some symptoms of depression, for example, can manifest as increased sleep, decreased levels of energy and lack of focus.","2":"It could be, probably not but like the symptoms that you are saying I've been having for a month now.","3":"It's good that you're aware of it, but keep in mind that proper diagnosis can only come for a licensed professional. If this has been happening, it might be a good idea to get a professional opinion. I meant more to say that it's sometimes difficult to differentiate between illnesses of the body and illnesses of the mind, specially around things like sleep, which are connected to both. It could also be a part physical, part psychological.","4":"Yea, I've never been to a psychologist or therapist before tho.","5":"I can imagine it can be a little scary, but therapists are a lot like ears for hire, just go in, not even thinking about depression or issues, talk a little bit and see how you feel, you can bring out the more complex stuff whenever you feel comfortable.  There are also online resources like Blah Therapy, NYC Well, among others. Just make sure you're actually speaking to a professional and not just a helpful stranger."}}
