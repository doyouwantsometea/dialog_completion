Its impossible to tell if an event was random or just unpredictable, so I do not think there is much distinction. If its impossible to tell whether a spin left electron will be spin up or spin down, how would it matter if its \"truly\" random or not, as long as it is indeed \"truly\" unpredictable.","2":"But isn't it just the thing? That quantum physics proved true randomness, something beyond just unpredictable?","3":"&gt;That quantum physics proved true randomness, something beyond just unpredictable?  Not quite. Which QM model are you referring to?","4":"I'll be honest, I don't understand this topic as much as I'd like to.","5":"Well, typically when scientists say random, they just mean unpredictable."}}
