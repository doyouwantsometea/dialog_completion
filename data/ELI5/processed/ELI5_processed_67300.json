If you are being targeted specifically, you'd likely be unable to do anything short of having 2 factor on every account you own. So again, for the vast majority of people, they are not \"simple\" questions.","2":"get a paid account on publicdata.com.  there you can easily pull up a lot of stuff reddit would largely have you believe you need top secret security clearance to find out like who a vehicle is registered to based on license plate, or reverse find out what's registered to you if you have the name to look up","3":"But again, you'd have to be specifically targeted, which is a lot of work vs large attacks targeting a ton of people.   And if you are being targeted, there is little you will be able to do.","4":"That's really all beside the point of why I asked the question though.  \"Hope know one ever takes an interest in you b\/c you're fucked after a days effort on their part\" isn't a good security model, in my opinion.","5":"That's the best security model because it works for 99.99% of people. Which is why the system is as it is.   The system works for most of the people, most of the time and is easy to use and implement."}}
