Their basically viruses that target specific bacteria, like e coli or strep throat. They can't work on anything else, which is why bacteriophages are so amazing. I can't really explain simply why their so awesome, but this video from Kurzgesagt does a really good job at it: https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=YI3tsmFsrOg","2":"That was a super informative video! I learned a lot, but I have a few questions. Where could we get bacteriophages? I know they are everywhere but how do we get solely bacteriophages? Why aren\u2019t we investing more time and resources into bacteriophages?","3":"I assume they get a single bacteriophage from dirt or something and cultivate it with petri dishes. And I have no idea why it isn't being researched in the US, but I think big pharma may have something to do about it.","4":"You hit the nail on the head there friend. If big pharma can\u2019t profit off it they aren\u2019t interested","5":"We'll just have to wait for the next Super-bug huh?"}}
