It is not a requirement.  &gt; In the UK the execs would be on at least 4 months.  Or what?  The beefeaters arrest them and handcuff them to their desks?","2":"If necessary but we are all far too conformist to resort to that. What happens in many cases is:  A) employee works for the full notice period often involving a handover or transition plan  B) employee works part of their notice by using holiday \/ coming to a personal agreement with the employer   C) employee is placed on \u201cgarden leave\u201d and is paid to sit at home during their notice period legally unable to start work for the new employer","3":"&gt; C) employee is placed on \u201cgarden leave\u201d and is paid to sit at home during their notice period legally unable to start work for the new employer  For an employee who would be in a position to lure clients away from the old employer, there might be something like this.  But usually you would get paid out upfront, rather than staying on payroll for the period.  I don't see how paying someone to not works provides security for the employer, other then the fore-mentioned not luring clients away.  Kind of nice for the employee, though.","4":"It\u2019s because you can plan a transition without someone just leaving on Friday","5":"If the 'transition' is for them to not show up and still get paid, which is two thirds of your examples, that is not much of a plan."}}
