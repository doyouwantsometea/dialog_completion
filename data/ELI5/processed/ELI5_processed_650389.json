I know they \"don't share\", but is that a crack at aristocrats or more of a Buddhist-style respectful reference to the nobility?","1":"Ever is a very strange word to use, all bulk materials will eventually decay into iron if you want to wait several million-million-million times longer than the universe is currently old, and even longer than that even protons and other subatomic particles will eventually decay. If you wait long enough, [entropy will always win](https:\/\/np.reddit.com\/r\/changemyview\/comments\/1dn43v\/i_remain_unconvinced_that_my_death_has_a_fixed\/c9s173k\/).","2":"So will there ever be a point in the universe's history where everything is iron, then? If not, what else will still exist?","3":"Check out that link for an amusing walk down toward the heat death of the universe. Dead cores of dwarf starts too light to be neutron stars and any large clumps of rock like planets will decay to iron stars, by this time neutron stars and black holes will pretty much be it other than that. Black holes will outlast everything else by a long margin.","4":"So the whole world will be iron? Bismarck would be proud (half-proud; no blood)   I've read (originally from Alexander von Humboldt via Edgar Allan Poe's \"Eureka\") that black holes are really just forming stars that haven't started to emit light yet (or maybe they just admit extremely dim light which is how the space agency took a picture of one the other day?)  \"Non-luminous stars\"  How does that fit in?","5":"No idea where that idea came from but it\u2019s most likely completely false. Black holes are a relatively well established concept with a lot of good theory and math. The recent image was not of the black hole itself, since you literally cannot see any light emitted from it or bounced off it, rather the swirling disk around it, only 2-3 times its radius away.","6":"\"No idea where that idea came from but it\u2019s most likely completely false. Black holes are a relatively well established concept with a lot of good theory and math.

There really isn\u2019t any such thing as a star that hasn\u2019t started to emit light (unless you count a failed star that has something really big crash into it)\"  --^so is that what a black hole actually is? Just a very dense cloud of dust that swallows nearby things up occasionally?"}}
