No shit they\u2019re going to advocate for people with larger vocabularies. You should try to be more aware of biases when looking for information.  Second, correlation does not equal causation. There is no proof that knowing more words makes you smarter. There are an almost infinite amount of other factors in life that could potentially affect intelligence and vocabulary with the same trend.  Third, none of that matters because this is a flawed correlation. Of course a bigger vocabulary is a good predictor of a high IQ score - they admit in that article that reading is *part of the IQ test!*  That\u2019s like saying you tested people\u2019s intelligence by making them drink a bunch of water and then claiming that there\u2019s \u201can undeniable link\u201d between how smart you are and how much water you can drink.","2":"Where in the article it claims that reading is part of the IQ test? anyway take a look here https:\/\/www.researchgate.net\/publication\/7960682_Relationship_between_Intelligence_and_Vocabulary","3":"Right here: \u201cVocabulary testing is a standard part of most IQ tests\u201d  Also, the links you have provided are literally just the top two results when you look up \u201cvocabulary related to intelligence\u201d.  Maybe be a bit more diligent with your research before turning to Reddit to solve all your problems.","4":"Vocabulary testing isn't really reading but it's true that vocabulary testing is a part of most IQ tests.  I didn't google \"vocabulary related to intelligence\", not sure why you are trying to attack me passively, do you have any links that proves otherwise?.   These are the links I found and I'm not necessarily supporting them I'm just looking for the experts out here to either prove them wrong or correct.  Again not sure why you are trying to attack my efforts, If you take a look at the post title it says \" How is vocabulary related to IQ\" not \"Why\" which means that I'm not claiming that there's a relation.  and stop being aggressive please we are not in war lol","5":"I\u2019m not trying to be aggressive or attack you. I\u2019m sorry if it\u2019s coming across that way.  You\u2019re right. I was using vocabulary and reading as synonyms when they are not, but that doesn\u2019t change my point.  I know you didn\u2019t google the exact phrase I did, but my point is that if those links are showing up at the very top of the search feed, then it seems to me you are depending on Reddit rather than spending more time looking things up. That doesn\u2019t make you a bad person. I\u2019m simply suggesting that Reddit should maybe be a secondary tool after you\u2019ve done more work to find the answers yourself. Anyone can claim to be an expert on here and type up some long, cleverly worded block of text to make you believe whatever they say.  Your question specifically was \u201cHow is vocabulary related to IQ\u201d.  The answer is  -vocabulary is part of the IQ test-  Nothing more, nothing less.  They are related in the same way that being able to eat hot dogs is related to a hot dog eating competition.","6":"Appreciate you apologizing, that's some mature stuff here."}}
