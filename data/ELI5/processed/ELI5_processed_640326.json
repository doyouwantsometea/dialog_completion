If we send a shuttle into space and it sends images back, it is always dark. But the sun is able to provide daylight to Earth. So where is that sunlight going in space?","1":"\"light\" is just how your eyes interpret certain wavelengths of the EM spectrum. If you were floating an inch to the left of the moon and looked at the sun, you would see the sun as light.  The room you are in right now is full of other wavelengths of EM that your eyes can't see. Eg. Radio waves. You'd need a radio to \"see\" them.","2":"Are there radio waves in space?","3":"Yes, lots. We use radio telescopes to \"see\" them.  https:\/\/en.m.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Radio_telescope","4":"Awesome. Isnt space cool!?","5":"Space is awesome.
