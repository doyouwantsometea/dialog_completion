Doesn't that contradict the very definition of \"infinite\"?","1":"Sure they're both infinite but one is twice as big. ","2":"&gt;twice as *big.*  You're already making the mistake of talking about size.  Size is a comparison. You can't compare infinity precisely because it is infinite.","3":"You can and mathematicians do. ","4":"You can't. They don't. Tell me, what is Infinity - Infinity?","5":"Why would you ask this question if mathematicians don't consider some infinities larger than others?  This is rhetorical as you clearly don't want an answer. ","6":"XD I'm asking you so you realise there's no amswer"}}
