If you're using x86 then your computer is likely several years old and unupgraded.","2":"I'm sorry Jorsh, but I figured x86 was a better comparative due to smartphones only recently adopting 64 based ARM processor","3":"Ahh, good point. The only real difference between 32- and 64-bit ARM is just resource support, though. Otherwise they work quite differently from x86 and x64","4":"I think that's what I'm trying to get at here. As convoluted as my explanation is.  &amp;#x200B;  I know the architecture is vastly different, but what is it unique about the ARM processor that allows it to be cooled more efficiently than the x86-x64 processors.  &amp;#x200B;  Obivously these processors are meant to do more at once, but taking a SnapDragon S3 Dual Core@1.7GHz, and an Intel i3-5005u dual core@2GHz, what makes the cooling efficiency different?  &amp;#x200B;  Is it power usage? Is it calculation method? Or is it simply because there's just no reason to develop a desktop image that throttles this processor without the need for a more extensive passive cooling\/active cooling system.","5":"Smartphone apps simply use less system resources than their desktop counterparts and thus place less strain on the CPU, GPU, and RAM.  Also, there are very few desktop images for ARM, with the exception of ChromeOS and Raspbian (plus a few forks\/builds of other Linux distros).  (Note that this isn't a full explanation, but a partial one. There are certainly other factors)"}}
