I mean you were talking about the \"no true Scotsman\" fallacy, which is a logical fallacy in debate. The term doesn't really apply to someone who isn't engaged in a debate or is not debating in good faith. It's a fallacy because it doesn't follow logically.  If someone just wants to assert their opinion without any consideration for logic then they are free to do so (and they would be wrong).","2":"But who actually makes this fallacy? People talk about it as if it was a thing that people actually do, but I'm yet to see any concrete example of it.  In order to be a fallacy, the person would have to believe they are making a sound argument, when in reality they aren't. I don't think anyone is stupid enough to actually fall victim to the \"no true Scotsman\" fallacy. It's only ever arguments made in bad faith, or people just stating an opinion.","3":"It happens all the time. Somebody else in the thread mentioned Republicans. The term\u201cNever-Trumper\u201d is a real life example of this happening.","4":"But that wasn't an example of the fallacy. The person who thinks that Republicans who support gun control are not true Republicans is not using any illogical reasoning. They are expressing their view of what a Republican should be.  It seems like you are just confirming what I'm thinking, which is that the fallacy basically never actually happens.","5":"You just ignored my example of \u201cnever trumper\u201d","6":"What is the argument being made exactly? All I know is that those are Republicans who don't support Trump."}}
