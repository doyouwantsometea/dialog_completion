The problem is as was stated, there is fear that only the rich will great superior humans, or the militaries will try to create super soldiers.  I'm sure a great many would love if we could detect a bad gene in an embryo and edit it if it's one that would tend to have terrible repercussions of serious disease, but what about an embryo that is perfectly viable with no foreseen health issues? Do you risk possibly killing the embryo trying to edit it? Do you allow \"super babies\" since it'd probably only be for those that can afford it?  This is on an entirely different level of ethical dilemma than the other examples you gave. Your examples are making bad situations better. The one we are talking about is possibly making good situations worse OR better only to the rich.","2":"Then why not limit the research to curing bad genes in embryo? Like fixing half the world's medical problems before they even begin?","3":"Because there's the whole \"playing God\" thing, or the idea of at what point someone stops being \"Human\" if they are edited in anyway.  Listen, I'd love to have wings and a tail like a dragon, but people out there have issues with editing people for any reason.","4":"What I'm saying is cure those diseases that can be cured through genetic engineering, and leave it at that.  Limit research to that entirely. No super humans or flying dog cats. Just fixing genetic disorders","5":"Which is fine, but there's that whole \"slippery slope\" issue. Who gets to decide when enough is enough? If they can cure cancer or Downs or whatever, then why not instead of taking away the bad, they use it toward more good? Maybe edit genes to be more mentally or physically capable? (obviously being born with \"good genes\" doesn't make you fit, since you can still end up a dumb fat slob)"}}
