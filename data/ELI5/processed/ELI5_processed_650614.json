How does the world keep turning, so to speak, if work is abolished?","1":"A massive surplus has been created from the ever increasing efficiencies of the world. This surplus has ended up mostly in the hands of .5%  of the population. This means that the people that did the work did not get paid properly for their work. The money should therefor be redistributed in the form of universal basic income for all people. We all built the world together, so no, a tiny minority should not be able to amass the wealth from it.","2":"And what happens once all of the ill-gotten gains are redistributed?","3":"Oh gosh. Who could predict? Not my task to decide what happens when the wealthy pay for their crimes, nor is it even an important question. It\u2019s stolen money.","4":"Isn't that outcome sort of important to consider? Does the movement have a solution to that? You'd think getting cut off from free money would sort of change the dynamic.","5":"it\u2019s not a movement\u2026just literally enforcing the broken laws \ud83e\udd72"}}
