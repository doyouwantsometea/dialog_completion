I asked cause I clearly don\u2019t understand the relevance.","3":"Ah. I've had the (mis?)fortune of completely avoiding statistics and spreadsheet math. Given my field, I've been bombarded with squares and square roots for most of my life, so I was just a little bit baffled that you hadn't had a similar experience.","4":"Ya those of us that have the luxury of spreadsheets often learn a formula in Excel and never really know why each piece is relevant. I'm trying to change that for myself so I can make Excel a more useful tool for me.","5":"Interesting! May I ask what you actually do with those spreadsheets? Do you do data processing?","6":"Forecasting\/demand planning, inventory management. There\u2019s software that does it all for you but I feel like I could be a better forecaster if I didn\u2019t rely on the software as much. Most forecasters I know just ensure the data in their system is loaded accurately and press play and barely, if ever, question it."}}
