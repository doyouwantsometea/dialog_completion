Because believe it or not, that *is* allowed. Women should not be condemned to enjoy sex just for procreation. We moved past that. Decades ago. Abortion is a relatively simple solution to allowing women to have sexual freedom and enjoyment. Arguing against access to abortion is often seen as arguing against women to have freedom over their sexuality and bodies. Regardless of the percentage.","2":"As a method of birth control wouldn\u2019t a different method be safer and less invasive? I mean whatever, if you want a vacuum in your vagina, more power to you","3":"There is no birth control that works 100% of the time. You can stack condoms and the pill and do everything correctly and still get pregnant. What's your suggestion then? Just not have sex, right?","4":"I never said that. Have all the sex you want. If you get pregnant have an abortion. Have 15 abortions. I don\u2019t really give a flying fuck. I just wondered why women get so Passionate about that topic","5":"Looks like you're really the only one getting passionate about anything on this thread man."}}
