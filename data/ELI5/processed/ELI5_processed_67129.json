Also, how would this affect humans if they were to travel there?","1":"Sit in a chair. Now stand up quickly. Congrats, you just experienced approximately 2G.    Constant, it would be bad for your bones and joints and put strain on your heart but probably no worse than being very obese and unfit.","2":"Any insight as to the effects if someone were born on Kepler 442b and experienced the 30% more gravity as a constant from birth? Could humans adapt to it or would it need to be an adaptation that takes place over generations similar to evolution?","3":"You'd get 'adapt' to it in that you'd never know anything different and probably build up more muscle due to the constant additional exercise etc. but it would still be putting more strain on your body than it is currently designed for so you'd need evolution to properly adapt to it.","4":"So in a sense you\u2019re saying that if humans were to colonize Kepler 442b, future humans born and raised on it might have denser bones, and more muscle mass to offset joint problems. Ha! Imagine Kepler-ites(?) visiting earth and being able to jump and run faster than \u201cearthlings\u201d","5":"&gt; you\u2019re saying that if humans were to colonize Kepler 442b, future humans born and raised on it might have denser bones, and more muscle mass to offset joint problems.  Seems likely, yes."}}
