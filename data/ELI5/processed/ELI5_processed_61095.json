If you're looking at a mirror at something 1 meter behind you, it's the same thing as if you were looking at a window at something 1 meter behind the window.","2":"That\u2019s really screwing with my head. How can it possibly be any further away than the plane of the mirror?","3":"Because the mirror (almost) perfectly reflects light that hits it.  Every ray of light that hits the mirror is reflected, as if it emanated from its parallel location in the virtual image. See [this diagram](https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/d\/d1\/Mirror_virtual_image.png) for example. The light coming from the actual lightbulb bounces of the mirror and reaches your eye in the exact same angle as if the mirror was a window, and the lightbulb was on the position of the virtual lightbulb. From your eyes' perspective, they are exactly the same, and there is no way to tell you're looking at a mirror.","4":"I get that in terms of how an image is made, and I\u2019m fine with that side of it, but how can that image be out of focus? The light doesn\u2019t travel 10m *into* the mirror before it reflects back out right?","5":"What do you mean? If you're looking at an object 10m away from the mirror, then yes, light does travel 10m until it hits the mirror. Not \"into the mirror\", but to it. So what's the difference? The distance is still the same.","6":"Sorry, might not have worded that right. But ignore the point I was trying to make there, it was based on a flawed logic.  I\u2019m still really struggling to understand how if I\u2019ve got a mirror at 1m from my face, why does it matter how far an object has reflected before it hits the mirror. The focusing issue is in my eyes, not in the light hitting them. That means the light is in focus until I observe it, right? And regardless of where it *appears* to be in the mirror, the light only reflects 1m from the surface of the mirror before it hits my eye, so why isn\u2019t the entire image at a uniform focal length?","7":"&gt; why does it matter how far an object has reflected before it hits the mirror  Because it changes how much the light dissipates from the object until it hits your eyes.   The pupil isn't a singular point, it's about 2 to 4 mm wide. Light emanating from a single point on the object doesn't enter the eye through a single point, it emanates at different directions therefore enter the eye through the entire pupil - one ray of light enters through the top, another through the bottom, another through the middle, etc.  The lens in our eye focuses the light so that all the light emanating from the same point in the object will also reach the same point on the retina. At different distances, the light from the object dissipates differently, and the lens has to bend differently in order to correctly focus the light (that's why we can't focus on far objects and near objects at the same time)."}}
