Generally, no. If you pay the full balance at the end of the month there is no interest applied. If your card charges an annual fee, you still have to pay that.  2. If your card has no fees and you spend no money you don't pay anything.  3. If you make some kind of deal to make interest free payments on a purchase that's between you and the seller. Your card company doesn't care what deals you make with other people, the money you owe *them* gets charged interest.","2":"Thanks!  So for 3. it\u2019s necessary for the bank to have interest free payment deals so I don\u2019t get charged interests? ","3":"For 3 Im not really sure what you're asking.  Your credit card charges interest on any balance you carry over on the card into the next month. Any other loan or payment plan has nothing to do with your credit card.","4":"Yeah, i think i phrased it weirdly  Basically if i buy say a computer in a monthly payment and it deducts $100 every month from my card, even if i pay the $100 monthly the card generates interest  (Sorry if it\u2019s still weird\/hard to understand, english is not my first language) ","5":"Oh ok.  As far as your card company is concerned that $100 a month being deducted is an individual payment every time. So long as you pay it off every month there's never any interest applied by the card company.","6":"Thank you! I was worried there where hidden fees or something"}}
