And yeah, they invested a lot of money\/effort into studying traffic, applying what they learned, and educating the public so it would work out.   There's a lot wrong in the city &amp; state, but they got some me traffic stuff done well, and parks &amp; rec. Did some awesome things there too","2":"It is such an interesting concept. Does it just benefit the general flow of traffic on highways? Or does it actually prevent accidents and other benefits?","3":"I don't recall well enough anymore, but I think all those pieces together would have lowered both severity and frequency of accidents. There was one main highway for north\/south cross-town traffic whick would still get backed up, but the rest of the highway grid &amp; loops were good.  I drove about 40-60 minutes a day on the highway on average while there and recall passing more homicides than car crashes. I drove around or through one of the two quite rough areas of the city though - it's not like the whole city is like that... and there was a 3-way gang war going on at the time which I'm sure didn't help. The city has a \"Shot Spotter\" system which triangulates the position of gunfire. You can find the maps online. It shows very clearly where the roughest parts of town are. The military actually uses that tech too in war zones and defensive perimeters. Neat bit of science there.","4":"TIL man. I\u2019m not American and even though I know of the gun violence and general violence there, this type of personal experience always sends shivers. Both scary but too interesting to stop reading about it.","5":"It's unfortunate TBH that guns get such a bad rap. The failing is at a cultural\/societal level, not with a tool some humans choose to misuse. I know as many people who safely use them to feed their families and\/or for recreation as I know people who wouldn't dream of touching one and would gladly ban them for everyone because their only perspective on it is the one given to them by the news &amp; politicians. I have a 100% success rate so far of people who were anti-gun but willing to broaden their horizons and actually go shooting ending up with a drastically changed opinion by the end of the day.   It's a tool - you shouldn't use it if you don't know how to do so safely It's deadly - doesn't belong in the hands of a child without appropriate context, supervision, training, etc.  It's people that are the problem... Take away guns, they still use knives, vehicles, fire, pipes, rocks, bombs, etc. To do the same things. And regarding the violence, I'm in favor of guns sticking rather than people starting to get more creative with how they try to harm masses."}}
