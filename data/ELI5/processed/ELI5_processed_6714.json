So why did you ask the question at all? Either you're a troll or need to accept the answers you get or look iy up yourself and shut up","2":"u\/already-taken-wtf is literally the only one who has perhaps provided something meaningful to look into. I suggest you work on your issues mate, there's a discussion going on which has disagreements. Seems like you're too into yourself to realise that.","3":"There's no disagreements. It's you asking the same question 15 times expecting a different answer. Just because im telling you how it is and how you're acting doesn't mean i have issues.","4":"Good luck with your issues (if any), hope you find some solutions (if required). Have a nice day \u262e\ufe0f","5":"Good luck getting the answer you're looking for by asking the same question 15 times.","6":"Cheers. Have a good day:)"}}
