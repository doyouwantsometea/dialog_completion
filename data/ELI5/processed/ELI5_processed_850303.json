The judge applied the state sentencing guidelines for those crimes and arrived at 23 years.","2":"&gt;A jury of his peers found that the evidence presented against him established beyond a shadow of a doubt.  First, beyond shadow of a doubt is not a legal standard.  Second - I'm asking what the evidence was.","3":"First of all, would it make you happier if I said \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt,\u201d since you\u2019re very hung up on the semantics?","4":"Yes, actually it would. We're talking about someone being deprived of their freedom for 23 years. If there's a place for correctness, it is this one.  Address the second point please.","5":"I have no information besides what you have as regards the second point.","6":"In other words, Weinstein was convicted based on a rumour.","7":"I have no idea if this is the case. Because I do not have information on something does not mean that it was done with ill intent. I also don\u2019t know how string theory was developed, but I don\u2019t think it was done illicitly just because I don\u2019t know about it."}}
