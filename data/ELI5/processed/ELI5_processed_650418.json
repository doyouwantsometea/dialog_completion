What are the odds that you do not get the 1\/100","1":"If the odds are 1 in 100 that it happens, that means the odds are 99\/100 that it doesn't happen. So, the probability of not happening is 0.99.  If you wanted to know the probability of it not happening twice in a row you would multiple 0.99 x 0.99 which equals 0.9801 or 98.01%  To calculate the odds of it not happening 100 times in a row you multiple 0.99 times itself 100 times which is also written as 0.99^100. The answer is 0.366 or 36.6%","2":"Ok, thank you very much","3":"You might just be the most dedicated OP I've ever seen in regards to thanking people who answered your question.","4":"Hahahah, well I feel like they took the time to answer the question so I should take the time to thank them for it","5":"If only every OP had the same idea.","6":"Oh well, I guess some people might not have the time"}}
