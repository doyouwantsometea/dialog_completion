Feed it a \"6\" and it will add the next two numbers. Feed it an \"8\" and it will store a number into memory. How exactly the transistors are arranged to do so is not even remotely ELI5, and the people who know it are paid millions for their expertise. If you want to see what it looks like inside a CPU you can watch [this video](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=Fxv3JoS1uY8).  The best I can do for ELI5: using transistors you can build logic gates. Using logic gates you can build logical functions. Transistors can also control which logic gates get activated based on a given input. You change which transistors are activated by sending signals to certain CPU pins in a certain order. The CPU is designed such that it would automatically read instructions from certain pins when powered on (which is where the BIOs\/boot process comes in). [Transistors to gates](https:\/\/www.cs.bu.edu\/~best\/courses\/modules\/Transistors2Gates\/).  If you have the basic building blocks to form transistors and\/or logic gates, you can build a fully functional computer, which is how people have simulated computers inside other software such as Minecraft or Factorio.","2":"When you hear \"x input is converted to y output\", how is it converted","3":"A function. If the function is y=x\\*2, then inputting 4 will result in 8.  Programs are kinds of functions that (usually) take input, process it, and provide some kind of output. While computers only work with numbers, it's up to the program to interpret what that number means. They aren't always literally numbers that need to be displayed as text on a monitor.","4":"How does the computer take 8 and turn it into pixels","5":"That process has already been explained to you in [another comment](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/explainlikeimfive\/comments\/gilmgj\/eli5_how_does_a_computer_learn_those_first_few\/fqgpkp3\/).  You seem to be under the assumption that every result calculated by the CPU is literally turned into pixels. That's clearly not the case, computers calculate all sorts of things for different purposes. The software needs to determine what to do with the result. In the case that the result needs to be displayed on screen, the software will tell the monitor how to do so (via the graphics processor)."}}
