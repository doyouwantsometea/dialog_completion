Square roots are useful in solving many equations, and squares (the opposite of a square root) occur quite often in physics and the sciences.","2":"I do a lot of math (sort of), but it\u2019s excel equations and I\u2019ve never bothered to understand why I would divide a number by the square root to get a statistical analysis.  So ya, I\u2019ve always let the computer think for me.  Thanks","3":"I'm not insulting you; squares and square roots and such aren't useful for everyone.","4":"I\u2019m not offended. I asked cause I clearly don\u2019t understand the relevance.","5":"Ah. I've had the (mis?)fortune of completely avoiding statistics and spreadsheet math. Given my field, I've been bombarded with squares and square roots for most of my life, so I was just a little bit baffled that you hadn't had a similar experience.","6":"Ya those of us that have the luxury of spreadsheets often learn a formula in Excel and never really know why each piece is relevant. I'm trying to change that for myself so I can make Excel a more useful tool for me.","7":"Interesting! May I ask what you actually do with those spreadsheets? Do you do data processing?","8":"Forecasting\/demand planning, inventory management. There\u2019s software that does it all for you but I feel like I could be a better forecaster if I didn\u2019t rely on the software as much. Most forecasters I know just ensure the data in their system is loaded accurately and press play and barely, if ever, question it."}}
