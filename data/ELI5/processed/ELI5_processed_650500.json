Firstly its an issue of neatness and\/or professionalism. Men who wear their hair long tend to be seen as unkept. This attitude is relaxing a bit in the west, but not so much in Asia.     Secondly, its an issue of uniformity. Corporate culture is not conducive to displays of individualism. They can be distractions, and they take time from management to judge whether or not they are appropriate for a given job or situation. It's much simpler if everyone has short hair and wears dark coloured suits with matching ties.","2":"But my point is long hair isn't always unkempt right? So why does this notion exist","3":"Because it's more likely to be unkept. Not that people with long hair are sloppier or lazier, but long hair is simply more maintenance. It takes more time to brush and style it. And it has a wider breadth of styles, which would have to be quantified and rated for appropriateness, and then approved or disapproved by some level of management. It takes much less energy to just mandate short hair actoss the board.","4":"Does this mean well groomed long hair is always acceptable?","5":"No."}}
