As you use your phone, it heats up, and when it hits a predetermined point, it artificially limits your performance until the temperature drops back below the point - rinse and repeat.  Of course, PUBG for your phone is not the same game as PUBG on your PC, and so will be much less intensive and not cause your phone to heat up like your PC does.","2":"For sure, and I pondered that, but even current windows machines that do the same, there is still the need for an active cooling system.  Or on the alternative, what prevents a pc using x86 based processors from using a method similar to bypass the need for an active cooling system?","3":"For what it's worth, the level of cooling will affect how much your PC or phone is able to push itself.  If you have a full water cooling loop in your PC, your PC's temperature will stay below the point that it starts to throttle its own performance, letting you push it harder for longer.  If you only have a box cooler, your PC will throttle more since the ability to dissipate heat is much worse than a full water cooling loop.  There are PCs that are only passively cooled (no fans), and those are only good as very light clients, since anything intensive would push the PC beyond it's throttling point. And since you're relying on the surrounding air to dissipate the heat, it's going to take much longer for the temperature to drop.","4":"Right, and the better passive cooled ones use a decent amount of heatsink and heatpipe dispersion, but you wouldn't see that in a smart phone device. It seems to dissipate heat using the body of the rest of the device and it's components   &amp;#x200B;  I guess a better way to phrase the question is, what prevents an ARM processor from heating as quickly as a x86?   &amp;#x200B;  an x86 without active cooling (or elaborate passive cooling as the above) would typically shut itself off before you would be able to load windows or an xshell client, however a smart phone doesn't get hot (to the human touch) without long use of the device, despite all the back-end communication and calculations going on","5":"Yeah, using the phone body as basically a radiator is necessary since you can't put big radiators where people's hands will be.  &gt;I guess a better way to phrase the question is, what prevents an ARM processor from heating as quickly as a x86?   Power. ARM and x86 are very different architectures and come with varying instruction sets. This means certain chips may be able to do things other chips can't. You'll find that any ARM Windows machine isn't long lived (RIP Surface RT) since there isn't too much processing power to throw around.  Also, Android is a very light process that doesn't need much power. ARM is great for these. There have been x86 phones, but those have their own software limitations (e.g. some apps will not launch with x86).  "}}
