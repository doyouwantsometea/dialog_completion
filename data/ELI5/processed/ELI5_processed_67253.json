We want the fluid to have certain properties when it comes out of the boiler (we don't actually want steam) and when we have a high boiling point, we can put in more energy.  Also, water can store a lot of energy before it actually changes temperature, way more than acetone.    The turbine speed is related to how much fluid you pump through it, not the temperature although the fluid type can effect that.  The thing that varies with the temperature is the torque, how hard the turbine can try to turn stuff.","2":"Right, and the energy is generated by the turbine spinning, so wouldn't the liquid phase boiling at a lower temperature but generating the same pressure generate the same energy output?","3":"To start with, I made a mistake in my previous comment.  The turbine speed and torque is going to be based on super complicated fluid mechanics stuff that I don't know to well.    No, it won't have the same energy output.  Lets say that substance 1 has a boiling point of 50 degrees Celsius and substance 2 has a boiling point of 100 degrees Celsius.  Lets also say that they require the same amount of energy to heat up 1 degree Celsius (1 kj).  Substance 1 absorbs 50 kj of energy but substance 2 absorbs 100 kj.  This means that substance 2 can have more energy extracted by the turbine.    The pressure doesn't actually have much to do with it, it's actually held constant during the boiling process and a pump is used to get the liquid to the right pressure.","4":"Right, this explanation is all compatible with thermodynamics (more energy in=more energy out), but why? Why doesn't a gas molecule at the same pressure affecting the same surface area and moving at the same speed, just at a different temperature, not move the turbine the same amount? The turbine extracts energy by spinning. It doesn't convert heat energy at all, it converts the kinetic energy of the paddles spinning to electricity, and that kinetic energy is generated by pressure.","5":"You know, I almost included this in the last post but I decided not to include it to keep it simple.  The turbine is designed to bring the gas to supersonic speeds.  If we look at the conservation of energy, the gas needs to cool down to actually do this.  So a gas that's hotter can go faster in the turbine and faster velocities allow for more power to be generated."}}
