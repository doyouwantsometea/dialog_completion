I know they \"don't share\", but is that a crack at aristocrats or more of a Buddhist-style respectful reference to the nobility?","1":"We can\u2019t economically create gold neither does gold play into market value anymore, we went over that. Market value is what people are willing to pay for things, and they aren\u2019t willing to pay for fruits they aren\u2019t comfortable with. Thats why every supermarket has the same 5 or so kinds of apple regardless of where they are or the thousands of other kinds out there.  Not dinosaurs basically, anything past the last major extinction event and thats a super scary thing to need to clarify.  And they reference their religion but didn\u2019t base their math off it. You can redo their math and a chunk of their experiments yourself (like the gold foil experiment. I\u2019ve done it, it works. So does relativity (hence gps) and pauli\u2019s exclusion principle (you just need a good lamp and a prism).  Its really scary that you consider their religion as part of their work without actually looking at or understanding their work.","2":"Everything you just was just garbled repeating of some kool-aid you've been drinking from a dying and pathetic offshoot of civilization   I'm going to stop talking to you, except for maybe  your two other posts, I hope that eventually on a biological level you see the changes in the world and how far into the wrong camp you are and literally almost as a biological instinct see the more enlightened way of the side of von Braun and Heisenberg and Karl Reinmuth and Humboldt and all those guys","3":"You can do the math yourself, you do the research yourself, the raw data is all there. and given our discussion on researchers I think you have grossly misunderstood at least heisenbergs work.   I don't know where you are getting your information from but I highly recommend you just go to a library and get some peer reviewed sources okay? you can recreate a lot of the older experiments yourself.  On an ecological scale its difficult for you to get first hand data but maybe go ask a farmer? talk abotu different strands of corn and why which is grown in which quantities? talk to a grocery store about what they buy and why.  Everything I know is tangible and verifiable, and its stuff I can check the math on because I have that expertise. I honestly don't believe that is true of anyone who unironically uses the phrase \"koolaid\" to describe belief systems.","4":"\"Check the math\"   Heisenberg apparently hated when people said stuff like that  It all comes down to rationalism (literally just Spinoza) vs. empiricism (the rest of the Enlightenment) and I choose empiricism","5":"I realise that, thats why I'm telling you to do it yourself.  Its not a particularly rational approach to take for atomic theory, but there are good tangible ways to test it.  Heisenberg was found in a cave with holding a lump of cadmium next to an open nuclear reactor. People told him to check the math because he math was wrong. Oppenheimer showed that very very conclusively.","6":"Oppenheimer who (in addition to being hated by, among many others, Linus Pauling whose wife he unsuccessfully tried to bang), got his security clearance revoked for probably trying to sell out the Soviets, which had no hindrance at all in the progression\/advancement of nuclear weapons? No Oppenheimer and others like Einstein on the Manhattan Project were gross people who didn't know what they were doing but always tried to claim credit (true visionaries like Fermi only sided with them because the Nazis probably would have persecuted his wife, who like his coworkers, was Jewish)   No, many people think either the Nazis towards the end detonated a smaller atomic bomb which is A.) Why the Americans weren't able to nuke Japan until after Germany was 'defeated' and they had all the Nazi scientists, and B.) What the Nazis probably used as a bargaining chip to have the Western Allies of America and England tacitly  side with Germany over the Soviet Union towardd the end so the Germans could at least salvage West Germany","7":"You are totally insane if you believe any of that. Please travel, go meet people, go see the sites of these things someone has told you happened. thats such a drastic and inappropriate rewrite of history that I don't really know how to respond to it.","8":"https:\/\/www.google.com\/amp\/s\/www.independent.co.uk\/news\/world\/europe\/radioactive-nazi-atom-bomb-bernd-th-lmann-germany-amateur-treasure-hunter-a7963521.html%3famp  Unfortunately this article is only so-so, I saw another British news article a while back that was better","9":"Once again though, their plan failed because their math was wrong. They didn't have a bomb, they did have enriched uranium, they were just wrong about the quantities they needed specifically because Heisenberg did not check his math.  They had a reactor, again thats where the allies found him (holding a lump of cadmium).","10":"I've heard that too, just that the Nazis didn't add enough uranium   Do you honestly think out of all the visionary and extremely daring and outside-the-box things the Nazis tried, they wouldn't have just checked what adjusting the uranium amounts would do?   It is theoretically possible that you're right and they didn't use the right amount of uranium, but ask yourself, what if they did?","11":"No they thought they needed more than they did, the firing mechanism is where they messed up.   And ya I do, they messed up the math, partially because the guy in charge of the math hated it when people told him to check it.. You can find his notes and look at it.  If they did then they had the pieces and they just calmly decided not to use the bomb and lose the war because I guess they felt bad about the whole war thing. You are right, that makes more sense."}}
