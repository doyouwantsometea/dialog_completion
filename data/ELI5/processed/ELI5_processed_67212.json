They don't consolidate basketball games though hubs, it's not the same model.  Apples and Oranges.  Flight to MCN though ATL.  If every single person on the plane got off in Atlanta, now they're operating an empty plane from ATL to MCN.  Are they making money or taking a loss?  Meanwhile, a plane full of people that actually wanted to go to Macon weren't able to buy tickets because it said the plane was full, so they've also lost all of that revenue.   ","2":"&gt; Flight to MCN though ATL.  If every single person on the plane got off in Atlanta, now they're operating an empty plane from ATL to MCN. &gt; Are they making money or taking a loss?  If they know what they are doing they are making a profit: they sold a plane full of tickets MCN, and everyone payed. It's possible that they didn't do their math and charged too little to cover the operation costs, but this is completely unrelated to whether people get off in ATL. ","3":"A.  Operating costs and profit are different things.  You seem to think that the business model is still like it was in the 50's where planes were only half full and everything was free.   It's not.  Deregulation changed all of that.   The current business model is: pack as many people as possible in the plane (by enticing them with low prices) and then selling them stuff while you've got them essentially held hostage.  &gt;but this is completely unrelated to whether people get off in ATL.  The operating cost is.      Tell me about the plane full of people that wanted to buy a ticket and couldn't.  Is those tens of thousands in lost revenue unrelated?","4":"I don't know what flights you take but on transatlantic carriers booze is free, as is food, and 95% of people buy nothing on the flight.","5":"I assure you that more than 5% of the people paid a bag fee, signed up for a Credit Card, booked hotels and activities through the airlines website, paid a change fee for booking, and connected through to other domestic flights where they did pay for food and booze.
