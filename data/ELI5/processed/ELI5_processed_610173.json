Artists go for pretty much the opposite: \"I'm different!  I'm fearless and innovative!  You don't know what I'll do next!\"","2":"I'm really attached to my hair though, does this mean business isn't the right career for me?","3":"I really want to believe that hair wouldn't be an obstacle...  If you can think of a way to do it without blowing your privacy, maybe put up an anonymous photo of yourself someplace?  Then go to r\/AskHR and see what some people who do interviews and hiring think.  They'll have a much clearer idea what things are like these days.","4":"Sure I'll do that, btw I didn't exactly intend if it was acceptable or not, I meant to ask if the career of business itself unsuitable for a person who believes in self expression?","5":"It probably *is* suitable just because business is so broad.  There are so many different companies, and inside those companies there are different departments, some more flexible than others.  Are there business jobs where hair could hurt your chances?  Yeah, I imagine there are.  Should you give up on business because of that?  Probably not, and I hope you don't!  [Disclaimer, because it feels like this is winding down: I've always been clean-shaven with short hair so I've never had any trouble with this, so my sense of the rules might not be the best.]","6":"Thanks a tonne \ud83d\udc4d"}}
