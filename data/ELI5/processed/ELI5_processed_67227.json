We're talking about someone being deprived of their freedom for 23 years. If there's a place for correctness, it is this one.  Address the second point please.","3":"I have no information besides what you have as regards the second point.","4":"In other words, Weinstein was convicted based on a rumour.","5":"I have no idea if this is the case. Because I do not have information on something does not mean that it was done with ill intent. I also don\u2019t know how string theory was developed, but I don\u2019t think it was done illicitly just because I don\u2019t know about it."}}
