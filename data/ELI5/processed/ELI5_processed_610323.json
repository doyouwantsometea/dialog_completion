Invent a cost effective manner of purifying salt water, and then you can save the world AND be the rich elite! Win-win!","2":"Alright, fair enough. I'll look into the existing researches about it. Thanks for your time. Have a nice day.","3":"I hope i am not coming off as rude, i just have spent much time wondering the same as you and all it leads to is anger towards all humanity. Try hard to channel that energy into something positive and the world will be better off because of it. I hope i didnt come across harshly","4":"Nah there are(is) more rude people (person) already here. Yours is quite a valid point. I'm just replying now to not look disinterested and so that others don't feel bad. I'm no longer interested in the discussion, I've got the answers (somewhat).","5":"Fair Enjoy your evening"}}
