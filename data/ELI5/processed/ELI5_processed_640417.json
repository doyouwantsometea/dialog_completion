Nominally our definitions of different races are based on skin tone which is governed by genetics but those racial definitions vary across cultures, nations, and history. Genetics determines how dark or pale your skin is but whether you're 'white' or 'black' is pretty much based on a hodge podge of societal conventions and retroactive justification.   Meanwhile, breeding and the taxonomy of species do depend on more rigorous scientific methods including genetics but even then its messy. Scientists change their minds all the time whether or not two particular breeds of animals are a distinct species or not.   Meanwhile with breeding it really only matters to people who use animals for a particular purpose. If you're trying to win the Westminster Dog show you're going to need to ensure the dog meets the breeding standards set by the people at the Westminster Dog show. But if you just want a buddy to hang out with then the actual breeding requirements like the shape of the ears or length of the tail matter less than temperment or size.","2":"Yeah makes sense. Are there any reliable catalogs of the different variations of the human species? As in, if I wanted to look for how humans were akin to dog breeds, what sort of terminology would be used to define our differences? What is such a practice even called? Again, strictly biological","3":"There's not a 'standard' like the American Kennel Club has for its breeds. Again it varies country by country or even across time.   You can read about different societies standards for race or class based on historical records. Like the Spanish Casta used by the [Spanish Empire](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Casta) in colonial times. But they don't really apply to today at all except when talking about sociological or anthropological concepts and effects into today.   But again, none of those factors line up with what we actually know about genetics. Genetics might explain why someone with primarily african ancestry has darker skin than someone with mostly northern european ancestry but its not actually a good barometer of who is 'black' or 'white' according to society past or present. We just never based our understanding of race on science to start with so attempts to deal with it 'scientifically' run into problems really quickly.","4":"Hmm okay. Thanks for the information. So, political correctness aside, it might be more accurate to talk about the \u201cAfrican breeds\u201d and the \u201cEuropean breeds\u201d to the extent that it relates to their genetics and traits?","5":"You can talk about ethnicities and traits. You don't need to use the word 'breed'. If only for the simple reason that for most areas in life humans are humans and animals are animals and we treat humans and animals differently for myriad reasons.   But again, you're going to have a hard time equating genetic traints with ethnicity. There are white africans and black europeans after all.","6":"Yes. Very true. I\u2019ve noticed from all this discussion just how unprepared we are to go about classifying and categorizing the human race."}}
