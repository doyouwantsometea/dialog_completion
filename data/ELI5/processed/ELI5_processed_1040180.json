I understand that there's great wealth disparity in that city, with the poverty averaging out the rich areas.  What I don't understand is if it's possible in New Orleans, why they didn't raise that money by increasing taxes on their tourism industry.  That would give them guaranteed income to better their infrastructure and reduce hardship on their permanent residents, and also decrease tourism downtime while they rebuild.","3":"What specifically would be tourism industry in New Orleans? I understand hotels but at some point you'll be taxing the very thing that attracted permanent residents in the first place.","4":"Mardi Gras, Bourbon St, casinos, jazz, food.","5":"Like I said.. Locals do all that stuff too. I used to live there.  I like jazz, going out, eating out, bourbon st, gambling and Mardi Gras.","6":"I went because I was in military training at Keesler, and it was something we looked forward to. Lots of military people moving through the south (like me) who know they might never make it back again want to experience the city for its atmosphere and culture. Taxation was just a thought, and as you pointed out, not a very well developed one.","7":"Grew up in Biloxi :-)","8":"I honestly loved it there! If I could take the heat and the possibility of hurricanes every few years, I would seriously consider retiring there...","9":"It was better in the 90's but it's a fun place to live."}}
