Eli5? So like I can pay myself as long as i do it pre-tax?","3":"No, not pre-tax or post-tax.  You can pay yourself, period. Money that you pay yourself is part of your business's expenses, and therefore are not profit. \"I personally profit as a result of owning this business\" is not the same as the accounting definition of 'profit,' because English is the worst.","4":"Sorry if this is a noob question, but uh: Don't you get your business expenses through your profit? There's nowhere else where the money is coming from. So this would break the very thing that makes something non-profit, right?","5":"&gt;Don't you get your business expenses through your profit?  I don't think I understand the question.  Your business has the money it takes in from the products and services it sells; this is called *revenue.*  Your business also has the money it pays out: money to keep the lights on, pay for raw materials, pay salaries, etc. These are called *expenses.* Crucially, salaries get paid out *here,* at this step.  Profit is simply Revenues minus Expenses, and it's this that must be zero in a non-profit, which means that everything needs to be fed back into an expense in some form or fashion.","6":"Ahh okay. Thanks!"}}
