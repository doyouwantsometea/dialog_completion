During that time her energy was real low bc she was dying. Talking was too much and we often told her it was ok not to. She wanted to talk but it was hard.  We asked yes or no questions for her to nod too.","2":"So it was ok with her not to talk as well?","3":"I mean she was coming to terms with death...I\u2019m sure she become \u201cok\u201d with all kinds of things.   It wasn\u2019t that she shouldn\u2019t talk but rather she couldn\u2019t talk.","4":"Right I\u2019m sorry.
