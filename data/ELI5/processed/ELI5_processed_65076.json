I'm not a transphobe; far from it. Trans individuals have my sympathy; they have a tough goddamn row to hoe, and anyone who says otherwise is lying to themselves.  *However.* That doesn't mean that I think mutilating one's body is the proper response.  Now that we've cleared that up, do you want to try again?  EDIT: Secondary question, why did you come up with \"transphobe\" just because I'm philosophically disinclined towards reassignment surgery?","2":"I still think you\u2019re a transphobe, and i have no interest in what you have to say, champ.","3":"You're wrong, and I've told you why.  Care to try again?","4":"I\u2019m good, thanks. Go suck some boots and jack off to a picture of Trumps face or smthng.","5":"Ah, more flaws in your reasoning.  Shall I dissect those as well, or are you going to keep being a jackass?","6":"Pee pee poo poo","7":"Ah. This is the level you sink to.  Amazing.","8":"eat shit","9":"I don't think I will.  What I *wanted* to do was have a conversation, but apparently you're not suited for it, for whatever reason.","10":"using italics doesn\u2019t make you correct","11":"Saying \"pee pee poo poo\" doesn't make you correct.  Calling me a 'transphobe' doesn't make you correct.","12":"jsyk, every time you reply to me I make a donation to Bernie Sanders","13":"And why do you think that has an effect on me?  Waste your money the way you want to; no skin off my back.  Hell, for all you know, I support Sanders, too.","14":"Idk if it does it or not, I\u2019m just seeing how many times I can get you to reply","15":"What if I'm seeing the same thing?","16":"good for you, pee pee poo poo man","17":"That doesn't make you correct, pee pee poo poo man."}}
