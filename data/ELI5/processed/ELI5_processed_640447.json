Also they do a stupid amount of mathematical research to find more efficient ways to calculate things.","2":"Yet they are able to find new research almost every year? What changed? Im think Im gonna need a Eli4 haha!","3":"If you go out into the forest to pick mushrooms, and you pick up one, have you magically found all the mushrooms in the forest? Or will you have to spend more time looking for more?","4":"Oh I see now. \ud83d\ude04  Does that mean when AMD failed with their FX line up, that they were on a bad forest of mushrooms? And Im assuming they hired a new engineer that was able to locate a better forest of mushroom?","5":"They made a shite design that shared an FPU between 2 half-baked cores, so any calculation that involved decimal points couldn't be run in parallel on that core unit. Among several outstanding bruh moments, this was a pretty big hole in the side of that ship."}}
