This is to make sure that they are making a good, well-thought decision. The word for \"lawyer\" in many languages is \"advocate\", so essentially someone is acting as the Devil's lawyer.","2":"So does that always mean that the person or 'Devils' point isn't wrong?","3":"Exactly. They Devil's Advocate may be speaking PERFECT truth. It's up to everyone to decide where the truth is, and what is more important. Maybe the person DIDN'T cause a miracle, and shouldn't be a saint after all--the church should figure that out before proceeding.","4":"So just because the term is 'Devils Advocate' doesn't necessarily mean the person being advocated, is necessarily the Devil... in a manner of speaking? Just that they have an opinion considered unpopular?","5":"I think that nowadays, it would be more like:  There is an opportunity before us. The possibilities of earning off of it are quite high, and the chances of losing are quite low. Losing, though, would cause a great deal of harm. Someone being the Devil's Advocate would bring that up, even though it may be perfectly rational to take the chance..","6":"Would that necessarily make the person advocating for the Devil a bad guy?"}}
