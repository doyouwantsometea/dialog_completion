Doesn't that contradict the very definition of \"infinite\"?","1":"Here's a simple example. Think of all the positive numbers. Infinite, right? Now think of all the even positive numbers. It's half as big as the first example but it's still infinite. ","2":"That's what I'm saying! No matter how easily you can get numbers from one of the piles of numbers being measured, if both piles are infinite, they are infinite","3":"Sure they're both infinite but one is twice as big. ","4":"&gt;twice as *big.*  You're already making the mistake of talking about size.  Size is a comparison. You can't compare infinity precisely because it is infinite.","5":"You can and mathematicians do. ","6":"You can't. They don't. Tell me, what is Infinity - Infinity?","7":"Why would you ask this question if mathematicians don't consider some infinities larger than others?  This is rhetorical as you clearly don't want an answer. ","8":"XD I'm asking you so you realise there's no amswer"}}
