Does it just work like hand sanitizer by killing bacteria?","1":"I'm pretty sure that the soap somehow breaks apart the cell wall of the bacteria, killing it *and* washing it off of your hands.   Whereas hand sanitizer simply kills the bacteria and leaves it on your hands.","2":"I thought the same initially but then I thought about how hand sanitizer stinks so much of alcohol and it made sense that it would kill bacteria but if soap could kill bacteria why wouldn\u2019t sanitizer be made in a similar way so it smells much nicer and it isn\u2019t as rough on your skin.","3":"I got some vegetable based hand sanitizer towards the beginning of covid, when all the regular GermX was selling out. It was slimy and warm and you'd just be rubbing it on your hands for like a full five or six seconds, and it wasn't evaporating, and then suddenly your hands were dry. It didn't smell good, but it didn't smell like alcohol either.","4":"Oh well maybe it is just cheaper for big companies to not bother making sanitizer smell better and be better for your skin.","5":"Yeah, \"rubbing alcohol, but thick\" is probably way cheaper and faster and enough people don't complain."}}
