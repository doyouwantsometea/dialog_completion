If a sound wave falls outside of that range, you are not going to be able to hear it.  However, that doesn't mean that you aren't able to perceive it in other ways.  We can \"feel\" sound waves outside of our normal range of hearing - both above and below the 20\/20,000 thresholds.  The 18.9 Hz wave is no different - you can't hear it, but you can feel it is there.  In many people, this feeling manifests itself as fear or paranoia.  You can \"feel\" something in the room, but none of your other senses register anything consciously.  This incongruence greats discomfort,t which manifests as fear.  It is called the \"Ghost Frequency\" because it is theorized that many \"haunted\" areas simply produce tones close to 18.9 Hz (through resonance or other natural quirks) and people associate the fear response with a \"presence\" in the area.","2":"Great explanation. Thank you!  So would it be safe to assume that, one can theoretically make a location\/home \u201chaunted\u201d, by just getting a device to emit this frequency?   Also, are there any physical reactions the body gives off to this save the eerie feeling?","3":"It is actually pretty tough to generate things that low - most speakers can't do it (since there is no point in making a sound no one can hear).  That said, yes, you could make a house \"feel\" haunted by pumping in 18.9 Hz tones - people would feel the room was \"off\".  As for physical reactions, nothing due to the sound itself but there are all sorts of physiological reactions to fear.","4":"Superb, if you don\u2019t mind further questions, what are the use cases for frequencies this low, considering the fact that it is inaudible to humans.","5":"I can\u2019t think of any use cases for sounds that low."}}
