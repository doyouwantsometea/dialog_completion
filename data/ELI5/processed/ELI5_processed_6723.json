How does the shell grow inside the chicken? And how does it happen so quickly?","1":"They need to last the ~22 days needed to incubate without stuff getting in that shouldn't which could affect the chick.","2":"oh. so there\u2019s multiple eggs in the chicken at once? how many eggs can be inside a chicken at one time?","3":"No you misunderstand, a single egg after it has been laid incubates between 21 and 28 days, and for those 3 + weeks is exposed to the environment.   A chicken can only form one egg at a time, and usually lays one every 24 to 48 hours depending on the breed and the age of the hen. However there are always a few eggs at various points of the process from ovulation to the actual laying within the chicken at any give time.","4":"oh gotcha! yes i definitely did not understand. thank you! i can\u2019t wait to spread my new chicken knowledge lol","5":"You may enjoy r\/backyardchickens too :)","6":"oh my gosh yes! now subbed :) i\u2019ll bother them if i have any more questions lol"}}
