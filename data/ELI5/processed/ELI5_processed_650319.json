If it was \u201cjust another flu\u201d it would\u2019ve been over a long time ago.","2":"ok but the flu is gone now right? 47 cases is nothing we can easily handle that and make it 0, correct?","3":"We\u2019d have to quarantine those flu patients harder than we are with Covid now.","4":"Future generations would consider those 47 heroes that helped destroy the flu.   So can we make it disappear forever if there are only 47 sick with it now?","5":"There is more to the world than just Canada. If everyone with the flu quarantined until it was dead then it likely wouldn\u2019t be gone forever because it also jumps between animals.","6":"Yea but you can just stop the flow and free travel of people and suddenly I wouldn't even care about all of the country just my province and in theory the flu should be gone forever, no?","7":"If you keep the entire province quarantined forever then yes, flu would be gone forever."}}
