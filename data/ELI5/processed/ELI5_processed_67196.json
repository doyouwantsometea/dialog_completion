The circular shadow of the Earth has an orientation that depends on what direction is \"down\" to the observer.  If you went through the Earth to the corresponding spot on the other side; the Earth, Sun, and Moon would be in the same places but \"top\" and \"bottom\" would be reversed.","2":"But how does this explain the light source and the shadow not being on opposite sides of each other? I understand the the basics of the lunar cycle and the rotation of earth. I just don't understand how the sun *and* the shadow on the moon can be on the *same* side. Should they not be opposite?","3":"Which half of the Earth that is lit only depends on the Earth's rotation, and as the other thread explains in detail, that rotation is independent of the orbit of the planet and the Moon.  The Sun and the Moon are almost always on the same hemisphere of the Earth, this is a situation where they are almost opposite each other.  The sky becomes bright before the Sun is actually visible because the atmosphere scatters light.  That may be confusing your interpretation of the sun's location, thinking it's higher in the sky than it actually is.  The Sunrise\/sunset band is a ring around the Earth. As you go around that ring, your feet rotate relative to the plane of the planets.  On one side the shadow is \"up\" pointing toward the brightening sky.  On this side, the shadow points down.  The direction of the \"bright sky\" also rotates because the atmosphere is held to the Earth by the same gravity that holds your feet to the Earth.","4":"Can you see the moon from any point on the sunset ring at this time? I can understand if you go to the other side of the sunset ring then the shadow would appear upside down but surely you wouldn't be able to see the moon and the sun at the same time from that spot?","5":"There is a hemisphere of Earth where you can see the Moon (ignoring that it's hard during the day because the sky is so bright).  At the same time, there is a hemisphere of Earth where you can see the Sun (generally called \"daytime\").  Most of the time, where is an overlap between these two where you can see the Moon during the day (ignoring it's hard ...).  The eclipse is a \"special\" time where the two hemispheres touch at their edges.  As the Sun and Moon move apart, the overlapping section of the Earth in both becomes thinner and longer.  At the eclipse, it's at its thinnest, only minutes long, but it goes all the way around.  Note, this presumes that you don't have any trees, mountains, or buildings in the way, and the people in the video clearly had to trek to a specific place near them to achieve this."}}
