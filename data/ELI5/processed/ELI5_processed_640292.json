Cause all the top comments don't answer the question.  Most security questions should not be public info. Your first dog's name, street you grew up on, and high school mascot should not be public information for the vast majority of Americans.  So they are not \"very simple\" unless you know the answer, they could be millions of words, so in combination with a correct password that basic private question is enough to prove that it's really you and not someone who has just somehow gained knowledge of your password.","2":"If you were targeting a specific individual, much of that information could be found out.  Where you went to high school is probably over shared on people social media accounts, realestate records could show where you parents lived and there you have street you grew up and and a short list of highschools to find out mascots for.  I mean haven't you ever been presented with a list of multiple choice questions \"which of these streets was ever associated with you\"  \"which person was ever associated with you\" on credit card or bank applications?  They straight up say that's culled from public info.","3":"They get that info from your credit report\/history, which again, should be obtainable only with private info like your social, full name and signature or electronic equivalent.  If you are being targeted specifically, you'd likely be unable to do anything short of having 2 factor on every account you own. So again, for the vast majority of people, they are not \"simple\" questions.","4":"get a paid account on publicdata.com.  there you can easily pull up a lot of stuff reddit would largely have you believe you need top secret security clearance to find out like who a vehicle is registered to based on license plate, or reverse find out what's registered to you if you have the name to look up","5":"But again, you'd have to be specifically targeted, which is a lot of work vs large attacks targeting a ton of people.   And if you are being targeted, there is little you will be able to do.","6":"That's really all beside the point of why I asked the question though.  \"Hope know one ever takes an interest in you b\/c you're fucked after a days effort on their part\" isn't a good security model, in my opinion.","7":"That's the best security model because it works for 99.99% of people. Which is why the system is as it is.   The system works for most of the people, most of the time and is easy to use and implement."}}
