That means ur fingers arnt getting as much fresh blood to flow over the nerves and sooth it. Blood and saliva have natural painkillers in them. This is why papercuts hurt so much.","2":"That's some crazy science that I did not know! So if I get a paper cut I should spit on it?","3":"If u get a papercut on ur finger, do you not put it in your mouth and suck on it anyways? Cuz i do like the second i get a paper cut lol, this is also why dogs and other animals lick their wounds.","4":"Yeah, I do. Man, life is snap focussing right now. Everything makes sense! Thanks!","5":"https:\/\/www.newscientist.com\/article\/dn10514-natural-born-painkiller-found-in-human-saliva\/ And your blood contains endorphins which is why when u get a burn or something the pain goes in fast waves its bc ur blood sooths it for a second before the endorphins are worn out and fresh blood has to replace it."}}
