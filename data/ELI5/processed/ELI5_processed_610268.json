So it\u2019s really pretty important to not withhold the fact how capable the human body is at looking after itself with just protein and fats instead of giving the impression that we need a carb diet to keep our brains going.","2":"Yes, from what I've read, there are no essential carbohydrates precisely because of gluconeogenesis. Ketones are apparently more efficient than glucose. Yet again, I've read that High Carb Low Fat and Low Carb High Fat tend to result in similar improvements.   Metabolic problems seem to arise, I think, in modern diets that are High Carb High Fat.","3":"I\u2019d be curious how many type 2 diabetics are in the high carb low fat versus high fat low carb group, as I would struggle to see many, if any in the latter.","4":"This guy talks about why he quit keto for HCLF.  He sounds genuine but I wonder what information he's neglected or forgotten to include that would give us more insight into why he decided to switch.  [https:\/\/www.forksoverknives.com\/success-stories\/why-i-quit-keto-diet-diabetes\/#gs.7bkwey](https:\/\/www.forksoverknives.com\/success-stories\/why-i-quit-keto-diet-diabetes\/#gs.7bkwey)","5":"Man, from a quick overview that\u2019s fundamentally iffy with how he came to a lot of those conclusions especially talking about it making cells dysfunctional and then he\u2019s selling a meal planner based off his 30 days of plant based diet?   I don\u2019t like to be dismissive but it\u2019s very much like he\u2019s written that article to talk down about a way of life purely to upsell and profit off his own with little evidence rather than buzzwords and negativity. At least I\u2019m not here to earn a cent talking about my own way of life eating.","6":"I hear you man, this is why Reddit seems a far more trustworthy place. Almost every nutrition guru on the web is a supplement salesman. They're as bad as the conventional lab coats who tell us to shove \"whole-grain\" down our throats."}}
