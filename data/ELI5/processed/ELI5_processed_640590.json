If they're safe and effective for our pets, why are they not safe and effective for us?","1":"Of course! For what it\u2019s worth, my friend is an extreme lover of animals, wants to be a vet, knows all the gritty details and controversies about the medication, and she still uses it on her animals and recommends it to others.","2":"Ticks are absolutely horrible here. I mean, they are really bad. And so is lyme disease...both in people and pets. Our vet recommended the lyme disease vaccine but after reading up on it, there was no way I was gonna give it to my dog. It's practically useless anyway and often causes horrible reactions. You're even supposed to keep using a monthly tick treatment on top of the vaccine. We've been using Nexgard for about 6 months now and it really does work exactlylike it's supposed to. It works so well that the company even guarantees it. If your pet's been on the medicine for at least 3 months and still gets lyme disease, they'll cover 100% of the treatment cost. I do worry worry about the long-term effects, but with where I live, tick treatment that works really is a necessity.","3":"This. This is why using next guard is worth the risk of side effects because in certain areas a dogs quality of life would be absolutely terrible if it didn\u2019t have a way to reliably repel ticks. Having 24\/7 protection from ticks is worth the relatively rare risk of side effects.   PS. It is very toxic to cats, but look up permethrin. The brand you\u2019ll probably find is Sawyer. It will change your life when it comes to repelling ticks. Lasts for weeks on your clothes. DEET is a joke. I found it when doing rattlesnake research in Missouri after one day I counted walking through 27 different individual seed tick blobs. Never again.","4":"Permethrin, like what's in lice shampoo? Didn't realize that worked for ticks, as well. Will definitely be checking into it! Thank you!!","5":"Yep. No worries. Long story short: DEET is a generic compound that can be made by lots of companies for cheap, so it\u2019s marketed for everything but it only really works for biting flies and only when it\u2019s still wet (you can smell it).  Permethrin isn\u2019t a generic chemical produces by lots of companies. And the primary consumers of the chemical are US agriculture and US military.   https:\/\/sawyer.com\/videos\/permethrin-clothing-gear-insect-repellent\/  My experience is I treat my boots and hiking\/field clothes once a month and I almost never get embedded ticks anymore. Don\u2019t apply it to your skin. Don\u2019t let cats anywhere near it before it dries. Heat destroys the chemicals, so hang or tumble dry those."}}
