You learned by using the tachometer.   You relearn whenever you get a new car and has to get used to how it feels - especially if it uses a different engine type, for example switching to diesel (or back) requires you to completely relearn how a car should feel.   Once you've learned how your car (or other motorized transport) feels at all speeds, you don't need any of the instrument panel except maybe a way to estimate how much fuel you have left.","2":"I don\u2019t think I ever looked at the tachometer when changing gears. I could hear the rpm go up and I could feel the acceleration slowing down, which would tell me to change gears.   Besides, most cars these days are automatic, and they still have tachometers.","3":"Oh, so you never learned to use your gears properly?   To be fair this isn't unusual, my first driving instructor skipped it as well.","4":"I drove first 13 years of my driving life with manual transmission, and I had no issues using gears. I still drive a manual occasionally without any issues, and without looking at the RPM when changing gears. Even with cars I haven't driven before. And yes, I do engine braking and skipping gears without any issues, and my cars have always been impeccably maintained.  I'm not sure what I'm supposed to be missing by not looking at the RPM when changing gears?","5":"&gt;I'm not sure what I'm supposed to be missing by not looking at the RPM when changing gears?  Well, for starters you're leaving a bunch of acceleration on the table by   &gt; skipping gears  And not using the peak of your power curve as much as you could be.   If you're consistently skipping the same gear that'll sacrifice a bit of longevity, though whether you'll keep the car long enough to need it is another question.   Fuel efficiency is definitely improved by using the bottom of your rev range, without going too low, which is literally impossible to judge accurately by feel for most people - though if you have perfect pitch that's not necessarily a concern.","6":"I'm not consistently skipping gears, I do it depending on the situation. If I'm on fourth gear and at or close to my speed goal, I usually skip straight to sixth. Sure, acceleration, if I still need to do any, might be slightly slower than if I changed to fifth instead. But I'm not usually in a situation that demands maximum acceleration.  And lets be honest: skipping gears is perfectly safe. Any wear and tear it causes is neglible.","7":"&gt;is neglible  In the grand scheme of things, the entire solar system and everything it contains is neglible.   Doesn't mean we can't put effort into it and our existence within it.","8":"I have never had any issues with clutches or gearboxes is any of my cars with manual, and the car I had with most mileage was an old Saab with something like 450.000km on it. Whenever you do anything with your car, it causes wear and tear. That includes changing gears, with or without gear skipping. So if we want to minimize wear and tear, we shouldn't be driving our cars at all.","9":"Is this a straw man argument? I think this is a straw man argument, but I'm not great at fallacies."}}
