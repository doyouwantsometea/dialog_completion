How do they do this? Are they really listening in to me?","1":"So did you announce the exact product name in earshot of your phone?","2":"no not at all. we simply went to the store, bought it in cash, came home, and replaced it.","3":"If you didn't say the name of the product then why is your question if they're listening to you?  how else would they get the exact product. It looks like it was confirmation bias. You're looking for the product now and you found it.","4":"if you look at my post, you\u2019ll see that i ask \u201chow are they doing this\u201d. i don\u2019t know how they\u2019re doing this. how is this confirmation bias?","5":"Rather than \"looking for the product\" it's just that you are more aware.   I recently got a specific car. I never noticed how many people have my car because before, I never paid attention to it.   You see hundreds of ads a day. This is a few of those ads."}}
