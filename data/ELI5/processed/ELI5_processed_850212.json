It's not that we can purify salt water. It's that we shouldn't. I mean the amount of negative affects that would have on the planet alone makes it a bad idea.","2":"That's what I'm asking. What are those effects? Your saltiness affects your and your close ones it's not a global issue so leave me out of it lol.","3":"You have like 5 people telling you the same thing and all you do is argue. So why did you ask the question at all? Either you're a troll or need to accept the answers you get or look iy up yourself and shut up","4":"u\/already-taken-wtf is literally the only one who has perhaps provided something meaningful to look into. I suggest you work on your issues mate, there's a discussion going on which has disagreements. Seems like you're too into yourself to realise that.","5":"There's no disagreements. It's you asking the same question 15 times expecting a different answer. Just because im telling you how it is and how you're acting doesn't mean i have issues.","6":"Good luck with your issues (if any), hope you find some solutions (if required). Have a nice day \u262e\ufe0f","7":"Good luck getting the answer you're looking for by asking the same question 15 times.","8":"Cheers. Have a good day:)"}}
