People will always want the best weapons of the time when the police abuse them. Silencers now, laser drones tomorrow. Whatever kills the largest number of abusive cops and soldiers.","2":"Wouldn't it be better then to keep the guns away from peopld at all? Then the police wouldn't need guns at all and it would be more fifficult for them to opress you","3":"Who is gonna stop them from keeping their guns, like every other warlord through history?","4":"You could stopp to sell more guns and stopp to sell amunition and replacement parts, you coulf give incetives for every returnedvgun, but xou are correct, many guns wouldvremain, but in the long run they would dissapear","5":"You can't do any of that, because gun factories already exist to serve the police and military. So unless you abolish the military and police (which I favor), there will always be pressure from lobbyists to sell more guns. That's why the NRA exists- gun manufacturers trick private owners into joining, to lobby Congress to expand the market for the manufacturers. But if you abolish the state organs of violence, there is no need for the second amendment, and no gun industries left to lobby. I applaud your attempts to end the slaughter of capitalism though.","6":"That soundsvlike an additional problem","7":"Guns aren't going anywhere until capitalism falls. Spend your energy working on the root of class conflict and the gun problem will solve itself."}}
