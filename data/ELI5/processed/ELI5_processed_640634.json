All you need is tobacco, paper and maybe some flammable material to mix up with tobacco. So why the fuck do I have to smoke polonium 13?","1":"Either because they don\u2019t use apatite in their fertilizer, or more likely because they do but don\u2019t tell you.","2":"How can they just \"not tell me\"? They are obliged by law","3":"Which law, US law? I\u2019ve never seen a \u201cmay contain\u201d list when purchasing cigars.","4":"I don\u2019t live in US but I\u2019m pretty sure they can\u2019t hide what their products contain","5":"First of all, the polonium isn\u2019t an ingredient, it\u2019s not something they add to it, it\u2019s left over from doing agriculture.   In the US cigarettes don\u2019t have an ingredient list.  And if there was a \u201cmay contain traces of\u201d list, it would be so long as to not fit on either a pack nor a carton.   I\u2019m not a US lawyer and am even less familiar with the law in whatever country you\u2019re in."}}
