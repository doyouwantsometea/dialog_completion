Imagine you take a black marker and draw points on its surface.  Now, space is somewhat like the surface of the inflating ballon. While inflating, the surface expands and the distance between any two points on its surface  becomes larger too.  The surface of the balloon doesnt really expand \u201cinto anything\u201d, it just grows larger while maintaining the same characteristics.","2":"I think it's because I'm thinking in conventional terms I'm confused if the way balloon surface is expanding in an empty room...if the space is also expanding inside of something empty (?) Emptier (?)","3":"Space is the surface of the ballon, not the ballon. There\u2019s no \u201cinside the balloon\u201d and there\u2019s no \u201croom the balloon is in\u201d.","4":"Yeah but...but why not?","5":"I guess that\u2019s something a little too complicated for a eli5. Basically you are asking \u201cwhat is the universe\u201d and as far as I know there\u2019s very little consensus on that.","6":"Yeah I know my question is a little too complicated... worth a shot!"}}
