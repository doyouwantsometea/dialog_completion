You decide to use seashells as money, as there is a fixed quantity. The system works. However, one day you discover a small beach with a lot of shells but you keep it a secret. Would the market react if you tell no one ?","1":"When the government takes the issuance of the central bank, no real debt is incurred in the sense of household debt, but it is politically expedient to act as though that is the case. The only real value in the world is material resources and labour -- money is an obfuscating game above all that.","2":"This is conflicting all my economic knowledge lmao. Okay, so does the government owe debt in the form of bonds ? And pay interest annually with our taxes or not? And when the central bank buys these government bonds is this inflationary or not ?","3":"You're getting a little technical for me now, I just read where my interest takes me and am not able to follow all the implications of this!  Money in modern society is more or less fictional with limits placed arbitrarily to benefit one or another faction of the ruling class. Debt is the main way money is introduced into the economy and there would be no money circulating if all debts were paid, as far as I understand.  Some books that opened my eyes about this were David Graeber's Debt: The First Five Thousand Years and Kate Raworth's Donut Economics. I also like reading about Modern Monetary Theory which is based on some of these ideas -- although I don't agree with the thinking of all MMTers (and am certainly not smart enough to say that to their faces).","4":"Okay I\u2019ll read them thanks !","5":"Maybe start with Kate Raworth, the Graeber one is a fucking fat book to get through if you've got an interview looming"}}
