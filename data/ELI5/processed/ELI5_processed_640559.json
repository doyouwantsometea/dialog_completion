Does my body absorb or metabolize it? Is it stored in some form?","1":"Not only is it absorbed but research has found that certain chemicals in sunscreens like oxybenzone, octinoxate, octocrylene, homosalate, and avobenzone are not only absorbed into the blood but are even found in the blood of a fetus of a woman who used it while pregnant. The research has even shown links to these chemicals and hormonal imbalance.","2":"What the hell!?!? Do you have any links to this research?","3":"The best for it is from the EWG.  [it\u2019s from 2018 but plenty current.](https:\/\/www.ewg.org\/sunscreen\/report\/the-trouble-with-sunscreen-chemicals\/)","4":"Thank you!","5":"No problem. When we found out about it years ago we check everything that contains any sunscreen. Even lip balms have the chems.  We switched to zinc\/ titanium dioxide organic sunscreens and our daughter who has more fair skin than either of us has yet to burn.  Do watch the ones that are safe lotion wise but also have a spray on version as well (disgustingly marketed for use on toddlers) have the chems in the spray and not the lotion."}}
