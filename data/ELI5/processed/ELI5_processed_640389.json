Apparently the process of evaporating sweat requires the excess heat from your body and the heat is used up in the process. Is that how heat energy works? Would it stay in the body unless there was sweat to evaporate? Sounds like the information sources I found are leaving out some important detail about how heat energy works cause this explanation does not compute. Anyone care to fill in the missing info?     Releasing the sweat does not have any cooling effect whatsoever. It needs to evaporate. The vast majority of body heat is lost in the form of evaporation energy. A liquid requires a certain threshold energy - enthalpy - to change into its gaseous form. That's where the body heat disappears. While your body also loses heat by other means (heat radiation and simple heat transfer to surrounding materials), evaporation energy lost to sweat evaporation is usually orders of magnitude bigger.","2":"Thanks a lot for the technical, yet very clear explanation.   I asked because I'm reading Bill Gates's new book on climate change. He explains that when the air is very humid, it might not be able to take in any more humidity, which would unfortunately lead to death by heatstroke within hours. I'm trying to apply what you told me to make sense of this. According to the book, \"the human body's ability to cool off depends on the air's ability to absorb sweat as it evaporates. If the air cannot absorb your sweat, then it can t cool you off, no matter how much you perspire.\"   Doesn't the fact that the sweat evaporated mean that you have been cooled off? What does the air absorbing the evaporated sweat have to do with you cooling off?  Edit: fixed mistake in explanation","3":"&gt; Doesn't the fact that the sweat evaporated mean that you have been cooled off? What does the air absorbing the evaporated sweat have to do with you cooling off?  If the air has already reached full saturation of water vapor, any further liquid water will *stop* evaporating. The sweat will stay in liquid form and not provide any cooling effect.   Think of the water vapor within the air as some kind of *solution*. If you add salt into a glass of water the salt will dissolve. If you *keep* adding salt the water will reach 100% salt saturation at some point and the salt - instead of dissolving - will stay in its solid form and accumulate at the bottom of the glass. It's similar with water vapor and air at 100% humidity.","4":"Thanks a lot. You are very good at explaining things. May I ask what you do for a living?","5":"&gt;Thanks a lot. You are very good at explaining things. May I ask what you do for a living?      I'd prefer not to answer that publicly.   I like to think that I had excellent teachers during my life and am merely imitating them.","6":"fair enough, thanks a lot for the help :)"}}
