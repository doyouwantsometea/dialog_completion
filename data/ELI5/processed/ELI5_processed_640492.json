Examples: tattoos are more acceptable and even breaking into the white collar professions; jeans can now be considered business-casual attire when lean and with a button-up or sport jacket. These are just examples of the \u201cnorm\u201d changing. But as another commentator said \u201cshort and neat hair has always been considered the professional haircut standard.\u201d","2":"Makes sense, although, why are white collar professions the last to change?","3":"Higher status. Strict rules and expectations. Two guys with the same experience, applying for the same job, one is clean cut and wearing a suit. The other is covered in tattoos and hair is jacked up. The employer is more inclined to higher the guy who\u2019s clean cut because \u201che takes care of himself, he\u2019ll do a good job with the company. The other dude looks like he doesn\u2019t take care of himself...\u201d It\u2019s all just ways that we project ourselves that helps form people\u2019s opinions about us. Surely a Dr. covered in tattoos will do a fine job (they\u2019re a Dr after all) but a conservative old woman might be frightened by the sight of him\/her.","4":"But the length of one's hair or tattoos aren't an accurate way of determining whether someone takes care of themselves right?","5":"Tell that to society. But we agreed already that things are changing. Society evolves. Another example, high society used to wear powdered wigs so show nobility. Now days, they just wear bespoke suits, shoes, and brand name attire. But still a majority will appear clean cut, minimum to no tattoos. Etc.."}}
