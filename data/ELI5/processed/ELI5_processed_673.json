There's still an underlying vein that whiteness is equated with attractiveness, and a lot of the motivation behind skin whitening stems from that idea.","2":"Well I think that the idea of attractiveness changes though, some individuals feel more attractive if they're tan, while others feel more attractive if they're not as tan.   Would you say that the consideration, that one's personal perception of beauty might not be related to historical racism, has been abandoned?","3":"No, not really, because for that to be the case, racism would have to be considered a historical past time, and not something that still actively happens in many societies across the globe. There is still a stigma within the fashion industry that lighter skin is better, there's been work done to change this narrative, but we still have a long way to go in that sense.","4":"Well yeah, it's pretty real, and honestly quite baffling that in 2020 we see systematic oppression based on ethnicity with such strength and impunity.  With that said, is there any space left, for a young hispanic girl to want to lighten her skin a bit without her even thinking about racism or doing so out fo trying to look like a caucasian person, but solely and simply because she likes the way it looks? In the same way that she wants to dye her hair pink, or pain her nails purple?","5":"I am all for anyone doing anything they want with their body, if it makes them feel good, then they should go for it. Your original comment seemed to imply to want an explanation for the stigma behind the ritual, and sadly it happens to be one that is largely tied to a checkered past. I will say, I personally get kind of sad though when someone wants to do something because they feel like they aren't attractive enough as they are, and that would include wishing their skin was lighter or wanting plastic surgery. It makes me feel bad that society has created these beauty norms that make people judge themselves so harshly.","6":"Oh yes, that was my questions and I'm finding very interesting answers. Including this one in the comment I'm replying to.  I think I've been a bit out of the loop about this negative side, because for example, the women I've dated don't always change things because they feel unhappy or unattractive, sometimes it's just bored of their current \"look\" and thinking of a new one, this includes tanning\/lightening, hair dying, etc. Going from straight hair brunette to curly haired blonde, or also non-biologically natural colors like pink or blue.   I guess I've seen these changes more of an accessory rather than a way to fix an insecurity caused by societal norms, which I mostly associate with weight loss\/gain and breast\/butt reduction\/enhancement; or specific clothes to match a clique or present a wealth status."}}
