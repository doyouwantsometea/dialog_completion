You have no way of knowing that those stars you mentioned exist, you simply trust many different things, from the scientists who say they found the data to the possibility that the universe is built on a firm set of rules that can be extrapolated from.  &amp;#x200B;  The point is, you may be able to \\*infer\\* that something exists, but all you really know is what you perceive, everything else is guesswork. Hence the question of \"if a tree falls in the woods and no one is around to hear it, does it make a sound\" is only a \"flawed principle\" if you treat the theories science has discovered as some hard and fast absolute, which they are not. What if the universe actually worked such that collisions only cause vibrations if someone is around to observe them? How would any scientific principle ever discover that, given that science is based on observation?","4":"I guess I understand now. But I still think it's important to trust science (see: [flat earthers](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Flat_Earth#Modern_Flat-Earthers), [moon landing was a conspiracy](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Flat_Earth#Modern_Flat-Earthers))","5":"To be clear, I am not advocating for a distrust of science. This is philosophy, which is focused on very different things.  &amp;#x200B;  A key point is to imagine that we \\*do\\* live in that universe, where unless something is observed by a human it doesn't happen. How would that affect us?     Not one bit.  &amp;#x200B;  If the universe only operates differently if it has no way of being observed, then by definition it can't affect us. Science is still as useful as it always was. The point of philosophy is to consider the \"what ifs\", and see whether that has any bearing on how we \\*should\\* behave."}}
