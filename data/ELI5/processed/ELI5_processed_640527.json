Six or seven people have told you as much.   The reason that humans don\u2019t have children immediately after reaching puberty, is not biological.   Remember you\u2019ve accepted that your original premise, that the question was predicated on, wasn\u2019t true? Why you doing this","2":"You seem to think just because someone comments something, I take it as truth. The answer, even if my question has a false premise, is STILL biological. The entire situation is biological. We're talking about ovulation and human behavior. You just keep picking new points to try tripping me up on.","3":"If you post a thread in a question forum, and the majority of people give you the exact same answer, you don\u2019t believe them?   Yes, okay, discussion of biology was a necessary part of answering the question. It\u2019s a question that referenced puberty in mammals - it self-evidently was going to refer to biological topics. However, your question was asking for the biological reason that humans aren\u2019t ready for kids whilst animals are. The premise is false, and the reason the premise is false is due to social and not biological factors. As I\u2019ve said over and over and over. You may as well be asking \u201cwhat\u2019s the economic rationale for the earth rotating around the sun\u201d.   And for your last sentence - I\u2019m not the one trying to steer this away from a question about raising children and into a semantic debate about   I\u2019m gonna respond every single time btw. ","4":"I wouldn't say the majority of answers said the exact same thing, there was a decent mix of answers that I saw. Some made good points. And I feel like your logic is lacking. The only social answers were the ones provided once the commenter framed my question in a nonbiological way. I was still looking for biological answers. And I got some good ones. There are other factors other than \"that's just how you view it\".   And ya know what fine, go ahead and reply every time. I gotta get up and go to work tomorrow so I can't continue this much longer and I won't care enough to reply tomorrow. So give your last comment, I hope it's a good one.","5":"Woo I absolutely nailed you with that last response. Literally just repeating your own hypocritical words back to you. oh man I can\u2019t believe you handed me that opening on a plate like that, too perfect.   Have a good day in work, I hope you\u2019ve learned from all of this"}}
