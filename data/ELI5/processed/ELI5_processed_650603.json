I know they \"don't share\", but is that a crack at aristocrats or more of a Buddhist-style respectful reference to the nobility?","1":"As I tried to say 'noble' does only mean non-reactive not necessarily stable. Radon is a noble gas but it's radioactive with a half life of 3.8 days decaying into Polonium.   Most elements lighter than lead (have isotopes that) are stable and won't change while pretty much all element heavier than lead will decay over time into lead. Over astronomical time scales stars will continue to change the ratio of hydrogen and helium to heavier elements but the majority of  will stay lighter than Neon.","2":"Hmm, interesting, thank you (unless that's a bullshit answer but I have no way of refuting it anyway)   But if lead decays into something even heavier...  Then maybe eventually (2 billion years from now?), everything will be either super heavy or super light?","3":"First, elements decaying always become lighter. Second, lead is stable and does not decay. The only way elements become more massive is through nuclear reactions in stars.    The general trend is that very light elements become heavier and very heavy elements become lighter until they reach Lead\/Thallium. Exotic isotopes that don't fit the general pattern are extremely short-lived, so they basically don't exist.  Also, 2 billion years is not very long, the most stable isotope of Bismuth for example has a half-life of 19 billion billion years to decay into Thallium, and over the 14 billion years the universe has existed stars have only managed to transmute about 2% of mass into anything else than hydrogen and helium.","4":"Also, do you think it's possible that either naturally or \"artificially\" that new elements will be made?   If so, how many? 119 overall? 120? 5,000? 80,000? Infinite?","5":"Theoretically, there can be more massive elements but the most massive ones we've artificially created already are so unstable they decay within nano- to microseconds - in practical terms these elements don't matter because they barely exist."}}
