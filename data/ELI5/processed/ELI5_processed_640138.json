I mentioned where I got it from in my top level comment and you don't even have an idea?   Huh. Guess I could make it more clear, but then again it isn't really relevant to the topic at hand so I don't think I will.","2":"You are just saying that if I don't look at RPM when changing gears, then I \" never got professional driving instruction and didn't bother maintaining  your first vehicle or got it from an instructor who didn't bother  maintaining his vehicles. In that case you almost certainly learned from  someone who learned from a tachometer somewhere upstream and just  skipped the lessons about using your full rev range.\". I did in fact receive professional driving instruction, and I have always taken good care of my cars.  Just because you keep on saying it's wrong to skip gears, doesn't actually make it true.","3":"So you do have an idea of where I got it from?","4":"Driving instructor told you skipping gears is wrong? Maybe your instructor was wrong? My driving instructor told me how to do engine braking and he did also talk about skipping gears.   Feel free to google whether it's ok to skip gears and you will get article after article saying that it's perfectly OK to do so. Sure, you can do dumb things when doing so, but that applies to everything we do in life.","5":"&gt;Feel free to google whether it's ok to skip gears and you will get article after article saying   Whatever you want it to.   \"There are websites on the internet that agree with my preconceived notions\" also applies to whether vaccines cause autism and if the Earth is flat.","6":"These are basically the first handful of articles about this, none of them are saying that skipping gears is wrong:  https:\/\/www.motorauthority.com\/news\/1112261_is-it-okay-to-skip-gears-on-a-manual-transmission  https:\/\/www.roadandtrack.com\/car-culture\/buying-maintenance\/a12041218\/skip-gears-manual-transmission\/  https:\/\/drivetribe.com\/p\/is-it-okay-to-skip-gears-with-a-Z4HaQWPiQIG5RpeeVMCW0Q?iid=Wn1zNOMeQd2DW4Qp84GLmg  And those are high profile websites, not some random infowars-wannabes.  Many of the articles referred to this video: https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=tpGsNXUlX1c  In short: there's nothing wrong with skipping gears. Maybe, just maybe, you are wrong about this?","7":"Or here's a different idea.   Car manufacturers know you're going to do it anyway, so they overengineer their gearboxes accordingly.","8":"So you are saying that it's perfectly fine to skip gears, cars can handle it just fine? Which is what I have been saying all along, thanks for agreeing with me :).","9":"Doing things wrong is usually fine if you don't mind paying for fool-proofing.","10":"So, on the one hand, I have an engineer, numerous motoring journalists and my driving instructor telling me it's perfectly OK to skip gears. But on the other hand, there is this random person on the internet telling me it's \"wrong\" to skip gears. Hmmm, who to believe...  Seriously: you don't consider it to be possible that you are quite simply wrong on this issue?","11":"Hmm? I stopped caring when your post was removed, just been stringing you along seeing how worked up you can get about it.   Of course skipping gears is ok, it's just wrong in certain situations but not to a degree that can't be overcome by adding several hundred kilograms of metal to your vehicle."}}
