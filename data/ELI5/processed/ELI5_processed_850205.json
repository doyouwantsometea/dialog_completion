How does that work?","2":"there are way, intelligent people will find a way","3":"&gt;there are way [sic]  Such as?  &gt;intelligent people will find a way  So you're leaning on the \"What I think is right is definitely correct, despite all evidence to the contrary, because someone smart (who has already said that it's a bad idea) will make it work eventually\"   Do I have that right?  Intelligent people have looked at the task of covering millions of square miles of the planet with a covering to capture some gas and decided that it makes absolutely no sense, and would then also completely ruin the ecosystems that would have to be covered, as well as taking an absurd amount of materials, resources, and energy to complete, and they decided it would be much more feasible to find other solutions that are actually possible.","4":"No you couldn't be more wrong, I could go into vast details of ways to harvest methane from the meltiing arctic, but no one gives a shit. Everyone will just crap down my neck like you have been doing all day. It could be as simple as vacuuming it up with big harvesters. However that is not my expertise to come up with blue prints and contact manufacture companies, then finding some way to get investors involved and government acceptance. Some ELSE in a position to do something about it can and will. I just have to trust that.","5":"&gt; It could be as simple as vacuuming it up with big harvesters.  It doesn't just sit there... it ekes out of the ground and floats up into the sky, and if you aren't there right at the second it comes out, you can't get it back. And it's not coming out in like 5 big vents we can just cap. It's leaking through every single square foot of land as the biomass below the frost is thawed.   Nobody is crapping down your neck, they're responding to your belligerent resistance to the answers to your own question. You are being told that you are wrong because you are wrong. You are being told that you don't understand the topic because you are proving that you don't understand the topic.   You can trust in your fantasy all you want, but it's not physically possible. ","6":"Then we put bases there to capture it as it comes out. Long tubs with vacuum pressure running a grid over acres of land.  It's not belligerent. I am personifying a 5 year old and asking all the questions they would. You guys are being impatient, rude, and down right threatening. Here are the \"facts\" I have walked away from this with: #1 Overcompensation has lead to animal abuse #2 Cow farts from over population will add to green house gases #3 Tending to and raising livestock waste non-renewable resources #4 Land efficiency could be better spent with vertical farming Did I miss something?","7":"&gt; Then we put bases there to capture it as it comes out. Long tubs with vacuum pressure running a grid over acres of land.  So you want to cover millions of square miles of arctic tundra with... vacuum tubes? Running a constant negative pressure in the area to absorb methane gas. And you don't see how insane that sounds?  &gt;You guys are being impatient, rude, and down right threatening.  Act like an idiot who is arguing in bad faith and be treated accordingly. The threats aren't okay, but you're being intentionally frustrating, and people are getting frustrated. Accept the consequences of what you're putting out into the world.  &gt;Here are the \"facts\" I have walked away from this with:  Your facts are correct, yes. They are also just plain facts. Not \"facts\". ","8":"Devil's Advocate. Way to be a jerk"}}
