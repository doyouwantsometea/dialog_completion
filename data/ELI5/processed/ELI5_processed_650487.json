I'm not asking about the process, I'm asking about the actual mechanics. For instance, how does a seed\/seedling\/tree \"know\" what, how and when to grow and make each part? How does the genetic code get interpreted, given there is no intelligence to interpret it?","1":"DNA is not a code.  You are looking at this backwards. There is nothing prescriptive going on here.  Rocks will roll down a hill and group up there.  The rocks did not \"know\" to be there.","2":"&gt; DNA is not a code.  No?   _ DNA codes genetic information for the transmission of inherited traits._ - britannica.com  _ Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is a molecule that contains the biological instructions that make each species unique._ - genome.gov  _ Deoxyribonucleic acid, or DNA, is a biological macromolecule that carries hereditary information in many organisms._ - biologydictionary.net  Code - instructions - information - these are the way the experts are describing DNA. You're saying what?","3":"No it is not a code in the sense that it was coded to do something. People call it a code, but that is not what it is.  We are describing a chemical process after observing it.  These are molecules interacting with each other, not running a predetermined algorithm or something.","4":"But it is a predetermined algorithm, isn't it? Isn't it predetermined that an apple seed will grow into an apple tree and not into an orange tree? Is there any chance, no matter how small, that it will grow into an orange tree?","5":"No.  The DNA is a combination of chemicals that is different for each species.   This combination makes up the genes.   It wasn't predetermined that this is what would happen.   It evolved that way.  So when the proteins form it does so based on the genes.  This is not the same thing as having it predetermined.  Which is why its not great to call it a code.  A code has an intended purpose.   Additionally the offspring of species don't always copy the DNA correctly from the parents and there is a mutation,  which is how we ultimately get new genes, then new species etc.  In the end it is just chemicals reactions happening.  Physics and the laws of the universe  will just cause this to happen."}}
