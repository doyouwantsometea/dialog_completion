Also, cheerleading has been normalised in the sense that it's in all high schools and sporting events so its seen out in the open on a regular basis. I would disagree with any comment that cheerleaders are for the purpous of general excitement but not sexual. If there wasn't a purposeful sexual component, the girls wouldn't have to wear tight skimpy outfits and dance in a sexual manner. Mascots are for general excitement, and look what they wear.","2":"Why is it different if strippers make money?","3":"Good question. Historically and still, people have always stigmatised women using their sexuality to make money. I believe a small part of that is that when men use their sexuality to make money they simply cannot earn as much (get paid less for porn etc...) and this has created gender unfairness that puts women ahead, in a misogynistic society this is unacceptable.  Probably the biggest reason is that many people are still pretty religious and believe that women should save their sexuality for marriage, or better yet, not have one at all, and the fact that we are out flaunting AND making money from it causes the Karen's of the world to get pretty mad.   At the end of the day, stripping and cheerleading are at two different levels of the adult entertainment industry, with stripping obviously being the more 'severe' end. Cheerleaders are suggestive, but don't actually take their clothes off- so this is seen as more socially acceptable.   Source- I'm a stripper.","4":"Thanks for taking the time to answer elaborately\ud83d\udc4d Unrelated question, but why would do men earn less from sex work or rather why is porn more popular amongst men?","5":"No problem. I do believe men earn less because there is generally less of a need for men In sex work. Whilst women defo still watch porn, it's probably not quite as much as men watch porn, and women love to watch other women, which is not the case for a straight man to watch other men. Most straight porn is focussed around the woman. It's pretty much the same for other sex work too, there are some venues where male strippers work, but there is just less of a demand for that.   I wouldn't specifically say that porn is more popular amongst men, when women are truly honest, you'll find that the majority of us do watch porn. The difference is that men are more visual, they prefer to see a naked woman to get aroused, and therefore watch porn on a more regular basis. Women are not as visual as men, so fantasizing works better for us, meaning less of a need for porn."}}
