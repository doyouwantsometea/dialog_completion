How does the world keep turning, so to speak, if work is abolished?","1":"Taxes on automated industries that have little to zero labour costs I would assume.","2":"So, is it fair to say \"from the labor of others\" (i.e  that one engineer working tirelessly to keep the machines whirring)?","3":"Well im assuming the few people who do work in those industries would be compensated well above the ubi.","4":"For the purpose of incentivizing, I'd think it would have to.   So bottom line, the UBI  that provides for the non-workers comes from the automation maintained by other humans?","5":"I\u2019d say that the UBI will be very basic. Pretty much essential items, food, shelter, water, electricity, internet, petrol and phone plan. Anything extra you want will most likely come from some sort of job, even if its a handcraft or service type thing.","6":"I think this is possible in our lifetime."}}
