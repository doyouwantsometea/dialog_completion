I know they \"don't share\", but is that a crack at aristocrats or more of a Buddhist-style respectful reference to the nobility?","1":"Absolutely, they all failed. They tried to use mercury to \"transmute\" the lead.  But the key take away is that there is absolutely nothing scientifically valid about what alchemists were attempting.","2":"Evidently you can  From the wikipedia for: https:\/\/en.m.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Synthesis_of_precious_metals  GoldEdit  Chrysopoeia, the artificial production of\u00a0gold, is the symbolic goal of\u00a0alchemy. Such transmutation is possible in particle accelerators or nuclear reactors, although the production cost is currently many times the market price of gold. Since there is only one stable gold isotope,\u00a0197Au, nuclear reactions must create this isotope in order to produce usable gold.  Gold synthesis in an acceleratorEdit  Gold synthesis in a particle accelerator is possible in many ways. The\u00a0Spallation Neutron Source\u00a0has a liquid mercury target which will be transmuted into gold, platinum, and iridium, which are lower in atomic number than mercury.[citation needed]  Gold synthesis in a nuclear reactorEdit  Gold was synthesized from\u00a0mercury\u00a0by neutron bombardment in 1941, but the\u00a0isotopes of gold\u00a0produced were all\u00a0radioactive.[12]\u00a0In 1924, a Japanese physicist,\u00a0Hantaro Nagaoka, accomplished the same feat.[13]  Gold can currently be manufactured in a nuclear reactor by the\u00a0irradiation\u00a0of either\u00a0platinum\u00a0or mercury.","3":"Not through any economically feasible process nor any process that they were attempting. you can do anything to anything with enough energy.     But that is entirely off topic from your original question. And again I would recommend a review of how the periodic table works.","4":"All processes get cheaper eventually   And even if they couldn't, the question was never whether you could \"profitably\" turn lead into gold, only that you could turn lead into gold   Well, maybe it was for certain people but I'm sure not for others  If you really disliked the current economic system and wanted to turn it all on its head you could just make a shitload of gold and give it to everyone","5":"It was always whether it could be profitable that's literally the only reason to choose gold.  And you can do that now with counterfeit currency, also no current currencies are tied to the gold standard anymore.","6":"I would imagine the idea wasn't that way for everyone (you may also need gold for conductivity purposes), a lot of them may be idealists   I know that most places aren't on the gold standard, but a lot of grumpy older people complain constantly about how \"we need to get back on the gold standard\" and might eventually gain the support of movements of people just by appealing to a return to the gold standard policy   That sort of idea has had a huge impact on politics in the past, wasn't the one party called the Free Silver Party or something?  Anyway, in some ways counterfeit money might actually be harder long-term to pull off, since people get better and better and verifying it (people will probably also get better at faking it)  Or, if a dollar is literally identical in every single way that would also help fight the matter   Eitherway I think we should work om both practices   Although, I don't know if I like the possible \"sneakiness\" of counterfeiting","7":"Alchemists predate electricity by a couple hundred years. There is no reason to transmute anything into specifically gold other than to make money.  And no, thats never ever going to happen, fiat currency it too much better. And fiat currency being harder to counterfeit is exactly why we will never go back.  And its not possible, its certain.","8":"Well, it doesn't matter then  In my opinion, only materials have any value at all, and money is worthless, except possibly for historical or symbolic value (I have a picture of a U.S. quarter 'sculpted' to look like a skull with angel winged-helm that I think is cool)   It matters because, while no one gives a shit about currency except for symbolic reasons, the allure of gold is that, being an extremely long-held cultural substance, it's close to being \"outside the realm of governments\", like I can see some hardcore libertarians liking the idea of it   Especially, after like a huge societal collapse, people would want gold because it sort of carries a long-standing value in a lot of cultures and you could probably even buy off a few uncontacted tribesmen with its shinyness and durability and malleability   My point, I could prevent people from thinking in those terms by flooding the world with gold   What becomes the issue then? We'll just think purely in terms of useful and pleasing materials   Like food, medicine, clothing, construction materials, shelter, etc, a \"post-scarcity\" society","9":"Sure if your hypothetical situation plays out exactly as you have said it would then yes it would happen as you say it would.  Humans don\u2019t generally operate that way in real life though and you have an enormous number of assumptions that are in no way probable. (Like having access to a particle collider in the apocalypse).","10":"Many of the particle colliders are underground in Switzerland which is a country extremely famous for building underground bunkers and wanting to survive through nuclear wars and all other wars","11":"They need an enormous amount of power and expertise though, you cant just flip a Switch and have them run, and you certainly can\u2019t by yourself.","12":"Good thing Switzerland has a shitload of nuclear power   (Bavaria and several other regions in that area might have similar capabilities, and even if not they could just go to Switzerland)","13":"Ya but not autonomous nuclear power. Maybe you are a nuclear physicist and nuclear engineer but you still can\u2019t be in both places at once and do the maintenance","14":"Hmm, we were mainly just talking about regions trying to survive some sort of apocalypse   Yeah the Alps in general seem like a good place for that, (google alpine redoubt or national redoubt, even Mussolini had a pretty good one), and that being said the entirety of the Western World for the most part could be used. Even Svalbard north of Norway is famously thought of as a place to preserve things","15":"Not living things. Its cold and hard to grow crops. They are good at preserving things specifically because living things don't survive there well","16":"Okay well crispr and all the indoor agriculture techniques post-WWII solve all those problems   I mean they're figuring out ways to grow plants in spaceships and terraform Mars I'm sure they can do it underground in Earth","17":"If you have enough infrastructure to do so on a useful scale then you aren't in an apocalypse.","18":"What if the rest of the world on the surface,  not in bunkers, all die in a nuclear war but the Swiss (among others) are safe underground with a fully functioning society   Is that considered an apocalypse?","19":"most would call it science fiction, or total fantasy. If society is functioning then you don't need to make gold."}}
