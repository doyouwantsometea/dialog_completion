It's cost is from physical ingredients.  It is a **product**.  It has value because it is a physical thing.  That seat is a **service**.  It has value because it is providing a opportunity.   An opportunity which you've taken from the airline by lying.  They can't resell it.   They *don't* have an extra dessert, they've got an empty seat.   They can't put that seat back on the shelf, and they can't sell it to someone else because you said you were going to be in it.  How about this: The more full a plane is, the less per seat it costs to operate.   Very simple.   More people to share the fixed hourly cost of fuel, crew, maintenance.....  Consolidating though hubs keeps the planes full and costs go down.  Empty seats means the cost per passenger goes up.         ","2":"I agree that a plane with unsold seats is less profitable.   But if I buy a seat, presumably I'm doing it at market value (more on this later). At that point the airline shouldn't care what I do with it. Taken to the extreme example, if I buy a flight and then miss the plane, the airline has just made exactly the same profit as it would have if I'd flown (actually _slightly_ more because their operation costs will drop slightly from the missing weight).  Now what is \"market value\"? In a perfectly competitive market it's just enough to cover operation costs + additional airline overhead. There is no way the operation costs are lower for the two hop flight, so either there's additional overhead for a single hop flight or the market isn't efficient.","3":"&gt;the airline has just made exactly the same profit as it would have if I'd flown  No, they haven't.    The ticket covers the fixed cost of operating.   Actual revenue comes from selling booze, snacks, credit cards......  The modern business model is pretty much trapping people in a tube and selling them shit.  Empty seats don't buy shit.    ","4":"Interesting, I'd never thought about that. Still, it depends on the airline, on many airlines the services like food and booze are free. Maybe there are some budget airlines, but this article was about Lufthansa which is more mid to high end. ","5":"Bottom line, if it wasn't costing them money, would they care?   The two biggest numbers in Airline Economics are CASM and RASM.  Cost per *Available* Seat Mile and Revenue per *Available* Seat Mile.  How much is produced\/consumed for every seat, every mile.  Here's the thing.   Available is extremely important.  When passengers do the Hidden City, they remove the Available.       With a large airline like Lufthansa or Delta (who operates 4800 flights every day), it aggregates big time.  If *one* person on each flight does a hidden city, that's the equivalent of running 16 empty Boeing 777 flights every day."}}
