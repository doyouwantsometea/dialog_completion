The inverse square law can be used to describe how light spreads from its origin. It\u2019s used extensively in physics and astronomy.","2":"I will have to look up the inverse square law, I just need examples of mathematical properties practically being used for me to get it correctly. Thanks  As far as exponential numbers for radioactive decay, is it something like decay increases at exponential rates in relation to an original number kind of thing? ","3":"So, let\u2019s say we have 1 gram of element X, and every minute it reaches half life(the element has deteriorated to half of what it began with). Basically, the elements mass is cut in half every minute(1,.5,.25,.12.5... until there is literally one atom left and cannot be split any more). This is an exponential function and creates an asymptote.  This graph does a good job at representing how this works:  https:\/\/image.slidesharecdn.com\/7-151102012642-lva1-app6891\/95\/71-77-638.jpg?cb=1446427914","4":"I knew of decay but for some reason never really absorbed it's properties. That's almost too elegantly simple. It makes sense. I just never really saw it as a division in that sort of way but ya how else would it do it decay?  Except for, why do elements decay based on half lives? Why not just decay all at once? Does it have something to do with exposed surface area and how as it shrinks, less of it is exposed allowing particles to actually make it to the surface? So that would be sort of spherical geometry thrown in there as well or am I totally off track? ","5":"Gonna be honest with you, I have no idea what physical properties of an element would affect its decay rate. All I know is that every element has a half life, so that\u2019s what I used.","6":"I just didn't know if it was based on exposure to lighter elements as I would think inner core elements within a ball of say Uranium, would get it's aloha particles stuck within the dense uranium ball, trapping the alpha particles inside until outer atoms decay enough to let it's aloha particles out. It kind of makes sense to me it just seems very strange that it's completely random within certain spectrums as observed to be called it's half life. I didn't know radiation was that weird yet, I thought that was only once you got down to quantum type stuff which I guess aloha particles sort of are? I'm not sure. "}}
