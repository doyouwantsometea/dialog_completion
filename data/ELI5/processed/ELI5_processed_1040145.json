I know they \"don't share\", but is that a crack at aristocrats or more of a Buddhist-style respectful reference to the nobility?","1":"Look at those pictures, follow the arrows, it\u2019s like a flowchart.","2":"Oh cool, so does that mean that, like radon, all of the noble elements will eventually turn into lead?   Could lead ever decay into something else? Is there a half-life of lead?   If lead does decay into something else, it would probably take us billions of years to find out, right?","3":"&gt;Oh cool, so does that mean that, like radon, all of the noble elements will eventually turn into lead?  What makes your ask this question? Helium will never \u201cdecay\u201d into lead, nor will neon etc.   When stars explode a large amount of heavier elements are formed, but again this isn\u2019t the same process.    &gt;Could lead ever decay into something else? Is there a half-life of lead?  I\u2019ve already told you that every single element has radioactive isotopes, see: https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Isotopes_of_lead - note just how many radioactive isotopes lead has, many are decay products from other elements, lead is the heaviest element that still has stable isotopes.   Isotopes are atoms with the same number of protons but different numbers of neutrons. Only specific configurations of protons and neutrons are stable, everything else is unstable and undergoes radioactive decay.   &gt;If lead does decay into something else, it would probably take us billions of years to find out, right?  See the link above    I think checking out some educational YouTube videos would help you. Try this one: https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=fES21E0qebw","4":"So, there will never be a 19th periodic column? Or a 7th or 8th or 9th or 10th periodic row?","5":"There already is a 7th row, and within our lifetimes there likely will be some elements added to the 8th row.   There will never be a 19th group unless IUPAC decides to change the layout of the periodic table (which it won\u2019t do). Just a note on this, the periodic table actually looks like this: https:\/\/encrypted-tbn3.gstatic.com\/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcRJaY9NjvEqGbvN3HSDyyO3GKilL7zoRWTdyTCf-3xYkqXqSvTt0V_onoGqvw (google Wide Periodic Table if that doesn\u2019t work), so technically it has 32 columns but those between groups 2 and 3 aren\u2019t given group numbers.","6":"Hmm   Could there ever be a 9th row?","7":"Probably not.  The last few elements discovered on the 7th row already decay within fractions of seconds, and there\u2019s 50 elements to fill up the 8th row yet to be discovered before the 9th row.","8":"What possible firsthand empirical experience do you have for you to say that \"there's probably no 9th row\"?","9":"Why do you think I have any actual firsthand experience in this field? I read journals and understand the science.   It took about 70 years for the rest of the elements in the 7th row to be created, that was elements 95-118). The last few discovered decay within fractions of seconds. The faster something decays the harder it is to create and then detect.   We will likely see element 120 within 5 years, but getting to element 169 (which would be the first element on the 9th row) is going to to take a lot longer and will need improvements in technology if it can even be created at all.   Is there a reason you are so obsessed with this?","10":"It's important   Part of the beauty and attraction of the original periodic table is that when Mendelev first showed it, later on a lot of his predicted things came true   So, it's fascinating   It makes a subject that can be annoying and boring and dry in high school, and widely hated, fascinating  Okay, well, if 119 can be found in 5 years, can #10,000 be found in like 700 years?   Plus you said it took 70 years for the 7th row elements to be found, but even that's a huge improvement when you think of how it took thousands of years for a good portion of the elements to be recognized","11":"Is it really important though? None of these elements have real world applications. It\u2019s mostly a dick waving contest.   If it\u2019s boring in school it\u2019s mostly because of boring teachers or boring curricula, or both. Chemistry is an amazing science because it\u2019s so essential to everything around us.   If it takes 5 years to discover element 119, and even if it takes 5 years past that for each other element you\u2019re looking at nearly 50000 years. And that\u2019s a theoretical number pulled out of nowhere with no basis in reality. There\u2019s other problems to overcome, like heavier elements needing electrons to travel at faster than the speed of light and somehow overcoming the repulsion of protons in the nucleus."}}
