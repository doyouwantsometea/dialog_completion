It\u2019s a lot about fitting in with the culture. I know a handful of \u201cstraight\u201d guys who were \u201cturned\u201d by my gay friends and in a year these previously straight-acting men are the gayest of the bunch.","2":"Thank you for not attacking my question and seeing it for the curiosity it is. I do believe culture and fitting in does play a large role here. But I haven't run into any flamboyant heterosexual males.","3":"I guess we\u2019d have to look at straight males that were raised by really flamboyant parents and see how they turned out.","4":"I dont know if that would be considered cruel and unusual if done purposefully. But undoubtedly there should be 2 flamboyant men that could care for a child better than at least some heterosexual couples.","5":"Yea we\u2019ll have to do these experiments underground \ud83d\ude05"}}
