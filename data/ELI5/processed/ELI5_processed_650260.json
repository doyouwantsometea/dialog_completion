Flu transmission has been dramatically decreased as the protective measures for COVID- distancing, masks, quarantine- are also effective at preventing the spread of influenza.","2":"How come COVID cases hit new highs every day if these measures work?","3":"COVID is much, much more infectious than influenza. So it will spread much easier even with preventative measures in place. COVID-19 preventative measures work, but are more effective on influenza numbers simply because influenza is easier to prevent and less infectious in the first place.   Additionally as others have stated, influenza vaccinations are reaching record highs since the pandemic began, and that certainly contributes to the lower overall influenza numbers.","4":"So is influenza gone forever? 44000 -&gt; 47 -&gt; ??? next step is 0 no? Have we finally beat influenza?","5":"No, certainly not. Influenza, and its various causative virii, is a global disease that has already thwarted attempts to eradicate it, due to its relatively low infectiousness. The ability of influenza to rapidly mutate and generate new strains means we're unlikely to see it gone for some time.   Our preventative measures for COVID-19 have significantly hampered its spread and ability to infect and kill humans, but we haven't seen the end of it.","6":"How does it thwart it?   If it has low infection rate and we have 47 cases we can handle it, no?","7":"47 confirmed cases, and those are just the people you've tested. Influenza is difficult to get rid of because it's perfectly tuned its infectiousness.   For every 3 people it infects, one of them won't develop symptoms and continue to spread it to others. Those that do develop symptoms can become highly contagious even before symptoms become apparent. And of that group, some might only develop mild symptoms and continue going about their normal lives-spreading it further.  This means tracing influenza outbreaks is extremely difficult to accomplish, and it's frankly easier to treat someone who already has it than actively try to wipe it out.   Influenza isn't especially lethal- it's mainly deadly to the young, elderly and immunocompromised- like many diseases.   COVID-19 is very lethal compared to influenza. It can kill someone from any age group."}}
