When volatility is extremely high the chance that they can find it for the price the buyer paid goes down. Clearing houses don't want to take on this risk so they require collateral that the brokerage must put up. High volatility = higher collateral requirements.   This process is separate from the buyer buying a stock and their funds must be separated from this process. This is federal law. These brokerages don't have a choice here. They either let you buy and risk going bankrupt or restrict buying.","2":"But wouldn't the sell side (from a retail investors perspective) of robinhood have those same deposit \/ collateral requirements?","3":"There are 2 important differences on the sell side for RH. First is rh knows where the shares are when you sell them(in a cash settled account) so the probability of failure to deliver goes down and is also more predictable.  Second, and much more importantly, locking out selling forces holding, potentially causing unrealized losses where the investor would have otherwise sold. The same isn't true on the buy side. Not allowing buying only limits losses\/gains. Limiting selling locks them in.","4":"What is the source of the insecurity requiring a deposit? Is it coming from leveraged positions? A possibility that the counter party never had the stock in the first place?  Also, this seems like a serious flaw with their business model. When counter party risk is higher on one end constantly, there will be moments when the brokerage will have to accommodate for that risk. It makes me wonder...  Do other brokerages have this flaw?","5":"They just simply don't have the capital that the big brokers do. Vanguard, Fidelity and Schwab did not have to place any restrictions on buying because they can afford the collateral. This is the price of free trading, a shitty brokerage."}}
