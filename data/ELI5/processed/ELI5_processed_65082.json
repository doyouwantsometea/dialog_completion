The computer processes a bunch of numbers, and then sends values to your screen in the format [R,G,B] where R, G, and B are 3 numbers that range from 0 to 255 or from 00000000 to 11111111 in binary. The Monitor turns on each pixel to the corresponding value (take a magnifying glass and look at your monitor, there really are tiny red, green, and blue lights making up the screen!) and that is interpreted by your brain as an image.","2":"Shouldn't that limit resolution? And how does the monitor know that the numbers mean the color?","3":"Why would that limit the resolution? You just send a set of 3 numbers for each pixel. For 1080p, thats 1920 x 1080 pixels x 3 numbers x 60 frames per second=373,248,000 numbers per second, or in more familiar units 3.73 MegaBytes per Second. That's what a MegaByte *is* 1 million 8bit numbers. Considering most PCs today have GigaBytes of memory and Terabytes of storage--1000 and 1million times larger respectively--video display isn't that taxing.  The monitor ultimately just turns lights on and off. The final number goes to each red\/green\/blue subpixel and controls a power supply, regulating how much voltage it puts out, which ultimately controls how much light is allowed through or blocked.","4":"How does it send to each? How does it do shades? How many transistors are we talking about here?","5":"&gt;How does it send to each?  Lots and lots of wires.  &gt;How does it do shades?  As I said, each number ranges from 0 to 255, where 0 is \"black\" and 255 is \"as bright as it can\".  &gt;How many transistors are we talking about here?  Tens of billions. At this point, transistors in modern chips have features 5 nanometers across, that's only about 45 silicon atoms across. They really pack them in.","6":"What's the difference between digital and analog, then, if they both work like this?","7":"Digital devices are designed to produce 1 of only 2 states ON and OFF. These are meant to be completely distinct, with no in between.  Analog devices still use transistors, but they allow for many shades of grey between 0 current an maximum current.   Transistors work like switches, with current flowing from the Source to the Drain, controlled by the Gate. This lets a tiny voltage at the Gate control a much larger current, like how a tiny valve can completely shut off a pipe.   Digital devices are designed to only have their gate ON or OFF. Analog devices can take a range of voltages through the gate that gradually turns on the current flowing through the device. This lets a tiny signal be amplified into a much bigger one, wiggling the \"valve\" creates a much stronger wiggle in the current through the \"pipe\", and this can turn the tiny electromagnetic field of a radio wave into something you can hear, with a little external power supplied by something else to drive the main current.","8":"How does a digital produce only one of two?","9":"The output from one transistor is strong enough to completely max out the Gate of another.","10":"Why was this not possible in analog?","11":"Its not *impossible* its just not what its meant to do. Digital isn't \"better\" than analog, they just do completely different things. You use analog to handle real-world signals that can take a range of values, you use digital to do math and process information. Ultimately, you translate back and forth as needed, like in the case of a monitor taking a digital signal to produce an analog image.","12":"So analog has more than 1 and 0? How does that work","13":"&gt;Analog devices still use transistors, but they allow for many shades of grey between 0 current an maximum current.

This lets a tiny voltage at the Gate control a much larger current, like how a tiny valve can completely shut off a pipe. Analog devices can take a range of voltages through the gate that gradually turns on the current flowing through the device.   Remember, 1 and 0 are just what we call ON and OFF. Its all a matter of how much current is flowing. We get to choose how to interpret that.","14":"But what do they do?","15":"I just told you.","16":"How do you interpret something that's neither on nor off?"}}
