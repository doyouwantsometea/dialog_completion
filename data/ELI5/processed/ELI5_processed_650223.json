Who does this happen too? Never in my life","2":"Lucky. Common occurrence where I\u2019m at","3":"Sounds awful","4":"My level is rarely \u201cawful\u201d it is just incredibly annoying and during flu\/cold\/COVID seasons it\u2019s hard to tell the difference of something infections and your body being a spazz","5":"When I've gone down to Austin my entire face and sinuses are full of pressure and it is awful. I'm assuming it's like that, but I could just be a baby because it never happens otherwise. Guess I am lucky!","6":"Ah a Texan? I\u2019m guess you don\u2019t have overly large fluctuations in temps that happen quickly? I live in the Midwest. There are days you need your AC in the morning and your Furnace by afternoon. Sometimes, I hate it here lmao","7":"No I live in the rockies\/southwest. We have a lot of fluctuations but I haven't spent too much time in the midwest so maybe it's nothing in comparison. Texas is drastically different, I may just be allergic to something there idk","8":"Ahh I see :)"}}
