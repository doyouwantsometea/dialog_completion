There is no American exceptionalism or the opposite of it here.","2":"Hello. Did my question get removed please? I am confused... As usual :-)","3":"Hi there, no worries! Your post was removed under rule 6 (see the sidebar!).","4":"Oh I am sorry. Actually I asked the question because when I went in holiday to the US I had to complete an immigration form that asked if I was black, white, etc. I didn't understand the question or the reason for it so I was looking for the background\/justification. I am sorry if you think it was intended for some bad reason. It wasn't. I should delete the question. I didn't mean to upset anyone. Sorry.","5":"No worries :) I did not assume bad faith, just applying the rules. It has been removed already so deleting\/not deleting doesn't make that much difference haha"}}
