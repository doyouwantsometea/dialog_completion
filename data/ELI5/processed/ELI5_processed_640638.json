They are caused by a small misfiring in the brain.","2":"That sounds a lot like what it is. I'll look more into it.","3":"It\u2019s not fully understood what causes them but I think of them as mini-seizures. This is not scientific but my personal theory is that something goes wrong in the central nervous system but there are additional safety mechanisms that make sure no full blown seizure occurs. Since myoclonus is a common side-effect in epilepsy I\u2019m thinking that a person with only essential myoclonus has some overlapping characteristics but not all of them which prevents anything else from happening but these involuntary little jerks. They usually do not progress or get worse at all but I wonder if someone who has them may be more likely to suffer an actual seizure if many triggers align such as sleep deprivation\/alcohol\/bright lights\/drugs. This is all speculation.","4":"Thats a really strong theory. Since I'm pretty sure not everyone experiences these shivers do you know what type of biological difference would cause a person to have them","5":"It may be related to chemical imbalances  of neurotransmitters (serotonin and GABA) in the part of the brain that controls movement. This is still an active field of study."}}
