Didn\u2019t have to. Wasn\u2019t part of my curriculum.  Yes, believe it or not, there are many many people that work with numbers every single day and actually have no idea why they do steps a, b, c and d to arrive at their answer. They just follow the instructions that were given to them. I am partially one of them. However, I\u2019m trying to set myself apart by understanding step a through d. Computers allow people to not know how they get the number their management is asking for.   I\u2019d be willing to guess many people that work at banks dealing with mortgages, aside from the actuator, don\u2019t actually know what they\u2019re doing.   \u2018Murica!","5":"Congrats on taking things into your own hands.","6":"Thanks. Gotta separate myself from the rest of the philistines somehow."}}
