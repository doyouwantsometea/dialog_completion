The term \"race\" is used to refer to a very vague concept, which is informed by genetics, but also by culture, geographic location, physical appearance, history and politics.  \"Breed\" refers solely to genetics (and possibly to appearance as well).  Historically, the term \"breed\" *has* been applied to human races.  Mostly by eugenicists looking for a pseudoscientific way to justify their racist beliefs, by claiming that all these things which make up a \"race\" can be derived from genetics (they obviously cannot).  Additionally, the term \"breed\" has connotations of livestock (because livestock are bred to produce desirable traits).  This is another reason why \"breed\" has *historically* been used to apply to humans (to justify slavery and other racist policies), and why it typically is *not* used today.","2":"You say they aren\u2019t the same, that\u2019s fair, but that still doesn\u2019t explain why race only applies to us. Why not to animals too?","3":"Because animals do not have culture, history or politics.","4":"I would contest the notion that race has only to do with culture, history, or politics. Maybe it can be used that way, but there is a biological connotation that I believe you're avoiding.  If we are not to use the term race, I would like to hear your substitution. When compared to the word 'breed', I think race is actually less offensive.","5":"What?  Where did I say not to use the term race?  Also, in my top-level answer, the first thing I said was that race is genetic.  Maybe read the comments you're replying to.","6":"No need to be like that, I did read your comment and I appreciate the time you took to write it.  I asked you why animals don\u2019t have different races, and I suppose I misunderstood you when you replied with \u201cbecause they don\u2019t have history or culture\u201d.  I think what you should\u2019ve done instead of getting annoyed that I misunderstood you was to explain in further detail what you meant. Maybe you meant to say that animals don\u2019t have different races because they don\u2019t match all of the criterion of race, only some of them.   I think we might be in agreement on the subject to be honest, but instead of having the patience to clarify things for me, who might not be as bright as you, you accused me of not having read your comments. It was an honest mistake on my part, so I will apologize, it just wasn\u2019t as clear to me as it was to you. That\u2019s why i\u2019m on this sub in the first place."}}
