This is false. The majority think that time is continuous, not chopped up into moments of Planck time.  &gt;Time as we experience it must have existed after the big bang, but at those early moments, only a few Planck time units after the big bang, space was not yet space. It was a massive ball of unimaginable amounts of energy,  This is also false. I'm not even sure what this is supposed to mean.  When you rewind the clock, things get closer and closer together until at some point, the energy is packed together so tightly that spacetime has to be described with quantum mechanics, but there are numerous problems with formulating such a theory.  &gt;I am hope full that when a nuclear clock is finally created (much more accurate than an atomic clock) we may start to unwrap some of the mysteries of time.  A nuclear clock also has nothing to do with the nature of time. It simply allows us to measure time more accurately, though its error will still be many times greater than a Planck time.","2":"Planck time was mentioned here several times, but what it really is? How it is defined?","3":"Planck time is the time it takes for light to travel one Planck length.  A Planck length is the resolution of a photon energetic enough to create a black hole, which basically means you can't see anything smaller than it.  None of this means they are the smallest possible length scales, just that they are scales at which quantum gravity becomes important.","4":"One photon can create a blackhole? Wow, I mean, it sounds logical, but I've never thought of it.","5":"Yeah. A really small one though. Black holes are about how much energy is in some amount of space.","6":"But do photons even have size? They aren't just points?","7":"This is complicated. It's easiest to think of them as waves, but more accurately, they are waves of points.  The energy is proportional to the frequency of the wave, and resolution is also proportional to the frequency, and so we define the Planck length as the length at which the energy of a photon is high enough to make a black hole.","8":"Ok, thanks, I definitely should read more about it!"}}
