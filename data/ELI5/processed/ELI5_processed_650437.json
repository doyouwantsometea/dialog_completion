Your pants is the backbeat","2":"I am completely at a loss as to what this is a reference to.","3":"It's a house music beat. Say it out loud.","4":"My older son has tried to explain house music to me. Given that I was dancing in clubs in the 1980s, one would expect it to come to me more easily. What would you recommend I read to grasp what a 'house music beat' is?","5":"Have you asked uncle Google or aunt YouTube? If you really want to read there's a book titled Electronic Dance Music Grooves. It has loads of examples of drum sequences for various genres.","6":"I've found definitions on Wikipedia, but they're such that they are understandable once I've learned the meaning of the term elsewhere.   Also, drum sequences might as well be quadratic equations  - no, that's not quite correct. I've acquired an understanding of what quadratic equations *are*, while drum sequences are still just a series of sounds.   My son once tried to explain the difference between dubstep and drum and bass to me. I'm not sure which of us found it a more painful experience."}}
