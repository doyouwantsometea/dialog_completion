You may not have been able to experience this side if it however. I\u2019m very close (consider them framily) with some of the people I met and went to college with and still converse with people I went to HS with.  It\u2019s all about your experience going through these institutions. While the institution itself is a stepping stone it\u2019s about the people you meet and grow relationships with that make the difference. It\u2019s OK if that doesn\u2019t happen, but for many these connections are more than just \u201ctransactions\u201d.","2":"I completely understand and value friendships made in HS and College, but I guess I've never felt I owed thanks or respect to either for having made them? Particularly a place I paid to attend.     But, that's absolutely just me. I can totally understand if someone respects or feels grateful to an institution for giving them a place to make these friendships and connections.","3":"Well I think you\u2019re mixing a few things in the question you\u2019re asking. You have the statement \u201cwhy do people put so much into the relationships at college\/HS\u201d and then what you really want to know about are the fundraising events. Both are very different. For HS donations\/fundraisers can help fund things at the school so that other children can also attend or do things there. It\u2019s the same thing for College, fundraising is a way for the school to make money to fund new infrastructure and other things. People donate money for many reasons some being they want to allow other children experience things they experienced or help expand programs that are beneficial. Education is one everyone thinks should be funded, but when it comes to funding it\u2019s difficult to for people to give up money to actually do it.","4":"&gt;Perhaps I should have phrased the question better then. Sorry!      &gt;   &gt;I absolutely understand putting effort into friendships and relationships, no matter where they were established.      &gt;   &gt;I was referencing specifically emotional connections and culture surrounding the school itself. Or perhaps my trying to separate the two is an issue, as they seem inseparable to some?","5":"They attach these emotional connections and culture because of the human connections and experiences (the two are intertwined).   If you\u2019re referring to the money aspect some of it is the same, other times it\u2019s insuring that others get to have those experiences that you did (at least a chance).   I\u2019m not sure what you\u2019re looking for now to be honest. Are you looking for why people donate money via fundraisers to schools that they attended or go to networking events (like alumni functions). Or are you looking for why people put such significance on the \u201ccollege\/school\u201d experience (some of which I touched on)."}}
