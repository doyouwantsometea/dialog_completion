The company owns physical goods (land, equipment, cash, etc) stock is ownership of that company and thus ownership of the goods owned by the company.","2":"but in most cases, you don't get to sell any of those possessions though.","3":"No, instead, you can sell the stock you bought for money. Which, is in essense selling the partial ownership of those assets. It's not really different than you selling the physical goods yourself. You buy stock (partial ownership of physical goods), then you sell that ownership.","4":"but that's really my question. If you have partial ownership, then why aren't you getting dividends?   Jeff Bezos is only rich because people buy the shares he sells. If literally no one bought his shares, he would only be worth his paycheck.","5":"Because the company can either reinvest that money into the company, ideally so the company becomes more valuable. Or, it can pay out dividends. The decision comes from whether the stockholders (in aggregate) think the company can use that money to make the company more valuable than what the stockholder can normally do.   Using you example earlier, if you made hundreds of your blood paintings, you wouldn't be rich, because no one would buy them. It's basic economics at that point, partial ownership of Amazon is more valued than your paintings are.   Amazon continues to expand its services and logistics network with the money it could spend on dividends. If it paid out dividends, it wouldn't be building as many new distribution centers and becoming more valuable to its customers who buy things from amazon. By doing so, it makes amazon ownership more valuable."}}
