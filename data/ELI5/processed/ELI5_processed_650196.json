Alcoholism actually remaps the brain and causes dependency. Meaning you may actually die if you abruptly stop  drinking. It creates a response system similar to narcotics or nicotine: it needs it to function properly.","2":"Why isn\u2019t it an addiction and not a disease. Calling it a disease relinquishes culpability of the individual.","3":"It is both. Addiction IS a disease process. That's what I'm saying. You are reliant on a substance to  function that you don't actually need to function. That's a disease state. Who cares if you can blame them or not? Treat it and move on. People only get bent out of shape on addiction because they want to. Do you get mad at COPD patients even though the number 1 cause is smoking? What about type 2 diabetics from being overweight? That's their fault too.","4":"Yeah all that shit you mentioned at the end is their fault. Also why isn\u2019t smoking a disease?","5":"Smoking isn't a disease. Being addicted to nicotine is a disease. Drinking isn't a disease. Being addicted to alcohol is a disease. It's when you cross into dependence or when it impacts your life is when you are now part of a disease process. I have a drink or two during the month, but I'm not an addict. That's the key point. It doesn't change my life around it. Society has just decided that alcoholism and drug use are addictions, but fuck you for it. Even though there are quite a few disease states of choice.","6":"What other things that people are addicted to are now classified as a disease? Does card collecting count?","7":"Addiction is the disease. What you are addicted to doesn't matter in terms of being a disease itself","8":"So if you\u2019re diagnosed addicted to collecting cards you\u2019re entitled to the medical and financial support to the same level of an alcoholic?","9":"Well, not really because there needs to be organizations and such for funding. Gambling and alcohol and drugs all get attention and funding, but addiction is a disease."}}
