Time itself \u201cstarted\u201d there, as time is a property of the universe - not something outside of it (we know that because we can measure how time changes based on speed and mass). So... the question itself doesn\u2019t actually make sense. Nothing needed to spark it, because time and causality didn\u2019t exist \u201cbefore\u201d in order to start it.  It\u2019s mind melting and totally alien thinking, but the concept of causality itself just... can\u2019t apply. We know how long it\u2019s been since it started, but there was no \u201cbefore\u201d it started.","2":"Well said and well reasoned. Thank you for that. You\u2019re right it is alien thinking because I\u2019m trying to understand where all of that \u201cstuff\u201d came from but, based on the point you raised, I\u2019m applying linear thinking to a non-linear question.","3":"Singularities are so weird, as they\u2019re essentially just points where every concept and \u201claw\u201d we know of stop applying. Every advance we have made in understanding let\u2019s us go a little bit deeper; but it always breaks down again. I don\u2019t expect we can ever know enough not to be left with some question or paradox.  I still can\u2019t properly wrap my head around the speed of light when \u201criding the photon\u201d. It took 13billion years for the light to get to us from the Big Bang. It spent 13billion years moving. But, when you move at light speed, time changes. So from the perspective of the photon... it\u2019s instant? No time elapses from its perspective? It is everywhere everytime all at once? Brain melting.","4":"I\u2019m somehow dumber than I was an hour ago. So, if I\u2019m understanding your point, it\u2019s possible there is no origin in the construct of what we understand as an origin? Meaning, I understand a baby came from it\u2019s mother, etc., but there may not be that sort of concept with the origin of this...everything? Am I ball-parking your comment\u2019s intent?","5":"Kind of. There is an origin - we know it was about 13billion years ago, and I believe we have some models for the Big Bang that work down to a few seconds after it started... but, ultimately, if there wasn\u2019t a \u201cbefore\u201d the start, that means there can\u2019t have been *a cause* of the Big Bang as the very concept of \u201ccausing something\u201d in itself relies on there being *a before* state.  It\u2019s likely we will be able to get closer and closer to \u201cthe start\u201d, but much like when we travel half the distance from A to B, then half again... etc... we approach B, but never get to it.","6":"That\u2019s an excellent point. Halving the distance means you\u2019ll never get there. The why, how, and what has always thrown me for a loop with this question. I wish there was some cosmic repository with all the answers to all the questions, presented in a way we\u2019d understand. I get that the unknowable seems more alluring by nature of it being unknown. However, this isn\u2019t who shot JFK (which is an important question) - this is the question of everything and it\u2019s both intoxicating and frustrating.   Thank you very much for all your replies. You presented your thoughts in an easily digestible manner and clearly know a thing or two about a thing or two. I appreciate you and your time.","7":"Also, I can highly recommend the now very old \u201ca brief history of time\u201d by Stephen Hawking, if this sort of thing is interesting to you.","8":"I\u2019ve wanted to read that for ages but was intimidated by it. Somehow I thought I\u2019d never possibly understand what he was writing. Maybe I should finally check it out. Yet again, great tip.","9":"It\u2019s intended \u201cfor the layman\u201d, and if you\u2019re asking these sorts of questions, you\u2019re the audience he had in mind for it. I seem to remember it being much less dry than I had expected, and gave a glimpse into his sense of fun too. I\u2019ve actually just re-ordered it after this conversation, as I lost my copy years ago. Must have lent it out at some point!  I can also really recommend \u201cThe man who mistook his wife for a hat\u201d by Oliver Sacks - totally not physics related; but absolutely fascinating in a similar manner.","10":"I\u2019m going to have to do the same. I used the have a respectable library. They seem to have mostly disappeared. Oliver Sacks is the doctor they based Awakenings on, right? I\u2019d be interested in what he has to say.","11":"Yep, that\u2019s the one. The book I mentioned is a series of his cases (anonymised) which give insights to how the brain seems to work based on how different injuries effect people.","12":"I think it\u2019s fair to say my psyche has been injured from trying to understand this. It was so nice reading your replies. You were very helpful. Thank you very much.","13":"Thank you for a fun conversation :)"}}
