There are some companies loosely termed \"cash cows\" - they have a steady business earning profits but cannot really expand very much (it is usually an old industry or one that is saturated). These companies will return some of their profits every year to the investors through dividend. Typically, these companies will have slower moving share prices.   Most high growth companies use their profits to reinvest in the business to grow it faster. These companies (usually tech but not necessarily so) are deemed \"high growth potential\" and will not pay dividends but possibly provide the investor with faster valuation growth (ie higher share price growth) but at higher risk potentially.  It depends on the investor - for an older investor, who does not want to have their investments fluctuate and can live off a 3-4% dividend (or less) then they might prefer a dividend bearing stock. Others, who might have more risk tolerance might prefer a high growth - high risk stock.","2":"But will they eventually pay dividends? Because if they end up never paying dividends, and share prices are high, wouldn't they just end up as a white elephant?  In reply to another comment, this really just seems like an MLM strategy, where only a few get rich, while the rest are just waiting for their turn.","3":"Some do, some don't. There is no rule here. Not sure what you mean by \"white elephant\"? There are many firms that have grown and existed for dozens of years now and pay very little to no dividend - you might know some of them Amazon, Google, Facebook, Tesla. If you purchased several thousand dollars of their shares 20 years ago (not Tesla) you'd be a millionaire several times over.   It doesn't take much to begin.","4":"but the only works if other people buy it. It's like an MLM, in the form of people buying the company's \"products\" (in this case shares) with the hope of selling it for more later.","5":"Possibly, I don't get your intent. Walmart (for example) buys stuff at a low price and sells it at a higher price - this is called profit and is what businesses do.   If you think of investing as a business, you buy low and sell high and make a profit? Why is this an MLM? (MLM's mean something completely different) Your cash preference, risk tolerance, liquidity preference etc determine what and when to buy and sell. Everyone has a different set of needs. So long as the market is reasonably transparent and accessible, it doesn't appear unreasonable.   Companies exist to create value - that value is determined by society (the people who buy and use their product). If they aren't successful then they won't make money. If they do make money, their value increases. If you own that company, you'll make money when that value increases.","6":"If I go to walmart and buy a chicken, I have obtained something inherently valuable (food). Now, I may cook the chicken and resell it for profit as well, but that's because I have created value (by cooking the chicken).  Now, let's say I have a chicken, and I sell you an IOU for 25% of that chicken, but at the same time, you cannot use that IOU to reclaim 25% of that chicken, and its only purpose is to say you have own 25% of the chicken.  So what value does that IOU (essentially the same as a share) carry?","7":"Take any example of a company share. I'll use Apple. You purchased some of their shares in 2005. Their employees designed a product called an Iphone, marketed it, made it and sold millions of it and continued to innovate making their company valued at hundreds of billions of dollars because of the money it makes. You own a part of the effort the company put into this. How is this different from you buying a chicken, cooking it and selling it for more? If you sold someone a 25% share of your chicken company, then that person is entitled to 25% of the value of the company. You no longer own 100% of that company. If all you did was sell one chicken, then you need to give that person 25% of the profits from that chicken. A share isn't an IOU - it means that the owner of the share is part-owner of the company.","8":"but what does it mean to be part-owner if you're not getting dividends (part of the profits)?","9":"There are issues with corporate governance, but if someone owned 25% of the shares of a large public company (unrealistic mostly) they'd almost certainly be on the Board of Directors (BOD) and very likely the Chairman of the Board. The BOD (representatives of the shareholders - mostly large shareholders themselves) decide on the dividend policy. It is, in theory, the shareholders that decide whether or not the company pays a dividend, management can advise but the board decides.   So if a company doesn't pay dividends it is usually a joint consensus of the management and the owners (shareholders) of the company. Of course, if someone owns 0.00001% of the shares of the company, they probably cannot expect to have much say (other than voting at the AGM) in the major strategic decisions of the company.","10":"yeah, so I feel like buying non-dividend shares is more of a winner takes all system. You either buy enough to gain some control or you shouldn't bother, since you own something you have no control over, which really feels more like a gamble, though safer.","11":"The beauty of the free market is that you can make any investment decision based on any set of beliefs you have. All I can attempt is to explain how it works. If your conclusion is that A is better than B, then so be it.   It is simply odd that you make such a huge distinction between dividend and non-dividend paying shares. But you are free to do so. Hopefully if you ever intend to invest, you research the return history of various companies in recent history and validate your belief (dividend etc) against empirical performance.   At the end of the day, investing is mostly about making as much money as you can at an acceptable risk in a timeframe that fits you.","12":"True. It's not much different to buying Nike shoes or Louis Vuitton bags and reselling them for a higher price. As long as someone is willing to buy."}}
