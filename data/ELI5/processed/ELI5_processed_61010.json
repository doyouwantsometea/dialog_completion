Specifically a flu shot.","1":"Vaccinations train your body on how to fight diseases. It basically gives your body the \"I have seen that one before\" power over sickness.  However you need to be kind of healthy to get vaccinated. There are certain conditions under which you cannot receive vaccines (you are very young, your immune system is gone due to birth defects or cancer treatment,. ..).  These people rely on an effect called \"herd immunity\".  Basically you die if you get infected but you never get infected because everyone around you is vaccinated. This prevents a disease from spreading.  Unfortunately to achieve herd immunity roughly 98% of the population have to be vaccinated.  So for me personally as a vaccinated, healthy adult it makes no difference if you are vaccinated or not. For my little daughter or my cancer stricken relative it is a life or death situation (unfortunately quite literally).  Therefore if you are healthy and able to get a shot, go get a shot. It will safe someone's life.  (Kind of the same principle as you clear a lane for an ambulance. Yes it is inconvenient for you for 30 seconds but you help safe a live and you would expect others to do it for you).","2":"So you're saying that if I get the flu then I'm actually putting other people's lives at risk who aren't able to get vaccinated?","3":"Yes","4":"Thanks for clarifying this. I've never had the flu.","5":"Good in you :)  Please get vaccinated for everything that is available. It helps protect your community.","6":"To be honest all I hear about is flu vaccines. What else is available?","7":"Measles, chicken pox and a whole range of other diseases.  Ask your doctor, they will gladly give you an overview.","8":"Do most people have a doctor? Because I don't, I haven't seen a doctor in years outside of an ER and that was for injuries.","9":"Depends on where you come from. In Germany you have a general practitioner that is \"your doctor\". It gets documented with your health insurance.  In Norway you get a doctor assigned and are not allowed to go to a different one, except for emergencies (afaik)."}}
