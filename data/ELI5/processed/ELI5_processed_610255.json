It had nothing to do with smells.  Bodies smell.","2":"Oh but it does. It is the main point of it's existance.","3":"Are you high?","4":"Are you? I think you can't differentiate between the function of the kidneys and the bladder. You dont need a bladder from a physiological standpoint per se.","5":"Why are you focusing on the kidney part LOL and no I am not high I am at work.  I'm over this, you seem like you are trolling.  Look shit up before posting please.","6":"I quote: \"You need a bladder to empty the liquids you drink\""}}
