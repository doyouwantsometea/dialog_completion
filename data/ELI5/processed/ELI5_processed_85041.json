You can take college courses that explain the concepts. As far as i know, they don't teach basic economics in highschool (something they absolutely should).","2":"Let's say you own 10% of amazon. That doesn't suddenly give you right to sell 10% of Amazon's assets though.","3":"No, it suddenly gives you the right to 10% of Amazon's ownership, in the aggregate.   Use a small business for example with 2 owners. You and me, for example. If i want the money out of the business and you want to grow the business, you wouldn't let me sell the store front, as it would cripple the business, even if the office space is half the value....","4":"sure, but if I had 10% of a business, I would presumably be able to receive 10% of the profits also.","5":"That is one way to look at it, yes. That's why dividends exist. It's not the only way to look at it though. Because without the business keeping that profit to invest back into the business, it could never grow, giving up increasing value in the future.  Take manufacturing, say that you build widgets, each widget nets x profit. That x value can be given out as dividends or it can be used to increase the number of widgets we make and sell. So, by giving up x now and letting the company build another production line of widgets, next year, i get 3x (2x for 2 years of profits, plus x for the new production line of widgets they made)","6":"so that's fine, but what if the company never hands out dividends? The company grows and grows, but what is the purpose of your shares besides selling? Because if you own something that in reality doesn't do anything until you sell it, then where is the value?","7":"Why would there need to be another purpose other than selling it? If i buy antique or collectors items, they don't pay dividends, i only get cash value when i see them. Likewise, whenever i buy most things (like as a business owner buying inventory to sell) they own their inventory, but get zero value until it is sold.","8":"Because you need to view your shares as like partly owning a goose that lays golden eggs. If you own 10% of that goose, that means you're entitled to 10% of whatever eggs that goose lays.   If others want to reinvest the golden eggs into the goose, but you want to keep it, you should be able to keep it.","9":"\"Because you need to\".... then only buy stocks that give our regular dividends.   I understand why you want dividends, but the conversation has moved from you don't understand why some stocks don't do dividends to crying that some don't, those are fundamentally different concepts.   Your way of viewing stocks is valid and some stocks share your point of view, but it isn't the ONLY valid way to view stocks. In the end, the decision to pay dividends is based on the board of directors, which the stockholders can vote on...","10":"But why should it be the board's decision of whether it pays stockholders or not?   Why isn't it that if you decide to not take dividends, you would gain more stocks (based on company performance) because you're technically \"reinvesting\" your dividends?","11":"Because the board enacts the will of the stock holders, based on stockholder voting. The idea of having tens of thousands of people try to run a company (each stock holder) would be a surefire way to end any company. Thus, like government, people are appointed to the board based on the majority of stock ownership.   I have no idea how you think just splitting stock would somehow be a solution for that, as every single stock issued dilutes the rest....   At the end of the day, if you don't like a company that doesn't pay dividends, don't buy their stock. No one is forcing you to buy it...","12":"Dilution is not necessarily a bad thing. 10% of 10 million is worth more than 20% of 1 million.  And yeah, I'm not forced to buy stocks, but if your ownership of a business only has value when sold, it sounds like a good recipe for a ponzi scheme or MLM.","13":"Then you don't really understand either of those terms....","14":"Mlm works by selling you products which you then go on to sell to others, how is that not much different to an ipo?  And a ponzi scheme requires others to keep joining so it can keep the cycle going, although in  this case a company is generally self sufficient, but at same time isnt obligated to buy your shares if you decide to sell. Which means they can  sell high and buy low by just waiting for a stock market crash or recession.","15":"By that definition of mlm, then every wholesaler that sells to walmart, target etc is a mlm. In that case, mlms make the world function......  A ponzi scheme requires there to be an exaggerated or novalue behind the product being bought or sold. If everyone just held their stocks, (thus demand for buying stocks just froze), then people would sell their stocks (potentially liquidating the company) or stock holders would then demand dividends. Either way, there is value behind the product (ownership) being exchanged...  And yes, companies do typically buy back stock during recession (the opposite of dilluting) to manage stock prices, which is based on the majority of stock holders decision.","16":"The difference with wholesalers, is that there is intrinsic value, i.e. Food, water, etc. Stocks don't have intrinsic value. And there's competition for the same objecrlt, e.g. Tomatoes. MLMs don't have competition, because you buy it from the company only.  And company buying shares back during recessions is what I mean by non-dividend shares as not being not intrinsically valuable. People only sell things that have less value while being held. So non-dividend shares are valuable like art. Whatever the buyers decides.","17":"So wholesalers.   A) there is intrinsic value, as you have partial ownership of material goods (what the company owns)   B) the competition is between companies, aka you can buy that companies stock or this companies stock. The stock values are extremely competitive within an industry.  It really feels like I'm helping you write a highschool econ paper...  Also given the way these things are being spread out, we will come back to ponzi schemes, one topic at a time (for now wholesalers or mlm","18":"But that's the key right? You own something you have no control over.  You can buy stocks between companies, but that's like selling apples and oranges. They're both fruits, but they're still different things.","19":"You didn't answer or acknowledge the limitations of being wholesales (aka mlm), so i will assume this is based on mlm.  When i buy apples directly from an orchard, i take the risk (just like buying stock) that i can sell them at a profit to grocers (who sell them to the consumers who consume them). I have no control over whether or not the grocers will buy them or not. I may end up with rotting apples because i didn't realize that people now hate apples...","20":"But that's not doing market research. Maybe the analogy is not the best to price your point, but you can easily ensure you have sales before purchasing.   Also, you have the intrinsic value of apples which you can eat (I assume you're not allergic to it). So even though you may lose some of your money (the apples rot) you're guaranteed a certain level of return regardless. Hell, even rotten apples can be turned into compost for further loss mitigation. There's so much more flexibility there.","21":"Market research also shows that stocks are valuable, so your previous point is invalid. Why would i buy stock if i knew the value was frozen?  Your analogy would make purchasing any currency in foreign currency moot. I could invest in buying yen, i can't eat that, but correctly i can use it to buy apples.... likewise for bolts, 2 by 4s, etc....","22":"Point 1. You are correct. But that's not different in investing in nike shoes or luxury bags to resell later. The value of the stock comes from perception rather than anything thay can be more objectively discerned (dividends). E.g. Nike shoes are inherently shoes, so they have a level of intrinsic value. But is it worth 1k, is a matter of perception.  Point 2. Actually that highlights my point. If you invest in yen and try to use it in another country, it is very likely most places will not accept the currency unless you are willing to trade at a decent or significant loss. So that investment makes no sense because it is unusable until converted, which requires a person willing to trade it.   Furthermore, from another comment, someone said that money is useless until spent, which I fully agree with. But the reason why money always remains valuable is because it is the only form of negotiation with the government for the world's most valuable asset: land."}}
