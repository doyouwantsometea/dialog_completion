Now they are warning us about the heat. I don\u2019t remember ever having a power outage during any other winter or sumner unless ice took down a line or a hurricane took out a line. What changed?","1":"They definitely do. Though only when the wind blows. And since energy storage is basically impossible at large scale they are useless while there is no wind.","2":"Lol i do not know when there isn\u2019t wind. It is super windy here. Why did that question get downvoted on a ELI5 post?    I am obviously here because I don\u2019t understand and want to understand.","3":"They might always be spinning but the speed will vary leading to more or less electricity. One thing that made me appreciate how difficult having an electrical grid online is the fact that all the energy going in to a network and out of it have to be the same exactly. This helped me understand that stuff can just happen.","4":"So energy can\u2019t be stored?  It just goes in and out?","5":"On the bigger scale basically. All electrical energy storage has a high loss factor on the grander scale. You can pump water upstream from a damm and some other things but a lot of the energy goes poof so it's not widely done I think. In the end basically all that goes in must go out. A tricky but most of the time solvable task.  I just recently saw an.amazing talk about it but it's German. If you are still interested I could link it.","6":"I appreciate the offer to link it, but I barely know English, and it is the only language I know.   I had no idea that there was an issue with storage. I have heard that sometimes they turn off the windmills because they are making too much energy and that didn\u2019t make sense. I guess if they can\u2019t store it then it does make a bit more sense.   I have also heard that some guy said that energy is neither created nor destroyed it is just transferred.   But what did Einstein know?","7":"While it's true that energy can't be destroyed for the purpose of the electricity grid turning electricity to anything but electricity makes it basically unusable in most circumstances.","8":"What could we use the energy for instead of electricity? For the times when the solar panels and turbines make too much?"}}
