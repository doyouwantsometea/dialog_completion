If it isnt energy that makes our muscles shake what is it?","1":"First of all, the light does not reach your muscles, it just reaches your skin. So it cannot have any direct effect on the muscles anyway.  But more importantly, muscles cannot just convert any sort of energy into movement, just like a diesel engine can only use diesel and not steam or wind or electricity. The energy source for muscles is a specific chemical \"fuel\" in your body called ATP, muscles can only use that and nothing else.  However, while the ATP is the energy source, your brain has to control the muscles somehow, and it does that - simplifying here - by sending electric impulses along your nerves. If you touch an electric cable, the electricity will cause havoc with this communications system - your muscles believe that they're given random, frantic orders, and act accordingly.  So, in short - muscle spasm don't happen because of too much energy, but because they recieve random orders.","2":"why does electricity penetrate skin but not light, they are both energy right?","3":"And something being lifted up means that is has potential energy, but that doesn't mean it can penetrate anything.  Just because two things \"are energy\" does not mean that they have anything in common, except that you can probably somehow transform one into the other.","4":"that was supplemental.   Q:  why does electricity penetrate skin but not light","5":"Ummm...do you want me to give you a course in maxwell equations and quantum physics? Because that the only way I can think of to explain why some materials are electric conductors while others are not, and why some materials are transparent to light while others are not.  A sheet of copper lets electricity flow and blocks light. A sheet of glass is an electric insulator while being transparent to light. We're just talking about totally different phenomenons here."}}
