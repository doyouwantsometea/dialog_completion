Who told you that it was?","2":"Society? Plus I think comment section approves","3":"What society?  From what country are you posting? In the USA it's only an issue if it compromises safety or the person is trying to be confrontational deliberately.","4":"Are you saying afros are allowed in most workplaces??","5":"I'm saying that I haven't seen an afro specifically denied anywhere except in the military and places where long hair was a safety concern. Having spent the majority of my life in IT and managing networks for hundreds and hundreds of commercial entities and government agencies, it's extremely rare that someone is denied the ability to wear an afro - based on the thousands and thousands of workers\/ employees with whom I've interacted.   It used to be a thing in the 80's and 90's because it looks obnoxious, but political correctness and 2 more generations of people that don't care about their appearance has basically done away with restrictions on hair styles. People just don't care about afros anymore.","6":"Do you could imagine your lawyer with a 20 inch afro?"}}
