There's multiple factors.   One is the lack of contact with other civilizations.   Many civilizations in the old world traded information on how to do things, which affected their history, economy and technology. For example, Gunpowder was a Chinese invention, and eventually was used with the invention of the Gun to create a weapon that was far superior than any in history. Sub-saharan Africa didn't have significant contact with the rest of the old world until European colonization.   Most of modern Africa today is poor and uneducated because of corruption, wars, poor economic planning and situations which leaves many in bad health.","2":"My source is Google Images, but yeah I agree with the trading thing.","3":"Google images isn't a good source for a generalized statement like that.","4":"https:\/\/www.nature.com\/articles\/s41586-019-1050-5  73% of sub-Saharan Africans live in the homes I described.","5":"There we go! Much better!  I'd say the most significant factor in that is the amount of wealth with an individual or family, and a person's knowledge on how to build a house."}}
