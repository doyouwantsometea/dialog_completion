I see a recognition and celebration of immigration and diversity.  &gt; Who founded the other half?  Individuals that have been here for more than one generation. Native born Americans.   &gt; Wow. So life is good for the immigrants and bad for the people who were already there?  Immigrants just behave better is all.   &gt; What about the Native Americans? How did it go for them when immigrants came?  Not well. As you know, Western Civilization is founded on violence\/slavery\/genocide.","2":"You're the only one who claimed there was a quote? I tried to help you out by finding an article that has the same message from someone in power.   If we're so dangerous and genocidal then why do people want to come here? Shouldn't they be terrified of us?   And all your allusions to the \"noble savage\" are completely racist.","3":"You seem confused.","4":"That's a useful phrase for people who can't answer questions.","5":"Not all questions are created equal. And your's show a lack of clarity of thought.","6":"You can't answer these questions, what are you doing here? Proud of your lack of ability to think? Well done.","7":"another low IQ post.","8":"Thanks for answering my question.","9":"Anytime. Does it hurt that your post has zero points and has only been upvoted by 1 in 4 people?","10":"No. I don't care about upvotes. Thanks for the insight into your mindset though.","11":"I am of the mindset that those with grammatical errors in their sentence structure and an inability to articulate themselves clearly in their written responses to others are fun to fuck with because they be dumb. Thanks for continuing to allow me to play with dumb.","12":"Don't thank me, thank your thesaurus.","13":"I just downvoted your post."}}
