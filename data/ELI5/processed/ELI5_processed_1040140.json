I know they \"don't share\", but is that a crack at aristocrats or more of a Buddhist-style respectful reference to the nobility?","1":"Sure if your hypothetical situation plays out exactly as you have said it would then yes it would happen as you say it would.  Humans don\u2019t generally operate that way in real life though and you have an enormous number of assumptions that are in no way probable. (Like having access to a particle collider in the apocalypse).","2":"Many of the particle colliders are underground in Switzerland which is a country extremely famous for building underground bunkers and wanting to survive through nuclear wars and all other wars","3":"They need an enormous amount of power and expertise though, you cant just flip a Switch and have them run, and you certainly can\u2019t by yourself.","4":"Good thing Switzerland has a shitload of nuclear power   (Bavaria and several other regions in that area might have similar capabilities, and even if not they could just go to Switzerland)","5":"Ya but not autonomous nuclear power. Maybe you are a nuclear physicist and nuclear engineer but you still can\u2019t be in both places at once and do the maintenance","6":"Hmm, we were mainly just talking about regions trying to survive some sort of apocalypse   Yeah the Alps in general seem like a good place for that, (google alpine redoubt or national redoubt, even Mussolini had a pretty good one), and that being said the entirety of the Western World for the most part could be used. Even Svalbard north of Norway is famously thought of as a place to preserve things","7":"Not living things. Its cold and hard to grow crops. They are good at preserving things specifically because living things don't survive there well","8":"Okay well crispr and all the indoor agriculture techniques post-WWII solve all those problems   I mean they're figuring out ways to grow plants in spaceships and terraform Mars I'm sure they can do it underground in Earth","9":"If you have enough infrastructure to do so on a useful scale then you aren't in an apocalypse.","10":"What if the rest of the world on the surface,  not in bunkers, all die in a nuclear war but the Swiss (among others) are safe underground with a fully functioning society   Is that considered an apocalypse?","11":"most would call it science fiction, or total fantasy. If society is functioning then you don't need to make gold."}}
