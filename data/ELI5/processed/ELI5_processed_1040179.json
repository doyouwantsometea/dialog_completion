Are they making money or taking a loss?","2":"As I said when [you asked this below][1], they are making money. If they aren't making money they sold their ticket too cheap to cover operational costs.  [1]: https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/explainlikeimfive\/comments\/arl51v\/eli5_how_does_hidden_city_travel_cost_airlines\/egofd6y","3":"You think running empty planes makes money?  You think turning customers away when you could've sold them something makes money?  You honestly believe this?  &gt;they sold their ticket too cheap to cover operational costs.  1.  Operational cost and profit are not the same thing.  2.  They priced their ticket on your *lies*, so how could it possibly be adequately priced for the market.","4":"&gt; You think running empty planes makes money?  The main thing that makes money is selling tickets. Fortunately for them the tickets are already sold. But if the plane is underweight they can also make more by shipping cargo. So yes, in that sense running \"empty\" planes makes money, potentially more than running full planes.  &gt; You think turning customers away when you could've sold them something makes money?  I think that if you sold a service at a profit you sold a service at a profit. I agree that the airline could make _more_ money if they could resell the empty seats, but given that they are already sold I'd hope they are already making something.  &gt; You honestly believe this?  Yup.  ","5":"&gt;The main thing that makes money is selling tickets  Not true.  100% incorrect.  &gt;But if the plane is underweight they can also make more by shipping cargo  Weight is weight. The plane doesn't care if its you or a box.  They can't sell it to cargo any more than they could sell it to another person because *you lied* to them and told them that that weight was already taken.  &gt;I think that if you sold a service at a profit you sold a service at a profit  They **don't** sell the service at a profit.   They sell it at break even.   The *profit* comes from ancillary streams...Bag fees, credit card sales, snacks, booze....  &gt;Yup. I'd strongly advise against starting an airline.   You'll lose your shirt.

Do you want me to explain what a citation is?  &gt; How about this: &gt; If you lying to them doesn't cost them money, then why are they fighting it?  I don't think they could care less about my lies, they care about profits like any other business. If I can buy a cheaper ticket, sure, that costs them money, so of course they fight it.
