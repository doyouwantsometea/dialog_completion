If yes, how do they get rid of them?","1":"It's a little bit more involved than that, but as a man myself, that is the general anatomy of where testosterone is created. Although they say that the biggest sexual organ is actually our brain because it has a lot to do with what we think, how we think, what we have learned, and how we feel. One of the other replies to my comment was talking about castration as a form of punishment especially back 30 to 60 years ago, a very interesting movie about that is called \"The imitation game\" we're a man is working with the code breakers of the world war to try to figure out how to stop the enemy and was very successful at it, but it was struggling with his sexuality and a time and place where it was illegal to not be straight Here's a short article from mental floss attacks a little bit about a few famous castrated people http:\/\/mentalfloss.com\/article\/22367\/6-famous-eunuchs","2":"I see, this is very interesting. I think there's something like this in the history of my culture too (Malay, Malaysian) but I can't seem to recall anything.  Again, thank you very much!","3":"If I am not mistaken, many Asian cultures also performed castrations for various reasons, both political or social. But I can't speak to it as it's not a part of my culture or study","4":"Perhaps the East Asians and a small number of us South East Asians. I'm not well-read on that myself :(","5":"As I was doing a little bit of reading around on the Wikipedia page for eunuch and castration that definitely mentions some East Asian areas and their history of involvement"}}
