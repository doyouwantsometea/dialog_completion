High level waste is simple enough to contain on land, and takes up a tiny amount of space. Why bother dumping it in the ocean and making it impossible to monitor or recycle?","2":"The idea is that a leakage on land is more dangerous than in the sea and maybe more costly to build the containment facility? The US is currently having a debate over where to build the next containment facility iirc?","3":"Leakage on land is basically a non-issue. You cask the waste, put the casks in a big concrete yard, and watch them. If one leaks, you fix it and clean up the leak.  The debate in the US over spent fuel storage is purely political. The engineering aspects of safely storing spent nuclear fuel have been well understood for half a century.","4":"I assume stuff like earthquakes avoided by picking a good location? Why is it political though, shouldn't it be a clear cut science issue cause it has to be built somewhere anyways?","5":"Everything is political. People don't like the idea of storing waste in their area, despite it being generally a very safe proposition.  The US government had a political flurry over disposing of napalm a few decades ago because people flipped out when they heard that a train carrying napalm might pass near their town. The fact that napalm is just safer gasoline did not seem to change anyone's mind about \"SCARY TRAIN!\""}}
