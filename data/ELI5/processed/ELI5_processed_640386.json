If yes, how do they get rid of them?","1":"I am not a 100% sure but I did hear that those undergoing genital amputation also undergo castration.. that is their testicles are also removed.. an act of merciful castration. To save them the pain of being able to feel sexual urges and not being able to satisfy those urges.","2":"Thank you! It seems that I am unaware that the testicles is what makes the sexual urges","3":"About this I can confirm a 100% its our testicles. Not our penis. Its just the organ to assist in reproduction XD","4":"I genuinely thought it's more...psychological? I.e having sexual thoughts = sexual urges","5":"Thoughts are ofc psychological but for our body to reciprocate those thoughts it needs to respond in a certain way. The hormones are the chemical messengers which elicit those responses. So the mind and the testicles lol they just do it like a cooperative mission. Guess there is some truth when they say guys think with their dicks.. well balls to be precise haha","6":"Hahaha could be! Thank you very much for replying :)"}}
