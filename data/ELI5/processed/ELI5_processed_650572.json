Up and down only mean \"pointed toward the earth\" and \"not pointed toward the earth.\" No matter how far south you fly, gravity keeps everything oriented so that \"down\" is toward the earth. The only way you know which way is up and down is which way gravity pulls you, and since gravity always pulls you toward the earth, your feet always point toward the earth, whether you're over the north pole or the south pole. ","2":"Yes but in this video, he explains that if a plane were to fly from the UK to australia, if you were to watch the plane from space would it appear upside down?","3":"I'm not going to watch the video, because I don't watch internet videos, but that is incorrect. The bottom of the plane always points toward the earth.","4":"Yes, so theoretically if i was to watch a plane from space it would be upside down?","5":"I don't know what you mean by upside down. You'd see the top of the plane, because you're above it. If you are on a plane and it's landing and you look down and see other planes, are they upside down?"}}
