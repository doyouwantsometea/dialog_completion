Also, science..  https:\/\/www.express.co.uk\/news\/science\/848991\/life-after-death-what-happens-when-you-die-quantum-physics","2":"A shitty UK tabloid is science now?   Congrats, you played yourself","3":"Them: Sean Carroll, a cosmologist and physics professor at the California Institute of Technology,   You: dumbfuck stoner.  Thanks for the intellectual debate..","4":"Yes because billions of people on the planet don\u2019t believe in an afterlife, only me, a dumbfuck stoner.   P.s. just because one actual scientist believes something to be true, doesn\u2019t make it so. Isaac Newton \u201cdiscovered\u201d gravity, but Einstein taught us that he was completely wrong about how it works.","5":"Half of the planet has an iq under 100, plenty of dumbfuckery around.  A great deal of science is in fields that has nothing to do with the topic, a volcanogist has only his personal beliefs, mostly based on early life brain washing, lots are from places where lack of faith is deemed a detriment so you are not likely to find their true opinion, Saudi Arabia and the USA spring to mind. Despite that, US scientists aren't that church going, even assuming that every single one attending is a believer, very unlikely.  &gt;\tThe majority of scien- tists in the US (60 percent), UK (66 percent), and France (81 percent) are nonattenders; only a small fraction of French scientists attend services once a week or more (3.2 percent). Nonattending scientists are in the minority in some nations, however, such as Turkey (40 percent) and Italy (44 percent)","6":"So believing in a higher power or believing that we don\u2019t have all the answers makes someone a dumbfuck? I think that you are too immature to handle the fact that someone else might believe something different from you.   **NO ONE KNOWS FOR SURE WHERE CONSCIOUSNESS COMES FROM AND NO ONE KNOWS WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU DIE** not even British Tabloid magazines know. So why are you pretending that you do?","7":"I base my opinion on facts, logic, evidence and not being force fed religion as a child.  When you die, you cease to exist, like the 13 billion years before you were born, not that difficult to comprehend. What subatomic particles or physics allows anything different? We don't know where consciousness comes from because we don't fully understand the subject, no need to assume its magic sky fairy's doing it.","8":"You aren\u2019t though. Because if you based your opinion of facts and logic, your opinion would be, \u201cI don\u2019t know because there is no conclusive evidence that shows where consciousness comes from.\u201d  I don\u2019t need to assume it\u2019s a magic fairy because it could easily exist here in a material realm and we just can access it through our brain. There is no magic behind radio signals, yet you can\u2019t see it without a radio receiver. Perhaps we cannot yet observe what causes thoughts and ideas.","9":"No, facts and logic dictates there is nothing there to explain, why would there be, we are a self contained biomechanical unit, nothing more and nothing less. Perhaps if there was even vague evidence of something let alone conclusive proof, then it would be researched seriously as it would be a life changing event for everyone on the planet. How much research is being done?  Close to zero..   We can detect radio signals and have been doing so for over a century, we know the quantum realm behind it, we can smash atoms together and explain the results, all the shrapnel.  There are no mystery physics remaining to explain metaphysical bunkum, just waving your arms around and having a vague opinion that \"something\" happens with no means of explaining it, based on no evidence just a \"perhaps\" is not an easily defendable position. You have nothing.","10":"You are just retarded I think. \u201cThere is nothing there to explain\u201d, there are probably thousands of scientists that would laugh in your face if they read that."}}
