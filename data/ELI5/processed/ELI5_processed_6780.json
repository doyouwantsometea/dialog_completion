As you do things on the computer, such as browse Reddit, your computer keeps taking up more memory with every post you click, every photo you view, every link you click.  When that memory becomes more limited, your computer operates more slowly, as it struggles to try to \"find a place to fit more stuff.\"  However, once you restart your computer, most of that memory is wiped clean and you start fresh, so your computer is often faster.  Basically, on a restart, your computer \"empties the trash can,\" so you can start filling it up again, without constantly having to try to compact the trash to fit more in the can.","2":"Interesting.  So does the computer have a hard time understanding when to \u201clet go\u201d of something in its memory?","3":"Yes, to a great extent.  What is stored in memory is often determined by the software used to store it.  For example, I'm current browsing Reddit on my laptop using the Firefox browser.  Firefox keeps saving things to memory, with everything I do.  If I wish, I can tell Firefox to \"clear the cache,\" manually telling it to get rid of all of the junk it's been saving, without having to restart the computer or restart Firefox.  But if I don't do that, it will keep saving things.  The more different programs I have open and running at the same time, the more memory is being used.  For example, if I also have a game running, the game, too, will take up some memory.","4":"That\u2019s what cache is!!! TIL!!!!   So - if you open a program that has junk in its cache, it can theoretically slow things down?  Unless you manually clear cache or unless the program has automated its cache clearing?","5":"Obviously, every program is different, but to a great extent, that is true.","6":"I\u2019d imagine it might be worse for programs like browsers that are constantly loading images and other web content?"}}
