Twice now in fact.  The purpose of a judicial system is to determine who is and who is not guilty of a crime.  The system you're proposing is a crap shoot that has nothing to do with guilt or innocence.  Our current system, while far from perfect, does work at least in theory.","2":"&gt; The purpose of a judicial system is to determine who is and who is not guilty of a crime.  Yes and everyone has the right to hire a lawyer, which more often than not leads to them manipulating and hiding facts to bolster their position in a case. Narcoanalysis helps pacify their lying side and eliminate that \"hurdle\" in the current system on top of the current procedures in practice. So, yes, it has to do with guilt or innocence.  &gt; Our current system, while far from perfect, does work at least in theory.  I don't know if you're knowledgeable enough on the subject matter but contradictory to your belief, the same can be said for narco tests. I don't see how that makes the current system \"better\" in any way than narco tests, considering you just admitted that the current system is not perfect in any way. Your earlier point was that narco tests aren't perfect either. So explain to me your thought process behind reaching the conclusion that current system &gt; narco tests when both aren't perfect.","3":"&gt;So explain to me your thought process behind reaching the conclusion that current system &gt; narco tests when both aren't perfect.   Breaking your arm isn't good.  Neither is bone cancer.  Breaking your arm is better than having bone cancer though.","4":"Yes, but I created the whole thread because I don't get the analogy. Bone cancer is worse than breaking your arm. Indeed. That's in the medical terms. But in legal terms, explain to me how narco tests are worse than the current system. Because the way I see it, narco tests can be conducted much faster than doing the paperwork, gathering the evidence, back and forth cross-examinations by the advocates which can go on for months, courts getting adjourned and deferring the case hearing to a later date due to absence of one party or another (dishonoring the summon)\/lack of evidence\/deliberate stalling by either party\/delays due to technical issues and so on and so forth.","5":"&gt;But in legal terms, explain to me how narco tests are worse than the current system  Because it's less accurate.   &gt;narco tests can be conducted much faster than doing the paperwork, gathering the evidence, back and forth cross-examinations  Yes.  Arbitrary determinations of guilt based on weight are faster too.  Why not that system?","6":"&gt; Because it's less accurate.   Ah! The classic case of [circular reasoning](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Circular_reasoning). Gotta love it!  https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/explainlikeimfive\/comments\/ary20x\/eli5_why_do_narcoanalysis_tests_not_used_in_every\/egqf9tv\/  You're arguing for the sake of arguing now. Your points have no substance left and you have no clue what you're even talking about anymore.  &gt; Yes. Arbitrary determinations of guilt based on weight are faster too. Why not that system?  That's pointless mental gymnastics. Answer the question or admit that you're not following my point anymore.","7":"How is it circular reasoning this time, but none of the previous times I've said it?","8":"It has always been but I gave you the benefit of the doubt before. Now it's clear as a whistle you have no idea what you're even advocating for.","9":"Obviously. Bye."}}
