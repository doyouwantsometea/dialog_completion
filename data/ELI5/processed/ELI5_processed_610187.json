The alpha\/beta\/gamma particles coming out might crash around and damage other atoms, but this is a result of the decay and doesn't precipitate more decay in most cases (fission can be an exception).  &amp;#x200B;  For fission, you can imagine the nucleus like a deformed ball. Unstable nuclei will \"oscillate\" such that the ball will get more spherical and more elongated repeatedly. If it manages to stretch to far, it'll break apart. This is a decent analogy, though being somewhat quantum mechanical it isn't quite that simple.","2":" So when a Uranium atom decays into \"stable\" Thorium, is it possible that another alpha\/beta\/gamma particles can knock into it, turning it back into Uranium or has the particles lost just enough energy in it's initial emission to not be able to return, \"upgrading\" the atom again? I don't know much about the properties of such particles and how they actually interact with \"full\" particles such as protons\/electrons\/neutrons or if it might as well be a different world, not allowing interaction in such a straight forward way. ","3":"Generally, you won't be able to add back to the nucleus without fusion, which requires high energy and generally doesn't work well on elements heavier than iron as putting in more nucleons into such nuclei make them bound less strongly. This is why it is said heavy elements originate in supernovae, normal stars don't have the energy to fuse beyond iron. If the nucleus is unstable enough and gets run into, it can cause it to break apart, which is exploited by nuclear reactors to sustain the controlled fission reactions.","4":"As far as suoernovae, it's because there's a ton of high energy+high gravity\/pressure keeping them together to fuse if I have that correct? ","5":"Yes, pretty much. To add to a nucleus, you must overcome the electromagnetic repulsion from the protons enough that the strong force takes over. The strong force is a very short ranged force, unlike electromagnetism, and doesn't follow the inverse square law.","6":"It sort of reminds me of [that way to arrange magnets](https:\/\/youtu.be\/h34L9udPlv4) in such a way that it will repel when kinda far but snap in once close although I realize that in the video, atoms wouldn't lock in at that further distance.
