Feral cat hunting is a thing and apparently pretty fun. Cats have been responsible for a crapton of now-extinct species. If only they would just take out certain species like the possum (more of an NZ thing) but they do not discriminate that much.  I actually tracked down the Cat Man of Kangaroo Island to see about getting a catskin hat from him but I am glad I didn't because I found out later that owning cat fur anything (excepting a few circumstances) is a felony. Super lame, as I love the work he does.","4":"Ahh thank you for explaining! And Wow good thing you found that out and didn\u2019t end up trying again later down the line!","5":"Yeah, I'm glad too. After I tracked him down I sort of wondered why I had never seen it elsewhere and whaddya know."}}
