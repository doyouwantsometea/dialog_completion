I know I had some sex education in school but it wasn't very good. It's a common problem in schools because people are scared to talk about it. Some of the fear is that it will encourage kids to start having sex early but I think it's important for everyone to know how the body works. Everyone has one, so why hide it?  Kids need to know what is normal and what is not normal, so if there is a problem, they can talk to a doctor. Puberty is scary with everything changing and a lot of people feel shame about it when they shouldn't. I'm glad you're asking questions ahead of time so you're a little more prepared.","2":"How come things for girls are so much more complicated but for boys it\u2019s not that much","3":"It's just how the human body is. \u00af\\_(\u30c4)_\/\u00af Can't do much about it. Lots of religions have stories that give reasons if that's something you believe in.  Although I think it is pretty flippin awesome that women can grow a child inside of her. And then feed it with her own body too. It's like a superpower.","4":"Is it ok if I message u and ask a couple questions?","5":"Yeah go ahead!"}}
