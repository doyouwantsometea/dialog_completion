For their own mental gymnastic games. The testimony of those women was enough to convince him. That many women are not lying and to infer as much is disgusting behavior that you need to reflect deeply on.","2":"&gt;I just want you to know that you're coming off as an abuser who's trying to defend a well-known abuser.  English common law is doomed if people are this sensitive, and disregard logic for feelings. The man, no matter what he did, was seemingly convicted based on a rumour.","3":"No he was convicted on testimony. Testimony isn't just pointing a finger. It's a long drawn out process with corroboration and it's so much more than just accusations. I'm not sensitive, I'm letting you know the opinion I've formed about you based on your comments.","4":"&gt;Testimony isn't just pointing a finger  In this case it was though. Literally women pointing their fingers saying \"he raped me\".","5":"And that's all it takes because it's true. What you're inferring is anybody who accuses rape is lying. These women are not lying just to take down a powerful man. They told the truth and the law caught up to him."}}
