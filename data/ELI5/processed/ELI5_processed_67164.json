Isn't \"queer\" already an umbrella term for all the other letters?","1":"There are many sports that fall outside of football, basketball, and baseball.  Just as there are possibly those who identify as just queer but not the other identifiers.  By including Q those who identify that way are given representation and not ignored.","2":"But then it would be more appropiate to call it \"Queer\" instead of \"LGBTQIA+\".  Thats what I meant with this comparison. There is no need to name something \"Football, Basketball, Sports, and Baseball\" when it means the exact same thing as just \"Sports\".","3":"Not everyone identifies as queer.  It\u2019s about representation.","4":"Uh, wait a minute. This is the first sentence about \"Queer\" on Wikipedia:  &gt; ***Queer*** is an [umbrella term](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Umbrella_term) for [sexual](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Sexual_minority) and [gender](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Gender) [minorities](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Minority_group) who are not [heterosexual](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Heterosexual) or are not [cisgender](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Cisgender).   Under that definition, it is impossible to be, for example, \"gay but not queer\".  Unless everyone has a different idea what the word \"queer\" actually means. But I do hope that such a widely-used acronym actually means something.","5":"That\u2019s a fairly old view on it."}}
