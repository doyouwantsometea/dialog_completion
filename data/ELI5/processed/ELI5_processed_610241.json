When you think, you can \u201cfeel\u201d that your thoughts are located in your brain. Not in your stomach or 20 feet away. Seems like if your thoughts weren\u2019t physical there\u2019s be no way to experience this sense of their location, since non-physical things can\u2019t interact with physical things. If physical things *can* interact with non-physical things, I\u2019d love for someone to explain it to me.","2":"But, I don\u2019t feel like my thought originate in my brain. Like, to me it feels like two beings living using my brain. One is my thoughts, my personality, my emotions. The other is the animalistic brain that controls my body. When I get scared, or injured my animalistic will take over control for a moment. But when I sit here and think of bullshit like this, it feels like I\u2019m tapping into something outside my body entirely.","3":"Yes but neurosurgery proves that fucking with the brain itself causes changes in what consciousness feels like. Since the brain is a physical thing, consciousness must be physically caused, since no one has yet explained how non-physical things could interact with physical things. In other words, if conscious thought were on \"another plane,\" fucking with the brain itself shouldn't cause changes in consciousness. But it does.","4":"How does it cause changes in consciousness? What do you mean by that?","5":"Like, if a surgeon pokes your brain here, you might remember what you had for lunch a month ago. If he pokes you there, you see some colors. If he takes a huge chunk of your brain out, you lose the ability to form certain thoughts altogether etc.","6":"Hmm, that is interesting. Also, brain trauma has been known to actually affect people\u2019s personalities. (Making them more impulsive, angry, speak a new language, etc.)"}}
