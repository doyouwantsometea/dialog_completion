A liter of acetone boils to ~420 liters of gas(at 373k\/100c) vs a liter of water boils to 1200 liters (at 373k\/100c) at 1atm. Makes sense to use the fluid with more expansion.","2":"Well, it's true that acetone is much larger per mol, so it's obviously not a great choice as you pointed out. But surely there's some low-molar-mass fluid with a low boiling point?","3":"Surprisingly few, actually. Ammonia has been used, and it's OK but not ideal. Water has another large benefit-the cool side of the engine is still above ambient, allowing very easy and cheap cooling","4":"&gt;Water has another large benefit-the cool side of the engine is still above ambient, allowing very easy and cheap cooling  I think this is kind of a given for fluids that work. Sure, liquid oxygen has a low boiling point, but good luck easily getting it to condense. I suppose that's the problem with ammonia and probably everything else.","5":"Fair. Ironically you want the opposite for a heat pump..."}}
