Your body naturally builds up a static electrical charge - from moving, rubbing against clothes and furniture, etc. The sensitive electronics in a PC can be damaged if you put that charge through them by touching them. If you touch a ground first, that charge goes into the ground - literally into the Earth, and your body is electrically neutral for a while.","2":"ooh yeah this makes sense so pretty much you are transfering your energy before you touch the pc so you dont transfer it to a pc part?","3":"Yup.","4":"thanks for the answer much appriciated!!","5":"Bonus interesting fact: the definition of the Earth in electrical physics is \"an object so large that its electrical charge does not change, no matter how much charge you give it\". :)","6":"wait so lets say there is a massive piece of metal and you put like 1,000,000 volts into it its charge wont change?","7":"It probably will, even if it's a very massive piece of metal, like an aircraft carrier.  But the Earth is so big that you can put a million volts into it, and there won't be a measurable change in its charge.","8":"ah okay yeah that makes sense"}}
