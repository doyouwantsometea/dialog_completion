An afro is only obnoxious if it's intended to be outside the accepted norms. An enormous afro - as in absolutely huge - is obnoxious because we don't wear enormous things on our heads day in and day out. They obstruct views and may be a dangerous distraction under some conditions. A \"regular size\" afro really has no negative connotation with it. And by regular I mean something relative to the size of the person - 6-12\" or so?  As far as there being norms on appearance in general, that's sociological in nature.  Every society or group is connected by similarities.  And as clean appearances go, you need to project that you practice good hygiene. Nobody wants to be around people that don't take care of themselves.","2":"That makes sense... Thanks..I understand if people would view it as obnoxious, but why would that affect employment? Also more than obnoxious, I've met many people who are straight up prejudiced against it","3":"Again, I'm saying that I haven't seen it as a hindrance to employment today like it was 25-35 years ago. People were more formal all the way around in their employment back then. Men wore suits or ties at least, women wore blouses and slacks or even skirts and dresses. Today, all of that is rare. Very rare. That's mainly why afros aren't frowned upon like they were back then. But also like I said, PC sort of prevents people from even discussing it.  As far as the prejudice goes - it's just a guess, but the few people I know that have commented on giant afros see a connection between them and protestors. So, people likely view huge afros as a form of protest. Employers don't like to even consider hiring people that they consider to be agitators, generally speaking.   Note: I'm limited on how often I can post, so I'm having to go back and edit other comments instead of replying directly.","4":"Oh cool , just one last edit please, whether you're an protestor or not doesn't have much bearing on your job skills right? Why are emplyers averse to hiring them?","5":"Employers don't typically look at skills alone. It's cheaper to retain an employee than replace one, so they would rather hire someone that will get along with everyone else rather than quitting shortly after being hired, or running off other employees instead.  If a person seems like they might be a problem case during an interview, it's probably a sign that they won't fit in.","6":"Why wouldn't others get along with someone with an afro?","7":"By definition, protesters and agitators don't conform and try to be agents of change. But existing employees typically don't want anything to change. Therefore, they generally don't get along with noncomformists.  That also could explain why there tends to be prejudice against afros by others - they're not interested in any change in the status quo."}}
