And even if you do that, the house is still going to get ripped down to that structure unless you build it like a vault with bulletproof windows and doors, so you are talking probably $500,000 fo a house the size of a small apartment. It just doesn\u2019t make sense. And like someone else said, tornadoes happen often, but still hit such a tiny minority of houses. It\u2019s just not that often that houses will get hit.","2":"Well yeah I think my question is very specific. How about more general threats like a fire?","3":"What about them? Fires basically destroy everything too. I see  no advantage of stone vs wood house. Either one will have to be completely rebuilt after a fire.","4":"On the contrary. Even if the fire eventually has the same result in both types of houses, an area full of stone houses will burn at a slower rate allowing more time for a response.","5":"Oh sure mass outdoors fires. But those are so rare. Houses are spread out enough in the states that\u2019s not really a concern. Until you get to massive forest fires like the once in California not too long ago, and it just destroyed everything in its path."}}
