There were cells that \"wanted\" to reproduce and there were cells which did not. Now, those who did not, died. What is left are the ones which wanted to reproduce, so they carry on whatever they were doing.   So today, every cell, virus, whatever living thing \"wants\" to reproduce, because this is one of its genetic traits which made it survive for so long, just like plants being green or animals breathing oxygen are other genetic traits.","2":"Thank you for your answer. Very interesting.  Follow up question: Viruses, that are just DNA or RNA inside a protein, would in a vacuum be pretty much an inanimate object. It would not die, not reproduce and so on. If one self-replicating virus mutated so that it would not self replicate it would be its own type of virus, one of a kind, never increasing in population nor decreasing. Over time wouldnt we have billions of these non-replicating viruses simply by chance and mutation?","3":"Hmm I have no knowledge in this subject, so everything I say is just hypothetical and quickly googled, BUT  The numbers in microbiology are astronomical. We have 10^31 viruses on earth (not types of viruses, the \"bodies\" themselves), which is a number beyond any imagination. We only have 10^21 stars in the observable universe!  (nature.com: \"Microbiology by numbers\")  So I think there are a lot of dead-end mutations, but their number is so insignificant that we might never find one. Or, they just get destroyed rather quickly by environmental forces, radiation etc.","4":"Thank you very cool  I cant believe there are more viruses on earth than stars in the observable universe. Viruses seems so incredibly more complex to me, granted I know nothing on either stars nor viruses. Nature truly is amazing.","5":"Me neither. As I said, these are numbers that just seem out of place.   People also say that there are more grains of sand on earth than there are stars we can see, did you know that?  Or the most interesting fun fact I've learned in the last weeks: We can fit all planets of our solar system between earth and moon. Crazy, right? The moon is so much further away from us than it seems.    I hope I gave you a few things to think about. Never stop exploring!","6":"You definitely did! Thank you so much, this is so incredibly fascinating."}}
