Specifically a flu shot.","1":"&gt;Just because I know the answer doesn't mean I don't want an explanation.  Ya it does and thats what loads it. Similar questions without the bias exist on the sub thats why it breaks rule 7.      third one down here should help:  [https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/explainlikeimfive\/search\/?q=flu%20shot%20why&amp;restrict\\_sr=1](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/explainlikeimfive\/search\/?q=flu%20shot%20why&amp;restrict_sr=1)      But your exact phrasing won't exist because your question is asking people to convicne you of something and really don't allow that. you could try r\/changemyview","2":"That's not what constitutes a loaded question.","3":"You have a premise, an answer you believe underlying your question that you are looking to be addressed\/corrected\/confirmed. Thats a controversial underlying premise and the definition of being loaded. If it wasn\u2019t then you wouldn\u2019t need to ask.  Try r\/changemyview","4":"I'm not saying your correct assuming my having a loaded question or not but by that definition the majority of ELIF front page questions are loaded. You say it's controversial. I don't agree with that. My question is not an answer with a question mark attached, it's just a very specific question. It's targeted because you all believe it's controversial. So please ELIF: why aren't controversial questions permitted?   (Does that seem like a loaded question?)","5":"You may report questions you feel are in bad faith or that are made as pretenses to argue ones own point.  Your question is not allowed here and thats the end of the discussion for both rule 6 and the other 2 reasons listed.  Good luck on other posts."}}
