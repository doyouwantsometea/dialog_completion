The dot on the surface of earth is your position. If you look at the moon it will be lit from the bottom side as the light of the sun goes past earth on both sides.","2":"In the video the moon appears to be setting. In this diagram the moon would appear to be rising for the viewer judging by the direction of the arrows.","3":"Yeah the moon is setting because of the rotation of the earth. Earth spins like 20 times for each revolution the moon does around it","4":"Ok that make sense. Hence why they are up at altitude to see the moon where it is.","5":"Yeah :P smart move on their end"}}
