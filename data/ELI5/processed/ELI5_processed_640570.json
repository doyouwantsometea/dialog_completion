How do they keep the rest out?","1":"Just want to say OP good on you for delving deeper into this and not brushing it off! You turned your daughter's misspelling into a totally super teaching moment! We need more parents like this!","2":"Thanks! I\u2019ve always been a naturally curious dude, not understanding how something works just kinda bugs me. Looks like it\u2019s a hereditary thing lol","3":"Totally get you on that one! Can tell you though I know many parents would have left this one to someone else or even paused it for a few years. My stance is to let our kids know from us, rather than Google or another student. And the fact that you have now opened up a comfortable safe space to talk about this stuff with them, that's so choice!   I only wish I had had that open dialogue with either of my parents. I got a book at 13 or 14.","4":"Yeah, my parents misled me or kicked the can down the road when I asked uncomfortable questions. It always bugged me. Now that I have my own kids, my philosophy is that if they\u2019re old enough to ask they\u2019re probably old enough to know the answer. It\u2019s not like they\u2019ll just stop wondering if they get blown off.","5":"Exactly. Sometimes we learn -not what to do- from our folks. Ha  Great philosophy. Hope more people get on board with that one."}}
