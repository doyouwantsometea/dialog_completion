For me it was all just annoying, with the occasional \"get this thing out of me because I'm **DONE** with this messy cramping business!\".       Yes, it is possible to have sex any time during the menstrual cycle *(which usually lasts about 28 days, but can vary several days either way)*. Some women like the freedom of having sex during their period knowing they can't get pregnant *(which is a HUGE worry!)*, while most don't feel interested in sex.        Listen to your partner. Communicate.","2":"I\u2019m kinda confused about it. I guess maybe it\u2019s cus I don\u2019t understand how the parts like rlly look.","3":"Doesn't matter how they look, but there are plenty of diagrams available.       This one in particular should make it very clear why pregnant women get to jump the line for the bathroom. See how the uterus is atop the bladder? Imagine an extra 15 pounds+ standing on your bladder...                 https:\/\/www.webmd.com\/sex-relationships\/guide\/your-guide-female-reproductive-system#1           For more information about pregnancy &amp; how a fetus grows &amp; what happens to the woman:            https:\/\/www.webmd.com\/family-pregnancy","4":"How is the vagina on the inside? I thought that was like the whole thing","5":"Look at the diagram.            The vagina is the passageway between what can be seen on the outside (labia) and the cervix (mouth of the uterus, which is normally tightly closed). It's a potential space... the walls usually are touching unless there's a tampon, finger, toy, penis, or baby moving through.          The uterus is kind of pear-shaped, about the size of a fist (depending on the person), and the small part connects to the cervix."}}
