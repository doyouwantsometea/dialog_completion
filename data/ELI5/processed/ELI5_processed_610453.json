The question itself is a medical question and while there are standard answers OP should ask a doctor because it could be symptomatic of something else\/worse.","2":"Thanks for the advice but if I'm asking reddit then I'm not really expecting much more than that so I'd prefer to be able to see what everyone is saying about it.","3":"This subreddit does not allow anecdotal or guess based answers. You could try r\/answers or r\/nostupidquestions if that is more what you wanted.  Your question itself is asking for a medical diagnosis, please do not take a diagnosis from anonymous strangers on the internet.","4":"Ok thanks I didn't know about those subs. The issue i was asking about is very minor and infrequent so I wanted to know if there was a quick biological reason why it happened, like a \"brain misfire\" etc.","5":"Even still its worth asking a doctor, you could be totally fine, but on the off chance a doctor goes \"the particular way your knee twitches left indicates potential macguffin syndrome\" its better to ask a doctor than have the internet say you are fine when you might not be (even if its a minor\/slim chance)."}}
