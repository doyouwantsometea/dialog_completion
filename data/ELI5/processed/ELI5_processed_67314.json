I guess you\u2019re taking about that scene in ant man where he shrinks past the quantum realm. Or in men in Black where they zoom outside the universe at the end. Indeed, this is not different dimensions, it\u2019s still the same three dimensions being the same as they always are. Just small objects. There probably is a word for what you\u2019re describing like maybe \u201cdifferent scales\u201d. At different scales the environment can seem quite different like how the smallest bugs \u201cswim\u201d through the air like we swim in water.   I don\u2019t consider this to be \u201csize travel through reality\u201d. You could make a computer program with a scroll bar to scroll through different size scales of a generated image\/scene. This doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s a dimension. It could be called an axis, or a variable, or a degree of freedom, etc.   I have no idea how you are relating any of this to a tesseract though. That\u2019s something entirely different.","2":"i think that the tesseract is the next evolution as cube is to square like i said, but the model they have now are just two years interchanging cubes connected at all corners. Im saying the proper model should be three. But ya you got what im saying, shame we don\u2019t have a terminology for it. Alls im saying is that my \u201ctesseract\u201d model might just be called a 4D object instead of tesseract. Like how a cube is a 3D model.","3":"The proper model is 8 and if you look closely you will see 8 cubes in that picture, not 2. They look strange because of perspective but there are always 8 perfect cubes in the picture. Why is it that you think there should be 3 cubes?","4":"Also could you post a picture of the Tesseract model you\u2019re talking about because the one I am used to is a much more simplified version sounds like. Standing still it is a cube inside of a Cube and when moving it just rotates in an out if itself.","5":"Yup, that\u2019s the one. There are indeed 8 cubes in that picture. But only two of them are obvious so you will often not notice the other 6. The space between the parallel faces of the inner and outer cubes is itself a cube."}}
