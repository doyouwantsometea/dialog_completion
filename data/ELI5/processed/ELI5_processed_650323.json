Sure, some of them are from people being idiots and not using birth control. But a lot are from birth control failing. So people did take precautions (birth control) and still got pregnant (despite taking precautions not to).   So really, what you're saying, all those women would have to do, is not have sex. Which, in a way, is a valid point. But given the way humans are, that's not a feasable advice and not something you can base your argument on. Plus, people have tried that, by having abstinence only sex ed. That leads to a lot of teenage pregnancies. I think we can safely conclude that preaching abstinance as a form of birth control doesn't really work.","2":"I clearly never said that women Should not have sex. Please quote where I said that. If women don\u2019t have sex, that means I won\u2019t have sex, and I surely don\u2019t want that. Try not to get emotional and just think of this reasonably and rationally and simply explain it like I asked","3":"You are suggesting that women should just not get pregnant. The only way women can 100% not get pregnant is by not having sex.","4":"Actually that\u2019s not true. If you really want to be technical a complete hysterectomy is 100% guarantee that you will not get pregnant","5":"Yes, so is having a castrated partner. Not really 5he point of your \"debate\"","6":"Actually I did \u2018castrate\u2019 myself via vasectomy  Why are you getting so hostile toward me? I told you I\u2019m OK with abortion. What more do you fucking want?","7":"Actualy, a vasectomy is not 100% guaranteed to prevent pregnancy, there's a chance for it to fail and for sperm to get through and the woman might still get pregnant.   I don't think I'm any more hostile than you are."}}
