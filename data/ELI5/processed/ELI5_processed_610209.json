I'm kind of shook and overwhelmed by all of this, can someone break down Hong Kong's history with China to me and what the heck happened with the opium wars?","1":"This is so skewed.  Brits traded their silver for chinese tea. Brits drink so much tea. Brits ran out of silver. So brits drugged chinese people into addiction, essentially making a hostage situation.  The ransom being hong kong with 99 years lease.  The class divide in hong kong was intentionally made by the brits that also functions as a method of wealth transfer from the colony to the capital by lending money to a small number of local populace under 2 conditions:  * the money has to be used to buyout bankrupt british firms in hong kong. * some of the following profit must be invested in british owned corporations.","2":"This is so dirty and I believe you. It makes my soul sad and sick. What rich powerful people do to stay rich and powerful is usually fucking disgusting.","3":"Yea, i wouldn\u2019t blame the average british citizen on the atrocities done by the plutocrates tbh.  Because if you ask an average british factory worker in the 60s about hong kong, he\u2019d probably have no idea at all (though they *do* get some or a little benefit from it)  But there\u2019s a good reason why the queen went around being guarded by mp5 wielding security personnels. Even her irish neighbors would love to pop a cap at her.  Also, the east india companies are literal embodiment of evil. The treatment of black slaves as financial assets is dirty but the treatment of asian workers as expendable, replacable labour that are buried in mass graves upon death by overworking and get replaced with a fresh batch on demand is taking it to a whole new level.","4":"Yeah, it's not the average Joe doing these things, that's for sure. Idk where we went wrong as a species but it definitely makes me sad.","5":"That\u2019s the nature of large organizations such as corporation, actually.  Milgram test proves that following the authority beat basic social instincts. And that\u2019s what corporations (east indies included) are; just a large group of people following orders.  The workers just follow the order from the manager. The managers just follow the order from the director. The directors just follow the order from the fund manager. The fund managers just follow the orders from the investors.... and the investors are just the workers saving their hard-earned wage in the banks.  See? Easy to do it since no one\u2019s responsible, everyone\u2019s just doing their job.","6":"Aw, man. This just makes me think of the military and now I might go drink my last two beers and listen to Bob marley and cry."}}
