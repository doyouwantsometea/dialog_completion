I feel your pain, exacerbated by the cold. Just the cold alone is enough to make my fingers hurt enough to consider amputation. About 35\u00b0 F seems to be the point where it starts. The rest of me is fine, just my fingers have the issue.","2":"Nope, my fingers hate the cold. I can rock shorts and a hoodie in the cold no problem, but I need giant South Pole gloves. When biking in the cold, my knees and face can freeze up and it's fine, but once the cold gets through those gloves,  call me Bill Paxton, cuz it's game over,  man.","3":"I've been wondering of late if arm compression sleeves might help. I wear gloves for work and most of the time I'm not in my house. Have to protect my dish pan hands. But I wear thin gloves because I need nimble fingers. They don't really protect against the cold. I suppose it's worth a try.","4":"Wouldn't that restrict blood flow to your fingers? Seems like that's the problem, less blood in the extremities makes for more ouch. You should mount a battery powered hair dryer to the side of your head. Then it will blow at your hands when you're working. Problem solved!","5":"They are supposed to promote circulation. Sports people use them all the time.  No room for the hair dryer next to the ear protection. Maybe if I just didn't work on cold days?  I do know they have battery powered gloves to keep your hands warm. Might work for your cycling, but I know I'd destroy them doing remodels."}}
