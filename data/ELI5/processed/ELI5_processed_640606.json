It's just a thin layer of tight plastic","1":"Aside from draft prevention and trapping an air pocket for insulation, there is a third effect not mentioned yet.  Plastic film blocks  infrared radiation, particularly the long wave infrared associated with heat while letting visible light through.","2":"So does this mean leaving the plastic up in summer would block out heat?","3":"&gt; So does this mean leaving the plastic up in summer would block out heat?  It will trap the heat inside your house just like it does in the winter.  This is how greenhouses work.","4":"Oh. Duh \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2642\ufe0f","5":"I mean, yes, technically, it will block low  wavelength IR from coming in, just like it blocks it from going out.  However, it still lets in the higher wavelength stuff, which your furnishings absorb and re-emit as low frequency IR."}}
