How do they do this? Are they really listening in to me?","1":"I would like to know this as well.  I was talking to a contractor about the possible use of laminated beams to fix an issue with our house, low and behold, the next day Chrome started adding ads for laminated beam manufacturers in the articles I was reading.  I never used my phone, or any other device to look up information about them.  Just a verbal conversation.","2":"That\u2019s very creepy. In my instance, I got an ad for the exact LED model i had to replace and what i ended up buying. Again, never googled it","3":"Is the debit card you used to buy them the same one you use to buy things on the net?","4":"No not at all. Would be even scarier if it was because that would mean my card number is on the net and is associated with my name and IP address.","5":"I was thinking more along the lines of Mother Google keeping an eye on what you are buying, even if it isn't something you bought online.  The amount of data mining they can do is creepy.  Wouldn't be surprised if they can snoop on your bank account."}}
