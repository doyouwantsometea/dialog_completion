The words \"white\" and \"black\" were not (and are not) used to accurately identify where people come from, but to define status and class. If you look into it, you can find cases of people 'looking' white but being classed 'black' and vice versa because these words meant things like slave status, power, and money, not what a person looks like. Something like 'pink' is not a relevant descriptor because using 'white' and 'black' is not about what people actually look like. If you are interested and the question is genuine, please look into this yourself and educate yourself on the topic. Whether you meant it or not, a question like this comes across quite ignorant and potentially offensive.","2":"It is a real question and I don't want be offensive and sorry if it seems that way. I am interested because my wife and I entered the US and had a nice holiday. We had to choose in the immigration form if we were black, white, etc. She is from Brazil and chose 'white' because she isn't Hispanic or black... It was genuinely confusing.","3":"I'm really sorry, I misundersood your phrasing. I appreciate that it's a genuine question and I didn't mean to sound harsh in any way. It is a complicated topic and does have the potential to sound offensive and disingenuous, but I'm sorry for misunderstanding your intentions.","4":"Thank you ! It is a tough question to ask without seeming biased or having an agenda of some sort. I really hope it doesn't come across that way. I have enourmous respect for all Americans.... All people actually :-)","5":"Not thick at all, it's my fault for interpreting negative intent when you simply wanted to ask a question. The last few days there's been a lot of discussion on the topic because of what's been in the news and I have seen a lot of people belittling what's going on by saying they don't get it or that they don't see colour and things like that, so I reacted negatively when I shouldn't have. Hope you have a nice day :)"}}
