They don\u2019t put money back into the economy, or rarely do. Think of it in terms of neighborhoods. You have poor, upscale, and rich. When the housing society of the rich neighborhood gets money from the people in it, do you honestly think some of that money makes it down to the upscale neighborhood? Same goes for the upscale to the poor. When you\u2019re rich, everything because a \u201cprivate\u201d. Private planes, cars, healthcare, etc. Services that cater to the rich are only offered to them. Oh... an easier example would be plane sections. Does any food or drink from 1st class make it to coach? Sure... they bought a ticket in the air plain but did it really help the plane go anywhere? What happened if someone from coach tries to sit in 1st? There you go.","2":"Airlines are interesting. They only way they stay barely profitable is using thr business class. Thr economy class has low to no profitability. In a sense, people flying business class are sustaining that business model.  Rich people are spending their money no? Buying cars, buying houses, traveling, etc. The money goes back i to the economy.  The money they have in terms of assets is no different than what you have as your own assets. Just less. If I buy a house, and tomorrow a mall gets built next to it and suddenly my house is worth 10x more and I am a millionaire in net worth, should society hate me?  If I buy stock options, and get rich over night, am I now a bad guy?","3":"I think you need more experience on that circle. Then this question would be different. Especially the bit about money going back into the economy.","4":"This is why it's an ELI5?","5":"True... how about adding in the notion that each \u201cclass\u201d has their own economy."}}
