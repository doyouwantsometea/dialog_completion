Specifically a flu shot.","1":"Good in you :)  Please get vaccinated for everything that is available. It helps protect your community.","2":"To be honest all I hear about is flu vaccines. What else is available?","3":"Measles, chicken pox and a whole range of other diseases.  Ask your doctor, they will gladly give you an overview.","4":"Do most people have a doctor? Because I don't, I haven't seen a doctor in years outside of an ER and that was for injuries.","5":"Depends on where you come from. In Germany you have a general practitioner that is \"your doctor\". It gets documented with your health insurance.  In Norway you get a doctor assigned and are not allowed to go to a different one, except for emergencies (afaik)."}}
