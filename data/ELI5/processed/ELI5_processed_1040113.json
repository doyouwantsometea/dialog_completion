Does such a program S make sense to you?","2":"No.  Not in the slightest.","3":"Hm. Then I'm out of ideas because I don't really understand what you don't understand. Sorry this didn't work out.","4":"I don't understand how H(a,b) got transformed into H(x,x) and why it needed to be transformed.  I don't understand how H(x,x) could be a thing.  I don't understand how P(P) could be a thing, or what it would look like (no explanation I've seen actually walks through what happens).  In short, feeding a program to itself makes no sense to me.","5":"Do you understand that H(a,b) and H(c,d) are the same thing?","6":"Yes, I understand that those are the same thing (or at least it's possible that they could be the same thing).  One thing that's tripping me up is how and why H(a,b)--which is still my lifeline here--got transformed to H(x,x) in the subroutine, and how H(x,x) could even be coherently evaluated.  Then the final (or maybe not final, I'm getting sleepy) difficulty is P(P).  Don't even understand how to begin understanding what that could entail (i.e., I don't understand how a program's only argument could be the program itself, or what it would do with that argument, not to mention the difficulty that P contains a subroutine with H(x,x)).","7":"So is the problem with H(x,x) just that both arguments are the same, or is it that it looks at x(x)?","8":"I don't know what looks at \"x(x)\" means.  I don't understand how H(a,b)--which makes sense to me--got transformed to H(x,x) in the subroutine, or why it had to be transformed.  Beyond that, I don't know how H(x,x) would work.  Or how the \"program\" and the \"input\" of H(a,b) could somehow be the same thing (which is what H(x,x) implies to me--if I've misunderstood that, please let me know).  And beyond that, I truly don't know how to process or think about P(P).","9":"Alright, so H(a,b) is when you describe what H does. You have to call them differently because they're different arguments, even if they could be the same.  H(x,x) is then running that routine with *specific* arguments. Essentially, it runs H(a,b), but with a=x and b=x. The cause of the transformation is that we're no longer looking at the definition of H, but at the application of H.","10":"Why does H(x,x) need to be run in the way it does?  And how is H(x,x) even a thing?  I still don't understand how a program and the input to the program (i.e., the two arguments for the subroutine) can be the very same thing.","11":"Hm I might be out of ideas trying to explain it...","12":"Updated the post."}}
