No, it doesn\u2019t make sense to me, because it\u2019s completely irrelevant. Don\u2019t patronize me, dickhead.","2":"huh?","3":"I\u2019m saying there\u2019s a distinction between *avoiding getting too much sun* and *going out of your way to lighten your skin*. Even if you go to the beach with cloth over your skin, you\u2019ll still be exposed to the sunlight, and it\u2019ll still make you darker. Just the same as how you can get a sunburn through the clouds. The only way to actively make your skin lighter would be to avoid sunlight altogether, and if there are alternative methods, just as someone else mentioned, they\u2019d likely be very unhealthy for you or your skin.","4":"What makes you assume that covering your skin with clothe doesn't prevent tanning? Literally people get the \"trucker\" tan this way?  And in any case, the risk for tanning and skin lightning seem to be pretty up there anyway, so not sure hot his is relevant?","5":"https:\/\/goodlookingtan.com\/can-you-tan-through-clothing\/  &gt;\u201dCan you tan through clothing? The simple answer is yes, you can. While all materials are different, clothes should not be relied on to prevent the sun\u2019s harmful rays from reaching your skin.\u201d  *You\u2019re not sure how this is relevant?* Go back and reread our argument my guy, my argument has stayed pretty consistent while yours has been hardly coherent.","6":"Yeah totally, specially with the insult, lol","7":"I edited it out already because I realized it was immature, but you were absolutely being patronizing while barely putting up any sort of argument, you were misguidedly condescending and it made me want to insult you. My apologies. Anyway, considering your last couple replies, it looks like we\u2019re done here. Have a nice day.","8":"Good night!"}}
