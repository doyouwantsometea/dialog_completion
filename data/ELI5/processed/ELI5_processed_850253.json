How do they do this? Are they really listening in to me?","1":"&gt;lights  Lights are very common. This is like when people were talking about how amazon was listening to them because they mentioned wanting to get water from the water fountain and amazon suggested buying a waterfountain.   Solid theory, except that it was black friday and I also got that ad as long as like everyone else.   I believe it's closer to confirmation bias. You see lots of ads. When you talk about something, you become more aware of it. When it catches your eye you freak out and all of a sudden, everyone is listening to you.   If anyone disagrees, please provide evidence that is stronger than I think it does, therefor it is.   I'm aware that some apps have stolen information in the past for ads, but I'd like to know if Facebook or Google is doing this.","2":"not basic lights i\u2019m talking about the entire LED structure that i replaced. amazon was able to give me an ad for that EXACT model. i never google searched it or anything similar to it at all. this was done all in person.","3":"So did you announce the exact product name in earshot of your phone?","4":"no not at all. we simply went to the store, bought it in cash, came home, and replaced it.","5":"If you didn't say the name of the product then why is your question if they're listening to you?  how else would they get the exact product. It looks like it was confirmation bias. You're looking for the product now and you found it.","6":"if you look at my post, you\u2019ll see that i ask \u201chow are they doing this\u201d. i don\u2019t know how they\u2019re doing this. how is this confirmation bias?","7":"Rather than \"looking for the product\" it's just that you are more aware.   I recently got a specific car. I never noticed how many people have my car because before, I never paid attention to it.   You see hundreds of ads a day. This is a few of those ads."}}
