Secondly, sales tax varies greatly from city to city and so you won't see nationally available products advertised with tax included anyway, so people are accustomed to just mentally adding an extra few percentages to their expected total. Do I know EXACTLY what my total will be before I check out? No, but I really don't need to. I know it's generally going to be X amount, and I just wait to see the exact total before I slide my card. It doesn't really change anything.","2":"So, in short, it\u2019s because the states charge different amounts of tax and businesses want to make their products *seem* cheaper?","3":"Not just state to state, but city to city. The store across the street could be totally different, which makes it difficult to advertise.","4":"Why is tax higher for certain stores and not others? I can understand different states having different tax rates, and potentially even different cities having different taxes, but why would it change store to store in the same town\/city?","5":"My point was that the other side of the road might be in another city technically, and so will have different taxation.","6":"Oh, I see."}}
