(Like, the inside of a machine... Like a camshaft in an engine? I would be stumbling finding words for describing that, yet I can visualise one from multiple angles easily, yet I've never handled one in person!)  Btw, I'm trying to track down a quote about imagination and describing\/visualising things, from which (if my memory is right) the camshaft example comes","2":"Ok its like this: I simply know how something looks like, but cant see it. If I close my eyes and try to imagine it I simply know what I want to imagine and know everything it consists of but I just cant see it. Very rarely I can see it vividly but again, that when Im sleeping or right before, cant control it though. I dont need to say inside what the item consists of because it happens so fast. Its like I can almost imagine it but not really. Unfortunately its really hard to explain for me.","3":"I found the quote I was thinking of... an anecdote from Richard Feynman, arguably one of the greatest physicists of the 20th century.   &amp;#x200B;  &gt;When I was a  kid growing up in Far Rockaway, I  had a friend named Bernie Walker. We both had \"labs\" at home, and we would do various \"experiments.\" One time, we were discussing something - we must have been 11 or 12 at the time - and I  said, \"But thinking is nothing but talking to yourself inside.\"       &gt;   &gt;\"Oh yeah?\" Bernie said. \"Do you know the crazy shape of the crankshaft in car?\"      &gt;   &gt;\"Yeah, what of it?\"      &gt;   &gt;\"Good. Now tell me: how did you describe it when you were talking to yourself?\"       &gt;   &gt;So I  learned from Bernie that thoughts can be visual as well as verbal.   &amp;#x200B;  \u2014 [http:\/\/calteches.library.caltech.edu\/607\/2\/Feynman.pdf](http:\/\/calteches.library.caltech.edu\/607\/2\/Feynman.pdf)","4":"Thats one amazing quote, I like it. After reading the flooding comments, I really focused on imagining things and for the first time, literally right now, I made up a little colorless movie of a sheep jumping through a yard and then it somehow turned into a suit wearing sheep and it robbed a bank and then I lost focus. Yeah I dont know what happened really","5":"The whole piece is worth reading - it talks about how some people count to themselves audibly (imagining a voice counting, as it were), and some people count to themselves visually (imagining watching a clock) - and how the different types of thinking to yourself affects your ability to do different things simultaneously.      Goes on to describe how Feynman then tried to learn to do both (as have I since reading this. And like Feynman, have failed).      More importantly, the larger point of the story is about how even basic everyday things that are \"universal\" can be done in completely unexpected and, frankly, alien seeming ways for other people! :)"}}
