How does it differ from normal ammo","1":"No, actually.  The \"standard\" round for the M16 rifle (and other weapons that use 5.56 ammunition) is something called M855, which is *like* full metal jacket ammo, but it's tipped with a little bit of steel that's colored green (which is why you sometimes hear it called 'green-tip') to enhance its ability to punch through obstacles.  The relatively high ratio of muzzle velocity to bullet weight leads the other popular round, the M193, to fragment near explosively when it hits something.","2":"Huh! That\u2019s pretty cool as long as you\u2019re not on the receiving end!","3":"Oh, absolutely. If I had to be shot with one of the two, and I had a choice? Give me the green-tip penetrator any day of the week. It's a lot more likely to go straight through and leave a cleaner injury with a better prognosis for recovery.","4":"Only if you\u2019re unarmored though, an HP round might not get ya shot in the first place if you\u2019ve got kevlar but FMJ will from what I\u2019ve heard. From a 5.56 at least, from what I\u2019ve heard.","5":"It depends on the \"level\" of armor you're wearing. *Any* 5.56 round travels so damn fast that it will basically slice right through anything level IIIA or below, hollow-point or not.  The \"levels\" are a concept from the National Institute of Justice, and refer to the types of rounds that a given body armor will stop. Kevlar is basically rated to stop handgun rounds only; armor that stops rifle rounds will generally include hard ceramic or steel plates. A level III plate, for example, is rated to stop six shots from a 7.62 round (the 5.56's bigger, nastier brother) before it fails.","6":"But 7.62-38 doesn\u2019t pierce as much as 5.46 does"}}
