If you went to the ocean, got a bucket of water and put it on the garbage can then no that isn't really much of a waste. But if you take clean drinking water that a lot of people don't even have access to and throw it out, then yeah that's wasting water. Honestly, this question just made me shake my head like cmon.","2":"But the water will remain there, right? I believe if we're like planning missions to Mars we surely would have the tech to clean ocean water, right?","3":"The water will remain where?? What the hell are you talking about?","4":"&gt;The water will remain where??  On Earth? \u2022_\u2022 that's probably what the question is??","5":"Yeah?? Where else do you think it'll go?? When people say waste water they mean drinkable water.","6":"&gt;Where else do you think it'll go??  Idk man you seemed to be the one not knowing that fact lol.  &amp;nbsp;  &gt;drinkable water.  And we have resources to clean up the water. So essentially it can be consumed even if it's polluted?","7":"You're the one who asked a stupid question which you then edited. Not my problem","8":"Lol no need to be salty. There's are other ways to express your frustration too.","9":"Yeah well maybe you should figure out how to filter my saltyness while you're at it. It's not that we can purify salt water. It's that we shouldn't. I mean the amount of negative affects that would have on the planet alone makes it a bad idea.","10":"That's what I'm asking. What are those effects? Your saltiness affects your and your close ones it's not a global issue so leave me out of it lol.","11":"You have like 5 people telling you the same thing and all you do is argue. So why did you ask the question at all? Either you're a troll or need to accept the answers you get or look iy up yourself and shut up","12":"u\/already-taken-wtf is literally the only one who has perhaps provided something meaningful to look into. I suggest you work on your issues mate, there's a discussion going on which has disagreements. Seems like you're too into yourself to realise that.","13":"There's no disagreements. It's you asking the same question 15 times expecting a different answer. Just because im telling you how it is and how you're acting doesn't mean i have issues.","14":"Good luck with your issues (if any), hope you find some solutions (if required). Have a nice day \u262e\ufe0f","15":"Good luck getting the answer you're looking for by asking the same question 15 times.","16":"Cheers. Have a good day:)"}}
