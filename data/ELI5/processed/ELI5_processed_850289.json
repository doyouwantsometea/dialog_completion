All systems will tend towards an equilibrium. Imagine you're hitting a golfball around a field for a million years, and there's a single rabbit hole somewhere in that field. Odds are the ball will eventually wind up in that hole, and once it does it is going to stay there.  The ball being in that hole is loosely analogous to life - it is something that is very unlikely but given enough time and the right circumstances it will eventually happen.  As for why life is stable, that's sort of by definition. If it weren't stable, then it wouldn't be life. Plenty of little bits of molecules stuck together in the ocean over several million or billion or trillion years, but they all fell apart. The one that didn't fall apart and instead replicated itself by complete accident was the one that survived long enough to evolve into humans, who promptly named this self-sustaining process \"life\".","2":"Thanks for the answer.  I understand that life dosent want anything, but Im wondering more what are the laws and mechanisms that makes it so that for an example viruses have the tendency to self replicate? If all systems seek an equlibrium it seems counter-intuitive to me that strains of genetic acid molecules have the tendency to get ever more complex (or simple and effecient as in viruses) just to sustain an incredibly complex system.","3":"Stability and complexity are unrelated. The added complexity *in some contexts* clearly makes life more able to sustain itself, otherwise it wouldn't evolve. In places where it is not useful, it does not evolve. This is why viruses are simple - they don't benefit from added complexity.  As for exactly how they work, they take advantage of the complexity in their hosts. The complicated things like growing and protecting oneself and getting food and reproducing are all handled by the host cell. *Somebody* has to do those things, and the virus simply allows the host cell to do them. Viruses don't even really understand how to make more viruses - they simply turn themselves over to the advanced machinery of the host and allow the host to use its own 'knowledge' of replication to make more virus.","4":"I get that viruses are simple because they dont benefit from added complexity, but I mean in terms of chemistry even viruses are incredibly complex compared to the elements on the periodic table. How does one go from these elements to long strains of acid thats specificly coded to replicate itself in a system that at all times tends toward an equlibrium?","5":"Many systems can be self-sustaining so long as they have 'food'. While we don't know the exact path that life followed as it formed, it seems safe to say that a very rudimentary von Neumann 'machine' molecule or arrangement of molecules came to be which then developed more and more complex 'programs' that eventually became DNA.  Again, such developments are very unlikely, but given the sheer number of molecules forming and breaking in the oceans even now, on the order of quintillions or more every second, over the course of trillions of years, it shouldn't be too shocking that it happened *once*.","6":"Im sorry a rudimentary what? Remember Im five years old.  What was the mechanism for the development into more and more complex programs? Simply sheer chance? Is there something in the chemistry that specificly makes it likely that these molecules are \"programed\" in endlessly different \"programs\" untill we have DNA?     Thank you very much for your answer! Very cool","7":"Oop - I slipped into nerdspeak. A von Neumann machine is a machine that can replicate itself by first building a body and 'downloading' the blueprint for that body into it allowing the new body to then replicate again.  As for the exact chemistry of it all, that is unfortunately beyond my knowledge. Organic chem is hell."}}
