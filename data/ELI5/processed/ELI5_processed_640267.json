Specifically a flu shot.","1":"Yes","2":"Thanks for clarifying this. I've never had the flu.","3":"Good in you :)  Please get vaccinated for everything that is available. It helps protect your community.","4":"To be honest all I hear about is flu vaccines. What else is available?","5":"Measles, chicken pox and a whole range of other diseases.  Ask your doctor, they will gladly give you an overview.","6":"Do most people have a doctor? Because I don't, I haven't seen a doctor in years outside of an ER and that was for injuries.","7":"Depends on where you come from. In Germany you have a general practitioner that is \"your doctor\". It gets documented with your health insurance.  In Norway you get a doctor assigned and are not allowed to go to a different one, except for emergencies (afaik)."}}
