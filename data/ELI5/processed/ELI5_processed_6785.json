Placing something on a spectrum like the political left\/right is not done based on its name but on its properties and actions.","2":"Haha for sure. Like the DPRNK. Thats different though, because they call themselves democratic but historians don't. Where historian's seem to agree that the Nazi Party is far-right. They teach it in school to this day.","3":"I don't understand how those two differ. NaZi = National Socialist and socialism is not right wing let alone far right. It's just that the term 'nazi' and 'national socialist' has become an *example* of far right ideology. It didn't change the meaning of socialism.","4":"If the left and right axis is based on economy (regulation vs. open market) then Nazis would be left of centre wouldn't they?","5":"I'm not sure what the answer would tell you, because left\/right wing is based on more than economy oriented properties and in contrast to regular parties the Nazi party didn't follow a single ideology even in that regard.  Also if you would draw out the Nazi party's separate beliefs and policies you get more like a shotgun blast at various parts of the spectrum. Some policies could be seen as extreme left, some centrist-left, a lot far right obviously etc. So that way you can't 'fit' the party into a specific part of the spectrum. This is a key feature of this kind of parties that transcend the classical political classification that is left\/right wing. Nowadays it's more common for populist parties in Europe (don't know much about other parts of the world) where you see a combination of popular policies on both the left and right wing to 'attract' more followers if you call it that, but then also joined with a lot of far right policies, often played down to not be classified as such that easily.","6":"Thats where my understanding was overly simplistic. I thought the way it's commonly described referred only to economics and the idealogies attached to each side was an organic natural occurrence."}}
