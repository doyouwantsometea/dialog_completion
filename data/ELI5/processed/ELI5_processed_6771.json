It\u2019s like lead poisoning.","2":"A banana is also radioactive, I guess we should stop eating bananas","3":"I feel like you\u2019re being purposely obtuse here.  Potassium is slightly radioactive, but you also need it to live.  Uranium, plutonium, and the like are not essential for life, and are magnitudes more radioactive.  Dumping them in the ocean is a very bad idea.    I\u2019m not sure how much simpler we can make this.","4":"My point is, I think that whatever amount we dump into the ocean would not matter much because when spread throughout the ocean, the average concentration would be sufficiently low that is does not matter. So far, the most convincing answer I have seen in this post is about how the food chain will gather the radioactivity together into those at the top of the food chain. Those, we tend to consume.","5":"&gt; My point is, I think that whatever amount we dump into the ocean would not matter much because when spread throughout the ocean, the average concentration would be sufficiently low that is does not matter.  My point, and everyone else\u2019s, is that this is just not true.  It would matter.  Fukushima mattered, Chernobyl mattered.    Nuclear waste isn\u2019t the same as a banana.  Hell, it\u2019s not even the same as a nuclear bomb.  Different isotopes, different half lives.    Hiroshima and Nagasaki are occupied to this day.  Chernobyl still isn\u2019t, over 33 years later.","6":"I think seafood from Fukushima has been declared safe to eat. Which seems surprisingly short given the tens of thousands of years of half life. Ad for the difference between, the A bombs and Chernobyl, could you explain that too?"}}
