It's particularly notable when the gases are those other than the standard air mix of nitrogen, oxygen, CO2, and argon. Plus water vapor.  For example, if you open a manhole, the hydrogen sulfide will be near the bottom, because it's heavier than air. If the space has carbon monoxide in it, it could be near the top, as it's slightly lighter than air. CO2 is heavier than air, which is why you can use it to create a a ground fog. Methane is lighter than air, but flammable vapors of organic solvents tend to be heavier.   This is super important because you have to know where to look for these things before sending workers into confined spaces. Stratification of gases is a key understanding.","2":"If that's the case, then shouldn't we all suffocate because co2 would be at ground level?","3":"No. There is another post in this thread that explains atmospheric gases in normal concentrations better than I can.  But global CO2 concentration is 400 ppm. CO2 isn't threatening your life until about 40,000ppm. So even if that were the case, you would never know.","4":"This question was posted in the r\/askscience sub. The answers went clear over my head.","5":"Does it make more sense now?","6":"Hell yeah. Thanks bruh"}}
