So yeah, Pangea is just one of them, just that we know much more of it because of all the evidence left from the age of dinosaurs, that happens to be a lot.","2":"Yeah, that makes sense. I guess that I just assumed that whilst the continents do move, they just don't move around a whole lot.","3":"It's understandable to think that since we probably never live to see any major change of the continents locations. Remember that this process that it's currently happening, takes hundreds millions of years to complete, so we can only suppose how it will end up.","4":"Fair enough! I guess that if humanity is still around on Earth by that point, there'll probably be scientists then who can study how the continents shifted. But getting into that is more just speculation about what will and won't happen.","5":"Imagine a brand new whole inteligent species from that time trying to figure it out how were the continents located using human fossils, artifacts and ruins as clues.  Well, we know for sure that Australia moves 7cm to the north every year, so in a couple million years it will probably clash with Indonesia, then all the way to the north until finally clashing with China.","6":"Well, at least we have some idea of what might happen."}}
