But if the math is the baseline for the correct way and that would mean they can\u2019t be imaginary otherwise the math would be wrong?","3":"Thats a false dichotomy. I could imagine the design of a new car but that doesn't mean all the math I use is wrong because it hasn't been built yet. Math literally has something called imaginary numbers which are critical to use in many applications but have no physical meaning.","4":"Yeah I get all that but I don\u2019t you see the irony in claiming that I am wrong because the numbers that may or may not exist actually say that I am? Haha i mean how can you be so sure im wrong?","5":"You are using a word that has a definition. You can look it up in any dictionary and it would be pretty similar. When we say \u201cthis is what a dimension is\u201d you cannot argue or say maybe it\u2019s different. It is whatever we say it is. If I had 3 cats and then bought a fourth cat then that cat will not have wheels instead of legs. It won\u2019t photosynthesize. It won\u2019t breathe water. It will not do those things because cats don\u2019t do that. It\u2019s the definition of a cat. The same is with a dimension. It has a meaning and always behaves the same. It cannot act like something else because then it would **be** something else.","6":"Yeah like I said I think I just got the terminology all mixed up"}}
