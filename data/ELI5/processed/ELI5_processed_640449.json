How?","1":"How can a surgery cost that much.. Americas health system is so fucked up.. That's like 4 years salary for me to go under a knife for a few hours what justifies those costs \ud83d\ude12","2":"Agreed. Crazy thing is the surgery was only about an hour.","3":"Jesus christ... What hours work cost over a hundred grand... I'm so sorry to hear your in that situation. It almost sounds illegal to charge that much..   What the absolute fuck man. ","4":"I'm not in any situation. We are not required to pay the difference, or billed any amount for that matter.","5":"I taught when you said he got a bill of 113k and that medicaid paid 13 I taught u owed them 100k I must of just assumed as it wasn't made clear ( for me) I don't know how your health care system works all I do know is it is fucked and charges people stupid amounts.
