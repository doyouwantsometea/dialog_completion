Doesn't that contradict the very definition of \"infinite\"?","1":"How will you know your list is complete though? No matter when you think your done, someone will point out a number your missing. You can't say that there are as many natural numbers as real numbers until your list is complete. ","2":"&gt;How will you know your list is complete though?  You cannot complete a list of infinite things, and I don't just mean physically. To have something completed means to have ThisMuch\/ThisMuch, infinity is not a quantity. You can't have infinity out of infinite. You can't say Infinity\/Infinity is whole, complete, 100%, 1.","3":"Making an infinite list isn't impossible. You just have to show how each real number gets mapped to each natural number and that you didn't miss any. It's trivial to map the natural numbers to the real numbers, just use n -&gt; n (ex 1 maps to 1, 2 maps to 2 etc.)","4":"But that function isn't the \"completed\" list itself. It's a method, a program, we'd use to make the list. The list itself can't be completed, because completing something infinite is logically incoherent.","5":"The function contains all the information you need, try to find an even number that wouldn't be on my list if I printed it out.","6":"&gt;try to find an even number that wouldn't be on my list if I printed it out.  Again, this makes no sense. This is supposed to be infinite. To give this list to me, or to even finish it so you can print it, you'd have to stop at some point. And you'd be missing infinite elements of the list. You'd be missing just as many as if you'd given me a blank piece of paper.","7":"I thought you said you understood the diagonalization argument? Why are you arguing about the impossibility of making a physical list? Is that what you would need to convince you that you can get any even number by multiplying a natural number by 2?","8":"&gt;Why are you arguing about the impossibility of making a physically infinite list?  I'm not! This list is logically impossible to make, because making it means finishing it, and finishing, completing something means to have all that would fit into something. It means to have ThisMuch out of ThisSameMuch. To have that with something that's infinite, infinite would have to be equal to infinite. It would mean Infinite\/Infinite=1.","9":"I don't see why any of that is a problem. Who cares if a list\/set isn't finite? You can still do math on sets with infinite elements, talk about what is in the set and what is not in the set. Math doesn't put limits on things like physics does. ","10":"&gt;completing something means to have all that would fit into something. It means to have ThisMuch out of ThisSameMuch. To have that with something that's infinite, infinite would have to be equal to infinite. It would mean Infinite\/Infinite=1  You don't see how Infinite\/Infinite=1 is a problem??  &gt;You can still do math on sets with infinite elements, talk about what is in the set and what is not in the set.  You can do math on a finite number of elements that are on the list","11":"&gt;You don't see how Infinite\/Infinite=1 is a problem??  Is 1\/1 = 1 a problem? Is 2\/2 = 1 a problem? Why would infinite\/infinite = 1 be a problem?  &gt;You can do math on a finite number of elements that are on the list  If you do math on all of the elements at the same time, who cares whether there are finite or infinite number of them?","12":"&gt;Is 1\/1 = 1 a problem? Is 2\/2 = 1 a problem? Why would infinite\/infinite = 1 be a problem if they are the same infinity?  Because it would mean Infinite = Infinite, and that's nonsense. Treating infinite as a number is like treating a train as a train stop  &gt;If you do math on all of the elements at the same time, who cares whether there are finite or infinite number of them?  But you can't do math of all of something infinite, you can't have *all* of something *infinite*. Having *all* of something means to have 10\/10, 62\/62, SomethingFinite\/SamethingFinite","13":"&gt;Because it would mean Infinite = Infinite, and that's nonsense.   How is something being equal to itself nonsense? It would be nonsense if it wasn't true.   &gt;But you can't do math on all of something infinite.  How then do people solve infinite sums? Certainly not by adding one term at a time.","14":"&gt;How is something being equal to itself nonsense? It would be nonsense if it wasn't true.   And it is true, but Infinite isn't *something* so you can't compare it, not even to itself","15":"Of course it is, cardinality of infinite sets is well established in math.","16":"&gt;Typically you turn them into a recursive equation then solve it algebraically.  Exactly. This doesn't solve the infinite sum, this solves the equation.  &gt;Of course it is, cardinality of infinite sets is well established in math.  But cardinality of infinite sets is not Infinity itself","17":"&gt; Exactly. This doesn't solve the infinite sum, this solves the equation. The equation represents the sum, but is not the sum itself.  The solution to the equation is the sum, just as x = 2 is both the sum and the solution to 1 + 1 = x. What is so hard to grasp about this?  &gt;But cardinality of infinite sets is not Infinity itself  It's a measure of the size of infinite sets, which determines what infinites are bigger or smaller than others. This is exactly what you asked by starting this thread. You can't just dismiss the mathematics of comparing infinities because you don't understand it.","18":"&gt;The solution to the equation is the sum, just as x = 2 is both the sum and the solution to 1 + 1 = x. What is so hard to grasp about this?  ...Right, because there's no difference between the way you solve 1+1 and the way you \"solve\" an infinite sum  &gt;It's a measure of the size of infinite sets, which determines what infinites are bigger or smaller than others. This is exactly what you asked by starting this thread. You can't just dismiss the mathematics of comparing infinities because you don't understand it.  But I do understand it, what I don't understand is how mathematics acts as if what they're talking about is actual infinity. This is not infinity, not if you can compare it. Do you not understand the impossibility of comparing something impossible?","19":"I'm thinking the issue is that someone misled you about the nature of infinity and now you are at a point that you need to unlearn some wrong ideas before you'll make any progression towards a deeper understanding about the nature of infinities. Your talking as if infinity is some concept independent of mathematics when it's not. There is nothing about the nature of infinity that makes it incomparable to anything else, despite whatever you have been told.","20":"&gt;There is nothing about the nature of infinity that makes it incomparable to anything else, despite whatever you have been told.  It's not anything I've been told. In fact, I used to just believe what my math teachers said, and different sizes of infinity was one of those things. It's after becoming more skeptical that I've been able to truly thing through the concept of infinity. Realising it is impossible.  &gt;Your talking as if infinity is some concept independent of mathematics when it's not.  It is. Of course it is. Because it's impossible. How can anyone pretend to operate, study or even just imagine something impossible?","21":"Show that it's impossible then. You haven't given my any reason to believe you.","22":"If it was possible it would make sense, if it was possible, Infinite=Infinite would be true, Infinite-Infinite=0 would be true, Infinite+1=Infinite would be true and therefore 1=0 would be true.","23":"If infinite \/= infinite, then infinite +1 \/= infinite +1 and so 1 \/= 1. See, I can do it too, you haven't fixed the issue.","24":"...yeah  When did I give the impression that I thought it was 0? I think I said precisely the opposite","25":"You made the assumption in your derivation that 1 = 0 starting from inf = inf. I pointed out you made a mistake and so you didn't prove any logical fallacy.","26":"Uh... You do realise i can just erase that \"step\" and the whole thing is the exact same?","27":"No you can't, not without making another mistake. I've done enough derivations to see that.","28":"...  Infinity=Infinity  Infinity+1=Infinity  1=0","29":"How do you get rid of the infinities on each side without subtracting?","30":"Subtracting one thing from one side from the other is the same as just eliminating, ignoring, its existance.","31":"No it's not. It's shorthand for subtracting. You made a mistake, admit it and learn from it.","32":"xD  Subtracting is shorthand for ignoring. You just made a mistake, admit it and learn from it.","33":"whoa, sick burn dude...","34":"Sick burn but realise it's the same thing","35":"Sure, I admit it. I've been ignoring your dumber remarks for the sake of argument."}}
