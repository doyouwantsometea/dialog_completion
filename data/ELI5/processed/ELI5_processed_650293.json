While I don\u2019t recommend that diet, I do advise embracing positive lifestyle changes. Once single I quit drinking for good, started rock climbing and gained more confidence, better mental health, truer friends and the best body of my life. Breakups can be the catalyst for lasting change. \ud83d\ude0a","2":"When I hear these it puts into perspective how minor some of my problems are... like I am still so young and am talking about periods of a year or 2 or periods of months... it doesn't make the feelings any less real but when I hear of these crazy life changes after almost as long as I have been alive it just.... makes my issues feel very small.  You are super strong for pushing through that and hearing this gives me motivation!","3":"Like you said. Your pain is real. Don\u2019t minimize it. I only shared my experience to say all of us can grow from these experiences. I needed to grow a lot and I did. You will do what you need to do. We are all here to hold each other up as long as we need each others\u2019 support.","4":"I wasnt expecting this at all but I honestly love this thread. Everybody is being so supportive and motivating and it's refreshing :)","5":"That\u2019s why we\u2019re here. I get more clarity into my past pain and how far I\u2019ve come when I read what everyone else is going through and when I share my experience. You all helped me address pain I didn\u2019t realize I was still lugging around almost a decade later.  Feels great to let it go.","6":"So happy to have helped so many people just that little bit extra!   If you dont mind me asking how did you quit drinking? I have been heavily thinking about taking personal time off work and if I do that I've been contemplating rehab. I'm just so tired of temporarily quitting my vices and falling right back into them... drinking, drugs, video games, all of it","7":"PM me and I\u2019ll happily share. Best thing I ever did but it wasn\u2019t easy for me. It\u2019s easy now, I\u2019m lucky, but it was a battle at first."}}
