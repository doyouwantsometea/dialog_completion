A wire is either carrying enough voltage to decide that it's \"On\", or it's not in which case it's \"Off\". There is no in between.  So for example a processor that operates with a 5 volt data pin, the manufacturer might decide anything below 2.5 volts is a \"off\" and anything 2.5 volts or above is \"on\". And anything higher than 7 volts might kill the chip. Certain electrical tolerances are built into the components.","2":"So doesnt analog have the same 2 positions as digital?","3":"I mean it depends on what you mean by \"analog\". An analog what? You can send 5 volts of electricity to any electrical component, what happens when you do that is going to depend on what the component is designed to do (and also depends on whether you're sending AC or DC current).  If you send 5 volts to the digital processor in my example above, it would be interpreted as a 1\/On\/True however you want to represent that. A string of those might represent an instruction or something.  If you send the same 5 volts to a 12 volt analog LED, it might light up with about 40% brightness. Analog doesn't have \"positions\", that's the point. We measure its voltage level.","4":"So analog doesnt do 1s and 0s because it doesnt have 1 and 0 positions, but only %s of them?","5":"At this point we're not talking about computers at all, but the difference between analog and digital electrical circuits. This is less Computer Science and more Electrical Engineering.  An analog circuit is either \"on\" or \"off\", but its operation can also change based on the energy level. Usually we design the circuit for a specific voltage level (eg. 110V in a US household), and change the current draw to change its operation. Eg. to make a toaster coil hotter or a fan spin faster.  A digital circuit always just \"exists\", with its operation determined by the sequence of on\/off electrical signals transmitted through it. Note that it's the circuit as a whole that is designed to be \"digital\". Individual components like transistors or capacitors are inherently \"analog\", we just use them in different ways.  The concept of \"1s and 0s\" is just something we humans use to help work with digital circuits because of the constant stream of on\/off data going through the circuit - it's useful to represent it as binary numbers. Analog circuits don't operate this way so the concept is kind of useless.","6":"Bit the computer still processes it as either on or off, and doesnt process the other states?","7":"Yes. Computers are digital. They don't recognise any electrical state other than \"high voltage\" or \"low voltage\". They are manufactured to only react to those two possibilities."}}
