I know they \"don't share\", but is that a crack at aristocrats or more of a Buddhist-style respectful reference to the nobility?","1":"Well we needed to start between the difference between materials and phases, so a couple steps back still","2":"I know materials vs. phases I just didn't understand the difference between a solid noble gas and a solid metal","3":"Right, because of the difference between a material (metal) and a phase (solid)","4":"Can I have a link or a summary or a list of what you mean exactly by materials?","5":"Im referring to different types of atoms\/molecules, the periodic table is a list of base atoms and you can use NIST for list of molecules but thats absurdly long.","6":"What are 4 other types of materials besides metal? Or even 2?","7":"Each atom and each molecule is a type of material, there are billions. There can be large groupings (by things like phases at room temperature) but every different molecule is different.","8":"Okay, if metals are one large grouping, what is one other large grouping? Can you name a single one?","9":"Metals is a large grouping that consists of alkali metals, transition metals, rare earth metals, alkali earth metals and the f-block at the bottom.  On the right there are the noble gases, the halides the carbon like atoms and I forget the last one. They also go by their column numbers.  And thats just pure materials not counting compounds\/molecules. There are millions involving carbon alone."}}
