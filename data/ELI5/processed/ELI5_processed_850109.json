So we've received a substantial bonus from (generally) following COVID-related restrictions.","2":"47 cases of influenza in Canada vs thousands of COVID cases. I don't think they are related in how they transmit cause what we are doing clearly works for one but not the other.","3":"COVID is significantly more contagious than influenza, and COVID (unlike the flu) is prone to superspreader events.  So you'll see far more COVID spread than influenza spread under the same conditions.","4":"ok but where did Influenza go? Can it come back?","5":"Didn't go anywhere, but with any luck we'll continue to see low levels for awhile.","6":"I mean it's at 47 cases in my country... Can't we destroy it forever?   Viruses spread and stuff right? but if you get it down to 47 it should be easy to get it down to 0 and then it should never appear again, right?","7":"Dunno, call a virologist.","8":"The last virologist I talked to said COVID was just a new type of influenza that people are making a big deal about instead of treating it as such and going on with our lives.  So he's a quack, plus I just found out the influenza numbers today and I see this guy at a friends of a friends place sometimes and well they haven't had people over for a while.","9":"Yeah, that's no virologist.  Coronaviruses and influenza viruses are different types of viruses - one is not a new type of the other.  They have vastly different properties.","10":"ok so lets stop talking about corona cause it's nothing to do with my question and you can answer my question and stop de-railing, right?","11":"I said go talk to a virologist to get answers to your questions about getting rid of the flu.  You said something about talking to someone who you think is a virologist who said something no virologist would ever say.  So whoever you spoke to is somewhere between not a virologist at all and the world's worst virologist.  That said - you want to learn whether we're in a position to eradicate the flu - go talk to a (competent) virologist and stop dicking around on reddit.  And 47 reported cases may mean hundreds or thousands or tens of thousands of unreported (but still potentially contagious) cases.  47 may not mean what you think it means.  Most people who get the flu just deal with it, and many have mild symptoms not worth reporting.","12":"yea but in theory if those minor cases isolate themselves for like 2 weeks or something would have their own bodies destroy the virus or could be vaccinated with a flu shot or something, while the major cases who get caught by the testing should be kept an eye on or isolated for even longer as needed.  Also can it exist in the air or on surfaces? Again with 47 cases I am sure it is within our grasp to completely get rid of it. And if we can't get rid of influenza in my country with 47 cases what hope do we have for something like herpes or some other virus which is even more infectious.","13":"I DON'T KNOW.  Talk to a competent virologist.  Although the flu comes back as a different variation (or a few different variations) year after year, and jumps often between humans and animals, so your plan may not work at all."}}
