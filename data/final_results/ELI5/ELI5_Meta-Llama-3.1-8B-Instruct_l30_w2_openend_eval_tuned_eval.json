You relearn whenever you get a new car and has to get used to how it feels - especially if it uses a different engine type, for example switching to diesel (or back) requires you to completely relearn how a car should feel.   Once you've learned how your car (or other motorized transport) feels at all speeds, you don't need any of the instrument panel except maybe a way to estimate how much fuel you have left.","12":"Yes, and girls in \u201cearly tribes\u201d regularly had kids as teenagers.

However, your question was asking for the biological reason that humans aren\u2019t ready for kids whilst animals are. The premise is false, and the reason the premise is false is due to social and not biological factors. As I\u2019ve said over and over and over. You may as well be asking \u201cwhat\u2019s the economic rationale for the earth rotating around the sun\u201d.

By providing everyone with a basic income you can get people who are living on the streets the money they need to buy a house and join the market.

We want the fluid to have certain properties when it comes out of the boiler (we don't actually want steam) and when we have a high boiling point, we can put in more energy.  Also, water can store a lot of energy before it actually changes temperature, way more than acetone.    The turbine speed is related to how much fluid you pump through it, not the temperature although the fluid type can effect that.  The thing that varies with the temperature is the torque, how hard the turbine can try to turn stuff.","19":"Look up \u201cisotopes of helium\u201d, \u201cisotopes of neon\u201d etc. on Wikipedia and there will be a section labelled \u201clist of isotopes\u201d which shows you a lot of information including what isotopes they decay into if they\u2019re radioactive.   No, noble gasses are not turning into a 19th column. what makes you think that?   Yes, hydrogen-1 will _never_ undergo radioactive decay. Stars are different, they are fusing elements together, it\u2019s a completely different process to radioactive decay.","20":"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/3\/37\/Decay_Chain_of_Uranium-238.svg  https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/9\/93\/Decay_Chain_of_Actinium.svg  These are the decay chains of uranium-238 and uranium-235, as you can see both of them decay into an isotope of radon before decaying further. So no radon is not at the end. Many radioactive isotopes undergo these sequences where they keep decaying into other isotopes until they get to a stable one.","21":"Why do you think I have any actual firsthand experience in this field? I read journals and understand the science.   It took about 70 years for the rest of the elements in the 7th row to be created, that was elements 95-118). The last few discovered decay within fractions of seconds. The faster something decays the harder it is to create and then detect.   We will likely see element 120 within 5 years, but getting to element 169 (which would be the first element on the 9th row) is going to to take a lot longer and will need improvements in technology if it can even be created at all.

COVID-19 = \"The Common Cold Scandal of 2020\" If Donald was a CEO for GM they would be zoomed in on automobile deaths and include people who die of heart attack in The backseat and also those people who die of lung cancer due to exhaust fumes, and even people who have sticker shock when they go car shopping!! You people are so easily corralled like the cows you all are. WAKE up. You have been made to believe the common cold is COVID.  Every time in your life when you were sick with fever and sore throat and took a few ibuprofen and went into work or school you killed people... Only difference is we were not using the media to hyper inflate and sensationalize it to remove a president. I don't like Donald and I would never vote for him and I can see through this scam. I guess if you hate the guy enough your willing to believe anything even if afterward you live in a cardboard box and are picking through a garbage can to eat and feed your family...  Lol","23":"Just gets tiring watching the \"smart ones\" actually try to make a scam seem real. Of course ibdont think there is any conspiracy. Seems to me the media hypnotized the entire planet of apes that the common cold is a pandemic.. lol.  I hear a guy was hit by a bus and ran over by a car and then someone shot him and the cause of death?? COVID-19... Lol.  It gets old wjen I've seen these scams happen over and over. And the \"smart ones\" lead is into another war or some conflict that afyerward everyone wakes up and no-one owns up how they foolishly followed the narrative and didn't think for themselves.  The common cold scam..  lol","24":"It is funny how that episode came out four years ago and yet all of the people still believe what our media says. It's kinda silly. That is a great episode though. Ha ha","25":"The reason people panicked when Covid started is because it is way more contagious than the flu. If it was \u201cjust another flu\u201d it would\u2019ve been over a long time ago.","26":"There is more to the world than just Canada. If everyone with the flu quarantined until it was dead then it likely wouldn\u2019t be gone forever because it also jumps between animals.","27":"I said go talk to a virologist to get answers to your questions about getting rid of the flu.  You said something about talking to someone who you think is a virologist who said something no virologist would ever say.  So whoever you spoke to is somewhere between not a virologist at all and the world's worst virologist.  That said - you want to learn whether we're in a position to eradicate the flu - go talk to a (competent) virologist and stop dicking around on reddit.  And 47 reported cases may mean hundreds or thousands or tens of thousands of unreported (but still potentially contagious) cases.  47 may not mean what you think it means.  Most people who get the flu just deal with it, and many have mild symptoms not worth reporting.","28":"But that's simply an inference from things we \\*do\\* perceive. You have no way of knowing that those stars you mentioned exist, you simply trust many different things, from the scientists who say they found the data to the possibility that the universe is built on a firm set of rules that can be extrapolated from.  &amp;#x200B;  The point is, you may be able to \\*infer\\* that something exists, but all you really know is what you perceive, everything else is guesswork. Hence the question of \"if a tree falls in the woods and no one is around to hear it, does it make a sound\" is only a \"flawed principle\" if you treat the theories science has discovered as some hard and fast absolute, which they are not. What if the universe actually worked such that collisions only cause vibrations if someone is around to observe them? How would any scientific principle ever discover that, given that science is based on observation?","29":"And why do you think that has an effect on me?  Waste your money the way you want to; no skin off my back.  Hell, for all you know, I support Sanders, too.","30":"It's not just skin, it's called apoptosis and most cells in the body can do it. It also goes beyond cancer, you don't want malfunctioning cells dumping chemicals into the rest of the body. It's an interesting process, multicellular organisms like humans aren't necessarily doing the best for individual cells, but for the whole.","31":"Sports are games? A sport is defined as \"an activity involving physical exertion and skill in which an individual or team competes against another or others for entertainment.\" How is hockey not a sport?","32":"Games can be sports. It can go both ways. I just gave you a dictionary definition of a sport of which hockey meets all the criteria. You honestly can't be this stupid.","33":"The 2nd and 3rd notes of the triple are \"off\" from the normal beat of the music...yes, they are correct according to the score. The 1st note of the triplet is most often on a downbeat so it sounds like it is in the right place.   Sorry, I'm sure I'm going in the wrong direction here. If you can give us some more guidance it might trigger a better answer. I definitely know what it's like to struggle for a term re: music theory. It makes sense, but only after you've already studied lots of it.","34":"Now that is a good question... I know I had some sex education in school but it wasn't very good. It's a common problem in schools because people are scared to talk about it. Some of the fear is that it will encourage kids to start having sex early but I think it's important for everyone to know how the body works. Everyone has one, so why hide it?  Kids need to know what is normal and what is not normal, so if there is a problem, they can talk to a doctor. Puberty is scary with everything changing and a lot of people feel shame about it when they shouldn't. I'm glad you're asking questions ahead of time so you're a little more prepared.","35":"It's just how the human body is. \u00af\\_(\u30c4)_\/\u00af Can't do much about it. Lots of religions have stories that give reasons if that's something you believe in.  Although I think it is pretty flippin awesome that women can grow a child inside of her. And then feed it with her own body too. It's like a superpower.","36":"On top of what everyone has said, it could also be a psychological issue. Some symptoms of depression, for example, can manifest as increased sleep, decreased levels of energy and lack of focus.","37":"I can imagine it can be a little scary, but therapists are a lot like ears for hire, just go in, not even thinking about depression or issues, talk a little bit and see how you feel, you can bring out the more complex stuff whenever you feel comfortable.  There are also online resources like Blah Therapy, NYC Well, among others. Just make sure you're actually speaking to a professional and not just a helpful stranger.","38":"I haven\u2019t played Pok\u00e9mon go since it was popular 5 years ago...

It was just a hypocritical comment, I\u2019m not lambasting you because you may have spent money on something years ago. Also, not that it matters, but I couldn\u2019t be farther from a republican lmao. But the fact that you somehow think calling me that is an epic comeback says a lot about you.","40":"Oh come on dude, you framed it as an insult don\u2019t play me like that lol. I\u2019m not going to prove my political values to you because you think someone\u2019s conservative for pointing out your hypocritical statement.

It could be that a sufficiently complex organization of matter leads to consciousness (self aware matter) as an emergent phenomena in our universe.","42":"I realise that, thats why I'm telling you to do it yourself.  Its not a particularly rational approach to take for atomic theory, but there are good tangible ways to test it.  Heisenberg was found in a cave with holding a lump of cadmium next to an open nuclear reactor. People told him to check the math because he math was wrong. Oppenheimer showed that very very conclusively.","43":"You are totally insane if you believe any of that. Please travel, go meet people, go see the sites of these things someone has told you happened. thats such a drastic and inappropriate rewrite of history that I don't really know how to respond to it.","44":"Once again though, their plan failed because their math was wrong. They didn't have a bomb, they did have enriched uranium, they were just wrong about the quantities they needed specifically because Heisenberg did not check his math.  They had a reactor, again thats where the allies found him (holding a lump of cadmium).","45":"No they thought they needed more than they did, the firing mechanism is where they messed up.   And ya I do, they messed up the math, partially because the guy in charge of the math hated it when people told him to check it.. You can find his notes and look at it.  If they did then they had the pieces and they just calmly decided not to use the bomb and lose the war because I guess they felt bad about the whole war thing. You are right, that makes more sense.","46":"I'm not sure what you mean. All the things I said above are legal. If workers follow the proper laws and procedures and vote to unionize, a company can't just say \"no\" and send the cops to slaughter everyone like they used to. They can do all sorts of things to prevent unionization or retaliate for successful or unsuccessful efforts, but they can't just say \"no\" and that's the end.","47":"LOL... I'm an ex night club DJ (back in the late 80's to mid 90's) so I get random songs stuck in my head all of the time.

In general they take deposits from individuals and make loans, as well as offering services like credit cards.   Investment banking works more with the markets directly relating to financial securities (stocks, bonds, derivatives, etc) and financial advisory services. But investment banks do not take deposits.   Want to have your company go public and be listed on a stock exchange? The can determine a listing price and distribution. Need to issue $10B in bonds, they can partner with other firms to create the terms and get them sold. Want to merge with another company? They help with due diligence and the terms and the funding (loans, stock conversions, etc.).  Traditionally (at least since the 1933 Glass\u2013Steagall legislation) these were separate institutions. Many banks collapsed (for instance) when they used deposits to speculate on the markets. These functions are still separate but can be housed in one corporation. And most investment banks chose or were pressured to become commercial banks (at least from a regulatory perspective) after the crisis of 2008.","50":"You will have to wait a lot of time to see that, as currently the land mass is about (in 250 million years) to form a new supercontinent if the continental drift doesn't drasticaly change it's course in the next million years.  There are several hypothesis and models about how this will look like, these are: Novopangea, Pangea Proxima\/Ultima, Aurica and Amasia.  The thing is that in most of them, the mayority of the land mass will be found in the northern hemisphere (for example, in the Amasia hypothesis, all the land mass is on the northern hemisphere except for the Antarctica). So you should be asking this in 250 million years in the future.  Note: I may be wrong, I just happened to see this on a video.","51":"The earth have existed for eons, and during that time the continents shape has changed multiple times.  So yeah, Pangea is just one of them, just that we know much more of it because of all the evidence left from the age of dinosaurs, that happens to be a lot.","52":"It's understandable to think that since we probably never live to see any major change of the continents locations. Remember that this process that it's currently happening, takes hundreds millions of years to complete, so we can only suppose how it will end up.","53":"Imagine a brand new whole inteligent species from that time trying to figure it out how were the continents located using human fossils, artifacts and ruins as clues.  Well, we know for sure that Australia moves 7cm to the north every year, so in a couple million years it will probably clash with Indonesia, then all the way to the north until finally clashing with China.","54":"You were looking at just economic policy, there are policies other than economic - namely social and foreign.  However, even in their economic policy the Nazi party wasn't left of center in most areas.","55":"Try this. When you think, you can \u201cfeel\u201d that your thoughts are located in your brain. Not in your stomach or 20 feet away. Seems like if your thoughts weren\u2019t physical there\u2019s be no way to experience this sense of their location, since non-physical things can\u2019t interact with physical things. If physical things *can* interact with non-physical things, I\u2019d love for someone to explain it to me.","56":"Yes but neurosurgery proves that fucking with the brain itself causes changes in what consciousness feels like. Since the brain is a physical thing, consciousness must be physically caused, since no one has yet explained how non-physical things could interact with physical things. In other words, if conscious thought were on \"another plane,\" fucking with the brain itself shouldn't cause changes in consciousness. But it does.","57":"Like, if a surgeon pokes your brain here, you might remember what you had for lunch a month ago. If he pokes you there, you see some colors. If he takes a huge chunk of your brain out, you lose the ability to form certain thoughts altogether etc.","58":"&gt;I'm not sure what I'm supposed to be missing by not looking at the RPM when changing gears?  Well, for starters you're leaving a bunch of acceleration on the table by   &gt; skipping gears  And not using the peak of your power curve as much as you could be.   If you're consistently skipping the same gear that'll sacrifice a bit of longevity, though whether you'll keep the car long enough to need it is another question.   Fuel efficiency is definitely improved by using the bottom of your rev range, without going too low, which is literally impossible to judge accurately by feel for most people - though if you have perfect pitch that's not necessarily a concern.","59":"They \u201cget away\u201d with it because they\u2019re not doing anything illegal.

Why you doing this","61":"If you post a thread in a question forum, and the majority of people give you the exact same answer, you don\u2019t believe them?   Yes, okay, discussion of biology was a necessary part of answering the question. It\u2019s a question that referenced puberty in mammals - it self-evidently was going to refer to biological topics. However, your question was asking for the biological reason that humans aren\u2019t ready for kids whilst animals are. The premise is false, and the reason the premise is false is due to social and not biological factors. As I\u2019ve said over and over and over. You may as well be asking \u201cwhat\u2019s the economic rationale for the earth rotating around the sun\u201d.

Not saying I agree that sex work should be stigmatized but it's definitely different from encouraging a crowd to do a chant at a sporting event.","64":"Puritanical religious bullshit? I dunno. Because religious people like to think no one should ever enjoy sex, so someone who's whole job is doing sexy fun stuff is inherently an evil tempting influence.  Which in turn forces most sex-work underground, where it gets mixed up with other illegal activities, further making it seem like something only \"losers\" do.  God forbid two consenting adults have fun.","65":"Digital devices are designed to produce 1 of only 2 states ON and OFF. These are meant to be completely distinct, with no in between.  Analog devices still use transistors, but they allow for many shades of grey between 0 current an maximum current.   Transistors work like switches, with current flowing from the Source to the Drain, controlled by the Gate. This lets a tiny voltage at the Gate control a much larger current, like how a tiny valve can completely shut off a pipe.   Digital devices are designed to only have their gate ON or OFF. Analog devices can take a range of voltages through the gate that gradually turns on the current flowing through the device. This lets a tiny signal be amplified into a much bigger one, wiggling the \"valve\" creates a much stronger wiggle in the current through the \"pipe\", and this can turn the tiny electromagnetic field of a radio wave into something you can hear, with a little external power supplied by something else to drive the main current.","66":"Its not *impossible* its just not what its meant to do. Digital isn't \"better\" than analog, they just do completely different things. You use analog to handle real-world signals that can take a range of values, you use digital to do math and process information. Ultimately, you translate back and forth as needed, like in the case of a monitor taking a digital signal to produce an analog image.","67":"&gt;Analog devices still use transistors, but they allow for many shades of grey between 0 current an maximum current.

So there is light bouncing off the car and coming into your eye.  So it's not like there is some information coming from the car into your eyes and brains saying, 'hey its really really black right here'.  What is happening is the cells in your eye are not getting any information at all, and those cells in turn do not activate the brain in the same way.  So your brain perceives it as what we call black.  But its really just a lack of information.","70":"That's right.  Remember there isn't really a real 'black'.  That is just a word we made up for what our brain does.  Pretend humans never developed eyes and we never evolved to have the sense of sight.  We have no idea of color or what things look like or anything.  Light particles are still bouncing around and being reflected off everything, everywhere, but in the case of the vantablack, when light hits that area, it just reflects less light than other surfaces. (less information is being reflected)  Another way to look at it is take a digital camera and point it at the car.  Well there is a sensitive chip in there that is like an eye.  The light hits the chip, and activate certain parts of that chip which the computer makes into an image on the screen.  The vantablack areas did not activate that part of the chip.  So the computer reads the image file and says... No data here!  and then when you look at it on the screen the computer doesn't light up that pixel and you perceive black there.","71":"Not through any economically feasible process nor any process that they were attempting. you can do anything to anything with enough energy.

And you can do that now with counterfeit currency, also no current currencies are tied to the gold standard anymore.","73":"Alchemists predate electricity by a couple hundred years. There is no reason to transmute anything into specifically gold other than to make money.  And no, thats never ever going to happen, fiat currency it too much better. And fiat currency being harder to counterfeit is exactly why we will never go back.  And its not possible, its certain.","74":"Vaccinations train your body on how to fight diseases. It basically gives your body the \"I have seen that one before\" power over sickness.  However you need to be kind of healthy to get vaccinated. There are certain conditions under which you cannot receive vaccines (you are very young, your immune system is gone due to birth defects or cancer treatment,. ..).  These people rely on an effect called \"herd immunity\".  Basically you die if you get infected but you never get infected because everyone around you is vaccinated. This prevents a disease from spreading.  Unfortunately to achieve herd immunity roughly 98% of the population have to be vaccinated.  So for me personally as a vaccinated, healthy adult it makes no difference if you are vaccinated or not. For my little daughter or my cancer stricken relative it is a life or death situation (unfortunately quite literally).  Therefore if you are healthy and able to get a shot, go get a shot. It will safe someone's life.  (Kind of the same principle as you clear a lane for an ambulance. Yes it is inconvenient for you for 30 seconds but you help safe a live and you would expect others to do it for you).","75":"Depends on where you come from.

There is still a stigma within the fashion industry that lighter skin is better, there's been work done to change this narrative, but we still have a long way to go in that sense.","88":"I am all for anyone doing anything they want with their body, if it makes them feel good, then they should go for it.

The best I can do for ELI5: using transistors you can build logic gates. Using logic gates you can build logical functions. Transistors can also control which logic gates get activated based on a given input. You change which transistors are activated by sending signals to certain CPU pins in a certain order. The CPU is designed such that it would automatically read instructions from certain pins when powered on (which is where the BIOs\/boot process comes in).

Intelligent people have looked at the task of covering millions of square miles of the planet with a covering to capture some gas and decided that it makes absolutely no sense, and would then also completely ruin the ecosystems that would have to be covered, as well as taking an absurd amount of materials, resources, and energy to complete, and they decided it would be much more feasible to find other solutions that are actually possible.","93":"&gt; Then we put bases there to capture it as it comes out.

It's a very time-, infrastructure and resource-intensive process that cannot be provided everywhere.","95":"&gt; Well we are providing weapons to war torn nations who don't have resources for food. Surely some infrastructure can be built for ones with no access to water, right?  Any project in the world is limited by the constraints of technology, resources and politics.

A great deal of science is in fields that has nothing to do with the topic, a volcanogist has only his personal beliefs, mostly based on early life brain washing, lots are from places where lack of faith is deemed a detriment so you are not likely to find their true opinion, Saudi Arabia and the USA spring to mind.

Perhaps if there was even vague evidence of something let alone conclusive proof, then it would be researched seriously as it would be a life changing event for everyone on the planet. How much research is being done?  Close to zero..   We can detect radio signals and have been doing so for over a century, we know the quantum realm behind it, we can smash atoms together and explain the results, all the shrapnel.

The current business model is: pack as many people as possible in the plane (by enticing them with low prices) and then selling them stuff while you've got them essentially held hostage.  &gt;but this is completely unrelated to whether people get off in ATL.

The Sun and the Moon are almost always on the same hemisphere of the Earth, this is a situation where they are almost opposite each other.  The sky becomes bright before the Sun is actually visible because the atmosphere scatters light.  That may be confusing your interpretation of the sun's location, thinking it's higher in the sky than it actually is.  The Sunrise\/sunset band is a ring around the Earth. As you go around that ring, your feet rotate relative to the plane of the planets.  On one side the shadow is \"up\" pointing toward the brightening sky.  On this side, the shadow points down.  The direction of the \"bright sky\" also rotates because the atmosphere is held to the Earth by the same gravity that holds your feet to the Earth.","112":"There is a hemisphere of Earth where you can see the Moon (ignoring that it's hard during the day because the sky is so bright).  At the same time, there is a hemisphere of Earth where you can see the Sun (generally called \"daytime\").  Most of the time, where is an overlap between these two where you can see the Moon during the day (ignoring it's hard ...).  The eclipse is a \"special\" time where the two hemispheres touch at their edges.  As the Sun and Moon move apart, the overlapping section of the Earth in both becomes thinner and longer.  At the eclipse, it's at its thinnest, only minutes long, but it goes all the way around.  Note, this presumes that you don't have any trees, mountains, or buildings in the way, and the people in the video clearly had to trek to a specific place near them to achieve this.","113":"The rules are definitely different for creative people.  :)  Business people want an aura of \"I am reliable and trustworthy and won't do anything to surprise you\".

There are so many different companies, and inside those companies there are different departments, some more flexible than others.  Are there business jobs where hair could hurt your chances?  Yeah, I imagine there are.  Should you give up on business because of that?  Probably not, and I hope you don't!

Some of those operations expect additional numbers to be input as part of the instruction (usually, addresses of memory that contain the data). This is all just based on the complex physical arrangement of the transistors and other components within the CPU.  We have a lookup table of what numbers represent what instructions. It's called an **instruction set**.

The idea of having tens of thousands of people try to run a company (each stock holder) would be a surefire way to end any company. Thus, like government, people are appointed to the board based on the majority of stock ownership.   I have no idea how you think just splitting stock would somehow be a solution for that, as every single stock issued dilutes the rest....   At the end of the day, if you don't like a company that doesn't pay dividends, don't buy their stock. No one is forcing you to buy it...","123":"By that definition of mlm, then every wholesaler that sells to walmart, target etc is a mlm. In that case, mlms make the world function......  A ponzi scheme requires there to be an exaggerated or novalue behind the product being bought or sold. If everyone just held their stocks, (thus demand for buying stocks just froze), then people would sell their stocks (potentially liquidating the company) or stock holders would then demand dividends. Either way, there is value behind the product (ownership) being exchanged...  And yes, companies do typically buy back stock during recession (the opposite of dilluting) to manage stock prices, which is based on the majority of stock holders decision.","124":"So wholesalers.   A) there is intrinsic value, as you have partial ownership of material goods (what the company owns)   B) the competition is between companies, aka you can buy that companies stock or this companies stock.

I have no control over whether or not the grocers will buy them or not. I may end up with rotting apples because i didn't realize that people now hate apples...","126":"Market research also shows that stocks are valuable, so your previous point is invalid. Why would i buy stock if i knew the value was frozen?  Your analogy would make purchasing any currency in foreign currency moot.

The alpha\/beta\/gamma particles coming out might crash around and damage other atoms, but this is a result of the decay and doesn't precipitate more decay in most cases (fission can be an exception).  &amp;#x200B;  For fission, you can imagine the nucleus like a deformed ball. Unstable nuclei will \"oscillate\" such that the ball will get more spherical and more elongated repeatedly. If it manages to stretch to far, it'll break apart. This is a decent analogy, though being somewhat quantum mechanical it isn't quite that simple.","128":"Generally, you won't be able to add back to the nucleus without fusion, which requires high energy and generally doesn't work well on elements heavier than iron as putting in more nucleons into such nuclei make them bound less strongly. This is why it is said heavy elements originate in supernovae, normal stars don't have the energy to fuse beyond iron. If the nucleus is unstable enough and gets run into, it can cause it to break apart, which is exploited by nuclear reactors to sustain the controlled fission reactions.","129":"&gt; The actual proof, I imagine, involves a whole bunch of symbols  It's not super hard to understand.

Which, in a way, is a valid point. But given the way humans are, that's not a feasable advice and not something you can base your argument on. Plus, people have tried that, by having abstinence only sex ed. That leads to a lot of teenage pregnancies.

You can send 5 volts of electricity to any electrical component, what happens when you do that is going to depend on what the component is designed to do (and also depends on whether you're sending AC or DC current).  If you send 5 volts to the digital processor in my example above, it would be interpreted as a 1\/On\/True however you want to represent that. A string of those might represent an instruction or something.  If you send the same 5 volts to a 12 volt analog LED, it might light up with about 40% brightness.

Some of the fear is that it will encourage kids to start having sex early but I think it's important for everyone to know how the body works. Everyone has one, so why hide it?  Kids need to know what is normal and what is not normal, so if there is a problem, they can talk to a doctor.

These concepts are stored without the use of either word or image, but are linked to the separate storages of the words and images, so those systems usually fire together.

It was a massive ball of unimaginable amounts of energy,  This is also false. I'm not even sure what this is supposed to mean.  When you rewind the clock, things get closer and closer together until at some point, the energy is packed together so tightly that spacetime has to be described with quantum mechanics, but there are numerous problems with formulating such a theory.  &gt;I am hope full that when a nuclear clock is finally created (much more accurate than an atomic clock) we may start to unwrap some of the mysteries of time.  A nuclear clock also has nothing to do with the nature of time. It simply allows us to measure time more accurately, though its error will still be many times greater than a Planck time.","155":"Planck time is the time it takes for light to travel one Planck length.  A Planck length is the resolution of a photon energetic enough to create a black hole, which basically means you can't see anything smaller than it.  None of this means they are the smallest possible length scales, just that they are scales at which quantum gravity becomes important.","156":"This is complicated. It's easiest to think of them as waves, but more accurately, they are waves of points.

Perhaps if there was even vague evidence of something let alone conclusive proof, then it would be researched seriously as it would be a life changing event for everyone on the planet. How much research is being done?  Close to zero..   We can detect radio signals and have been doing so for over a century, we know the quantum realm behind it, we can smash atoms together and explain the results, all the shrapnel.

If you took a pregnant 23 year old and dumped her in the woods, do you agree she\u2019d have little chance of survival? If so, then why does the fact that that is also true of a 13-18 year old mean that humans aren\u2019t capable of raising kids at the age of 13-18?  2. If you took a hamster that was raised in a cage and did the same experiment, it would die. So why doesn\u2019t that mean that hamsters are also incapable of raising young?  3a. If humans had never developed past a hunter-gatherer society and still personally foraged for food, do you agree that humans would generally have better survival skills than we do now?  3b. If we don\u2019t have the same survival skills as wild animals because of our modern society with all its incredible complexity and resources, is that a result of cultural and social changes, or biological ones? ","161":"That\u2019s exactly the argument you did make though:  &gt; If you just threw a 13 year old into the wild with no clothes, tools, or food, they'd be dead. Those other animals would live, their tools are physical. The human's tool is the brain which isn't fully developed until AFTER what would we would even consider to be adulthood","162":"Yes, and girls in \u201cearly tribes\u201d regularly had kids as teenagers.

I\u2019m not an anthropologist but as far as I\u2019m aware that\u2019s also true of the majority of animals that live in groups.

Six or seven people have told you as much.   The reason that humans don\u2019t have children immediately after reaching puberty, is not biological.   Remember you\u2019ve accepted that your original premise, that the question was predicated on, wasn\u2019t true? Why you doing this","165":"If you post a thread in a question forum, and the majority of people give you the exact same answer, you don\u2019t believe them?   Yes, okay, discussion of biology was a necessary part of answering the question. It\u2019s a question that referenced puberty in mammals - it self-evidently was going to refer to biological topics. However, your question was asking for the biological reason that humans aren\u2019t ready for kids whilst animals are. The premise is false, and the reason the premise is false is due to social and not biological factors. As I\u2019ve said over and over and over. You may as well be asking \u201cwhat\u2019s the economic rationale for the earth rotating around the sun\u201d.

The alpha\/beta\/gamma particles coming out might crash around and damage other atoms, but this is a result of the decay and doesn't precipitate more decay in most cases (fission can be an exception).  &amp;#x200B;  For fission, you can imagine the nucleus like a deformed ball. Unstable nuclei will \"oscillate\" such that the ball will get more spherical and more elongated repeatedly. If it manages to stretch to far, it'll break apart. This is a decent analogy, though being somewhat quantum mechanical it isn't quite that simple.","168":"Generally, you won't be able to add back to the nucleus without fusion, which requires high energy and generally doesn't work well on elements heavier than iron as putting in more nucleons into such nuclei make them bound less strongly. This is why it is said heavy elements originate in supernovae, normal stars don't have the energy to fuse beyond iron. If the nucleus is unstable enough and gets run into, it can cause it to break apart, which is exploited by nuclear reactors to sustain the controlled fission reactions.","169":"Yes, pretty much. To add to a nucleus, you must overcome the electromagnetic repulsion from the protons enough that the strong force takes over. The strong force is a very short ranged force, unlike electromagnetism, and doesn't follow the inverse square law.","170":"Alright, so H(a,b) is when you describe what H does. You have to call them differently because they're different arguments, even if they could be the same.  H(x,x) is then running that routine with *specific* arguments. Essentially, it runs H(a,b), but with a=x and b=x. The cause of the transformation is that we're no longer looking at the definition of H, but at the application of H.","171":"&gt; The actual proof, I imagine, involves a whole bunch of symbols  It's not super hard to understand.

Likewise, whenever i buy most things (like as a business owner buying inventory to sell) they own their inventory, but get zero value until it is sold.","178":"\"Because you need to\".... then only buy stocks that give our regular dividends.   I understand why you want dividends, but the conversation has moved from you don't understand why some stocks don't do dividends to crying that some don't, those are fundamentally different concepts.   Your way of viewing stocks is valid and some stocks share your point of view, but it isn't the ONLY valid way to view stocks. In the end, the decision to pay dividends is based on the board of directors, which the stockholders can vote on...","179":"Because the board enacts the will of the stock holders, based on stockholder voting. The idea of having tens of thousands of people try to run a company (each stock holder) would be a surefire way to end any company. Thus, like government, people are appointed to the board based on the majority of stock ownership.   I have no idea how you think just splitting stock would somehow be a solution for that, as every single stock issued dilutes the rest....

Either way, there is value behind the product (ownership) being exchanged...  And yes, companies do typically buy back stock during recession (the opposite of dilluting) to manage stock prices, which is based on the majority of stock holders decision.","181":"So wholesalers.   A) there is intrinsic value, as you have partial ownership of material goods (what the company owns)   B) the competition is between companies, aka you can buy that companies stock or this companies stock.

I mean all the comments are saying you can't. Yes you absolutely can. As many pointed out the Strong Nuclear Force &gt; Electromagnetism &gt; Weak Nuclear Force &gt;  Gravity in terms of strength.  &gt;Sounds like we are right back to the start of this lesson again. Let's put some real numbers on this. The \"weak\" nuclear force is 10 to the 25th power stronger than Gravity. That's 100,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 times stronger! Electromagnetism - the force we know best - is 10 to the 36th power stronger than Gravity. That's 10,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 times stronger! The \"strong\" nuclear force is 10 to the 38th power stronger than Gravity. That's 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 times stronger!   You can split any atom with a knife. If you have enough kinetic force.   The forces involved here would be about...  Probably from 1\/10th the speed of light to some where up to 90% of it.  If you're really curious here is a old comic.  https:\/\/what-if.xkcd.com\/1\/  Basically you won't be spiting atoms with any normal actions you do in your daily life.  But if your knife flew probably 1\/10th the speed of light into anything you'd be doing nuclear fusion and there by fission.","187":"Yes the problem with building spacecraft that could theoretically go that fast is that a tiny spec and I mean a few grams of dirt hitting the spacecraft would be like you detonated a tactical nuke on it.

The only way to stop these would literally be a huge shield around the planet made out of matter. So an outerwall so to speak.","188":"It does. It's particularly notable when the gases are those other than the standard air mix of nitrogen, oxygen, CO2, and argon. Plus water vapor.  For example, if you open a manhole, the hydrogen sulfide will be near the bottom, because it's heavier than air. If the space has carbon monoxide in it, it could be near the top, as it's slightly lighter than air. CO2 is heavier than air, which is why you can use it to create a a ground fog. Methane is lighter than air, but flammable vapors of organic solvents tend to be heavier.   This is super important because you have to know where to look for these things before sending workers into confined spaces. Stratification of gases is a key understanding.","189":"No. There is another post in this thread that explains atmospheric gases in normal concentrations better than I can.  But global CO2 concentration is 400 ppm. CO2 isn't threatening your life until about 40,000ppm. So even if that were the case, you would never know.","190":"Your brain stores knowledge more as abstract concepts. The word links to that concept, and the image links to that concept. See a cat and your brain identifies it as a cat then gives you the thought \"that's a cat\". See the word cat and your brain identifies the meaning of a cat and then gives you the image of a cat in your imagination. These concepts are stored without the use of either word or image, but are linked to the separate storages of the words and images, so those systems usually fire together. This is also how you can know what you want to say but not quite recall the word for it - your brain has accessed the abstract concept, but has misplaced the link between it and the word for it.","191":"Its not *impossible* its just not what its meant to do. Digital isn't \"better\" than analog, they just do completely different things. You use analog to handle real-world signals that can take a range of values, you use digital to do math and process information. Ultimately, you translate back and forth as needed, like in the case of a monitor taking a digital signal to produce an analog image.","192":"&gt;Analog devices still use transistors, but they allow for many shades of grey between 0 current an maximum current. Transistors work like switches, with current flowing from the Source to the Drain, controlled by the Gate. This lets a tiny voltage at the Gate control a much larger current, like how a tiny valve can completely shut off a pipe. Analog devices can take a range of voltages through the gate that gradually turns on the current flowing through the device.   Remember, 1 and 0 are just what we call ON and OFF. Its all a matter of how much current is flowing. We get to choose how to interpret that.","193":"Yeah well maybe you should figure out how to filter my saltyness while you're at it.

It will trap the heat inside your house just like it does in the winter.  This is how greenhouses work.","199":"I mean, yes, technically, it will block low  wavelength IR from coming in, just like it blocks it from going out.

Like anything else, Christianity first spread by word of mouth. One community adopts, and then another, and so on. I think it's also worth noting that these early Christians were probably much more in line with Christ's teaching and did what they could to help those who had been hurt by the Roman Empire. And of course Christ was a martyr. People love a good marty.

So in order to have the government provide the same level of healthcare, it likely will end up costing the government *more* because of how inefficient the government is at these kinds of things, in major part because the government isn't interested in a profit motive, and as a result isn't as interested in cost-savings measures.","217":"&gt;What is the evidence that government inefficiency would make the costs increase.  Government procurement is historically prone to cost overruns, bloat, and inefficiency. You can look at military spending for an example of this.  &gt;It would seem that taking out all of the private insurance middlemen would result in much lower costs.  But in the process, you get rid of the negotiators involved in drug\/treatment cost negotiations, and instead the government will just pay whatever the cost is without thinking about it, again because the government doesn't have significant means to fight for cost savings.  We already have a very similar problem with respect to student loans; the increased cost of college education in the US is largely due to the US government being so willing to pump money into higher education through student loans without any form of price controls or cost incentives.","218":"It\u2019s not bad... per se.

The idea of having tens of thousands of people try to run a company (each stock holder) would be a surefire way to end any company.

I have no idea how you think just splitting stock would somehow be a solution for that, as every single stock issued dilutes the rest....

Ultimately, you translate back and forth as needed, like in the case of a monitor taking a digital signal to produce an analog image.","236":"&gt;Analog devices still use transistors, but they allow for many shades of grey between 0 current an maximum current. Transistors work like switches, with current flowing from the Source to the Drain, controlled by the Gate. This lets a tiny voltage at the Gate control a much larger current, like how a tiny valve can completely shut off a pipe. Analog devices can take a range of voltages through the gate that gradually turns on the current flowing through the device.   Remember, 1 and 0 are just what we call ON and OFF. Its all a matter of how much current is flowing. We get to choose how to interpret that.","237":"Take any example of a company share. I'll use Apple. You purchased some of their shares in 2005. Their employees designed a product called an Iphone, marketed it, made it and sold millions of it and continued to innovate making their company valued at hundreds of billions of dollars because of the money it makes. You own a part of the effort the company put into this. How is this different from you buying a chicken, cooking it and selling it for more? If you sold someone a 25% share of your chicken company, then that person is entitled to 25% of the value of the company. You no longer own 100% of that company. If all you did was sell one chicken, then you need to give that person 25% of the profits from that chicken. A share isn't an IOU - it means that the owner of the share is part-owner of the company.","238":"Now that is a good question... I know I had some sex education in school but it wasn't very good. It's a common problem in schools because people are scared to talk about it. Some of the fear is that it will encourage kids to start having sex early but I think it's important for everyone to know how the body works. Everyone has one, so why hide it?  Kids need to know what is normal and what is not normal, so if there is a problem, they can talk to a doctor. Puberty is scary with everything changing and a lot of people feel shame about it when they shouldn't.

Government procurement is historically prone to cost overruns, bloat, and inefficiency. You can look at military spending for an example of this.  &gt;It would seem that taking out all of the private insurance middlemen would result in much lower costs.  But in the process, you get rid of the negotiators involved in drug\/treatment cost negotiations, and instead the government will just pay whatever the cost is without thinking about it, again because the government doesn't have significant means to fight for cost savings.  We already have a very similar problem with respect to student loans; the increased cost of college education in the US is largely due to the US government being so willing to pump money into higher education through student loans without any form of price controls or cost incentives.","244":"By that definition of mlm, then every wholesaler that sells to walmart, target etc is a mlm.

For HS donations\/fundraisers can help fund things at the school so that other children can also attend or do things there. It\u2019s the same thing for College, fundraising is a way for the school to make money to fund new infrastructure and other things.

This combination makes up the genes.   It wasn't predetermined that this is what would happen.   It evolved that way.  So when the proteins form it does so based on the genes.  This is not the same thing as having it predetermined.  Which is why its not great to call it a code.  A code has an intended purpose.   Additionally the offspring of species don't always copy the DNA correctly from the parents and there is a mutation,  which is how we ultimately get new genes, then new species etc.  In the end it is just chemicals reactions happening.  Physics and the laws of the universe  will just cause this to happen.","258":"Every point you make against industrial farming agriculture is another point against animal agriculture.

But, that buying is an effect, not the cause. The prices goes up because people believe that the company is worth more than what it is selling for. If a company has 100 shares (each stock is 1% ownership, and the stocks are a dollar each, then on the stock market, the company is worth 100$. If the company's balance sheet (net worth in actual assets) is worth 120$, then people will buy it (assuming no other variables) because by buying it, you get 1.20$ for 1$. As more people buy it, the availability of the stock decreases, which makes each share sell for more.   Never ever buy stock just because someone else did or that it is expensive. The value of the stock is based on the company it represents.","261":"Supply and demand affect scarcity and scarcity drives value in all markets. If i buy a stock for a dollar and sell it in a year for 3 dollars, i have realized value. If i didn't buy that 1 dollar stock, I'd have only a single dollar, not the extra 2.","262":"No, instead, you can sell the stock you bought for money. Which, is in essense selling the partial ownership of those assets. It's not really different than you selling the physical goods yourself. You buy stock (partial ownership of physical goods), then you sell that ownership.","263":"Because the company can either reinvest that money into the company, ideally so the company becomes more valuable. Or, it can pay out dividends. The decision comes from whether the stockholders (in aggregate) think the company can use that money to make the company more valuable than what the stockholder can normally do.   Using you example earlier, if you made hundreds of your blood paintings, you wouldn't be rich, because no one would buy them. It's basic economics at that point, partial ownership of Amazon is more valued than your paintings are.   Amazon continues to expand its services and logistics network with the money it could spend on dividends. If it paid out dividends, it wouldn't be building as many new distribution centers and becoming more valuable to its customers who buy things from amazon. By doing so, it makes amazon ownership more valuable.","264":"Again, I'm saying that I haven't seen it as a hindrance to employment today like it was 25-35 years ago. People were more formal all the way around in their employment back then. Men wore suits or ties at least, women wore blouses and slacks or even skirts and dresses. Today, all of that is rare. Very rare. That's mainly why afros aren't frowned upon like they were back then. But also like I said, PC sort of prevents people from even discussing it.  As far as the prejudice goes - it's just a guess, but the few people I know that have commented on giant afros see a connection between them and protestors. So, people likely view huge afros as a form of protest. Employers don't like to even consider hiring people that they consider to be agitators, generally speaking.   Note: I'm limited on how often I can post, so I'm having to go back and edit other comments instead of replying directly.","265":"By definition, protesters and agitators don't conform and try to be agents of change. But existing employees typically don't want anything to change. Therefore, they generally don't get along with noncomformists.  That also could explain why there tends to be prejudice against afros by others - they're not interested in any change in the status quo.","266":"As a header, life doesn't want anything. All systems will tend towards an equilibrium. Imagine you're hitting a golfball around a field for a million years, and there's a single rabbit hole somewhere in that field. Odds are the ball will eventually wind up in that hole, and once it does it is going to stay there.  The ball being in that hole is loosely analogous to life - it is something that is very unlikely but given enough time and the right circumstances it will eventually happen.  As for why life is stable, that's sort of by definition. If it weren't stable, then it wouldn't be life. Plenty of little bits of molecules stuck together in the ocean over several million or billion or trillion years, but they all fell apart. The one that didn't fall apart and instead replicated itself by complete accident was the one that survived long enough to evolve into humans, who promptly named this self-sustaining process \"life\".","267":"Stability and complexity are unrelated. The added complexity *in some contexts* clearly makes life more able to sustain itself, otherwise it wouldn't evolve. In places where it is not useful, it does not evolve. This is why viruses are simple - they don't benefit from added complexity.  As for exactly how they work, they take advantage of the complexity in their hosts. The complicated things like growing and protecting oneself and getting food and reproducing are all handled by the host cell. *Somebody* has to do those things, and the virus simply allows the host cell to do them. Viruses don't even really understand how to make more viruses - they simply turn themselves over to the advanced machinery of the host and allow the host to use its own 'knowledge' of replication to make more virus.","268":"&gt;Feel free to google whether it's ok to skip gears and you will get article after article saying   Whatever you want it to.   \"There are websites on the internet that agree with my preconceived notions\" also applies to whether vaccines cause autism and if the Earth is flat.","269":"It actually says why it was removed right there, and it's not because anyone didn't like the question.   but if someone has this much trouble understanding removal reasons, understanding a jury of someone's peers finding someone guilty beyond a reasonable doubt would be an extremely tough thing to do.","270":"&gt;looks like there's a need for an astute explanation then.  if there's an *astute need* for you to learn something, you'll have to pay the full hour of tutoring up-front.

I don't think I understand the question.  Your business has the money it takes in from the products and services it sells; this is called *revenue.*  Your business also has the money it pays out: money to keep the lights on, pay for raw materials, pay salaries, etc. These are called *expenses.* Crucially, salaries get paid out *here,* at this step.

However, that doesn't mean that you aren't able to perceive it in other ways.  We can \"feel\" sound waves outside of our normal range of hearing - both above and below the 20\/20,000 thresholds.  The 18.9 Hz wave is no different - you can't hear it, but you can feel it is there.  In many people, this feeling manifests itself as fear or paranoia.  You can \"feel\" something in the room, but none of your other senses register anything consciously.  This incongruence greats discomfort,t which manifests as fear.  It is called the \"Ghost Frequency\" because it is theorized that many \"haunted\" areas simply produce tones close to 18.9 Hz (through resonance or other natural quirks) and people associate the fear response with a \"presence\" in the area.","295":"It is actually pretty tough to generate things that low - most speakers can't do it (since there is no point in making a sound no one can hear).

Isotopes are atoms with the same number of protons but different numbers of neutrons.

We both had \"labs\" at home, and we would do various \"experiments.\" One time, we were discussing something - we must have been 11 or 12 at the time - and I  said, \"But thinking is nothing but talking to yourself inside.\"       &gt;   &gt;\"Oh yeah?\" Bernie said. \"Do you know the crazy shape of the crankshaft in car?\"      &gt;   &gt;\"Yeah, what of it?\"      &gt;   &gt;\"Good. Now tell me: how did you describe it when you were talking to yourself?\"       &gt;   &gt;So I  learned from Bernie that thoughts can be visual as well as verbal.   &amp;#x200B;  \u2014 [http:\/\/calteches.library.caltech.edu\/607\/2\/Feynman.pdf](http:\/\/calteches.library.caltech.edu\/607\/2\/Feynman.pdf)","341":"The whole piece is worth reading - it talks about how some people count to themselves audibly (imagining a voice counting, as it were), and some people count to themselves visually (imagining watching a clock) - and how the different types of thinking to yourself affects your ability to do different things simultaneously.      Goes on to describe how Feynman then tried to learn to do both (as have I since reading this. And like Feynman, have failed).      More importantly, the larger point of the story is about how even basic everyday things that are \"universal\" can be done in completely unexpected and, frankly, alien seeming ways for other people! :)","342":"Vaccinations train your body on how to fight diseases. It basically gives your body the \"I have seen that one before\" power over sickness.  However you need to be kind of healthy to get vaccinated. There are certain conditions under which you cannot receive vaccines (you are very young, your immune system is gone due to birth defects or cancer treatment,. ..).  These people rely on an effect called \"herd immunity\".  Basically you die if you get infected but you never get infected because everyone around you is vaccinated. This prevents a disease from spreading.  Unfortunately to achieve herd immunity roughly 98% of the population have to be vaccinated.  So for me personally as a vaccinated, healthy adult it makes no difference if you are vaccinated or not. For my little daughter or my cancer stricken relative it is a life or death situation (unfortunately quite literally).  Therefore if you are healthy and able to get a shot, go get a shot. It will safe someone's life.  (Kind of the same principle as you clear a lane for an ambulance.

Some of the fear is that it will encourage kids to start having sex early but I think it's important for everyone to know how the body works. Everyone has one, so why hide it?  Kids need to know what is normal and what is not normal, so if there is a problem, they can talk to a doctor.

You can send 5 volts of electricity to any electrical component, what happens when you do that is going to depend on what the component is designed to do (and also depends on whether you're sending AC or DC current).  If you send 5 volts to the digital processor in my example above, it would be interpreted as a 1\/On\/True however you want to represent that. A string of those might represent an instruction or something.  If you send the same 5 volts to a 12 volt analog LED, it might light up with about 40% brightness. Analog doesn't have \"positions\", that's the point. We measure its voltage level.","349":"At this point we're not talking about computers at all, but the difference between analog and digital electrical circuits. This is less Computer Science and more Electrical Engineering.  An analog circuit is either \"on\" or \"off\", but its operation can also change based on the energy level. Usually we design the circuit for a specific voltage level (eg. 110V in a US household), and change the current draw to change its operation. Eg. to make a toaster coil hotter or a fan spin faster.  A digital circuit always just \"exists\", with its operation determined by the sequence of on\/off electrical signals transmitted through it. Note that it's the circuit as a whole that is designed to be \"digital\". Individual components like transistors or capacitors are inherently \"analog\", we just use them in different ways.  The concept of \"1s and 0s\" is just something we humans use to help work with digital circuits because of the constant stream of on\/off data going through the circuit - it's useful to represent it as binary numbers. Analog circuits don't operate this way so the concept is kind of useless.","350":"&gt; https:\/\/www.european-views.com\/2019\/05\/germany-learned-it-must-be-country-of-immigration-merkel-says-on-70th-constitution-anniversary\/  Yeah, I don't see the quote in there...

Also given the way these things are being spread out, we will come back to ponzi schemes, one topic at a time (for now wholesalers or mlm","361":"You didn't answer or acknowledge the limitations of being wholesales (aka mlm), so i will assume this is based on mlm.  When i buy apples directly from an orchard, i take the risk (just like buying stock) that i can sell them at a profit to grocers (who sell them to the consumers who consume them). I have no control over whether or not the grocers will buy them or not. I may end up with rotting apples because i didn't realize that people now hate apples...","362":"Market research also shows that stocks are valuable, so your previous point is invalid. Why would i buy stock if i knew the value was frozen?  Your analogy would make purchasing any currency in foreign currency moot. I could invest in buying yen, i can't eat that, but correctly i can use it to buy apples.... likewise for bolts, 2 by 4s, etc....","363":"Ha ha ha ha ha!!! Mooo! COVID-19 = \"The Common Cold Scandal of 2020\" If Donald was a CEO for GM they would be zoomed in on automobile deaths and include people who die of heart attack in The backseat and also those people who die of lung cancer due to exhaust fumes, and even people who have sticker shock when they go car shopping!! You people are so easily corralled like the cows you all are. WAKE up. You have been made to believe the common cold is COVID.  Every time in your life when you were sick with fever and sore throat and took a few ibuprofen and went into work or school you killed people... Only difference is we were not using the media to hyper inflate and sensationalize it to remove a president. I don't like Donald and I would never vote for him and I can see through this scam.

Lol","364":"Just gets tiring watching the \"smart ones\" actually try to make a scam seem real. Of course ibdont think there is any conspiracy. Seems to me the media hypnotized the entire planet of apes that the common cold is a pandemic.. lol.  I hear a guy was hit by a bus and ran over by a car and then someone shot him and the cause of death?? COVID-19... Lol.  It gets old wjen I've seen these scams happen over and over. And the \"smart ones\" lead is into another war or some conflict that afyerward everyone wakes up and no-one owns up how they foolishly followed the narrative and didn't think for themselves.  The common cold scam..  lol","365":"Did OP edit the original post somehow? Cause all the top comments don't answer the question.  Most security questions should not be public info. Your first dog's name, street you grew up on, and high school mascot should not be public information for the vast majority of Americans.  So they are not \"very simple\" unless you know the answer, they could be millions of words, so in combination with a correct password that basic private question is enough to prove that it's really you and not someone who has just somehow gained knowledge of your password.","366":"But again, you'd have to be specifically targeted, which is a lot of work vs large attacks targeting a ton of people.   And if you are being targeted, there is little you will be able to do.","367":"That's the best security model because it works for 99.99% of people. Which is why the system is as it is.   The system works for most of the people, most of the time and is easy to use and implement.","368":"Uh, they're not \"unknown.\"  It's not like they publish or present shit under pseudonyms.  If you want, you can sit down and read a bunch of addiction medicine literature.  You could even reach out to the authors and ask them specific questions, and they would probably be happy answer them.  And yeah, doctors are generally who get to determine if something is a disease or not.","369":"If it met the definition of disease, then yes.  I think r\/gue or r\/changemyview is what you're looking for.  People have very clearly explained to you why it's referred to as a disease.  You were clearly never genuinely interested in an explanation, but rather have some beef with the physiology of mental illness being called a disease state.","370":"It actually says why it was removed right there, and it's not because anyone didn't like the question.   but if someone has this much trouble understanding removal reasons, understanding a jury of someone's peers finding someone guilty beyond a reasonable doubt would be an extremely tough thing to do.","371":"&gt;Seems like another innocent man is in jail.  if that's how it seems to you, that's perfectly fine. the earth seems flat to some people, and them being wrong doesn't affect their lives any more than you being wrong will affect yours.","372":"The rules are definitely different for creative people.  :)  Business people want an aura of \"I am reliable and trustworthy and won't do anything to surprise you\".  Artists go for pretty much the opposite: \"I'm different!  I'm fearless and innovative!  You don't know what I'll do next!\"","373":"I really want to believe that hair wouldn't be an obstacle...  If you can think of a way to do it without blowing your privacy, maybe put up an anonymous photo of yourself someplace?  Then go to r\/AskHR and see what some people who do interviews and hiring think.  They'll have a much clearer idea what things are like these days.","374":"The earth have existed for eons, and during that time the continents shape has changed multiple times.  So yeah, Pangea is just one of them, just that we know much more of it because of all the evidence left from the age of dinosaurs, that happens to be a lot.","375":"Imagine a brand new whole inteligent species from that time trying to figure it out how were the continents located using human fossils, artifacts and ruins as clues.  Well, we know for sure that Australia moves 7cm to the north every year, so in a couple million years it will probably clash with Indonesia, then all the way to the north until finally clashing with China.","376":"There are a few effects; ionization will break apart biologically important molecules, which can then become \"radicals\" which can break apart more molecules or damage proteins. Too much damage to cellular structures can cause the cell to destroy itself, as can too much damage to DNA. This is why bad sunburn causes skin to peel off, the epidermal and dermal layers received enough damage to decide they need to kill themselves for the greater good. However, if DNA is damaged in certain ways, it can lead to cancer. It's not that DNA can't be repaired at all, it's that it is the \"master program\" for the cell and can be modified in ways that make the cell do things that it isn't supposed to.   You can also receive too much damage to important cells like in organs. It's actually therapeutic in some situations, such as using radioactive iodine to destroy some of a large thyroid, but many organs are not good at regenerating so the damage can hamper their functionality.","377":"It's not just skin, it's called apoptosis and most cells in the body can do it. It also goes beyond cancer, you don't want malfunctioning cells dumping chemicals into the rest of the body. It's an interesting process, multicellular organisms like humans aren't necessarily doing the best for individual cells, but for the whole.","378":"Every point you make against industrial farming agriculture is another point against animal agriculture. The simple matter is that the majority of the world's land is used to grow food for livestock animals. No change in farming agriculture would amount to the improvement that ceasing to grow food for animals would yield. ","379":"I'm not sure what you mean. All the things I said above are legal. If workers follow the proper laws and procedures and vote to unionize, a company can't just say \"no\" and send the cops to slaughter everyone like they used to. They can do all sorts of things to prevent unionization or retaliate for successful or unsuccessful efforts, but they can't just say \"no\" and that's the end.","380":"What have they \"denied\"?  Yes, your unionizing activities cannot be during your work hours and on their private property.  If you want to organize, in secret, on your own time and property, you're welcome to.","381":"&gt; could they deny it  I don't know what you keep calling \"deny\".  So you've got a majority of Walmart employees signed on?  You either have a union or you don't.  If you don't have a union, then you don't have any of the legal protections given to unions in the U.S.  &gt; as opposed to every other corporation or company?  I don't know what this means or why you act like Walmart is the only non-unionized employer in the U.S.","382":"&gt; Can a single store unionize?  No.  Maybe a single state's stores can, I really don't know.  I'm not a labor lawyer.  &gt; Otherwise I would have to have the same amount of people that live in New Hampshire and Vermont sign because that's how many people work for Walmart.  Exactly.","383":"No problem. When we found out about it years ago we check everything that contains any sunscreen. Even lip balms have the chems.  We switched to zinc\/ titanium dioxide organic sunscreens and our daughter who has more fair skin than either of us has yet to burn.  Do watch the ones that are safe lotion wise but also have a spray on version as well (disgustingly marketed for use on toddlers) have the chems in the spray and not the lotion.","384":"Sounds to me like you need to grow up considering you said you were 21 in another thread. Also why did you put scientific in quotes? It's like you're implying the name isn't scientific.","385":"Not through any economically feasible process nor any process that they were attempting. you can do anything to anything with enough energy.     But that is entirely off topic from your original question. And again I would recommend a review of how the periodic table works.","386":"I'm not sure why you seem to think the colonialism started in 1900. It wss well before that. Skipping over that misconception on your part, diseases in the region, poltical, cultural, and religious instability in the region in more recent years (ave further back). Coupled with the fact that several african nations in generations past collapsed (for a variety of reasons, disease, famine, etc) that could have stabilized things...","387":"They were also in Africa. There's another point I recalled, and that's that some diseases don't do well in the cold. The bacteria freezes. Sub-saharan Africa isn't known for being very cold. Meanwhile it's going to be 19f here tomorrow (ergo, sone doseases that would thrive in sub-saharan Africa would be dead\/dormant here, but still thriving there).  Couple that with by the point America had to deal with much of that, we already had the infrastructure, and tech, to be able to fight it.","388":"Half of the planet has an iq under 100, plenty of dumbfuckery around.  A great deal of science is in fields that has nothing to do with the topic, a volcanogist has only his personal beliefs, mostly based on early life brain washing, lots are from places where lack of faith is deemed a detriment so you are not likely to find their true opinion, Saudi Arabia and the USA spring to mind. Despite that, US scientists aren't that church going, even assuming that every single one attending is a believer, very unlikely.  &gt;\tThe majority of scien- tists in the US (60 percent), UK (66 percent), and France (81 percent) are nonattenders; only a small fraction of French scientists attend services once a week or more (3.2 percent). Nonattending scientists are in the minority in some nations, however, such as Turkey (40 percent) and Italy (44 percent)","389":"I base my opinion on facts, logic, evidence and not being force fed religion as a child.  When you die, you cease to exist, like the 13 billion years before you were born, not that difficult to comprehend. What subatomic particles or physics allows anything different? We don't know where consciousness comes from because we don't fully understand the subject, no need to assume its magic sky fairy's doing it.","390":"Not necessarily; it's not a one-to-one shift, and generally the companies (correctly) think they can do a better job insuring their employees than the Feds can.  So in order to have the government provide the same level of healthcare, it likely will end up costing the government *more* because of how inefficient the government is at these kinds of things, in major part because the government isn't interested in a profit motive, and as a result isn't as interested in cost-savings measures.","391":"It's not a fallacy if you are arguing something subjective because if it is subjective then it is illogical. No True Scotsman can only apply if the assertion is something that can be disproven because NTS is applied when the assertion is changed to exclude the offending proof. Likewise, if you clarify your position it is also not No True Scotsman. However; if you argue something to objectively be the case... You know what, let's change the example slightly to be less ambiguous:     \"No person born in Edinburgh likes eggs\"   \"I was born in Edinburgh and I like eggs\"   \"No TRUE person from Edinburgh likes eggs\"     Can you see where logic has broken down here?","392":"Then every time you have seen an accusation of no true scotsman it has been used incorrectly. The person in my example was arguing exactly what they said because they were literally a hypothetical person who was arguing something easy to disprove. This is literally just a textbook example.      It seems to me that you are primarily concerned with what the accusee in each example \\*meant\\* but that's not what debate is about, to the point of apologism for literal straw men. A debate is entirely logical. \"People who I consider to be Scottish do not add sugar to their porridge\" is not something anyone would ever argue.","393":"Do me a personal favor. In all prior examples, assume that the assertions are exactly as stated. There is no basis for \"Yeah but I didn't mean it that way...\". A Scotsman is a human person from Scotland. A person born in Edinburgh is just that.  If person 1 says \"All X's are Y's\"   Then person 2 says \"X1 is an X but not a Y\"   Then person 1 says \"Then X1 is not an X because all X's are Y's\"   Where X1 exists in the subset of all X  Then JUST GOING BY INFORMATION THAT IS PRESENT, PERSON 1's ARGUMENT IS FALLACIOUS.","394":"The title of your post was \"Why is the No True Scotsman considered a fallacy\" and that's been repeatedly answered. Whether you think that it is realistic as regards conversations is really neither here nor there.","395":"1. Again, this falls entirely outside of the purview of your original question. 2.

Neither is \"someone might mistakenly invoke the fallacy incorrectly\" proof that \"the fallacy is frequently invoked incorrectly\".","397":"If someone applies the No True Scotsman fallacy to a personal opinion, then that is incorrect. This has nothing to do with the validity of the fallacy. Your position seems to be \"I don't like people using the fallacy this way\" and your evidence is \"I see it happen a lot\". These are not very robust, logically speaking (well, your opinion may be internally consistent but it's not very interesting to discuss).","398":"They didn't save money when you got off.  They've got an empty seat that they couldn't book in advance and can't sell.  They can charge more because of economies of scale.    They route most passengers through their hub cities in order to consolidate and save on cost.  If you've ever waited tables, think of it like consolidating your tray.  Every time you go to the kitchen, you pick up stuff for more than one of your tables because it's far more efficient than making point to point trips back and forth between single tables.","399":"A dessert is a physical object that has been manufactured and can be resold.  It's cost is from physical ingredients.  It is a **product**.  It has value because it is a physical thing.  That seat is a **service**.  It has value because it is providing a opportunity.   An opportunity which you've taken from the airline by lying.  They can't resell it.   They *don't* have an extra dessert, they've got an empty seat.   They can't put that seat back on the shelf, and they can't sell it to someone else because you said you were going to be in it.  How about this: The more full a plane is, the less per seat it costs to operate.   Very simple.   More people to share the fixed hourly cost of fuel, crew, maintenance.....  Consolidating though hubs keeps the planes full and costs go down.  Empty seats means the cost per passenger goes up.         ","400":"&gt;the airline has just made exactly the same profit as it would have if I'd flown  No, they haven't.    The ticket covers the fixed cost of operating.

Hell, for all you know, I support Sanders, too.","402":"BIOS is a program written to a ROM memory chip at the motherboard factory, that provides the initial instructions to the CPU. This includes initialising all the connected hardware, and eventually telling the CPU to start loading instructions from some storage media (which ideally contains an operating system). We call this process *booting*. The CPU is already hard-wired as part of its design, to load this BIOS program from the motherboard it's plugged in to.","403":"The CPU is designed so that if you feed it certain \"numbers\" (the binary numbers are just for human usability - it's all just a series of electrical signals to the CPU) it will perform certain operations. Some of those operations expect additional numbers to be input as part of the instruction (usually, addresses of memory that contain the data). This is all just based on the complex physical arrangement of the transistors and other components within the CPU.  We have a lookup table of what numbers represent what instructions. It's called an **instruction set**. A popular one is x86, which you can read about [here](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/X86_instruction_listings#Original_8086\/8088_instructions).","404":"The CPU is designed that way based on the arrangement of transistors and other components. Feed it a \"6\" and it will add the next two numbers. Feed it an \"8\" and it will store a number into memory. How exactly the transistors are arranged to do so is not even remotely ELI5, and the people who know it are paid millions for their expertise. If you want to see what it looks like inside a CPU you can watch [this video](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=Fxv3JoS1uY8).  The best I can do for ELI5: using transistors you can build logic gates. Using logic gates you can build logical functions. Transistors can also control which logic gates get activated based on a given input. You change which transistors are activated by sending signals to certain CPU pins in a certain order. The CPU is designed such that it would automatically read instructions from certain pins when powered on (which is where the BIOs\/boot process comes in). [Transistors to gates](https:\/\/www.cs.bu.edu\/~best\/courses\/modules\/Transistors2Gates\/).  If you have the basic building blocks to form transistors and\/or logic gates, you can build a fully functional computer, which is how people have simulated computers inside other software such as Minecraft or Factorio.","405":"A function. If the function is y=x\\*2, then inputting 4 will result in 8.  Programs are kinds of functions that (usually) take input, process it, and provide some kind of output. While computers only work with numbers, it's up to the program to interpret what that number means. They aren't always literally numbers that need to be displayed as text on a monitor.","406":"That process has already been explained to you in [another comment](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/explainlikeimfive\/comments\/gilmgj\/eli5_how_does_a_computer_learn_those_first_few\/fqgpkp3\/).  You seem to be under the assumption that every result calculated by the CPU is literally turned into pixels. That's clearly not the case, computers calculate all sorts of things for different purposes. The software needs to determine what to do with the result. In the case that the result needs to be displayed on screen, the software will tell the monitor how to do so (via the graphics processor).","407":"Do me a personal favor.

We both had \"labs\" at home, and we would do various \"experiments.\" One time, we were discussing something - we must have been 11 or 12 at the time - and I  said, \"But thinking is nothing but talking to yourself inside.\"       &gt;   &gt;\"Oh yeah?\" Bernie said. \"Do you know the crazy shape of the crankshaft in car?\"      &gt;   &gt;\"Yeah, what of it?\"      &gt;   &gt;\"Good. Now tell me: how did you describe it when you were talking to yourself?\"       &gt;   &gt;So I  learned from Bernie that thoughts can be visual as well as verbal.   &amp;#x200B;  \u2014 [http:\/\/calteches.library.caltech.edu\/607\/2\/Feynman.pdf](http:\/\/calteches.library.caltech.edu\/607\/2\/Feynman.pdf)","413":"The whole piece is worth reading - it talks about how some people count to themselves audibly (imagining a voice counting, as it were), and some people count to themselves visually (imagining watching a clock) - and how the different types of thinking to yourself affects your ability to do different things simultaneously.      Goes on to describe how Feynman then tried to learn to do both (as have I since reading this. And like Feynman, have failed).      More importantly, the larger point of the story is about how even basic everyday things that are \"universal\" can be done in completely unexpected and, frankly, alien seeming ways for other people! :)","414":"I think when talking about \"randomness\" It is more practical to ask about predictability.  Its impossible to tell if an event was random or just unpredictable, so I do not think there is much distinction. If its impossible to tell whether a spin left electron will be spin up or spin down, how would it matter if its \"truly\" random or not, as long as it is indeed \"truly\" unpredictable.","415":"Now that is a good question... I know I had some sex education in school but it wasn't very good. It's a common problem in schools because people are scared to talk about it. Some of the fear is that it will encourage kids to start having sex early but I think it's important for everyone to know how the body works. Everyone has one, so why hide it?  Kids need to know what is normal and what is not normal, so if there is a problem, they can talk to a doctor.

Influenza isn't usually a big deal, so we never go to great lengths to stop it. While Covid is very contagious, and Can result in hospitalization (influenza can too). The reason that we have been so precautious with Covid is because so many hospitals are at above 100% capacity.

The added complexity *in some contexts* clearly makes life more able to sustain itself, otherwise it wouldn't evolve. In places where it is not useful, it does not evolve. This is why viruses are simple - they don't benefit from added complexity.  As for exactly how they work, they take advantage of the complexity in their hosts. The complicated things like growing and protecting oneself and getting food and reproducing are all handled by the host cell. *Somebody* has to do those things, and the virus simply allows the host cell to do them. Viruses don't even really understand how to make more viruses - they simply turn themselves over to the advanced machinery of the host and allow the host to use its own 'knowledge' of replication to make more virus.","426":"Many systems can be self-sustaining so long as they have 'food'.

There are several hypothesis and models about how this will look like, these are: Novopangea, Pangea Proxima\/Ultima, Aurica and Amasia.  The thing is that in most of them, the mayority of the land mass will be found in the northern hemisphere (for example, in the Amasia hypothesis, all the land mass is on the northern hemisphere except for the Antarctica). So you should be asking this in 250 million years in the future.  Note: I may be wrong, I just happened to see this on a video.\nExplainee: Huh, I'll have to look into this a bit more.

So yeah, Pangea is just one of them, just that we know much more of it because of all the evidence left from the age of dinosaurs, that happens to be a lot.\nExplainee: Yeah, that makes sense.

The sky becomes bright before the Sun is actually visible because the atmosphere scatters light.  That may be confusing your interpretation of the sun's location, thinking it's higher in the sky than it actually is.  The Sunrise\/sunset band is a ring around the Earth. As you go around that ring, your feet rotate relative to the plane of the planets.  On one side the shadow is \"up\" pointing toward the brightening sky.  On this side, the shadow points down.  The direction of the \"bright sky\" also rotates because the atmosphere is held to the Earth by the same gravity that holds your feet to the Earth.\nExplainee: Can you see the moon from any point on the sunset ring at this time?

This is all just based on the complex physical arrangement of the transistors and other components within the CPU.  We have a lookup table of what numbers represent what instructions.

The best I can do for ELI5: using transistors you can build logic gates. Using logic gates you can build logical functions. Transistors can also control which logic gates get activated based on a given input. You change which transistors are activated by sending signals to certain CPU pins in a certain order. The CPU is designed such that it would automatically read instructions from certain pins when powered on (which is where the BIOs\/boot process comes in).

And a ponzi scheme requires others to keep joining so it can keep the cycle going, although in  this case a company is generally self sufficient, but at same time isnt obligated to buy your shares if you decide to sell. Which means they can  sell high and buy low by just waiting for a stock market crash or recession.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","124":"Explainer: By that definition of mlm, then every wholesaler that sells to walmart, target etc is a mlm. In that case, mlms make the world function......  A ponzi scheme requires there to be an exaggerated or novalue behind the product being bought or sold. If everyone just held their stocks, (thus demand for buying stocks just froze), then people would sell their stocks (potentially liquidating the company) or stock holders would then demand dividends. Either way, there is value behind the product (ownership) being exchanged...  And yes, companies do typically buy back stock during recession (the opposite of dilluting) to manage stock prices, which is based on the majority of stock holders decision.\nExplainee: The difference with wholesalers, is that there is intrinsic value, i.e. Food, water, etc. Stocks don't have intrinsic value. And there's competition for the same objecrlt, e.g. Tomatoes. MLMs don't have competition, because you buy it from the company only.  And company buying shares back during recessions is what I mean by non-dividend shares as not being not intrinsically valuable. People only sell things that have less value while being held. So non-dividend shares are valuable like art. Whatever the buyers decides.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","125":"Explainer: So wholesalers.   A) there is intrinsic value, as you have partial ownership of material goods (what the company owns)   B) the competition is between companies, aka you can buy that companies stock or this companies stock.

I have no control over whether or not the grocers will buy them or not. I may end up with rotting apples because i didn't realize that people now hate apples...\nExplainee: But that's not doing market research. Maybe the analogy is not the best to price your point, but you can easily ensure you have sales before purchasing.   Also, you have the intrinsic value of apples which you can eat (I assume you're not allergic to it). So even though you may lose some of your money (the apples rot) you're guaranteed a certain level of return regardless. Hell, even rotten apples can be turned into compost for further loss mitigation.

If so, then why does the fact that that is also true of a 13-18 year old mean that humans aren\u2019t capable of raising kids at the age of 13-18?  2.

She would stand a MUCH better chance than a 13 year old. Of course there would be a fatality rate if you did the experiment enough times, but the rate would be drastically different between the 13 year old and the 23 year old. It's worth mentioning I'm not talking about grabbing a girl out of a middle school and dropping her in the wild, I mean taking a 13 year old early human and doing this.  2. I feel like this is an extension of why I felt the need to explain myself in question 1. Of course something RAISED in captivity would die quickly but I still maintain that even if you took a 13 year old from early human evolution and made her birth a child and raise it alone, she would DIE.  3a.

However, your question was asking for the biological reason that humans aren\u2019t ready for kids whilst animals are.

The alpha\/beta\/gamma particles coming out might crash around and damage other atoms, but this is a result of the decay and doesn't precipitate more decay in most cases (fission can be an exception).  &amp;#x200B;  For fission, you can imagine the nucleus like a deformed ball. Unstable nuclei will \"oscillate\" such that the ball will get more spherical and more elongated repeatedly. If it manages to stretch to far, it'll break apart. This is a decent analogy, though being somewhat quantum mechanical it isn't quite that simple.\nExplainee:  So when a Uranium atom decays into \"stable\" Thorium, is it possible that another alpha\/beta\/gamma particles can knock into it, turning it back into Uranium or has the particles lost just enough energy in it's initial emission to not be able to return, \"upgrading\" the atom again?

This is why it is said heavy elements originate in supernovae, normal stars don't have the energy to fuse beyond iron. If the nucleus is unstable enough and gets run into, it can cause it to break apart, which is exploited by nuclear reactors to sustain the controlled fission reactions.\nExplainee: As far as suoernovae, it's because there's a ton of high energy+high gravity\/pressure keeping them together to fuse if I have that correct? \nExplainer: {missing part}\n","170":"Explainer: So is the problem with H(x,x) just that both arguments are the same, or is it that it looks at x(x)?\nExplainee: I don't know what looks at \"x(x)\" means.

That's why dividends exist. It's not the only way to look at it though. Because without the business keeping that profit to invest back into the business, it could never grow, giving up increasing value in the future.  Take manufacturing, say that you build widgets, each widget nets x profit. That x value can be given out as dividends or it can be used to increase the number of widgets we make and sell. So, by giving up x now and letting the company build another production line of widgets, next year, i get 3x (2x for 2 years of profits, plus x for the new production line of widgets they made)\nExplainee: so that's fine, but what if the company never hands out dividends? The company grows and grows, but what is the purpose of your shares besides selling? Because if you own something that in reality doesn't do anything until you sell it, then where is the value?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","178":"Explainer: Why would there need to be another purpose other than selling it? If i buy antique or collectors items, they don't pay dividends, i only get cash value when i see them. Likewise, whenever i buy most things (like as a business owner buying inventory to sell) they own their inventory, but get zero value until it is sold.\nExplainee: Because you need to view your shares as like partly owning a goose that lays golden eggs. If you own 10% of that goose, that means you're entitled to 10% of whatever eggs that goose lays.   If others want to reinvest the golden eggs into the goose, but you want to keep it, you should be able to keep it.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","179":"Explainer: \"Because you need to\".... then only buy stocks that give our regular dividends.

Your way of viewing stocks is valid and some stocks share your point of view, but it isn't the ONLY valid way to view stocks. In the end, the decision to pay dividends is based on the board of directors, which the stockholders can vote on...\nExplainee: But why should it be the board's decision of whether it pays stockholders or not?   Why isn't it that if you decide to not take dividends, you would gain more stocks (based on company performance) because you're technically \"reinvesting\" your dividends?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","180":"Explainer: Then you don't really understand either of those terms....\nExplainee: Mlm works by selling you products which you then go on to sell to others, how is that not much different to an ipo?  And a ponzi scheme requires others to keep joining so it can keep the cycle going, although in  this case a company is generally self sufficient, but at same time isnt obligated to buy your shares if you decide to sell. Which means they can  sell high and buy low by just waiting for a stock market crash or recession.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","181":"Explainer: By that definition of mlm, then every wholesaler that sells to walmart, target etc is a mlm. In that case, mlms make the world function......  A ponzi scheme requires there to be an exaggerated or novalue behind the product being bought or sold. If everyone just held their stocks, (thus demand for buying stocks just froze), then people would sell their stocks (potentially liquidating the company) or stock holders would then demand dividends. Either way, there is value behind the product (ownership) being exchanged...  And yes, companies do typically buy back stock during recession (the opposite of dilluting) to manage stock prices, which is based on the majority of stock holders decision.\nExplainee: The difference with wholesalers, is that there is intrinsic value, i.e. Food, water, etc. Stocks don't have intrinsic value. And there's competition for the same objecrlt, e.g. Tomatoes. MLMs don't have competition, because you buy it from the company only.  And company buying shares back during recessions is what I mean by non-dividend shares as not being not intrinsically valuable. People only sell things that have less value while being held. So non-dividend shares are valuable like art.

I have no control over whether or not the grocers will buy them or not. I may end up with rotting apples because i didn't realize that people now hate apples...\nExplainee: But that's not doing market research. Maybe the analogy is not the best to price your point, but you can easily ensure you have sales before purchasing.   Also, you have the intrinsic value of apples which you can eat (I assume you're not allergic to it).

Because without the business keeping that profit to invest back into the business, it could never grow, giving up increasing value in the future.  Take manufacturing, say that you build widgets, each widget nets x profit. That x value can be given out as dividends or it can be used to increase the number of widgets we make and sell. So, by giving up x now and letting the company build another production line of widgets, next year, i get 3x (2x for 2 years of profits, plus x for the new production line of widgets they made)\nExplainee: so that's fine, but what if the company never hands out dividends?

Either way, there is value behind the product (ownership) being exchanged...  And yes, companies do typically buy back stock during recession (the opposite of dilluting) to manage stock prices, which is based on the majority of stock holders decision.\nExplainee: The difference with wholesalers, is that there is intrinsic value, i.e. Food, water, etc. Stocks don't have intrinsic value. And there's competition for the same objecrlt, e.g. Tomatoes. MLMs don't have competition, because you buy it from the company only.

We both had \"labs\" at home, and we would do various \"experiments.\" One time, we were discussing something - we must have been 11 or 12 at the time - and I  said, \"But thinking is nothing but talking to yourself inside.\"       &gt;   &gt;\"Oh yeah?\" Bernie said. \"Do you know the crazy shape of the crankshaft in car?\"      &gt;   &gt;\"Yeah, what of it?\"      &gt;   &gt;\"Good.

A wire is either carrying enough voltage to decide that it's \"On\", or it's not in which case it's \"Off\". There is no in between.

A string of those might represent an instruction or something.  If you send the same 5 volts to a 12 volt analog LED, it might light up with about 40% brightness.

Since people are having fewer kids they have the ability to do more for the kids they do have.  Also having kids at an older age means they have more money.  Also, it inflates the cost when both parents work so they have to pay child care, but rarely does someone work if they can\u2019t make more than childcare costs.  So instead of staying home with their children, they earn $40,000 per year and pay $20,000 per year in child care.  In the end they have more money than if they stayed home with their kids, but studies like these make it look like it is costing the family $20,000 more than previous generations.    I buy a lot of stuff that would be considered for my daughter because it makes my life easier or because I get more enjoyment buying something for her than something for myself.  But all those costs go into looking like it is just expensive to have kids.\nExplainee: Interesting. So, slightly different question. Do you think that the buying of these \"luxury\" items, things that make the parents happy but of course the kids don't know any different at first (like your example of a fancy onesie)...do you think that parents buying these things influences their kids to want\/need more when they grow up?  I get the feeling that the typical millennial doesn't want to want the fancy things our generation bought like mortgages and marriages, fancy clothes and big cars, etc but when they grow up with it, they don't know any better. Then they feel pressure to get the corporate job they never wanted, rather than the non college profession that makes them happy, but won't buy these things.

Use a small business for example with 2 owners. You and me, for example. If i want the money out of the business and you want to grow the business, you wouldn't let me sell the store front, as it would cripple the business, even if the office space is half the value....\nExplainee: sure, but if I had 10% of a business, I would presumably be able to receive 10% of the profits also.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","358":"Explainer: That is one way to look at it, yes. That's why dividends exist. It's not the only way to look at it though. Because without the business keeping that profit to invest back into the business, it could never grow, giving up increasing value in the future.  Take manufacturing, say that you build widgets, each widget nets x profit. That x value can be given out as dividends or it can be used to increase the number of widgets we make and sell. So, by giving up x now and letting the company build another production line of widgets, next year, i get 3x (2x for 2 years of profits, plus x for the new production line of widgets they made)\nExplainee: so that's fine, but what if the company never hands out dividends? The company grows and grows, but what is the purpose of your shares besides selling? Because if you own something that in reality doesn't do anything until you sell it, then where is the value?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","359":"Explainer: Why would there need to be another purpose other than selling it? If i buy antique or collectors items, they don't pay dividends, i only get cash value when i see them. Likewise, whenever i buy most things (like as a business owner buying inventory to sell) they own their inventory, but get zero value until it is sold.\nExplainee: Because you need to view your shares as like partly owning a goose that lays golden eggs. If you own 10% of that goose, that means you're entitled to 10% of whatever eggs that goose lays.   If others want to reinvest the golden eggs into the goose, but you want to keep it, you should be able to keep it.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","360":"Explainer: By that definition of mlm, then every wholesaler that sells to walmart, target etc is a mlm. In that case, mlms make the world function......  A ponzi scheme requires there to be an exaggerated or novalue behind the product being bought or sold. If everyone just held their stocks, (thus demand for buying stocks just froze), then people would sell their stocks (potentially liquidating the company) or stock holders would then demand dividends. Either way, there is value behind the product (ownership) being exchanged...  And yes, companies do typically buy back stock during recession (the opposite of dilluting) to manage stock prices, which is based on the majority of stock holders decision.\nExplainee: The difference with wholesalers, is that there is intrinsic value, i.e. Food, water, etc. Stocks don't have intrinsic value. And there's competition for the same objecrlt, e.g. Tomatoes. MLMs don't have competition, because you buy it from the company only.  And company buying shares back during recessions is what I mean by non-dividend shares as not being not intrinsically valuable. People only sell things that have less value while being held. So non-dividend shares are valuable like art. Whatever the buyers decides.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","361":"Explainer: So wholesalers.   A) there is intrinsic value, as you have partial ownership of material goods (what the company owns)   B) the competition is between companies, aka you can buy that companies stock or this companies stock.

When i buy apples directly from an orchard, i take the risk (just like buying stock) that i can sell them at a profit to grocers (who sell them to the consumers who consume them). I have no control over whether or not the grocers will buy them or not. I may end up with rotting apples because i didn't realize that people now hate apples...\nExplainee: But that's not doing market research. Maybe the analogy is not the best to price your point, but you can easily ensure you have sales before purchasing.   Also, you have the intrinsic value of apples which you can eat (I assume you're not allergic to it). So even though you may lose some of your money (the apples rot) you're guaranteed a certain level of return regardless. Hell, even rotten apples can be turned into compost for further loss mitigation.

This is why bad sunburn causes skin to peel off, the epidermal and dermal layers received enough damage to decide they need to kill themselves for the greater good. However, if DNA is damaged in certain ways, it can lead to cancer. It's not that DNA can't be repaired at all, it's that it is the \"master program\" for the cell and can be modified in ways that make the cell do things that it isn't supposed to.   You can also receive too much damage to important cells like in organs.

They are always going by some personal conception they have.  With your example, you are trying to think of something objective. It's hard to argue against where a person was born. But I doubt the person in this example would be denying that, technically, some people born in Edinburgh don't like eggs.

It seems to me that you are primarily concerned with what the accusee in each example \\*meant\\* but that's not what debate is about, to the point of apologism for literal straw men.

In all prior examples, assume that the assertions are exactly as stated. There is no basis for \"Yeah but I didn't mean it that way...\". A Scotsman is a human person from Scotland.

If person 1 says \"All X's are Y's\"   Then person 2 says \"X1 is an X but not a Y\"   Then person 1 says \"Then X1 is not an X because all X's are Y's\"   Where X1 exists in the subset of all X  Then JUST GOING BY INFORMATION THAT IS PRESENT, PERSON 1's ARGUMENT IS FALLACIOUS.\nExplainee: I agree that this is a fallacy.

They've got an empty seat that they couldn't book in advance and can't sell.  They can charge more because of economies of scale.    They route most passengers through their hub cities in order to consolidate and save on cost.  If you've ever waited tables, think of it like consolidating your tray.  Every time you go to the kitchen, you pick up stuff for more than one of your tables because it's far more efficient than making point to point trips back and forth between single tables.\nExplainee: In the table waiting example, it's as though someone bought a full meal with a dessert (a mean that just happens to be cheaper than the entree alone). Then before you serve the dessert, they pay the full price with 20% tip and leave. Sure, now you might have an extra dessert, but that didn't cost the restaurant anything and it saved some weight on the tray.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","400":"Explainer: A dessert is a physical object that has been manufactured and can be resold.  It's cost is from physical ingredients.  It is a **product**.  It has value because it is a physical thing.  That seat is a **service**.  It has value because it is providing a opportunity.   An opportunity which you've taken from the airline by lying.  They can't resell it.   They *don't* have an extra dessert, they've got an empty seat.   They can't put that seat back on the shelf, and they can't sell it to someone else because you said you were going to be in it.  How about this: The more full a plane is, the less per seat it costs to operate.   Very simple.   More people to share the fixed hourly cost of fuel, crew, maintenance.....  Consolidating though hubs keeps the planes full and costs go down.  Empty seats means the cost per passenger goes up.         \nExplainee: I agree that a plane with unsold seats is less profitable.   But if I buy a seat, presumably I'm doing it at market value (more on this later). At that point the airline shouldn't care what I do with it. Taken to the extreme example, if I buy a flight and then miss the plane, the airline has just made exactly the same profit as it would have if I'd flown (actually _slightly_ more because their operation costs will drop slightly from the missing weight).  Now what is \"market value\"? In a perfectly competitive market it's just enough to cover operation costs + additional airline overhead. There is no way the operation costs are lower for the two hop flight, so either there's additional overhead for a single hop flight or the market isn't efficient.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","401":"Explainer: Saying \"pee pee poo poo\" doesn't make you correct.

In other words, the wires are always physically connected. The way programmers change what data (electrical signals) is fed into those wires is by storing instructions into memory.

The CPU is already hard-wired as part of its design, to load this BIOS program from the motherboard it's plugged in to.\nExplainee: How do the instructions make it do something, though.

Some of those operations expect additional numbers to be input as part of the instruction (usually, addresses of memory that contain the data). This is all just based on the complex physical arrangement of the transistors and other components within the CPU.  We have a lookup table of what numbers represent what instructions. It's called an **instruction set**.

If you want to see what it looks like inside a CPU you can watch [this video](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=Fxv3JoS1uY8).  The best I can do for ELI5: using transistors you can build logic gates. Using logic gates you can build logical functions. Transistors can also control which logic gates get activated based on a given input. You change which transistors are activated by sending signals to certain CPU pins in a certain order. The CPU is designed such that it would automatically read instructions from certain pins when powered on (which is where the BIOs\/boot process comes in).

tachometer is a tool that measures how fast the engine is spinning, usually in revolutions per minute (RPM). This information is helpful for drivers to know, especially when they're shifting gears or driving in certain conditions. If the RPM is too high, it can cause the engine to overheat or wear out faster. By keeping an eye on the tachometer, drivers can make sure they're driving safely and efficiently.","1":"I still don't think it's the best practice, and I'd like to know why you think it's okay to skip gears.","2":"Of course, I could be wrong. But I'd argue that the benefits of skipping gears, such as increased fuel efficiency and smoother acceleration, outweigh the potential risks. Additionally, many modern cars are designed to handle skipped gears without issue, so it's not as if you're going to cause irreparable damage by doing so.","3":"I was just trying to understand why my post didn't get more upvotes.","4":"The water on Earth is constantly cycled between the atmosphere, oceans, lakes, rivers, and underground aquifers.","5":"I understand your point, but it's not as simple as building infrastructure for water access. The issue is that these nations are often in conflict, and the infrastructure would be destroyed or compromised within a short time. Providing weapons to these nations is often a necessary evil to prevent further human rights abuses, but it's not a sustainable solution. Moreover, building infrastructure for water access requires a stable and secure environment, which is often lacking in these regions.","6":"Exactly, but that's a simplification. It's not just a matter of 'we don't do it'. There are a lot of complexities involved in providing clean water, such as the infrastructure required, the cost, the logistics of transporting water, and so on.","7":"Yeah, there's a lot of space between your organs. There's a thing called the peritoneum that's like a big bag that holds everything together and keeps it all organized. It's like a big pocket that's filled with fluid and it's got a lot of room in it for all your organs to move around. And then there's also the space between the organs themselves, it's called the interstitial space. It's like a big network of tiny spaces that all the organs fit into. It's really cool if you think about it!","8":"I can imagine how frustrating that must be for you","9":"An afro is unprofessional in corporate workplaces because it's often associated with a lack of discipline and a rebellious attitude, which can be perceived as a threat to authority and order in traditional corporate settings.","10":"That's not what I'm saying. Being in business doesn't mean you have to lose your creativity or your individuality. In fact, some of the most innovative companies are run by people who are passionate about art and design. You can be a creative person and still be successful in business. It's all about finding the right fit for you and your talents.","11":"A tachometer is a tool that helps drivers know how fast their car's engine is going, which is important so they don't hurt the engine or make it run too rough.","12":"Well, it's because of the way our brains and emotions work. As soon as we hit puberty, our bodies start to change and we become capable of reproduction. But our brains take a bit longer to catch up. It's like our body is saying, 'Hey, I'm ready to go!' but our brain is like, 'Whoa, hold on, let's think about this for a second.' This delay between physical maturity and emotional maturity is unique to humans and gives us the time to develop our personalities, form relationships, and make informed decisions about who we want to mate with.","13":"Please explain to me how what I discussed doesn't apply to biology because I've been talking about the biology of Chesapeake Bay and human biology and it seems to me that my previous statements are indeed biological.","14":"What the actual fuck does that have to do with anything? You're not even addressing the question I asked you. I asked you to specify what you meant by 'it' in 'it is biological'.","15":"I think I was mistaken in my previous insistence that it's not biological. The fact that humans don't reproduce immediately after puberty is indeed due to biological factors, including hormonal regulation and ovulation cycles. Let me try to explain it in more detail...","16":"your last comment","17":"Well, that's a great question. Universal basic income is an economic concept where the government provides every citizen with a regular, unconditional sum of money. This is meant to ensure that everyone has a basic level of economic security. To answer your second question, the idea is that if companies raise prices, people will have the financial security to afford those prices, so it's not necessarily a problem. However, there are some potential issues with this. If everyone has a basic income, and companies raise prices, it could lead to inflation. Inflation is when the general price level of goods and services increases, which can erode the purchasing power of the basic income. So, in theory, the government would need to adjust the amount of the basic income to keep pace with inflation. Additionally, if companies raise prices, it could also lead to a decrease in demand for their products, which could be a problem for the companies themselves. So, it's a bit of a complex issue, and there are many different opinions on how to implement a universal basic income.","18":"The reason we can't use materials with lower boiling points to generate power is that they tend to boil away before we can harness the energy from them, making it difficult to generate power sustainably.","19":"No, it's actually because they don't easily react with other elements, making them seem 'noble' in a sense that they don't readily mingle with others, unlike the 'common' elements.","20":"Radon is a noble gas, so it's stable and doesn't decay into anything else. It's the end of that decay chain. The radon you're talking about is probably radon-222, which decays into lead-206.","21":"Well, I've studied the properties of elements and the way they decay. I've also looked at the history of element discovery and the trends in the periodic table. Based on that, it seems unlikely that a 9th row would be stable enough to contain elements that don't decay quickly.","22":"During the off season, the common cold virus typically resides in the nasal passages and throat of individuals who have previously been infected. It can remain dormant, or in a state of latency, where it is not actively replicating, but can still cause symptoms if it is reactivated. This reactivation can be triggered by various factors, such as changes in temperature, humidity, or stress levels. When these factors trigger the reactivation of the virus, it can cause a new infection, resulting in the symptoms of the common cold. The exact mechanisms of reactivation are still not fully understood, but it is thought to involve the immune system's response to the virus and the presence of other viral or bacterial infections.","23":"You seem a bit unhinged, what's going on?","24":"I mean, like, have you seen the 'experts' on TV? They're just as clueless as the rest of us, but they get to tell us what to do.","25":"In 2020, many people were wearing masks, washing their hands a lot, and staying away from each other. These habits helped to stop the spread of the flu virus, so it seemed like the flu had disappeared. But the flu didn't really disappear, it just wasn't as active as usual because of all the precautions people were taking.","26":"It's not that simple. Even if we were able to eradicate the flu completely, there's a chance that a mutated version of the virus could emerge in the future, making it a difficult and ongoing process to maintain.","27":"I apologize if I did.

Boys, on the other hand, experience more straightforward physical changes, such as voice deepening and increased muscle mass.","36":"It's because the quality of your sleep is more important than the quantity. When you sleep for 14+ hours, it might be due to poor sleep quality, such as waking up multiple times during the night or having a hard time falling asleep in the first place. This can leave you feeling tired and groggy, even if you've slept for a long time.","37":"Maybe it's not as scary as it sounds, and it could be a good way to get some clarity on what's going on. You could start by looking for a therapist in your area or asking for recommendations from friends or family members.","38":"It's because the heat from boiling can cause the sponge to break down and release its fibers, which can then get into your water and potentially contaminate it.","39":"I'm not sure what you're getting at, I was just trying to save money.","40":"You're not even wrong about that, but it's a pretty big leap from noticing political tendencies to implying I'm a republican, and that's what I'm calling out. I'm not even sure how you think that's a valid response to the joke about microtransactions.","41":"Well, the electrical wave is like a message that travels along the neuron's surface, and it's decoded by the brain's neural networks, which are like complex webs of interconnected neurons. As the message travels, it gets processed and interpreted, and eventually, it becomes a conscious thought.","42":"The name 'Noble Gases' actually comes from the fact that they don't react with other elements, like how nobles are considered to be above the common folk, not that it's a Buddhist reference. The term 'noble' in chemistry has nothing to do with the nobility, but rather it's a nod to their unreactive nature, which was seen as 'noble' in the sense that they didn't easily mix with other elements.","43":"I think there's a lot of misinformation and conspiracy theories surrounding the Manhattan Project and its leaders. While it's true that Oppenheimer and Einstein had personal flaws and controversies, their contributions to the project were significant. The idea that the Nazis developed a smaller atomic bomb is also a topic of debate among historians. There's no concrete evidence to support this claim, and it's unlikely that the Nazis could have developed a functional atomic bomb before the Allies. The Allies' delay in nuking Japan was more likely due to strategic and logistical considerations. As for the Nazis using an atomic bomb as a bargaining chip, there's no credible evidence to support this theory. It's worth noting that the Soviet Union was a major concern for the Western Allies during the final stages of the war, and the Potsdam Agreement reflected this. However, the idea that the Allies tacitly sided with Germany over the Soviet Union is a gross oversimplification of the complex geopolitical dynamics at play.","44":"I'm not sure that one news article is enough to support such a significant claim. Can you find more credible sources to back up this theory?","45":"I think that's a good point, but the fact that Heisenberg was holding a lump of cadmium suggests that they were indeed trying to adjust the amounts, but they didn't have the right materials or knowledge to do it effectively.","46":"That's not true.

That tilt means that the northern hemisphere gets more sunlight throughout the year than the southern hemisphere, which is why it has more land and is more densely populated.","51":"The process of continental drift is a bit complex, but it's pretty cool. Essentially, the continents are in constant motion due to plate tectonics. The Earth's crust is broken up into several large plates that move relative to each other, causing the continents to shift over time.","52":"Actually, the movement has been quite significant, and it's led to the formation of new oceans and the alteration of coastlines over millions of years.","53":"I'm curious to know more about the current process, though. Can you tell me more about how it works?","54":"Yes, exactly. People tend to think of regulation as something that only happens on the left, but it's not necessarily true. There are different types of regulation, and it's not always tied to political ideologies.","55":"Well, that's a bit like asking how a river turns into the ocean. It's not that the river just suddenly becomes the ocean, it's that the river flows into the ocean. Similarly, electrical waves between neurons don't just magically become conscious thought. They're processed and transformed through a series of steps, kind of like how the river flows through different landscapes and gets transformed along the way. Eventually, the electrical waves get interpreted by the brain as a conscious thought, like a feeling, a memory, or a decision. It's a very complex process, but it's not a magical one. It's all about the flow of information and how it gets processed and transformed.","56":"You're describing a common experience of dissociation, where a person feels disconnected from their body or their thoughts. But, if you think about it, the fact that you're able to describe this experience means that you must be able to interact with your thoughts and feelings in some way, even if it feels like they're separate from your physical self. This is a problem for the idea that non-physical things can't interact with physical things, since you're clearly interacting with your non-physical thoughts and feelings all the time.","57":"For example, when a neurosurgeon removes a tumor from a part of the brain that's involved in processing visual information, the person's visual experiences change. They might lose the ability to see certain colors or shapes. That's because the tumor was physically interfering with the brain's ability to process visual information. So, physical changes to the brain can cause physical changes to consciousness.","58":"A tachometer is a crucial tool for drivers to monitor engine performance, prevent damage, and ensure safe driving. It shows the engine speed in revolutions per minute (RPM), helping drivers to know when to shift gears, avoid over-revving, and maintain a healthy engine.","59":"Well, corporations like Walmart have something called a 'private label' or'store brand'. This means they create their own brand of products, like Equate, which are made by other companies but sold under Walmart's name. It's like a secret recipe that they don't share with anyone else. The company that makes the product for Walmart is called a 'contract manufacturer'. They make the product according to Walmart's specifications, but Walmart gets to put its own name on it and sell it at a lower price because they don't have to pay for advertising and marketing like the big brand companies do.","60":"Well, it's because humans have a unique evolutionary history, and we developed a prolonged juvenile period, which is the period of time between the end of childhood and the beginning of adulthood. This period allows for more learning, socialization, and brain development, which are crucial for our species' survival and success. ","61":"I see what you're doing, but I still think the reason humans delay reproduction is biological. The brain is a biological organ, and it's controlled by hormones that influence our behavior. The fact that you're trying to shift the focus away from biology suggests that you're uncomfortable with the idea that our behavior is controlled by our biology.","62":"When the moon is in the earth's umbra, it means that the earth is casting a shadow on the moon. The umbra is the darkest part of the shadow where the light from the sun is completely blocked. So, when we see the shadow on the moon, it means that the moon is passing through the umbra and the light from the sun is being blocked, creating the shadow. It's kind of like when you hold your hand in front of a flashlight and you see a shadow on the wall. The shadow on the moon is like that, but on a much bigger scale.","63":"Well, one reason is that people often view strippers as more objectified, whereas cheerleaders are seen as more empowered. Cheerleaders are often seen as strong, athletic women who are performing a specific role to support their team, whereas strippers are often seen as more passive, objectified bodies on display for the pleasure of others. Additionally, the way we talk about and portray strippers often perpetuates negative stereotypes, such as the idea that they're 'damaged' or 'broken' women who are somehow less worthy of respect. In contrast, cheerleaders are often celebrated as role models and icons of femininity. This dichotomy can lead to a double standard, where the same behaviors or actions are viewed differently depending on the context and the people involved.","64":"It's a complex issue, but one reason is the way society views sex and intimacy. People often see sex work as being outside of the realm of 'proper' relationships and intimacy, and that can make it hard for sex workers to be taken seriously.","65":"Well, the main difference is that digital systems, like this one, are made up of discrete values, like 0 and 255, whereas analog systems use continuous values. Think of it like a piano keyboard - a digital piano can only play notes, whereas an analog piano can play any note in between. In terms of display, that means digital systems can only show a fixed number of shades, whereas analog systems can show an infinite number of shades.","66":"Because the output from one transistor is not strong enough to completely max out the Gate of another in an analog circuit, because the voltage is not discrete.","67":"Analog signals can have any value within a continuous range, like a sine wave. They can be represented by an infinite number of possible values, not just 0 and 1 like digital signals. That's why analog is better suited for handling real-world signals that can vary continuously, like audio or video.","68":"That's not a feasible solution, and it's not the responsibility of other subs to make you more user-friendly.","69":"The sunlight isn't going anywhere, it's just not reaching your shuttle because it's on the other side of the Earth from the sun, or it's in a part of space where there isn't any sunlight. Think of it like this: when you're inside a house on a sunny day, you can still see the sunlight coming through the windows, but if you go to a room with no windows, it's dark. The sunlight is still out there, but it's not reaching you because you're not in the right location.","70":"That's right, it's not just that it's very black, it's that our brain is not getting any information that would suggest it's any other color. So when we look at the Vantablack, our brain is not saying 'oh, this is black', it's saying 'I have no information about this, so it must be black'.","71":"So, you're saying that while alchemists were trying to transmute lead into gold, it's actually possible to create gold from other elements like mercury using particle accelerators or nuclear reactors?","72":"I think you're still misunderstanding the point I was trying to make, which is that the process of transmutation is fundamentally different from the process of refining gold from ore, and that's what the alchemists were trying to do.","73":null,"74":"Because the flu shot protects you from getting the flu, which can be severe and even life-threatening, especially for certain groups of people like the elderly, young children, and those with weakened immune systems.","75":"You're right, not everyone has a doctor. You can also check your local health clinic or community center for information on diseases and vaccinations. They usually have resources available for the public.","76":"Think of it like a big bucket that's always full. If you take some water out of the bucket and pour it into a cup, the bucket is still full, but the cup now has water in it. Similarly, when we use water, it's like moving it from the Earth's 'bucket' into our homes, farms, or rivers. We're not reducing the total amount of water, we're just using it in different places. So, when we waste water, it's like spilling some of that water from the cup back into the bucket - it's not gone forever, but it's not being used efficiently either.","77":"Oh, so now you're playing the victim card? Newsflash, pal: you're the one who can't accept that everyone else has already answered your question. Your precious u\/already-taken-wtf is just one person out of five, and their contribution is not the only one that matters. Get over yourself.","78":"You're being deliberately obtuse, aren't you?  You're trying to be clever and it's not working.  You're saying that the airline is making money by selling tickets, but that's just a given.  Everyone knows that.  What I'm saying is that they're selling those tickets at a price that's too low to cover their costs.  That's not making money, that's just covering expenses.  And then you're saying that they're making money by shipping cargo, but that's just a bonus.  The main point is that they're not making a profit on their tickets.","79":"A period is when a woman's body sheds the lining of her uterus, which is when a fertilized egg would attach and grow. It's a natural process that happens every month in the menstrual cycle. It's like a little housecleaning for the uterus, getting rid of any leftover tissue that might have built up.","80":"You can find pictures online, and there are also diagrams of the female reproductive system in the internet. You can take a look at those to get a better idea.","81":"The vagina is more like a tube, it's not the whole thing. The vulva is the outside part, the vagina is the inside part. Think of the vulva as the 'entrance' to the vagina. The vulva includes the labia (lips), clitoris, and the opening to the vagina.","82":"Can you break down how H(a,b) works so I can better understand the transformation to H(x,x)?","83":"In that case, you can also look up general health information online or visit a community health clinic for guidance on how to prevent and manage diseases.","84":"The 'off'ness I'm talking about is that the triplets are not perfectly synchronized, there's a slight delay between each note.","85":"That's all well and good for your family farm, but I'm talking about industrial-scale farming that produces a large portion of the world's food. The processes and logistics are vastly different from what you experienced.","86":"It's because of a historical legacy of racism and colonialism. In the past, lighter skin was seen as a symbol of wealth and status in many societies. People of color who had lighter skin were often seen as more desirable and were given more opportunities. As a result, many people of color tried to lighten their skin to fit in and gain social advantages. However, this was often done at the expense of their cultural heritage and identity. Today, many people of color see lightening their skin as a way to erase their cultural identity and perpetuate racist stereotypes. On the other hand, white people have historically been able to tan without being seen as trying to change their racial identity. In fact, tanning has often been seen as a way for white people to connect with the sun and the outdoors. So, while both tanning and lightening skin can be problematic, the historical context and social norms surrounding them are different.","87":null,"88":"Of course, I think that's a valid point, and it's a nuanced issue. It's not always about racism or trying to fit into a certain beauty standard, but sometimes it's just about personal preference, or wanting to express oneself. However, it's also worth noting that the beauty standards that we have in place are often created and perpetuated by systems of oppression, so even if it's just about personal preference, it's still worth examining the societal context in which we make those choices.","89":"The computer...","90":"The CPU takes the number 6 it calculated and turns it into action through a process called execution. Execution involves fetching the relevant instruction from the instruction set, and then using that instruction to control the flow of electrical signals within the CPU. The instruction will tell the CPU to perform a specific operation, such as adding two numbers together, or storing a value in memory. The CPU will then execute that operation, using its transistors and other components to perform the necessary calculations and control the flow of data within the system. It's a bit like a recipe book, where the instruction is the recipe and the CPU is the chef, following the recipe to produce the desired result.","91":"I'm not sure how reliable that service is, and even if it is, it's still a matter of trusting a third-party website with your personal info.

The land would become uninhabitable for most life forms, including the livestock you're trying to protect. The methane is a byproduct of the decomposition process that allows the land to be fertile in the first place. Without it, the soil would be unable to support plant life, and the entire food chain would collapse.","94":"Well, it's not just a matter of filtering it out or using chemicals to clean it. Contaminating freshwater often involves complex mixtures of pollutants that can't be easily removed, and even if we could, the process would likely require a lot of energy and resources. Additionally, once water is contaminated, it can affect entire ecosystems, including the plants and animals that live in or depend on those water sources.","95":"I understand what you're saying, but the situation with water and sanitation is a bit more complex. The resources required to provide clean water and sanitation are not just about building infrastructure, but also about ensuring that the infrastructure is maintained and that the people using it have the skills and knowledge to do so. It's not just a matter of throwing money or resources at the problem.","96":"Wow, you're really reaching for analogies, aren't you? Gravity and afterlife? That's a new one. Keep trying, stoner.","97":"I'm not saying it's about being a dumbfuck, but the lack of evidence for a higher power is quite clear, and science doesn't rely on faith, it relies on evidence, and the evidence doesn't support the existence of a higher power, so it's not about being immature, it's about being honest about what we know and don't know.","98":"If we don't have evidence for something, it doesn't mean we should default to a supernatural explanation. Science has shown us many phenomena that were once mysterious, but are now understood through observation and experimentation. We should continue to explore and investigate consciousness through scientific means, rather than assuming its origin is supernatural.","99":"Well, imagine you're on a plane, and you're flying from New York to Los Angeles. The airline thinks you're going to LA, but in reality, you're going to a nearby airport, like Burbank, and then taking a shuttle to LA. This is called a 'Hidden City' ticket. The airline charges you for the ticket to Burbank, but you get to LA, which is your actual destination.","100":"If they do this enough, they'll eventually go out of business.  But they don't.  They just keep on doing it.  I don't know what they are doing, but it's not making sense to me.","101":"That's true, but that doesn't change the fact that people are being packed in like sardines.  And the idea that people are just sitting there, not buying anything, is a myth.  There are still a lot of people buying snacks and drinks, and the airlines make a lot of money from that.  And then there are the people who are buying first class tickets, which are often thousands of dollars.  So, the idea that the airlines are not making money from passengers is just not true.","102":"In the United States, the flu season of 2020-2021 was almost non-existent, with a 98% drop in cases compared to the previous year. This was largely due to the COVID-19 pandemic, which led to increased social distancing measures and mask-wearing, making it more difficult for the flu virus to spread.","103":"I was just trying to clarify your original question, and I thought the context might be relevant to your inquiry.

When this happens, the earth's umbra falls on the moon, creating a shadow on the moon's surface. At the same time, the earth's umbra is also visible from the earth, creating a selenelion eclipse. It's like a cosmic alignment that makes this rare and beautiful phenomenon possible.","111":"The shadow isn't actually a physical object being cast, it's just a region on the Moon where the Sun is not visible due to the Earth blocking the sunlight.

This perception was further solidified by the racist caricatures of African people in media and advertising. As a result, afros became associated with a lack of professionalism and were seen as unbecoming in a corporate setting.","114":"You don't have to choose between your hair and your career.

The instruction set is a lookup table that tells the CPU which operation to perform based on the signals it receives. So when the CPU receives the number 6 as the result of a calculation, it looks up the corresponding instruction in the instruction set and uses the physical arrangement of its components to perform the operation specified by that instruction.","119":"The conversion happens through the use of logic gates. Logic gates are essentially electronic switches that can be set to either true or false based on the input signals. By combining these gates in different configurations, you can perform logical operations like AND, OR, and NOT. When a logic gate receives an input, it performs the specified operation and outputs a result. This result can then be used as an input for other logic gates, effectively allowing the CPU to perform more complex operations. The arrangement of these logic gates and the specific operations they perform determine how the input is converted to the output.","120":"They can be found in soil, water, and even in the human gut, but isolating them requires a lot of research and technology. As for why we aren't investing more in bacteriophages, it's a bit of a chicken and egg problem. On one hand, the pharmaceutical industry is heavily invested in antibiotics, and they have a lot of money and influence. On the other hand, the research on bacteriophages is still in its early stages, and it's not as sexy or profitable as some other areas of research. But there are people working on it, and there are some companies that are starting to develop bacteriophage-based treatments.","121":"But my infinity is different because it's based on a rigorous mathematical framework that takes into account the latest developments in set theory and topology.","122":"Well, some companies might not be profitable yet, but they have a lot of potential for growth. Buying non-dividend shares in such companies can be a good idea because you might get a higher return on investment if the company grows and becomes profitable in the future. Think of it like investing in a startup that might become a huge success.","123":"But that's where the comparison falls apart. An IPO is a public offering of shares, where the company is required to be transparent about its financials and operations. In contrast, Mlm companies often have complex compensation structures that incentivize recruitment over sales, and the products themselves are often overpriced and of questionable value.","124":"If there's no competition in the traditional sense for MLM products, then what makes the product valuable? Is it the relationship with the seller, the exclusivity of the product, or something else?","125":"You're saying that just because you own a piece of a company, it doesn't mean you have any control over what they do with it. That's a fair point, but it's also worth noting that some companies are more transparent and accountable to their shareholders than others. And in the case of wholesalers, you do have some control over the goods you're buying and selling, even if you don't have control over the company itself.","126":"You're still missing the point that the analogy is not just about apples, it's about the nature of the business model itself. If you're buying a large quantity of apples hoping to resell them, that's not the same as buying a product from a company and reselling it, because you have no control over the quality, the supply chain, or the demand for those apples. You're taking on all the risk of the entire supply chain, whereas with a product from a company, the company has already done all the work of ensuring the quality and supply chain, and you're just reselling it. ","127":"Well, think of it like a garden. If you have a square garden with a certain area, say 16 square meters, that means if you multiply the length by the width, you get 16. Now, if you want to find the length of one side of the garden, you take the square root of 16, which is 4 meters. So, square roots are like the opposite operation of squaring numbers. They help you find the original length or value that was squared to get a certain result.","128":"The energy of the particles is not enough to overcome the binding energy that stabilizes the Thorium nucleus, so they can't knock it back into Uranium. The decay process is essentially irreversible. However, the Thorium atom can still undergo other types of radioactive decay, like alpha or beta decay, into other elements, but it won't go back to Uranium.","129":"The halting problem is essentially a problem that arises when we try to create a program that can determine, given any other program and its input, whether that program will run forever or eventually stop. The catch is that we can't create such a program, because if we could, we could use it to create a program that would either run forever or stop, depending on what we wanted. To understand this better, let's consider a simple model called a Turing machine, which is a theoretical computer that can read and write symbols on an infinite tape. A Turing machine can be thought of as a simple computer program that follows a set of rules to manipulate the symbols on the tape. If we could create a program that could determine whether any given Turing machine would halt or run forever, we could use it to create a program that would either halt or run forever, depending on what we wanted.","130":"A proof by contradiction is a special case of a proof by contrapositive. The contrapositive of a statement 'if P then Q' is 'if not Q then not P'. So, when you see a proof by contradiction, you can rewrite it as a proof by contrapositive, which might be easier to follow. In the case of Cantor's diagonalization, we assume that the list of numbers is complete and then show that this leads to a contradiction. Does that make more sense now? I can try to explain the rest of the proof in simpler terms if you'd like.","131":"The thing is, Cantor's proof doesn't rely on the idea that you can't add any more numbers to the list. It relies on the idea that you can always add another number that isn't in the list. The proof is based on the concept of cardinality, not on the idea that you can't add more numbers to the list. So, even if you could add a better list, it wouldn't change the fact that there are uncountable numbers.","132":"You could have just said the question was unclear or not well-written instead of attacking me.","133":"I mean, for one, it would require massive amounts of energy to operate the plants, which would likely be generated by burning fossil fuels and contributing to climate change. And then there's the issue of the high concentration of brine waste, which would be toxic to marine life if released into the ocean. Not to mention the cost, which would be astronomical and likely fall on the taxpayer. So, no, it's not just a matter of 'leaving you out of it'.","134":"You're the one being a troll, not me. I'm just trying to have a respectful conversation. If you can't handle a little disagreement, then maybe you're the one who needs to shut up.","135":"In the United States, abortion is a legal medical procedure, but there are some restrictions. Some people think it should be legal only in cases of rape or incest, while others think it should be completely banned. The Supreme Court has made decisions that have changed the rules over time. The goal is to balance a woman's right to choose with the right to life of the unborn child.","136":"You're not listening to what I'm saying, which is that your argument about abortion is being undermined by your own values and actions, like having a vasectomy, which is a form of self-castration. That's not a neutral or progressive stance, and it's not something you can just brush off as 'I'm okay with abortion'.","137":"I'm trying to have a conversation about the metaphor of the sheep, and you're getting defensive","138":"No, it doesn't mean that the Devil's point is always wrong. The Devil's advocate is actually there to present the opposing view, to make sure that all possible arguments have been considered, and to help the decision-makers make a more informed decision.","139":"The term 'Devil's Advocate' actually comes from a historical figure who was appointed to argue against the canonization of saints. It wasn't because they thought the person was evil, but rather to ensure that the process was thorough and that all sides of the argument were considered. So, it's about presenting counterarguments, not about labeling someone as evil.","140":"A computer learns those first few steps of computing through a process called bootstrapping, which is like a self-teaching process where it uses its own code to teach itself the basics, kind of like how a child learns to read by sounding out words and gradually building up to more complex sentences.","141":"So, to explain the Halting Problem, imagine you have a program that can run other programs. You give it a program, and it tells you whether the program will run forever or stop eventually.","142":"P is supposed to solve the halting problem by predicting whether a given program will halt or run indefinitely. If P can do this, then it can also predict what the program will output when it halts. However, if M is able to see the whole of P, then it's not just predicting the output, it's predicting the output of the prediction of the output, which is a different story altogether.","143":"The key point is that we're not actually running the Perfect Decider on the Nasty Trickster in the sense of executing both programs; rather, we're using the Nasty Trickster to show that there's no way the Perfect Decider could work for all possible programs. Think of it as a theoretical argument rather than a practical one. We're showing that if such a Perfect Decider existed, we could use the Nasty Trickster to prove it wrong, which is a contradiction. This is a common technique in proof by contradiction, where we assume something exists and then show that it leads to a logical contradiction.","144":"The 'no true Scotsman' fallacy is a type of ad hoc reasoning where someone rejects an argument by claiming that the person making the argument doesn't truly represent the group they're talking about. It's called 'no true Scotsman' because of a classic example where someone says 'no true Scotsman eats haggis with anything other than turnips', and then when you point out that some Scots do eat haggis with other things, they say 'well, those aren't true Scotsmen'.","145":"No, they could still deny it.  They could say it's a union proposal, even if you call it something else, and reject it on those grounds.","146":"Yes, a single store can unionize. In fact, some individual Walmart stores have unionized in the past, such as the one in Jonquiere, Quebec, Canada. However, this is relatively rare and often involves a specific set of circumstances. Typically, unionization efforts at Walmart involve multiple stores or even entire regions.","147":"If you stand up, the urine doesn't flow straight down because of gravity. It flows down your leg because the flow of urine is being blocked by the opening of your urethra, which is below your bladder. It's not like a pipe where the flow is smooth and unobstructed. The urine has to flow through a narrow tube, and the shape of your body can cause the urine to flow in a different direction. That's why the funnel device is helpful - it helps to direct the flow of urine in the right direction.","148":"Yeah, it can be pretty annoying when it happens, especially if you're trying to, you know, have sex.","149":"Don\u2019t worry, it\u2019s a natural process and you\u2019ll figure it out as you go along. You can also ask your parents or a trusted adult if you have any questions or concerns.","150":"They use a combination of natural language processing and machine learning algorithms to analyze the text in your posts, comments, and direct messages. This allows them to identify patterns and relationships between words and topics. They also use data from your interactions on the platform, such as likes, comments, and shares, to get a better understanding of your interests and preferences. It's not that they're listening in on your conversations, but rather that they're using the data you've provided to make educated guesses about what you might be interested in.","151":"You're saying that you don't know how they're doing this, but the fact that you're now looking for the product suggests that you're looking for the product, and that's a sign of confirmation bias.","152":"It's not exactly like linking words to pictures in our mind, but rather a complex process involving semantic knowledge, context, and linguistic rules that help us understand the meaning of written language.","153":"Well, in many cultures, men who exhibit flamboyant or effeminate traits are often stigmatized, ridiculed, or even ostracized. This can be due to societal norms, family expectations, or even peer pressure. As a result, many men may feel the need to suppress or hide their more flamboyant or feminine sides to fit in or avoid being bullied or ridiculed.","154":"In a hypothetical universe without time, everything happens simultaneously. There's no past, present, or future. All events exist at the same instant, like a snapshot of the universe.","155":"Planck time is a unit of time that is defined as the time it takes for a photon to cross a distance equal to the Planck length, which is a unit of length that is defined as the square root of the ratio of the gravitational constant to the speed of light squared. It is approximately 5.4 x 10^-44 seconds.","156":"That's a good point, but for the purpose of this conversation, we'll be treating photons as having a point size for simplicity.","157":"Exactly, and that's why this theory is more about the perception of being stuck rather than an actual, objective state. It's about how our brains process and recall information, even if it's not always accurate.","158":"Just because we don't know the answers to everything doesn't mean we should blindly accept unproven claims. Science has shown us that the natural world operates according to laws and principles, and there's no need to invoke a higher power to explain it.","159":"Perhaps, but we can observe the physical effects of radio signals, like the interference they cause. We can't observe the physical effects of thoughts and ideas, like where they come from or how they're generated. The two are fundamentally different in that regard.","160":"Well, that's because our species has evolved to be highly social, and we have a complex emotional and psychological development that doesn't allow for immediate mating. In fact, most humans don't even develop strong emotional and social skills until their early twenties, which is why we have a prolonged adolescence. Other mammals, like chimpanzees or lions, tend to reach sexual maturity much earlier, but they also tend to have much shorter lifespans and less complex social structures.","161":"3a. That's an interesting point. So you're saying that humans adapt to their environment, but that doesn't necessarily mean we're capable of raising kids on our own at a young age? I'm still not seeing how that connects to the idea that humans aren't capable of raising kids at 13-18 because a 23 year old would have a hard time in the wilderness.","162":"But even in those tribes, you're assuming they had all the tools and knowledge they needed to survive from birth, which isn't the case.","163":"The explainee's definition of biology seems comprehensive. However, it does not account for the study of non-living things, such as the biology of a computer chip or the biology of a painting, which is not necessarily related to living organisms.","164":"Are you seriously suggesting that you think a 13 year old girl wouldn't be able to raise a child on her own?","165":"I think you\u2019re misunderstanding my point. I\u2019m not trying to trip you up, I\u2019m trying to clarify your understanding of the situation. Let\u2019s go back to the original premise and re-evaluate it together.","166":"Your argument is based on the assumption that the biological explanations given were not sufficient to answer your question. However, you were asking for a single biological reason why humans aren't ready for kids, which is a simplistic and unrealistic expectation. The complexity of the issue cannot be reduced to a single biological explanation.","167":"Well, think of a rectangle with a certain length and width. If you square the length and width, you get the area of the rectangle, which is a real-world quantity.","168":"The energy of the emitted particles is indeed sufficient to interact with other atoms, but the interactions are governed by the rules of quantum mechanics and nuclear physics. The emitted particles can scatter off other nuclei, but they can't simply 'knock' an atom back into its previous state. The energy of the emitted particles is not enough to overcome the energy barrier for the original decay process, so it's not possible for the Thorium to 'downgrade' back into Uranium through particle interactions. However, the emitted particles can cause other nuclear reactions, such as neutron-induced reactions, which can lead to different decay products. This is why nuclear reactors and accelerators often use moderators and reflectors to control the energy and direction of the emitted particles, to optimize the reaction process.","169":"Exactly, the extreme gravity and pressure at the core of a supernova allow for the fusion of heavier elements, including those heavier than iron.","170":"Let's start with the first question.  What do you mean by 'looks at x(x)'?  You're right, H(a,b) is a function that takes two arguments, a and b.  If we just replaced a and b with x, we'd have H(x,b), which is still a function that takes two arguments.  So what's going on with H(x,x)?  Is it that the function is somehow looking at x as both the program and the input?","171":"The halting problem is a fundamental challenge in computer science that questions whether there exists an algorithm that can determine, given an arbitrary program and input, whether the program will run forever or eventually halt. This problem has far-reaching implications for the design of programming languages, the development of artificial intelligence, and the understanding of computation itself. The halting problem is often attributed to Alan Turing, who first proposed it in 1936. However, the concept has been explored in various forms throughout the history of computer science. The halting problem is a classic example of a self-referential paradox, where a statement or a program refers to itself, leading to a logical contradiction or an infinite loop. In the context of the halting problem, the self-referential paradox arises when a program attempts to determine its own halting status, which leads to an infinite loop or a logical contradiction. This paradox highlights the limits of computation and the importance of understanding the boundaries of what can be computed.","172":"You can think of diagonalization as a proof by contradiction. The assumption is that there is a complete list of all possible programs that can run on a computer, and that list can be enumerated. The proof then shows that if such a list exists, then it must be possible to write a program that can run on a computer and will not be on the list, which is a contradiction because the list is supposed to be complete.","173":"No, it\u2019s a very small amount, and we don\u2019t absorb it through our skin or digestive system. It\u2019s not like we\u2019re going to glow in the dark or anything.","174":"The reason is that wood is a good insulator and can be more cost-effective than other materials, like steel, in many cases. Additionally, wood is a common material in the US, and builders often stick to what they know and use locally available materials. This is especially true in suburban areas where the primary concern is not withstanding extreme weather, but rather with aesthetics and affordability. ","175":"I don't see how that helps. If the fire is large enough, it will still burn the entire area regardless of the material of the houses.","176":"You're saying that Weinstein's conviction was based on an unverified claim, and that's not what you wanted to hear.","177":"Well, the value is in the potential future earnings, not just the immediate dividends. If the company continues to grow, your share of the company will be worth more, so even if you don't get any dividends, you can still sell your shares for more than you bought them for.","178":"So, just like you get a share of the eggs from the goose, when a company makes a profit, you get a share of that profit in the form of dividends. That's why owning shares is not just about selling them, but also about receiving a portion of the company's profits.","179":"That's a nice idea, but it doesn't work that way. The board of directors decides how to allocate profits, and they might choose to reinvest in the company rather than pay out dividends. Even if you choose not to take dividends, the company's performance doesn't directly translate to more stocks for you.","180":"But an IPO is a one-time event where a company issues shares to the public for the first time. It's not a business model like MLM, where people are constantly being recruited and sold products. And just because a company might not buy shares doesn't mean it's a Ponzi scheme. In a Ponzi scheme, the promise of unusually high returns is based on new investors, not on the company's actual performance. MLMs don't make such promises, they just sell products to people who are already customers.","181":"explainee's response","182":"That's true, but what about the network effect of an MLM? You have to sell to others to make a profit, whereas with apples, you can just sell to grocers.","183":"I guess my post just wasn't that interesting, huh?","184":"The amount of water on Earth isn't a constant, it's a cycle. Water evaporates from the oceans, lakes, and rivers, forms clouds, and then comes back to Earth as precipitation. So, the water that's wasted is just part of this cycle, it's not gone forever, it's just being recycled.","185":"And don't forget to patent it, so you can cash in on your genius and save the world, all at the same time. ","186":"because atoms are made up of even smaller particles called protons, neutrons, and electrons, and these particles are held together by strong forces that require a lot of energy to overcome, like trying to break a strong metal chain with a knife or a hammer.","187":"Your answer here","188":"The reason it doesn't stratify itself is because of the temperature gradient. The temperature decreases with altitude, so the heavier gases are actually denser than the lighter gases at higher altitudes, which means they sink to the bottom. But the heavier gases also have lower temperatures, which makes them less dense than the lighter gases at the bottom, which makes them rise. It's a balance between the two, and that's why the atmosphere doesn't stratify itself by molecular mass.","189":"Well, we don't suffocate because CO2 is present, but rather because the oxygen levels are lower than they would be if the CO2 was evenly distributed. The air we breathe is about 21% oxygen, and the rest is mostly nitrogen. If CO2 were to stratify and reach the same concentration as the oxygen, that would be a problem. But the CO2 levels in a confined space are usually much lower than that. It's not the CO2 that's the problem, it's that there's less oxygen available because it's been displaced by the heavier gases.","190":"Not exactly. Our brain uses a network of connections to map words to concepts and ideas, rather than literal pictures. It's a complex process involving multiple cognitive systems and neural pathways. We draw upon our prior knowledge, experiences, and context to derive meaning from text.","191":"Because in analog, signals can vary continuously and never truly reach a maximum threshold, unlike digital signals which are binary and can only be fully on or off.","192":"Analog signals can represent a continuous range of values, not just on or off. Think of it like a volume knob on your radio, it can be turned up or down to any level in between, not just 0 or 100%.","193":"The Earth's water is constantly being recycled, but the rate at which it's being recycled is much slower than the rate at which we're using it. Think of it like a big water tank that's being filled up very slowly, but we're using water from it at a much faster rate than it's being refilled. That's why we can say we're wasting water, even though the total amount of water on Earth isn't changing.","194":"I don't think you're in a position to be giving advice on how to have a discussion, given how condescending and dismissive your responses have been.","195":"If you think the question belongs in a different subreddit, could you try posting it there?

The film is a good insulator in the winter because it traps the warm air inside the greenhouse, but in the summer it can make it hotter inside because it blocks the heat from escaping. So, if you leave it up in the summer, it can actually make the greenhouse hotter than it would be without it.","199":"I guess I never thought about how greenhouses work in the first place.","200":"Christianity became the dominant religion in the world through a combination of historical events, missionary work, and the spread of Western colonialism. It started with the spread of Christianity from the Middle East to Europe, and then to other parts of the world through the efforts of missionaries and colonizers. The Crusades, the Inquisition, and the colonization of the Americas, Africa, and Asia all played a role in the spread of Christianity. Additionally, the development of printing technology and the translation of the Bible into local languages helped to disseminate Christian teachings and make them more accessible to people. The rise of Christianity as a dominant world religion was also influenced by the decline of other religions and the cultural and social changes that occurred during the Middle Ages and the Renaissance.","201":"The Roman Empire was expanding rapidly and was looking for ways to unite its diverse population. The early Christian church was a great way to do that. They were able to spread their message quickly and effectively through their network of missionaries and churches. As the empire grew, so did the number of Christians. It became a popular movement that was hard to ignore. By the time Constantine came to power, it was a significant force in the empire. He likely saw the potential benefits of aligning himself with this powerful movement, and that's why he converted.","202":"You could have just calmly told me that the question was unclear instead of making a snide comment.","203":"If we were to purify all salt water, it would disrupt the natural balance of the ocean's chemistry, causing a chain reaction that would affect the entire marine ecosystem. It would also lead to the loss of biodiversity, as many species rely on the salt water to survive. Furthermore, the process of purifying salt water would require a massive amount of energy, contributing to climate change and pollution. Not to mention the economic costs of such a project would be astronomical.","204":"I'm not the one who can't handle a little disagreement, it's a discussion forum, not a dictatorship.","205":"First, let's talk about how animals are being raised for food. It's a huge industry, and it's one of the biggest causes of pollution and greenhouse gas emissions. Animals are being kept in huge factories and farms, where they're fed a lot of food and water, and they produce a lot of poop. This poop is not good for the environment, and it makes the air and water dirty. It's also very bad for the animals, because they're living in very small spaces and are treated very badly. ","206":"Explainer: > I see.

The issue isn't the livestock itself, it's the scale at which we're doing it. The problem isn't cow farts, it's the fact that we're producing so much meat to feed a global population that's growing exponentially. And as for vertical farming, it's not a replacement for traditional agriculture, it's a supplement. We need to be talking about sustainable practices, not just replacing one method with another.","208":"I've got the watch, and it's still not helping me catch more Pok\u00e9mon.","209":"I'm not being entitled, I'm just stating my preference for saving money.

It differs from normal ammo in that it has a harder outer layer, which helps it to maintain its shape and penetrate deeper into a target without expanding or deforming. This makes it more effective for long-range shooting and for shooting through barriers, but it also makes it more likely to over-penetrate and cause collateral damage.","214":"That\u2019s true, but if you do get hit, the green tip\u2019s got a lot less chance of causing major damage to internal organs and that\u2019s a big deal.","215":"Alcoholism is a disease because it affects the brain and body in ways that are hard to control. When you drink, alcohol changes the way your brain works, making you feel happy and relaxed. But over time, your brain gets used to this feeling and starts to crave it. It's like your brain is addicted to the feeling, and it keeps asking for more. This is called dependence. And if you try to stop drinking, your brain can get really upset and make you feel sick. It's like your brain is saying, 'No, no, no! We need more of that feeling!' That's why it's so hard to quit drinking once you've started. It's not just a matter of willpower; it's a physical response to the way alcohol affects your brain and body.","216":"That's correct, but it's not that simple. The employer's share of FICA taxes is only a small portion of their total costs for health coverage. They would still have to pay for the remaining costs, which could be more expensive than what they're currently paying for private health coverage.","217":"Well, the government has to pay for all the costs that the insurance companies would normally cover, like the salaries of the people working for the insurance companies, the cost of marketing, the cost of the websites, the cost of the paperwork, and so on.  And on top of that, the government has to pay for the actual healthcare, whereas the insurance companies only have to pay for the claims they have to pay out.  And then there's the issue of the government's payment systems and administrative overhead, which are notoriously inefficient and wasteful.","218":"They hoard wealth and power, creating social and economic inequality, which can lead to unrest and destabilization of societies. In extreme cases, it can even lead to revolutions and the downfall of governments.","219":"They're called Noble Gases because they don't easily react with other elements, not because they're being referred to as aristocrats. It's actually a historical reference to their unreactive nature, which was seen as 'noble' compared to the highly reactive elements that would readily form compounds.","220":"The noble gases do indeed have radioactive isotopes, although they are very rare and have long half-lives. For example, krypton-81m is a radioactive isotope of krypton that decays into argon-81. As for the periodic table, the decay of elements into other elements does not create new columns or periods, but rather new isotopes and elements that can be synthesized in a laboratory. And to answer your second question, hydrogen-1 is indeed stable and does not decay into helium-2, but stars can die through processes that are not related to the decay of hydrogen isotopes, such as the collapse of the core or the ejection of material into space.","221":"Radon is a noble gas, and like all noble gases, it's stable and doesn't decay into anything else.","222":"I don\u2019t think so, because we already have elements with atomic number 118, and IUPAC only accepts elements with atomic numbers greater than 1, so there won\u2019t be any more elements added to the 8th row, which means there won\u2019t be a 9th row.","223":"I've been studying the decay rates of the elements on the periodic table for years, and I've been able to make some pretty accurate predictions about what would happen if we were to continue the pattern.","224":"I was assuming you meant downshifting into a lower gear, which can cause damage to the transmission if done repeatedly or under load.","225":"I'm not claiming to be infallible, but I can tell you that the benefits of skipping gears in certain situations have been well-documented by experts in the field.","226":"Actually, those specifications are more historical or theoretical and don't reflect current practice. The ability to print money is more about liquidity and confidence in the system rather than a direct determinant of value.","227":"Because it would hurt the fish and other creatures that live in the ocean. Radioactive waste is bad for them, and it would make their homes dirty and unhealthy.","228":"The value of your share is in the potential future returns, not the dividends. If the company grows, your share will be worth more, and you can sell it for a higher price. That's the value of your share, it's not the dividend, it's the potential for future growth.","229":"If the company reinvests all the profits, you don't get any new eggs, but if they pay out some of those profits as dividends, you get some of those new eggs, which can then be kept or reinvested.","230":"That's not how it works.  If you don't take the dividend, the company doesn't just give you more stocks because you're not taking the dividend.  The dividend is a payment that the company makes to its shareholders, and it's a payment that is made out of the company's profits.  If the company doesn't make that payment, it doesn't automatically give you more stocks.  The value of your stock could go up or down, but it's not a direct result of not taking the dividend.  And even if the company does give you more stocks, it's not because you're'reinvesting' your dividend, it's because the company is giving you more stocks as a way of distributing its profits, not because you're somehow magically getting more stocks by not taking the dividend.","231":"In an IPO, the company is raising capital from the public for the first time, whereas in an MLM, you're buying products with the intention of selling them at a markup, but the real emphasis is on recruiting others to join the scheme. Regarding the Ponzi scheme, it's not just about waiting for a market crash; it's about convincing new investors to join with promises of high returns, not necessarily based on the company's performance or potential for growth.","232":"But what about companies that have a strong brand or a unique product? Doesn't that give their stocks intrinsic value? And what about the value of a stock in a company that has a strong track record of financial performance? Can't that be considered intrinsic value as well?","233":"Exactly, when you buy stocks, you're essentially buying a piece of that company, but it's more like a claim on the company's assets and profits rather than direct control over the company's operations. Think of it like owning a small portion of a painting, you still don't get to decide what the artist does next, but you get a share of the value if the painting appreciates.","234":"However, in the case of MLMs, you're not buying a tangible product like apples. You're buying a business opportunity that promises returns based on recruiting others, which is a much riskier and less controllable investment. You're essentially betting on the success of the entire business model, which can be much more volatile than the success of a single product like apples.","235":"Well, when a computer first starts up, it has a set of instructions that are hardcoded into its processor or its ROM. These instructions tell the computer how to perform basic operations like adding numbers or moving data around. It's like a recipe book that the computer uses to make its first few dishes. As the computer runs these instructions, it starts to learn and adapt, and it can begin to learn more complex things like how to recognize patterns or make decisions. It's a bit like how a child learns to talk by listening to and imitating their parents - the computer is learning by doing and interacting with its environment.","236":"Analog signals are continuous and can have any value within a certain range, not just 1 and 0.","237":"If you think a company will grow and be worth more money in the future, you can buy its non-dividend shares. When the company does grow, the value of your shares will increase, and you can sell them for a higher price than you bought them for, making a profit.","238":"A period, also known as menstruation, is when the uterus sheds its lining, which is when you get your period. It's a natural process that happens every month in people with uteruses, typically between the ages of 11 and 55. During this time, the body prepares for a potential pregnancy, and if there isn't one, the uterine lining is released as blood through the vagina.","239":"Girls have a more complex reproductive system than boys because they have to carry the pregnancy and nourish the fetus. This means that their bodies have to go through a lot of changes to make sure the baby can grow and develop. The reproductive system of girls is also more visible than that of boys, which can make it seem more complicated. But the changes that girls go through during puberty are just as normal and natural as the changes that boys go through. It's just that the changes in girls are more noticeable because they have to prepare their bodies for pregnancy and childbirth.","240":"Planes don't actually fly on the bottom of the globe. They fly through the air. The Earth is a big ball, and planes fly around it, not on it. When a plane takes off, it lifts off the ground and into the air, where it can fly to its destination.","241":"That's why it's called an inverted image, right? It's not actually upside down, but it appears that way because of the way we perceive the image from space.","242":"it's a logical comparison, isn't it?","243":"Well, the government would have to hire and pay a large number of bureaucrats to handle the new system, and it would be difficult to scale down the workforce once the system is set up.  Additionally, the government would have to handle the payment of claims, which is a complex and time-consuming process.  It would likely require the creation of a new agency, with its own infrastructure and personnel, which would be expensive.  Furthermore, the government would have to deal with the issue of fraud and abuse, which is a significant problem in the private insurance system.  All of these factors would likely increase the cost of the system, at least in the short term.","244":"If you buy shares that don't pay dividends, it's because you think the company will grow a lot in the future and make more money. So, when you sell your shares later, you might get a lot more money than you paid for them, making it a good investment.","245":"Exactly, it's like owning a share of a company versus owning a specific product. When you buy stock, you're essentially buying a piece of the company's overall value, not a specific item. It's more about the company's performance and potential for growth rather than the physical goods themselves.","246":"You're not paying for the opportunity to sell apples to grocers, you're paying for the opportunity to buy apples at a discounted price and then sell them to others at a markup. You're essentially buying a product at a wholesale price and then selling it at a retail price. But in an MLM, you're paying for the opportunity to buy a product at a discounted price and then sell it to others at a markup, while also recruiting others to do the same. The cost of the product is not the only cost, the cost of recruitment and the cost of the 'business opportunity' are also factored in.","247":"Alcoholism is a disease because it affects the brain and body in ways that are similar to other chronic diseases, like diabetes or heart disease. When someone drinks alcohol regularly, it can change the way their brain and body function, making it harder for them to control their drinking and leading to physical and emotional problems.","248":"The medical model doesn't necessarily imply that the individual is blameless. It's not about excusing the behavior, but understanding the underlying causes. Addiction is a complex interplay between biology, environment, and behavior. It's not a simple matter of willpower or personal choice.","249":"Smoking is considered a risk factor or a cause of disease, rather than a disease itself, because it's a voluntary behavior. People choose to smoke, whereas diseases like COPD and type 2 diabetes are often the result of complex interactions between genetics, environment, and lifestyle factors. By calling smoking a disease, you might inadvertently absolve smokers of personal responsibility for their health outcomes.","250":"The reason is that the Nazis' ideology was rooted in a mix of anti-communism, anti-liberalism, and anti-Semitism, which are all hallmarks of far-right ideologies. Additionally, the Nazis' emphasis on authoritarianism, militarism, and the suppression of minority groups also aligns with far-right tendencies.","251":null,"252":"Because in most cultures, traditionally masculine traits are associated with being strong, reliable, and responsible, rather than flamboyant or showy. This is not to say that all men who exhibit traditionally masculine traits are not flamboyant, but rather that flamboyance is often seen as a trait more commonly associated with traditionally feminine or androgynous individuals.","253":"They are not foolproof and can be manipulated by trained individuals, which raises ethical concerns. Moreover, the results can be influenced by various factors such as the individual's mental state, the skill of the interrogator, and the environment in which the test is conducted.","254":"Well, one reason is that college is often a person's first experience of living independently, making their own choices, and developing their identity away from family and friends. It's a time of great change and growth, and people often form strong bonds with their peers and professors. These relationships can become a sense of community and belonging that lasts a lifetime.","255":"I think it's interesting that you feel that way, because for me, it's not just about the friendships I made, but also about the opportunities and experiences that the institution provided that helped foster those relationships.","256":"You're saying that the experts are wrong, and they're using a metaphor that's misleading.","257":"The chance of an apple seed growing into an orange tree is zero, or so close to zero that it's not worth considering. It's a very specific process that's been observed and described, and it's not something that's going to suddenly diverge into something entirely different.","258":"Let's start with the basics. Animal agriculture is a leading cause of deforestation, greenhouse gas emissions, and water pollution. It's responsible for around 14.5% of global greenhouse gas emissions, which is more than the entire transportation sector. By choosing plant-based options, you're reducing the demand for animal products and the resources needed to produce them, which in turn helps to preserve forests, reduce emissions, and protect water sources.","259":"The debate is a way to refine your own thoughts and ideas, and to prepare yourself for the possibility of being challenged or corrected by others.","260":"Well, some companies might not have enough profits to pay out dividends, or they might be reinvesting their profits back into the company to grow. In these cases, buying non-dividend shares might still be a good investment if you believe in the company's growth prospects.","261":"If a company is worth more than its current market value, it means that its future prospects and earnings are expected to be higher than what is currently reflected in the market price. When a company distributes a portion of its profits to its shareholders in the form of dividends, that's a direct benefit to the buyer. It's not just about selling the stock at a higher price, but also about receiving a return on your investment. That's why investors buy stocks, not just because they're rare, but because they expect the company to perform well and generate profits that will be distributed to them as dividends.","262":"When you sell your stock, you're essentially selling a claim on a portion of those assets, which can then be used to purchase other assets or goods that you can directly sell or use.","263":"Because dividends are a different thing, a company can choose to give you some of the profit as dividends, but it's not a requirement. Jeff Bezos, as the owner, can choose to take the profit as dividends, but he also has other options, like reinvesting it in the company.","264":"In many corporate workplaces, there's a history of racism and bias against people with African features, and unfortunately, the afro hairstyle is often seen as a symbol of that. It's also been associated with a lack of professionalism or a 'wild' or 'unruly' image, which is not necessarily fair, but it's a common stereotype. Think of it like a 'uniform' that's been passed down through generations, but it's not necessarily based on facts or reality. ","265":"It's not the afro itself, but rather the fact that some people might be uncomfortable around someone with an afro, or might have preconceived notions about the kind of person who has an afro. This could lead to tension or conflict in the workplace.","266":"It's because of a thing called entropy, which is basically the measure of disorder or randomness in the universe. In other words, life is trying to create more order and complexity in the universe, and self-replication is a way to achieve that. Think of it like a game of Tetris: the pieces keep falling, and life is trying to build a tower that's as stable and organized as possible.","267":"The thing is, equilibrium doesn't necessarily mean'staying the same'. It means that the system is in a state where the rate of change is zero. Think of it like a ball at the bottom of a valley - it's not moving, but it's not staying the same either. It's just that the forces acting on it are balanced. In the case of life, the forces are the tendency towards entropy (which is a measure of disorder or randomness), and the tendency towards order and complexity that comes from the interactions between living organisms and their environment. It's a delicate balance, and it's what allows life to persist and evolve over time. As for why viruses can be so efficient, it's because they've evolved to be very good at replicating themselves, often at the expense of their hosts. It's a strategy that's allowed them to survive and thrive in a wide range of environments.","268":"A tachometer is a tool that shows you how fast your engine is spinning, which is usually measured in revolutions per minute (RPM). It helps you keep your engine in a safe range and avoid damaging it by going too fast or too slow.","269":"I'm afraid that's not true. The post was removed because it doesn't belong to the explain club, not because the mods didn't like the question.","270":"Oh, wow, I'm so sorry that the explanations were 'worthless' and 'dismissive' for you. I guess we should just start from the beginning and spoon-feed you the information since you clearly can't handle it on your own. I mean, it's not like you're just being obstinate or anything. ","271":"I understand your frustration, but the process is in place to ensure that justice is served, even if it's not always immediate.","272":"No, you can't just pay yourself any amount pre-tax, that's not how accounting works.  You have to follow Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) and the Internal Revenue Code (IRC).  The salary you pay yourself is a business expense, but you have to report it as income on your personal tax return.","273":"You're thinking of the flow of money, but this is about the flow of accounting. Think of it like a separate bucket, and the money that you pay yourself is coming from that bucket, not from your profit.","274":"That's a classic problem in cosmology, and there are a few theories, but one popular idea is the concept of the multiverse, where our universe is just one of many bubbles in a vast multidimensional space, and the Big Bang was just the result of a collision or interaction between our bubble and another one. Another theory is the eternal inflation theory, which suggests that our universe is just one of many universes that are constantly popping into existence, and the Big Bang was just the result of a random fluctuation in the energy density of space.","275":"I think that's because we're using a human-centric way of thinking about the universe. We're thinking in terms of causality and agency, which is not applicable to the universe at the scale of the big bang. It's not about who or what invented it, but rather the emergence of the universe from a state of quantum fluctuation.  The laws of physics that govern our universe are the same laws that governed the universe at the moment of the big bang. So, in a sense, the universe is not so much invented as it is an unfolding of its own potential.  Does that make any sense? ","276":"But you know, I think that's why I love this stuff so much.  It's brutal, but it's also beautiful, in its own way.  It's like trying to describe a colour to someone who's blind, or a sound to someone who's deaf.  You can try to explain it with words, but you'll never fully get it across.  It's one of those things that you just have to experience for yourself.","277":"The explanation should be in the context of the conversation and should not sound condescending or dismissive.","278":"It's a combination of factors, actually. ARM processors are generally designed for low power consumption, which is crucial for mobile devices. They use a different instruction set architecture and have a different cache hierarchy, which helps reduce power usage. Additionally, ARM processors often have a lower clock speed compared to x86 processors, which also contributes to lower power consumption. The cooling efficiency is also influenced by the fact that ARM processors are typically used in smaller form factors, which allows for more efficient heat dissipation. So, it's a combination of design choices, architecture, and usage patterns that make ARM processors more efficient in terms of cooling.","279":"Your experience is very different from mine. I've never seen it as a controversy, but I guess we're just in different worlds.","280":"I've been doing it for years, I've lost count of how many times I've tried and failed. I've even tried using my own money to hire lawyers to help but nothing seems to work.","281":"I'm glad you've learned about workers rights, I'm still learning myself. I'm not sure if it's the same everywhere, but I've heard that some places have a 'no questions asked' policy when it comes to asking for wages. Have you ever heard of anything like that?","282":"Yes, they would still have sexual urges, but the brain reorganizes itself to compensate for the loss. It's a complex process, and it's different for each person. Some people might experience a decrease in libido, while others might not. The brain is highly adaptable, and it finds ways to adjust to the new situation. The key is to focus on other aspects of life, like relationships, work, or hobbies, to redirect one's energy and attention. It's not always easy, but with time, support, and therapy, people can learn to cope with their new situation.","283":"However, it's worth noting that the relationship between testosterone and sexual urges is not entirely straightforward. Some people who have low levels of testosterone may still have strong sexual desires, and conversely, some people with high levels of testosterone may not experience strong sexual urges at all. There are many other factors that can influence an individual's sexual desires and behaviors.","284":"You're welcome! I'd be happy to help you look into the history of castration in your culture if you'd like.","285":"Because gold is not as convenient as money, and it's hard to divide into smaller units for everyday transactions. Plus, gold is not as durable as money - it can get damaged or lost, whereas money is more resistant to damage and can be easily stored and transported.","286":"Now, we can use a balance scale to weigh the coins and make sure they're not underweight, which would indicate they've been shaved down.","287":"I'm actually a chemist, I've been following some research on that topic lately","288":"First, let's talk about how animal agriculture is a leading cause of greenhouse gas emissions. It's responsible for around 14.5% of global GHG emissions, which is more than the entire transportation sector. This is because cows, sheep, and other livestock produce methane as part of their digestive process, and also because of deforestation and land-use changes to create pastures and grow feed crops.","289":"You're basically saying that despite the overwhelming evidence that this idea is impractical and harmful, you still think it's a good idea, and that someone else will magically make it work for you?","290":"Well, the reason is that the term 'far-right' doesn't just refer to a political ideology of extreme nationalism and authoritarianism, but also to a set of values and attitudes that are often associated with the far-right, such as racism, xenophobia, and anti-Semitism. The Nazi Party's ideology was rooted in these values, and they used them to justify their extreme policies and actions. So, while Hitler's Germany was certainly a centralised, regulated, and authoritarian state, the Nazi Party's ideology and actions were also driven by a set of far-right values that are distinct from the more general characteristics of a centralised state.","291":"because their ideology is clearly aligned with the characteristics of the far-right, such as authoritarianism, nationalism, and suppression of minority groups.","292":"But that's not what National Socialism is about, it's about racial and ethnic purity, not economic regulation.","293":"Hidden City travel is a way for passengers to bypass fare rules and get cheaper tickets by booking a ticket with a layover in a city they don't intend to visit, but it can also cost airlines revenue because passengers may not be completing the intended journey.","294":"Because it's said to be associated with the Schumann Resonance, which is a natural electromagnetic frequency produced by the Earth's atmosphere, and is often linked to paranormal or spiritual experiences.","295":"Yes, it would be theoretically possible to make a location\/home 'haunted' by emitting this frequency, but it's worth noting that the effectiveness of this would depend on the sensitivity of the individuals present and the acoustics of the space. As for physical reactions, yes, there have been reports of increased heart rate, palpitations, and even changes in brain wave activity when people are exposed to the 18.9 Hz frequency. Some people have also reported feeling a 'tingling' sensation in their skin or a 'cold spot' in the air. However, it's worth noting that these reactions can vary greatly from person to person, and not everyone will experience them in the same way.","296":"Well, it can lead to a lot of social unrest, protests, and even violence. But more importantly, it can also affect the political landscape of a country. Some politicians use this situation to further polarize the public, which can lead to the rise of extremist groups and further destabilize the political system.","297":"Radioactive waste can travel long distances through the ocean and affect marine life, even if it's not immediately near the dump site. Also, the ocean is not a bottomless pit; it has a finite capacity to absorb pollutants, and radioactive waste is particularly difficult to clean up once it's been released.","298":"I think that's a red herring, though. The cost of a containment facility is tiny compared to the cost of cleaning up a nuclear disaster. And a leakage on land is just as catastrophic as one in the sea.","299":"The political debate is largely driven by NIMBYism, people don't want it in their backyard, and also the fact that the US has a very low tolerance for risk, even if the risk is extremely low. It's not that the engineering isn't solid, it's that the public perception is that it's not safe, and politicians are afraid to take on that issue. Plus, the Yucca Mountain site was a specific example of a site that was chosen for its geology, but it was ultimately blocked by the courts and the politicians, so it's become a sort of symbol of the problem.","300":"You've got this! What's your plan for the next 5K?","301":"It is a fallacy because it's a way of moving the goalposts to avoid an argument. If someone says something is a characteristic of Scotsmen, and you say it's not true of Scotsmen, they'll just change the definition of what it means to be a Scotsman to exclude the thing you brought up. It's a way of avoiding criticism by changing the rules of the game.","302":"That is what happens when you are passionate about a particular idea or perspective, you want to share it with others and get their feedback.","303":"That's not why it was removed.

For example, an electron's antiparticle is a positron, which has the same mass as an electron but a positive charge instead of a negative one. As for anti-gravity, it's a bit more complicated. Anti-gravity is not exactly the opposite of gravity, but rather a hypothetical force that could potentially counteract or even reverse the effects of gravity. It's not something that's been directly observed or proven to exist, but some theories suggest that it could be a possibility. Think of it like a 'negative' force that could push objects away instead of pulling them in, but it's not the same as gravity in the sense that it's not a fundamental force of nature like gravity is.","307":"I'm talking about the 4D cube, a tesseract.

It's a very different approach, and one that raises a lot of ethical concerns. ","317":"You\u2019re not comparing apples to apples. The current system is designed to protect the rights of the accused, and that means it can be slow and imperfect. Narco tests, on the other hand, are a shortcut that can be used to convict someone quickly, but they can also be used to convict an innocent person. You can\u2019t just compare the two systems like they\u2019re interchangeable.

And that's why people who go to tanning salons are often trying to achieve a certain look, rather than actually trying to tan naturally.","321":"Well, it's because people are often trying to achieve a certain look or aesthetic, rather than just letting their skin adapt naturally to the season. If you're going out of your way to get a tan, it's often because you want to look healthy and fit, but if you're going out of your way to get pale, it's often because you're trying to fit a certain beauty standard that's not necessarily healthy.","322":"but that\u2019s not the same thing.

But the protection it offers is not enough to prevent tanning, especially in strong sunlight.

Try to stay on topic and we'll get somewhere.","326":"I didn't mean to come across that way. I'm trying to understand your perspective.","327":"That's true, but it's not just about the amount of sun you get, it's about the intensity and duration of that sun. Even through clouds, UV radiation can still pass through, and clothing, especially light-colored clothing, doesn't block it completely. That's why people who spend a lot of time outdoors, even in cloudy conditions, can still get a tan. And it's not just about the amount of time, it's also about the frequency and consistency of sun exposure.

I'm not buying it.","329":"It's actually a reference to their unreactive nature, not their social status. They don't readily form compounds with other elements, which makes them 'noble' in the sense that they're not easily corrupted or changed by other elements.","330":"Yes, radon is a noble gas, a member of the 18th column of the periodic table. It's radioactive and it decays into a stable isotope of lead, lead-206, or into polonium-210, which is also radioactive.","331":"The half-life of lead is about 22 billion years, but it doesn't decay into anything else. Lead is a stable element. It's not radioactive, so it doesn't undergo radioactive decay. It's one of the elements that are stable and don't break down into anything else.  And yes, you're right, it would take us billions of years to find out if lead decays into something else, but it's unlikely to happen because it's a stable element.  So, going back to the flowchart, the noble elements like radon will eventually decay into lead, but lead itself will remain stable and won't break down into anything else.","332":"The periodic table is a way of organizing elements based on their properties, but it's not a physical reality that can change over time. Elements can't just suddenly appear or disappear, and the periodic table won't suddenly gain new columns or rows.","333":"I'm not saying that I have firsthand experience with discovering elements, but the trend of element decay rates and the time it takes to discover new elements supports the claim that there's probably no 9th row.","334":"The universe is vast and has many stars and galaxies.

In fact, the concept of a center is more of a theoretical construct, especially when considering the universe's vastness and the movement of galaxies.","335":"I'm not sure I see how that follows.","336":"I'm not saying the physics would be different, but rather that the expansion of the universe is not like a lake with waves rippling outwards. The expansion is accelerating, and objects with lighter mass will actually move faster and potentially overtake others, which is what we see happening with the Milky Way and Andromeda galaxies. The theory of dark energy explains why objects are accelerating away from us, but it's not just a matter of gravity and other forces knocking objects around.","337":"It's called a cold shock response. When your body gets too cold, it tries to warm itself up by increasing your heart rate and blood pressure, which can cause your muscles to contract, leading to those random shivers. It's a natural response to help your body conserve heat.","338":"I understand, but keep in mind that while it's interesting to see what others are saying, some of the answers might not be accurate or up-to-date, so it's always best to cross-check with a medical professional.","339":"Have you ever experienced any other similar issues with your memory or imagination, or is this a relatively isolated phenomenon?","340":"You're saying that you can understand the object's internal workings without having to describe them, which is really interesting. Does that mean that you're using a different cognitive process when you're trying to imagine the object, rather than when you're just understanding it in your head? ","341":"Can you describe the movie you just imagined in your mind?","342":"Vaccination helps prevent the spread of flu and reduces the risk of severe illness and hospitalization.","343":"That's not a big deal, but it's worth considering getting one. Even if you're healthy, a doctor can provide you with preventative care and advice on how to stay healthy.","344":"So, a period is when the uterus contracts to push out the lining and any fertilized eggs.","345":"Puberty is a natural process, and it's normal to feel scared or unsure about what's happening. But the good news is that you'll have a lot of support from your family, friends, and even your body. Your body will start to change in many ways, but it's all part of growing up and becoming a healthy adult. You'll learn more about it as you go through it, and it's okay to ask questions or talk to someone if you're feeling confused or uncomfortable. Just remember, you're not alone in this, and it's a normal part of life.","346":"Well, that's a good point, girls do go through a lot of changes during puberty. One of the main reasons is because of the reproductive system. Girls have a vagina, uterus, and ovaries, which all need to develop and mature. Boys also have a reproductive system, but it's much simpler. They have testes that produce sperm and a penis, which also needs to develop. However, the reproductive system in girls is more complex because it needs to support a potential pregnancy, which is a lot more complicated than just producing sperm.","347":"Yes, that's right. The automation and technology that replaces jobs would be maintained and updated by a new generation of workers, who would then be supported by the UBI while they work on the automation.","348":"No, because analog signals can be any value within a certain range, not just two discrete values like digital signals.","349":"But that's not entirely accurate. Analog signals can be represented as a range of values, but the key difference is that analog signals can have any value within that range, not just a fixed set of positions.","350":"Well, the thing is, migrants aren't all great, and some of them might not be who they claim to be. Erdogan is threatening to let migrants into Europe because he knows that many of them are actually refugees from Syria and other countries, and he's using them as leverage to get what he wants from Europe. He's not just talking about the people who are fleeing war and persecution, he's also talking about people who might be economic migrants, or even people who are being smuggled in for other reasons. So, when Erdogan says he's going to let migrants into Europe, he's not just talking about the people you think of as 'great', he's talking about a whole mix of people, and some of them might not be what you expect.","351":"I'm just trying to understand why you posted something that seems so obviously low-effort and off-topic.","352":"When you hit your finger, the cold causes the nerve endings to go into shock. This shock makes the pain feel like it's amplified, like a million exploding stars. It's not that the actual damage to your finger is any worse, it's just that your brain is interpreting the pain as much worse due to the cold. Think of it like a volume control on your pain. When it's cold, the volume is turned up, and when it's at room temperature, the volume is turned down.","353":"I can imagine. I'm not sure what it is about our body temperature being lower than the ambient temperature that makes our fingers act up, but I'm sure it's some sort of thermoregulation thing.","354":"I'm not sure that's a practical solution, and I'm not sure I want to risk using a hair dryer near water or in a confined space.","355":"I think that's a very astute observation.  I think it's possible that parents are giving their kids the best, but also inadvertently teaching them that they need these things to be happy, when in reality they don't.  I think it's a bit of a vicious cycle, where parents want to give their kids a better life than they had, but in doing so, they're actually perpetuating the same problems that they're trying to escape.  And I think that's a really interesting thing to consider, because it challenges the idea that we're just giving our kids the best, when in reality we might be giving them a set of expectations that are unsustainable.","356":"Well, some companies might not have enough money to pay out dividends, or they might want to keep their money to invest in the company to make it grow faster. In that case, buying non-dividend shares means you're hoping the company will grow and become more valuable over time, so you can sell your shares for a higher price later.","357":"Exactly, and that's the key point.  You wouldn't let me sell the storefront because it would hurt the business, and similarly, if you owned 10% of Amazon, you wouldn't want to sell your shares because it would reduce your share of the profits.  That's why the tax code treats this as a capital gain, rather than ordinary income.","358":"The value of the share is the potential to have a claim on that future profit.","359":"You can't compare that to a goose laying golden eggs, because with a goose, you can actually see the eggs being laid and you can decide whether to take them or leave them. With a publicly traded company, you don't have that same level of control.","360":"The key difference is that MLMs don't have a tangible product like food or water. The product is the opportunity to make money, which is not something you can hold in your hand. And because of that, the value is not intrinsic, but rather perceived by the buyer.","361":"The point of wholesalers is that you're buying into a company that's already established, so you're not taking on the risk of starting a new business, but you're still getting a share of the profits.","362":"You're right that there are some differences between buying apples and participating in an MLM, but I still think the analogy holds. The key point is that you're taking on the risk of not being able to sell the apples at a profit, and that risk is not mitigated just because you can do market research or use the apples for compost. In fact, the MLM scheme is often designed to make it difficult for participants to exit or change their strategy, which is a major risk factor that you're not considering.","363":"Well, when the common cold is in its off season, it doesn't actually go away, it just becomes less active. It resides in a state of dormancy in the mucous membranes of our respiratory tracts, where it can remain for months without causing any symptoms. This is because the cold virus is highly adaptable and can survive in a latent state, waiting for the right conditions to become active again. When the weather starts to change and humidity increases, the virus becomes more active and starts to replicate, eventually leading to the onset of symptoms.","364":"I'm just really frustrated with the way people are being misled about COVID-19.","365":"Security questions were initially designed to be a simpler alternative to password recovery methods, but they have become a weak link in the security chain due to their simplicity and publicly available information. ","366":"You can access that information, but you have to pay for it. That's a key distinction between the free service and the paid one.","367":"I think that's a valid concern, but the point is that targeted attacks are much harder to execute than large-scale attacks, and the resources required to carry out a targeted attack are significant, which makes it less likely to happen in the first place.","368":"Alcoholism is a disease because it involves changes in the brain that affect a person's behavior and decision-making, making it difficult for them to control their drinking.","369":"You can\u2019t apply that logic here, because the medical community has since learned more about the disease.","370":"He was convicted for multiple counts of rape and sexual assault. He was found guilty of raping one woman and sexually assaulting another. The jury also found him guilty of a criminal sex act against a third woman. He was sentenced to 20 years to life for the rape conviction and 3 to 5 years for the sexual assault conviction. The sentences will run concurrently, which means he will serve 20 years to life in prison. ","371":"I understand your frustration, but the policy is in place to ensure that everyone who needs the information can access it without being turned away due to financial constraints. If you're not satisfied with the explanation, I'd be happy to continue the session or provide additional resources to help you better understand the concept.","372":"An afro is often associated with African American culture and can be seen as a symbol of black identity. In some corporate workplaces, there may be unconscious biases against people of color, and an afro may be perceived as unprofessional due to these biases. This is often a result of systemic racism and a lack of diversity in the workplace, rather than any inherent quality of the hairstyle itself.","373":"I think that's a bit of a stretch.  We're talking about professional image here, not personal style.  You can definitely be a business person and still have a unique personal style.  In fact, that's a good way to differentiate yourself from other business people.  So, don't worry about your hair.","374":"I'm glad I could introduce you to a new topic, I think it's fascinating to think about how the continents might change over time.","375":"You're right, it's hard to predict what kind of technology or discoveries will be made in the future, but it's interesting to think about how our understanding of the Earth's history might change as new evidence and methods become available.","376":"And that's exactly what happens when radiation damages DNA, it can cause mutations that prevent cells from functioning properly, or even trigger the cells to start reproducing uncontrollably, which is a hallmark of cancer.","377":"That's a pretty good way to think about it. In fact, that's basically how it works. Cells have these suicide mechanisms to prevent cancer, and in the case of skin cells, it's a trade-off between protecting against cancer and allowing the skin to regenerate quickly.","378":"So, let's start with the basics. Animal agriculture is a significant contributor to greenhouse gas emissions, deforestation, and water pollution. When animals are raised for food, they produce a lot of waste, which can lead to water pollution. Additionally, the production of animal feed, such as soy and corn, can lead to deforestation and habitat destruction. By choosing plant-based options, we can reduce our carbon footprint and help preserve the environment.","379":"In the United States, Walmart is not required to recognize a union as the representative of its employees, even if a majority of employees vote in favor of it. This is because the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) requires that a union must be recognized by the employer only if it has been certified by the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) as the result of an election in which a majority of employees in the bargaining unit have voted in favor of the union. If the union does not meet this threshold, the employer is not required to recognize it.","380":"Yes, they can.  In 1947, the Taft-Hartley Act passed, which allowed employers to hold secret ballots and to delay recognition of a union for up to 8 months after a majority vote, giving them time to campaign against the union.","381":"No, they could still deny it. The language of the document is what matters, not what you call it. They could still say it's a union proposal and deny it.","382":"If a single store wants to unionize, it can, but it would be a separate entity from any larger union that might exist for Walmart as a whole.","383":"So, what did they find out about sunscreen chemicals?","384":"Is it because you think it's too formal or too blunt?","385":"They're actually named after their lack of reactivity, not any kind of nobility. The name 'noble' in this context comes from the Latin 'nobilis', which means 'unreactive' or'stable', rather than any reference to aristocrats or Buddhist nobility. The term 'noble gases' was coined by William Ramsay and Morris Travers, who discovered these elements in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. They were impressed by the stability and inertness of these elements, and the name 'noble gases' stuck. ","386":"It's not necessarily that they're behind, but rather that the trajectory of technological advancements has been different. Think of it like a river with multiple tributaries. The Western world had a unique combination of factors that allowed it to develop and advance rapidly. Sub-Saharan Africa had different factors that shaped its own path, which may have led to a slower pace of technological progress in certain areas, but not necessarily a 'thousands of years behind' situation. ","387":"And that's exactly what's happening with COVID-19. We're developing vaccines, and they're being rolled out. It's a very different situation from the past.","388":"Actually, I think you're misunderstanding the point I'm trying to make. While it's true that many scientists don't believe in an afterlife, my argument is not about personal belief, but about the scientific evidence for the existence of the universe as we know it. The laws of physics and the observations we've made about the universe suggest that it began with the Big Bang and has been expanding ever since. This is not a matter of personal opinion, but of empirical evidence and the consensus of the scientific community.","389":"You're just dodging the issue with your emotive language and vague statements, I'm talking about people who claim to have all the answers and pretend that science is settled, when in fact, there's still so much we don't know.","390":"So, even though the employer is paying more in FICA taxes, they're not paying anything for private health coverage, so it's a net positive for them.","391":"The no true Scotsman fallacy is a type of argumentative fallacy where someone says that a group or category is defined by a certain characteristic, but then redefines the group or category when someone points out a counterexample, essentially saying that the counterexample isn't a 'true' member of the group.","392":"I see what you're saying, but the thing is, the person is still trying to move the goalposts by changing the definition of 'being born in Edinburgh'. They're not just having a personal conception, they're actively trying to exclude the counterexample from the definition. If they just said 'I don't like eggs, but I'm still a true Scotsman', that would be a personal conception. But instead, they're trying to redefine what it means to be a true Scotsman, which is what No True Scotsman is all about.","393":"I think you're misunderstanding the point of the fallacy. It's not about people being stupid or intentionally trying to deceive, it's about the way the argument is structured. When someone uses the 'no true Scotsman' fallacy, they're not just using a personal definition, they're making an argument that can't be logically challenged or disproven. It's a way of avoiding criticism by changing the definition of the term, rather than addressing the actual argument.","394":"But that's not a formal fallacy, that's just a matter of people having different interpretations.","395":"That's a bit of an assumption on your part, isn't it? You're assuming that people who use the No True Scotsman fallacy are aware that it's a fallacy. But people can be unaware of what they're doing, even when they're doing it intentionally.","396":"The fallacy you're talking about is a very specific one, and it's hard to spot without a clear understanding of what it entails.","397":"That's a good point, but the issue is not just about gatekeeping or personal beliefs. The fallacy involves making a claim that seems to be supported by the absence of evidence or the presence of an argument that is not actually relevant to the issue at hand. In the case of the Star Wars example, the claim that someone cannot be a true fan if they like The Last Jedi is not necessarily a fallacy just because it's about personal beliefs. However, if the argument is that The Last Jedi is bad because it doesn't fit with the original trilogy, that's a different story. That's where the fallacy might come in, if the argument relies on the absence of evidence or irrelevant points rather than a genuine critique of the movie.","398":"When you're on a layover, airlines can charge you for a 'Hidden City' ticket if you book a flight with a layover in a city you're not actually going to, but the final destination is your real destination. This is because the airline thinks you're going to the layover city, so they charge you for that flight too.","399":"And in this case, the restaurant, which is the airline, gets to keep the dessert, which is the empty seat, and sell it at a higher price to someone else who wants it.","400":"Actually, the airline is making less profit if you miss the flight because they still have to pay for the crew and other fixed costs, even if you're not there. But the point is, if you buy a seat, the airline has already made the profit from selling it to you. They can't resell it, and they can't put it back on the shelf. It's like buying a dessert - once you've bought it, the value is in your possession, not the manufacturer's.","401":"Are you actually trying to derail the conversation or is this just a pathetic attempt at trolling?","402":"Yes, the BIOS is essentially a set of instructions that tells the computer how to access and read from memory. It's like a map or a guide that the CPU follows to find and execute the programs and data stored in memory.","403":"The transition is made by a CPU executing the program, which is done by a process called fetching-decoding-executing. The CPU fetches an instruction, decodes it into a machine code, and then executes it. This process is repeated until the CPU reaches the end of the program.","404":"How does it use that number to determine which operation to perform, and what happens next in the CPU's execution pipeline?","405":"It's done through the use of logic gates, which are essentially electronic switches that turn on or off based on a given input. Think of it like a simple light switch: if you flip the switch, the light turns on. In a CPU, the logic gates are controlled by transistors, which are tiny electronic switches that can be turned on or off by applying a small voltage to them. When a signal is sent to the CPU, it's like flipping the switch: the transistor turns on, the logic gate is activated, and the signal is processed accordingly.","406":"The computer doesn\u2019t directly turn 8 into pixels. Instead, it uses a combination of graphics libraries and the graphics card to render the number as pixels on the screen. This is a complex process that involves many steps, including font rendering, color mapping, and rasterization. Essentially, the computer is using the number 8 as a code to tell the graphics card what to draw, and the graphics card is responsible for translating that code into the actual pixels on the screen.","407":"So, imagine you're talking about a group of people, like all the kids in your school. If someone says that no kids in your school like broccoli, but you know that some kids do like broccoli, you can't just say 'No true kid in your school likes broccoli'. That wouldn't make sense, because you're still talking about the same group of kids. Instead, you have to admit that your original statement was wrong, because some kids do like broccoli.","408":"So, the fallacy is a tool for people who want to be able to say that their conclusion is correct, even if it's based on a flawed premise. It's a way to avoid acknowledging that your reasoning is wrong, rather than a genuine attempt to understand or learn from the argument.","409":"4. But that's a different issue from whether the fallacy itself is actually occurring. 5. You're still not addressing the fact that your argument relies on a misunderstanding of the fallacy.","410":"Your response here","411":"The electrical wave is like a message that's being sent through a network, and when it reaches the right destination, it gets decoded into a thought or a feeling or a sensation. It's kind of like a digital signal that's being transmitted through the internet, but instead of reaching a server, it reaches a part of your brain that says, 'Oh, I know what that means!'","412":"That's really interesting. It sounds like you're describing a difference between 'knowing what something looks like' and'seeing it in your mind'. Do you think that's a fair summary?","413":"That's exactly what Feynman was talking about! The ability to visualize thoughts and create mental images is a powerful tool for learning and understanding. It sounds like you're tapping into that ability, even if it's just for a brief moment. Can you think of any other ways you can practice visualizing and creating mental images?","414":"That's a good way to think about it, but we need to be careful not to get too caught up in the static idea. Think of it more like a 4D fabric that has these static objects embedded within it. The objects are moving through time, but the fabric itself is also changing, so it's not just a collection of static points, but a dynamic and ever-changing landscape.","415":"Don't worry, it's normal to feel scared or unsure about what's happening to your body. But it's good that you're asking questions and wanting to learn more. If you want, I can try to explain more about what happens during puberty and what you can expect. Or if you'd rather, we can talk about how to take care of your body during this time.","416":"Well, it\u2019s because the female reproductive system is a lot more complex than the male reproductive system. Girls have to deal with menstruation and pregnancy, which can be a lot to handle. Boys don\u2019t have to worry about those things, so their reproductive system is a lot simpler.","417":"There are many factors that have contributed to this gap, including climate, geography, and history. One major factor is the lack of domestication of large animals, which led to a lack of food surpluses and therefore no ability to support large-scale social hierarchies and specialized labor, which are typically precursors to technological advancements. Additionally, the region has experienced numerous invasions and migrations, which have disrupted the development of complex societies. The transatlantic slave trade and colonialism have also had a profound impact on the region, suppressing indigenous innovation and imposing foreign systems of governance and economy.","418":"and we're still dealing with those diseases today, but in much smaller numbers.","419":"it means that the variable's scope will change as the code block executes, making it harder to understand and debug.","420":null,"421":"It's not that the flu has a special connection to cold weather, it's just that when it's cold, people are more likely to be indoors, where they're in closer proximity to each other. When you're indoors, you're more likely to breathe in the air that other people have breathed out, which can contain the flu virus. Think of it like a big, slow-moving cloud of germs. When it's cold, people are more likely to be stuck in that cloud with each other, and that's how the flu spreads.","422":"When we experience emotional stressors like a breakup, our body's 'fight or flight' response is triggered, releasing stress hormones like cortisol and adrenaline. These hormones prepare our body for action by increasing heart rate, blood pressure, and energy levels, but they also have a negative impact on our digestive system. Specifically, they can slow down digestion, cause nausea, and lead to a decrease in appetite. This is because our body is prioritizing energy allocation towards the brain and muscles, rather than the digestive system. Think of it like a car diverting power from the air conditioning to the engine \u2013 our body is shifting resources from digestion to stress response. This is why we often feel queasy, experience a loss of appetite, and may even have stomach cramps or diarrhea during times of emotional stress.","423":"Your story is very inspiring, I wish I had that kind of resilience, it\u2019s making me think about what I can do to take control of my own life, thank you for sharing.","424":"I'm glad to see that too. It's a great reminder that we're all in this together.","425":"Because in the process of self-replication, life forms can adapt, evolve, and increase their chances of survival in their environment. It's a fundamental drive that's essential for life to thrive and propagate.","426":"You're making a good point, and I think that's a fascinating topic. The creation of complex molecules from simple elements is a major challenge in chemistry, and it's an area of ongoing research. The process of abiogenesis, or the emergence of life from non-living matter, is still not fully understood. However, it's thought that the building blocks of life, such as amino acids and nucleotides, were formed through chemical reactions involving simple elements like carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen. These building blocks then came together to form more complex molecules, such as RNA and DNA, which are essential for the replication and transmission of genetic information. The process is still not fully understood, and it's an area of ongoing research and debate.","427":"Because Saudi Arabia is one of the largest oil producers in the world, and a significant portion of the world's oil supply passes through the Strait of Hormuz, which is located near Saudi Arabia. This makes Saudi Arabia a key player in the global oil market, and any disruptions to its oil production can have a big impact on the global supply of oil.","428":"I agree that bio-fuel has its drawbacks, but the research suggests that the emissions from bio-fuel are actually lower than those from oil, and the benefits of using it in the long term outweigh the costs.","429":"But, at the same time, if we don't start looking into alternatives, we might end up in a situation where we have to rely on even more polluting sources, like coal or oil, if we can't find a way to reduce our energy consumption.","430":"the missing part of the dialogue","431":"Can you tell me more about what's in this report that's particularly relevant?","432":"Well, the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) protects employees' right to form and join unions, but it also allows employers to engage in certain anti-union activities. Employers can legally fight unionization efforts, including holding secret-ballot elections to determine whether employees want to unionize.","433":"Unionization at Walmart, or any large corporation, typically occurs at the corporate level, not at individual store levels. If a union were to form at Walmart, it would need to represent employees across the entire company, not just one store.","434":"Alcoholism is a disease because it affects the brain, and the brain is the control center of our body. When we drink alcohol, it can alter the way our brain functions, making it harder for us to control our drinking habits. It's similar to how diabetes is a disease that affects the pancreas, or how heart disease affects the heart. In all these cases, the body's normal functioning is disrupted, leading to problems that can be treated with medicine, therapy, or lifestyle changes.","435":"Imagine you're standing in a big field with your friends. You're all surrounded by trees, and it looks like you're at the center of the world. But then someone tells you that there are actually many more trees and fields beyond what you can see. In the same way, we might think we're at the center of the universe, but the universe is much, much bigger than what we can observe.","436":"No, because the two theories have different underlying assumptions about the nature of the phenomenon being studied.","437":"the missing dialogue","438":"Generally, amputations do not remove the neural pathways that cause sexual urges. These urges are often driven by the brain, not the physical body parts themselves. So, yes, men who undergo genital amputations may still experience sexual urges. However, the nature and intensity of these urges can vary greatly from person to person. Some individuals may experience a significant decrease in sexual desire, while others may not notice much of a change. In some cases, individuals may experience increased sensitivity or altered sensations in their remaining body parts, which can lead to new forms of sexual expression or arousal. As for getting rid of sexual urges, it's not a simple matter of removing the physical source. Sexual urges are complex and multifaceted, influenced by a range of psychological, emotional, and social factors. That being said, some people may find that their sexual urges decrease or change over time as they adapt to their new circumstances. This can be due to a variety of factors, including changes in self-perception, emotional processing, and relationships. In some cases, individuals may also choose to explore new forms of sexual expression or intimacy, which can help them find new sources of pleasure and connection. Ultimately, the experience of sexual urges after genital amputation is highly individualized and can vary greatly from person to person.","439":"And it's not just the amount of testosterone, but also the sensitivity of the brain to testosterone that determines the level of sexual desire and urge in a person.","440":"Your answer here","441":"You're not listening. I'm not saying that ovulation isn't biological. Of course, it is. But that's not the point. The point is that the reason humans don't have children immediately after puberty is not because of ovulation. It's because of social and cultural factors, like the time it takes to form relationships, find a partner, and build a stable life.","442":"I've told you this before, but you're still not listening: the question you asked was flawed from the start, and it's not the answerers who are at fault. You can't just cherry-pick the bits you like from the discussion and ignore the rest. If you're really interested in learning, you need to engage with the full range of perspectives and arguments, not just the ones that fit your preconceived notions.","443":"Well, think of a square as a rectangular area. If you have a room that is 4 meters by 4 meters, its area is 16 square meters. If you want to find the length of the side of the room, you can take the square root of 16, which is 4. This is because the square root of a number is a value that, when multiplied by itself, gives the original number. In this case, 4 multiplied by 4 is 16.","444":"Exactly. When DNA is damaged, it can't be replicated accurately, and this can lead to mutations that can cause cancer or other genetic disorders. Additionally, cells with damaged DNA can become unstable and die, which can lead to tissue damage and organ failure.","445":"That's a great point, and it's actually supported by some research.

fast the engine is spinning, measured in revolutions per minute (RPM). It helps drivers understand when to shift gears, especially when driving uphill or merging onto a busy road. If the RPM is too high, it can lead to engine overheating or premature wear, so monitoring the tachometer is crucial for safe and efficient driving.","1":"I'm not convinced that skipping gears is the best approach, and I'd like to understand the reasoning behind it. Can you explain how you think it's safe and effective to skip gears, especially when it comes to engine braking and controlling the vehicle's speed?","2":"I could be mistaken, but I think the advantages of skipping gears, like better fuel economy and a more seamless driving experience, might be more important than the potential drawbacks. Plus, many cars these days are built to handle gear skipping without any problems.","3":"I think your post might have been a bit too vague for some people, and the title didn't quite capture the main point. Would you be open to rephrasing the title and adding some more specific examples to make it clearer?","4":"That's a great point, but what's often overlooked is that even though the total amount of water on Earth is constant, the distribution and availability of water can change significantly over time and space. This means that wasting water in one area might not be a problem in terms of the global total, but it can still be inefficient and problematic for local ecosystems and communities.","5":"I see your point, but the issue is more complex than just building infrastructure. In many of these conflict zones, the very act of building infrastructure can become a political football, with different factions vying for control and potentially disrupting or destroying the infrastructure. Moreover, even if we were to build infrastructure, it's unlikely to be maintained or sustained in the long term without a stable and functional government, which is often the root cause of the conflict in the first place.","6":"I think we're oversimplifying the issue by saying 'we just don't do it.' The reality is that providing clean water to areas with no access requires a multifaceted approach that involves not only infrastructure development but also addressing the underlying social, economic, and political factors that contribute to this issue. We need to consider the local context, the existing water management systems, and the capacity of the community to maintain and operate the infrastructure, among other things.","7":"Yes, there is space around all your organs. Think of it like a big blanket that wraps around everything and keeps it cozy. It's called the peritoneum, and it helps keep all your organs in place. There's also tiny spaces between each organ, kind of like how you can fit different puzzle pieces together. Does that make sense?","8":"I can imagine how frustrating that must be for you - it's crazy how our bodies can be so unpredictable, and it's even more frustrating when it affects our daily lives. Can you tell me more about what your mom's experience was like?","9":"An afro can be perceived as unprofessional in corporate workplaces due to its historical association with the Black Power movement and the Civil Rights era, which may have led to negative connotations in traditional corporate settings. However, it's essential to recognize that these perceptions are not universal and can vary greatly depending on individual perspectives and workplace cultures.","10":"I'm not suggesting that you have to choose between being a businessperson and being a creative person. Many successful entrepreneurs are artists at heart, and they find ways to express their creativity through their work. Think of Steve Jobs, for example - he was a master of innovation and design, and his passion for art and music helped shape Apple's unique identity. So, don't feel like you have to give up on your hair or your individuality if you pursue a career in business. Instead, look for opportunities that allow you to bring your creative energy to the table and make a meaningful impact.","11":"A tachometer is like the engine's heartbeat monitor. It shows you the engine's RPM, or revolutions per minute, which can give you clues about the engine's health and performance. For example, if the RPM is consistently high, it might be a sign that the engine is working too hard, and you might need to adjust your driving habits or check for any potential issues. Does that make sense?","12":"It's largely due to the interplay between our biology, culture, and brain development. As we reach puberty, our bodies undergo significant changes, but our brains continue to mature at a slower pace. This discrepancy allows us to develop emotionally, cognitively, and socially before we're physically capable of reproduction, giving us the time and opportunity to form meaningful relationships, make informed choices, and develop a sense of self before entering into partnerships.","13":null,"14":null,"15":"I think I was mistaken in my previous insistence that it's not biological. The fact that humans don't reproduce immediately after puberty is indeed due to biological factors. However, I'd like to revisit our previous discussion and understand where we might have gone off track. Can you help me clarify the points we've made so far?","16":"I understand your point about the premise of the question being false due to social factors, but I still think there's value in exploring the biological aspects of puberty and child development. You mentioned earlier that my question was asking for the biological reason humans aren't ready for kids, but I think that's a narrow interpretation of the question. I'm not trying to steer the conversation away from raising children, but rather to understand the underlying biological mechanisms that influence human development. I'm willing to engage in a more nuanced discussion about this topic, and I appreciate your willingness to respond to my comments. Let's focus on having a productive conversation and exploring the complexities of this issue.","17":"That's a great question! So, universal basic income is an idea where the government gives every citizen a regular amount of money, no strings attached. This way, people have a safety net to fall back on. Now, about your second question - if companies raise their prices, having a basic income wouldn't necessarily be a problem, because people would have the money to afford those prices. However, there are a few potential issues. If everyone has a basic income, and companies keep raising prices, it could lead to inflation. That's when prices go up, and the money in your pocket doesn't go as far. To avoid that, the government would need to adjust the basic income to keep pace with inflation. Plus, if companies raise prices too much, people might start buying less of their products, which could hurt the companies in the long run. So, it's a bit of a tricky situation, and there are many different opinions on how to make universal basic income work.","18":"Materials with lower boiling points have a higher vapor pressure, which means they tend to turn directly into vapor when heated. This makes it hard to capture and convert their energy into a usable form, like electricity. Think of it like trying to boil water: if the boiling point is too low, the water will just turn into steam too quickly, making it hard to harness the energy from it.","19":"That's a clever play on words! The term 'noble' comes from the fact that these gases don't easily form compounds with other elements, giving them a sense of independence and uniqueness, much like the nobility in history, who were known for their prestige and exclusivity. It's a fitting description, don't you think?","20":"Radon is a noble gas, but that doesn't necessarily mean it's stable. In fact, radon-222 is a radioactive isotope that decays into polonium-218, which then decays into lead-214, and so on. The decay chain for radon-222 ultimately leads to the stable isotope lead-206, but it's a bit more complicated than that. The key thing is that radon-222 is a short-lived isotope, meaning it decays quickly into other isotopes before it has a chance to accumulate in the environment.","21":"I'm basing my statement on the general trends and patterns I've observed in the periodic table, but I may be mistaken. Can you tell me more about the specific reasons you think there might be a 9th row?","22":"During the off-season, the common cold virus often remains in a dormant state within the body, where it can be reactivated by factors such as stress, changes in humidity or temperature, or a weakened immune system. When the virus is reactivated, it can cause a new infection, resulting in the symptoms of the common cold. This process is not unique to the common cold virus, as many viruses can remain dormant and then reactivate under the right conditions.","23":"I'm fine, just feeling frustrated with the way people are being misled about COVID-19. I think we need to take a step back and look at the facts, rather than just accepting what we're being told.","24":"It's like they're trying to gaslight us, making us question our own sanity. But we're not buying it.","25":"In 2020, people took extra precautions to prevent the spread of the flu. They wore masks, washed their hands a lot, and stayed away from each other. This helped to slow down the flu, making it seem like it had disappeared. But the flu was still around, it was just quieter than usual.","26":null,"27":null,"28":"I'm not saying I'm skeptical of science, but I'm curious - what makes you so confident that science has it right?","29":"I'm not impressed by your attempts to deflect and bully with donations to Bernie Sanders. Can you actually address the point I'm trying to make?","30":"Actually, the phenomenon of programmed cell death, or apoptosis, is a crucial mechanism in maintaining tissue health and preventing damage from external factors like UV radiation, not just cancer prevention. It's a complex process that helps to eliminate damaged cells and promote tissue renewal, and it's not unique to skin cells, but also occurs in other tissues and organs.","31":"I'm saying it's a sport, but one that's as slow-paced as a European soccer match, if you know what I mean.","32":"Honestly, I think it comes down to nuance. We call things sports when they require a combination of physical skill, strategy, and a level of physical risk. It's not just about scoring points, but also about the physicality and the mental toughness that comes with it. Take hockey, for example \u2013 it's a high-speed, high-impact sport that demands a lot from players. In contrast, a game like checkers is more about strategy and less about physical risk. So, while both involve competition and points, we tend to reserve the term'sport' for activities that push our bodies to the limit.","33":"That's a great point to listen for! The 'off'ness in the triplets is actually a result of the way the rhythm is performed. When you hear the third note of each triplet, it's not quite hitting its mark on time. This is known as a 'rubato' effect, where the musician is intentionally delaying the note slightly to create a more human, less mechanical feel. It's a subtle but important aspect of the music's character. If you listen carefully, you can hear how it adds a sense of warmth and emotion to the performance.","34":"I totally get why you're feeling scared - puberty can be a pretty overwhelming experience. But the good news is that you're not alone in this. Many people go through it and come out the other side just fine. It's actually a natural part of growing up, and it's a sign that your body is getting ready for adulthood. There are some changes you can expect, like hair growth, voice deepening, and mood swings, but it's also a time of great growth and development. If you have any questions or concerns, I'm here to listen and help you understand what's happening. And don't worry if you don't know what's going to happen - it's okay to take things one step at a time and learn as you go. We can talk more about it if you want, and I can try to answer any questions you have.","35":"Girls experience more complex changes because of the reproductive system, which includes menstruation, breast development, and changes in body shape. For example, girls may experience cramps, mood swings, and changes in their skin, which can be uncomfortable and unpredictable. Boys, on the other hand, experience more straightforward physical changes, such as voice deepening and increased muscle mass. These changes are often more predictable and less physically demanding for boys. Additionally, boys tend to develop physically at a slower pace than girls, which can make it easier for them to adjust to their new bodies.","36":"It's all about the quality, not the quantity. If you're sleeping for 14 hours but waking up a million times during the night, it's not gonna cut it. You need to get good sleep, not just a lot of it. That means finding a comfy spot, cooling down your bedroom, and establishing a relaxing bedtime routine. That way, you'll feel rested and refreshed, even if you're not sleeping for as long as you think you need to.","37":"Considering your concerns, seeking professional help might feel daunting, but it's often a crucial step in understanding what's happening. You might want to start by researching local therapists or counselors who specialize in sleep issues or anxiety, and then reach out to them for a consultation or initial session. This can help you gauge your comfort level and determine if therapy is a good fit for you.","38":"It\u2019s because the heat from boiling can cause the sponge to break down, releasing its fibers into the water, which can contaminate it.","39":"I'm genuinely curious, what made you think my attempt to save money was entitled? I'd love to understand your perspective on that.","40":"You're not wrong about that, but making a connection between my joke and a political label is a bit of a stretch. I'd appreciate it if you could focus on the actual issue at hand, which is the inconsistency between your views on microtransactions and your own spending habits.","41":"The electrical signal is essentially a coded message that gets transmitted along the neuron's surface, and the brain's neural networks decipher this code, weaving the information into a cohesive narrative that eventually manifests as a conscious thought.","42":null,"43":"I think there's a lot of misinformation and conspiracy theories surrounding the Manhattan Project and its leaders. While it's true that Oppenheimer and Einstein had personal flaws and controversies, their contributions to the project were significant. The idea that the Nazis developed a smaller atomic bomb is also a topic of debate among historians. There's no concrete evidence to support this claim, and it's unlikely that the Nazis could have developed a functional atomic bomb before the Allies. The Allies' delay in nuking Japan was more likely due to strategic and logistical considerations. As for the Nazis using an atomic bomb as a bargaining chip, there's no credible evidence to support this theory. It's worth noting that the Soviet Union was a major concern for the Western Allies during the final stages of the war, and the Potsdam Agreement reflected this. However, the idea that the Allies tacitly sided with Germany over the Soviet Union is a gross oversimplification of the complex geopolitical dynamics at play. Let's focus on the facts and evidence, rather than speculation and conspiracy theories. Can you tell me more about what specifically led you to question the official narrative on the Manhattan Project?","44":"I'm not convinced by a single news article, can you dig up more substantial evidence or expert opinions to corroborate this rather sensational claim?","45":"I think that's a good point, but the fact that Heisenberg was holding a lump of cadmium suggests that they were indeed trying to adjust the amounts, and that's what's really interesting - they were trying to troubleshoot, but it's clear they didn't have the right materials or knowledge to do it effectively. What do you think would have happened if they had gotten it right?","46":"That's not true. You're probably thinking of a different process, but even in that case, the NLRB is involved. In the US, workers have the right to unionize under the National Labor Relations Act, and employers are prohibited from interfering with that right. If a union wants to organize a workplace, they can file a petition with the NLRB, which will then conduct an election to determine whether the workers want to be represented by a union. The NLRB will ensure that the election is fair and that employees are not coerced or intimidated into voting against the union. If a majority of workers vote to unionize, the employer must recognize the union and bargain with it in good faith. So, while employers may try to resist unionization efforts, they can't legally prevent workers from unionizing through any means they want.","47":"I love that you're testing this theory in such a creative way! What made you think of this idea in the first place?","48":"Ha! That would be epic! What's the first song you think might get stuck in your head tomorrow? I'm curious to know!","49":"An investment bank is a type of financial institution that helps big companies raise money by issuing stocks or bonds, or by advising on mergers and acquisitions, which can be a complex process. They're like matchmakers, but they also provide strategic guidance to their clients, helping them navigate the financial market and make informed decisions. For example, they might help a company determine the best time to go public, or advise on how to structure a deal to maximize returns.","50":"Well, imagine the Earth is a big ball, and it's tilted on its side as it rotates around the Sun. That tilt actually has more to do with the distribution of landmasses than the amount of sunlight. The reason the northern hemisphere has more land is because of the way the continents have drifted apart over millions of years, leaving more land exposed in the north. ","51":"Yeah, it's actually pretty fascinating. Continental drift is driven by plate tectonics, where the Earth's crust is broken up into large plates that move relative to each other. This movement causes the continents to shift over time, eventually leading to the formation of supercontinents like the ones we were discussing earlier. It's a slow process, but it's what's shaping the Earth's surface as we speak. And who knows, maybe in 250 million years, we'll have a new supercontinent to explore!","52":"I mean, it's mind-boggling to think about - the continents have been on the move for so long, creating new landscapes and sea routes that have been lost to time. It's amazing to consider how different the world must have looked just a few million years ago.","53":"I'd love to dive deeper into the current process of continental drift. From what I understand, it's driven by plate tectonics, where the Earth's lithosphere is broken into several large plates that move relative to each other. Can you explain more about how these plates interact and what causes them to move?","54":"Yeah, it's a bit more complicated than that. Regulation can take many forms, and it's not always a partisan issue.","55":"When electrical waves between neurons reach the brain, they're not directly conscious thought. Instead, they're decoded and processed through a series of neural networks, kind of like how different regions of the brain work together to filter and refine the information. This processing involves chemical signals, synaptic connections, and even the structure of the brain itself. As a result, the electrical waves get transformed into meaningful patterns, which our brain interprets as conscious experiences, such as sensations, memories, or decisions. It's a highly intricate and dynamic process, but one that's grounded in the biology of the brain rather than any sort of mystical transformation.","56":"You're describing a phenomenon that challenges the traditional notion of mind-body dualism, where thoughts and feelings are seen as separate from the physical body. The fact that you can reflect on your experiences and describe them suggests that there's a complex interplay between your conscious and unconscious processes. This raises interesting questions about the nature of self and how we experience reality. If we consider the idea that our thoughts and feelings are not solely located in the brain, but are instead distributed throughout our body and environment, it might help to explain the sense of disconnection you're describing. It's almost as if your 'animalistic' brain is a manifestation of your body's autonomic nervous system, which can take over in times of stress or injury. But when you're engaging in abstract thinking, it's possible that your conscious mind is accessing a broader range of information and perspectives, giving you a sense of being connected to something beyond your physical self.","57":"For example, if a neurosurgeon removes a tumor from a part of the brain that processes visual information, a person's visual perception might change. They might struggle to see certain colors or shapes. This shows that physical changes to the brain can affect how we experience the world.","58":"Let's dig deeper into this. I think the real question is, what would happen if cars didn't have tachometers? Would drivers be able to tell when their engines were running too hot or too cold? Would they be able to shift gears at the right time without risking engine damage? I'm curious, have you ever wondered how car manufacturers decide when to include a tachometer in their vehicles?","59":null,"60":"Our species' unique evolutionary trajectory is characterized by an extended juvenile phase, which enables us to acquire essential skills, form complex social bonds, and refine our cognitive abilities. This prolonged period of development is thought to have arisen as an adaptation to our environment, allowing us to better navigate and respond to the challenges and opportunities that come with being a highly social and intelligent species.","61":"I understand your point, but let's not jump to conclusions. Even if the brain is controlled by hormones, it's still possible that the delay in human reproduction has multiple factors, including cultural, social, and environmental influences. Can we explore this topic further and consider different perspectives?","62":"A selenelion eclipse occurs when the moon is in the earth's umbra, but because the umbra is relatively small, the moon's disk is mostly illuminated by the sun, which is why we can see the shadow on the moon's surface. This phenomenon is possible because the moon is not a perfect sphere, and its irregular shape allows the sun's light to reach the umbra's edges, casting a shadow on the moon's surface, even though the moon is in the umbra. It's a complex interplay of light and shadow, with the moon's shape and the earth's shadow creating this unique visual effect.","63":"One reason for this disparity is that people tend to view strippers as more objectified and less empowered than cheerleaders. This is partly because strippers are often seen as passive bodies on display for the pleasure of others, whereas cheerleaders are viewed as strong, athletic women who perform a specific role to support their team. Furthermore, the way we talk about and portray strippers often perpetuates negative stereotypes, such as the idea that they're somehow less worthy of respect or are 'damaged' women. In contrast, cheerleaders are often celebrated as role models and icons of femininity. This dichotomy can lead to a double standard, where the same behaviors or actions are viewed differently depending on the context and the people involved.","64":"That's an interesting point. I think it's also linked to the historical and cultural narratives surrounding prostitution, which often portray sex workers as either victims or deviants. This binary thinking can be damaging, as it fails to acknowledge the agency and autonomy of sex workers, and the complexities of their experiences. It's only by moving beyond these simplistic narratives that we can begin to understand the nuances of sex work and the people involved in it.","65":"The main difference between digital and analog is that digital systems are like a piano that can only play the notes you've programmed into it, whereas analog systems are more like a grand piano that can play any note in between. Think of it like a spectrum of colors - digital displays can only show a limited range of colors, whereas analog displays can show an infinite range of colors and shades.","66":"Because the output from one transistor is not strong enough to completely max out the Gate of another in an analog circuit, since the voltage is continuous and can't be precisely controlled to the threshold required to fully switch the second transistor.","67":"That's right, analog signals can have any value between 0 and 1, not just 0 and 1 like digital signals. It's not that one is 'better' than the other, but rather they're suited for different tasks. Analog is great for handling signals that can vary continuously, like audio or video, whereas digital is better for processing information in binary form.","68":"I understand where you're coming from, and I'm happy to help brainstorm ways to make our subreddit more user-friendly. Can you tell me more about what specifically makes it hard for you to use? Is it the navigation, the formatting, or something else entirely?","69":"That's a great question! The reason we don't see sunlight in space is that it's not being reflected off of anything. On Earth, we see sunlight because it's bouncing off of the atmosphere, the oceans, and the land. But in space, there's no atmosphere to reflect the light, and the objects are too far apart to reflect it either. It's like trying to take a picture in a dark room \u2013 there's no surface for the light to bounce off of, so it just gets lost in the vastness of space. The shuttle is able to send images back to us because it has its own light source, like a camera flash, but that's not the same as seeing sunlight.","70":"So essentially, the brain is making an educated guess that it's black because it's not getting any visual information that would contradict that.","71":"So, it seems that while alchemists were chasing a myth, scientists have actually found ways to create gold from other elements, like mercury, using powerful tools like particle accelerators and nuclear reactors.","72":"I think we're getting sidetracked from the original discussion. Let's get back to what the alchemists were trying to achieve and how their understanding of the periodic table influenced their approach.","73":"I think you're right, and it's interesting that you bring up the idea of idealism. The nostalgia for the gold standard can be quite strong, and it's not just about economics, but also about a sense of security and stability. And you're correct that the Free Silver Party was a significant movement in the past. However, I'd like to shift the focus back to the present. If counterfeit currency is becoming harder to verify, it's also becoming more detectable. I think we should prioritize developing more effective methods for identifying and preventing counterfeiting, rather than trying to work on both practices simultaneously. Additionally, I'd like to acknowledge that your point about the potential'sneakiness' of counterfeiting is a valid concern, and we should consider the ethical implications of this practice.","74":"That's a great question, and I'm glad you're thinking about it! Not only does the flu shot protect you from getting the flu, but it also helps prevent the spread of the flu to those around you, like family members, friends, and even people you don't know. Plus, getting vaccinated can give you peace of mind, knowing you're doing everything you can to stay healthy and avoid missing out on things you love. And, if you have any underlying health conditions, getting the flu can be especially serious. So, it's really worth considering getting vaccinated, especially during flu season!","75":"In that case, you might want to consider reaching out to your local health department or a community health organization, as they often provide free or low-cost access to health information and resources.","76":"Think of it like a big bucket that's always full. If you take some water out of the bucket and pour it into a cup, the cup now has water in it. The problem isn't that we're reducing the total amount of water, but that we're not putting it back in the bucket for others to use. When we waste water, it's like letting the water spill from the cup, so it's not available for others to use. It's not gone forever, but it's not being used efficiently either.","77":"Newsflash, pal: it's not about who's right or wrong, it's about the quality of the information being shared. u\/already-taken-wtf's contribution was the only one that resonated with me, but that doesn't mean the others didn't have valuable insights. Can't we focus on the discussion rather than personal attacks?","78":"Let's focus on the pricing strategy. If the airline is selling tickets at a price that's too low to cover their costs, that's a different issue. It's not about making money from running empty planes or shipping cargo, but about ensuring that their pricing is sustainable in the long term. Can we discuss how they might adjust their pricing to better reflect their operational costs?","79":"A period is when the uterus sheds its lining, preparing for a potential pregnancy. This shedding of the uterine lining is a natural part of the menstrual cycle, occurring every month. It's a vital process that allows the uterus to regenerate and prepare for a fertilized egg to implant.","80":"I think it's great that you're curious about this! Understanding how our bodies work can be really empowering. If you're looking for more detailed information, I'd recommend checking out some reputable health websites or talking to a trusted healthcare provider. They can provide you with accurate and personalized information about the female reproductive system. In the meantime, I can try to explain it in simpler terms if you'd like, or we can discuss what specifically you're unsure about.","81":"The vagina is actually like a tube, it's not the whole deal. The vulva is the outer part, think of it as the 'front door' to the vagina. It's made up of the labia, clitoris, and the opening to the vagina - all the stuff you can see on the outside. ","82":"Let's start with H(a,b). I think of it as a function that takes two inputs, a and b, and produces an output. If we were to look at the code for H(a,b), I imagine it would involve some kind of computation that depends on both a and b. When we transform H(a,b) into H(x,x), it seems like we're essentially substituting x for both a and b. This means that the computation would now depend only on x, rather than on two separate inputs. Does that sound like a plausible explanation to you, or am I missing something?","83":"I understand that not everyone has access to a doctor, and it can be challenging to navigate health information on your own. In that case, community health clinics or online resources like the CDC or WHO websites can provide reliable information on disease prevention and management. Additionally, many cities have public health departments that offer free or low-cost health services, including vaccinations and screenings. Would you like me to look up more information on these resources for you?","84":"That's a great catch, and I think that's what makes the triplets sound so unique and interesting - the slight delay adds a human touch to the music. But I'm curious, have you ever noticed this phenomenon in other music pieces, or is this something that you're particularly sensitive to?","85":"Industrial-scale farming is a completely different ball game, with massive operations that require precision and mechanization to meet global demand. The scale and complexity of these operations mean that manual milking is largely a thing of the past, and even smaller-scale farms like yours often rely on specialized equipment and infrastructure to manage their operations.","86":"It's because of how racism and colonialism have shaped our society. For a long time, people thought lighter skin was better, and that's why some people of color tried to lighten their skin to fit in and get ahead. But now, many people see that as a way to erase their culture and identity. Meanwhile, white people have always been able to tan without it being a big deal, because it's seen as a way to enjoy the sun and the outdoors. It's a weird double standard, but that's what's going on.","87":"I think you're highlighting a crucial point, and I'd like to add that personal preferences for attractiveness can be complex and multifaceted. While it's true that some people associate whiteness with beauty, others, as you mentioned, find tanned skin more attractive. However, it's also important to consider how societal norms and historical racism can influence these preferences, even if they're not explicitly acknowledged. In the context of skin whitening, the issue isn't just about individual beauty standards, but also about the systemic and cultural factors that perpetuate the idea that lighter skin is superior.","88":"I think that's a valid point, and it's a nuanced issue. Personal preference and self-expression are definitely important, but it's also worth considering how societal norms and beauty standards are influenced by systemic oppression. Even if someone's decision to lighten their skin is driven by personal taste, it's still worth examining the cultural context in which that preference is formed. For instance, is the desire for lighter skin a result of internalized societal messages, or is it a genuine expression of individuality? Let's dive deeper into this complexity.","89":null,"90":"The CPU's execution process involves fetching the relevant instruction from its instruction set and then using that instruction to orchestrate a series of low-level operations within the CPU's architecture. Think of it as a highly specialized, automated workflow, where the instruction serves as a kind of blueprints for the CPU's internal machinery. By executing the instruction, the CPU is able to manipulate data, perform calculations, and control the flow of information within the system, all in a highly deterministic and predictable manner.","91":"I'm not sure how reliable that service is, and even if it is, you'd still be sharing personal info with a third-party website. That raises concerns about data collection and usage, doesn't it? We were just discussing how sensitive information can be misused.","92":null,"93":"However, the idea of removing methane from the land through vacuum pressure is not a feasible solution, as it would disrupt the delicate balance of the ecosystem. The decomposition process that produces methane is also responsible for maintaining soil fertility, and removing it would have a ripple effect throughout the food chain, potentially leading to land degradation and reduced agricultural productivity. This approach would not only be ineffective but also counterproductive, as it would compromise the very foundation of the ecosystem we're trying to protect.","94":"That's a good point, and it's true that the water is there, but the issue is that once it's contaminated, it's not just a matter of filtering it out or using chemicals to clean it. The contaminants can be incredibly diverse, including heavy metals, pesticides, and industrial waste, and these pollutants can bind to the water molecules in complex ways, making it difficult to remove them without also removing the water itself. Furthermore, the process of cleaning contaminated water can be very energy-intensive and requires a lot of resources, which can have its own environmental impacts. So, while it's true that the water is there, the challenge is in making it safe and usable again, and that's a much more complex task than just filtering it out or using chemicals to clean it.","95":"I see your point, but the challenge with water and sanitation is multifaceted. It's not just about building infrastructure, but also about ensuring that it's sustainably maintained, operated, and used by the communities that rely on it. This requires a long-term commitment to education, training, and community engagement, which can be resource-intensive and complex to implement.","96":"I think we're getting off track. Let's focus on the original point. You're saying that just because one scientist believes in an afterlife, it doesn't make it true. That's a fair point. But can we also consider that the lack of evidence for an afterlife isn't necessarily evidence against it?","97":"I'm not saying it's about being a dumbfuck, but the lack of evidence for a higher power is pretty clear, and science is about following the evidence, not relying on faith. It's not about being mature or immature, it's about being honest about what we actually know and don't know.","98":"I agree that the origin of consciousness is a complex and still-unresolved mystery. While we don't have conclusive evidence to explain it, it's clear that our current understanding is limited. Perhaps we can explore the idea that consciousness arises from the intricate interactions of subatomic particles and the brain's neural networks, without necessarily invoking supernatural explanations.","99":"When you buy a 'Hidden City' ticket, you're essentially exploiting a loophole in the airline's pricing system. The airline sells you a ticket to a specific airport, but you're actually traveling to a nearby city, often with a lower fare. This can be beneficial if you're looking for a cheaper option, but it's also against the airline's rules, and they might penalize you if they catch on. It's a bit like buying a ticket to a concert, but really attending a meet-and-greet event \u2013 you're getting what you want, but technically breaking the rules.","100":"I think what's going on is that the airline is using a pricing strategy that's not aligned with the actual demand for flights to Macon. If they're consistently selling out flights to Macon and then having people get off in Atlanta, it suggests that there's a mismatch between the price they're charging and the value that passengers are willing to pay. It's possible that they're trying to maximize short-term profits by charging high prices for flights that are likely to be popular, but in the long run, this strategy could lead to a loss of revenue and customer loyalty.","101":"And let's be real, just because some people don't buy anything on a flight doesn't mean the airlines aren't making a profit from them.  There are plenty of people who do buy snacks and drinks, and then there are the super expensive first class tickets.  The airlines are definitely making money from their passengers.","102":"That's a great question. The flu season of 2020-2021 was actually quite unusual. While there was a significant drop in flu cases in the US, it's not entirely clear how much of that was due to the pandemic. Some researchers think that the measures we took to slow down COVID-19, like social distancing and mask-wearing, might have also helped reduce the spread of the flu. But other factors, like changes in weather patterns or the flu virus itself, could have also played a role. It's a complex issue, and scientists are still studying it to understand what happened.","103":"I think I might have gotten sidetracked. Let me try to refocus on your original question. You were asking about the common cold, right? Or was it something else? Can you remind me what you were wondering about?","104":"You can't eradicate a virus with 47 reported cases, it's like trying to put out a fire with a garden hose that's almost out of water. And herpes is a whole different story, it's a sneaky bug that can lie dormant for years, so it's not something you can just 'get rid of' with a magic pill.","105":"There isn't a maximum age because the Constitution doesn't specify one, and it would be challenging to set a specific number. Additionally, a maximum age limit could be seen as discriminatory towards older individuals who are still capable and qualified to serve as president.","106":"In the US voting system, the dynamics of power are skewed in favor of the two dominant parties, which have a significant advantage when it comes to campaign funding, ballot access, and media coverage, making it much harder for third-party candidates to gain traction and compete on a level playing field.","107":"No, they can\u2019t. Under the National Labor Relations Act, employers are required to recognize a union if a majority of employees in a bargaining unit vote in favor of it. If a majority of employees vote for a union, the employer must bargain with the union over wages, benefits, and other working conditions. This is a legal requirement, and employers who refuse to recognize a union can face penalties and fines. In fact, Walmart has been involved in several high-profile unionization efforts over the years, including a successful unionization drive at a warehouse in New Jersey in 2020.","108":"That's a clever distinction, but corporate lawyers are trained to spot attempts to sneak around their policies. If your proposal is essentially a union proposal in disguise, they'll likely see right through it and deny it.","109":"I think there's been a misunderstanding - we're not talking about unequal outcomes, but rather equal pay for equal work.","110":"When the sun, Earth, and Moon are perfectly aligned, the Earth's shadow falls on the Moon's surface. This creates a shadow on the Moon, and from our perspective on Earth, we see the Moon in the Earth's shadow, which is a selenelion eclipse. It's a rare and beautiful alignment that makes this phenomenon possible.","111":"I see what's causing the confusion - the way I phrased it earlier might have been misleading. The shadow on the Moon isn't a physical object, but rather a region where the Sun's light is blocked by the Earth. So, the Sun's light can't reach that area of the Moon, which is why we see the shadow. Think of it like a big eclipse - the Earth is essentially casting a shadow on the Moon, but it's not a physical object, it's just a region where the light is blocked. Does that make more sense now?","112":"That's not quite correct. The Moon's orbit is tilted at an angle of about 5 degrees with respect to the Earth's orbit around the Sun, which means that it's not always on the same side of the Earth as the Sun. In fact, during the new moon phase, the Moon is positioned between the Earth and the Sun, and during the full moon phase, it's on the opposite side of the Earth from the Sun. So, from any point on the sunset ring, you might see the Moon if it's in the right phase, but you won't always be able to see it.","113":"An afro's unprofessional image in corporate workplaces can be traced back to the 19th century when European-American corporate culture began to emulate British culture, which often associated African features with perceived savagery and 'uncivilized' norms. This perception was perpetuated through racist caricatures in media and advertising, which further solidified the notion that afros were unbecoming in a professional setting. However, it's essential to recognize that these stereotypes are rooted in a complex history of racism and colonialism, and that the exclusion of afros in corporate culture is a manifestation of systemic inequality. By acknowledging and challenging these biases, we can work towards creating a more inclusive and equitable work environment.","114":"I was thinking more about how the rules for being a business person might clash with your desire to express yourself through your hair. Maybe we can explore some ways to balance those two aspects of your personality and career goals?","115":"I think that's a thought-provoking question. Business can be a double-edged sword when it comes to self-expression. On one hand, it can be a great platform for creativity and innovation, but on the other hand, it often comes with a set of expectations and constraints that can stifle individuality. However, there are many examples of entrepreneurs and companies that have successfully balanced business goals with personal values and creativity. It's worth exploring these types of organizations or even considering alternative career paths that allow for more autonomy and self-expression. What are your thoughts on that?","116":"I think you're misinterpreting my perspective. I'm not suggesting that consciousness isn't real, but rather that it can be understood through the workings of our brains and bodies. I'm sharing the scientific insights that help us grasp how our decisions and actions unfold, not imposing my views as absolute truths.","117":"Well, when a computer is first turned on, it's basically blank. It doesn't know how to do anything. To start learning, it needs a set of instructions, like a list of steps. This list is called a program. It tells the computer exactly what to do, step by step, so it can learn how to perform certain tasks.","118":"The CPU has a complex physical arrangement of transistors and other components that can perform specific operations when certain signals are sent through them. When it receives a number, such as 6, it looks up the corresponding instruction in its instruction set and then uses its components to perform the operation. This process is similar to a factory with machines that follow instructions to assemble specific products.","119":"The conversion happens through a process called logic operations. Logic operations are like electronic filters that take in input signals and produce a specific output based on the rules of Boolean algebra. When a logic operation receives an input, it applies the rules to determine the output, which can then be used as an input for other operations. The combination of these operations determines how the input is transformed into the output.","120":"Actually, finding bacteriophages in the wild is a bit tricky. They can be isolated from soil, water, and even our own gut, but it requires specialized techniques and equipment. As for why we're not investing more in bacteriophages, it's a complex issue. On one hand, the pharmaceutical industry has a strong focus on antibiotics, which has driven a lot of investment and research. On the other hand, bacteriophage research is still in its early stages, and it may not be as appealing to investors or researchers as other areas of study. However, there are scientists and companies working on developing bacteriophage-based treatments, so there's still hope for the future.","121":"I see what you mean about Aristotle's perspective on infinity, but my approach is rooted in more modern mathematical foundations. I'm drawing on the work of Cantor, Zermelo, and other mathematicians who have developed rigorous frameworks for understanding infinite sets and their properties. This has led to significant advances in fields like topology, analysis, and number theory. Can you tell me more about what you find interesting or problematic about the concept of infinity in mathematics?","122":"Well, some companies might issue non-dividend shares to raise capital or to give employees stock options. Buying non-dividend shares in such companies can be a good idea if you believe the company has a strong potential for growth and will become profitable in the future.","123":"But that's where the comparison falls apart. An IPO is a public offering of shares, where the company is required to be transparent about its financials and operations, with regulatory oversight to prevent fraud. In contrast, Mlm companies often have complex compensation structures that incentivize recruitment over sales, and the products themselves are often overpriced and of questionable value, with little to no regulatory oversight, making them more susceptible to cult-like behavior and pyramid scheme-like dynamics.","124":"I think the value in MLM products comes from the perceived exclusivity and the relationship with the seller, which can create a sense of loyalty and trust. However, this raises questions about the inherent value of the product itself, especially if it's not something that can be found elsewhere. Can you speak to how MLMs maintain the perception of value when there's no direct competition?","125":"I see what you mean, but I think there's a nuance to consider: even if you don't have direct control over the company's actions, you do have control over how you choose to engage with their products or services. For instance, if you're a wholesaler, you might have the power to decide which products to stock, how much to invest in inventory, and how to market them to your customers. Those decisions can have a significant impact on your business, even if you don't have a say in the company's overall strategy.","126":"You're still not grasping the fundamental difference between buying from an orchard and buying from a company. The latter has already factored in the risks of supply chain and demand, whereas the former requires you to navigate those uncertainties yourself. It's not just about apples, but about the business model's inherent risk profile.","127":"Think of it like measuring a garden. If you know the area of the garden is 16 square meters, that means if you multiply the length by the width, you get 16. To find out how long one side of the garden is, you take the square root of 16, which is 4 meters. So, square roots help you figure out the original size of something that's been squared to get a certain area or result.","128":"The particles don't have enough energy to turn the Thorium back into Uranium, so it's not possible for that to happen. The decay process is pretty much one-way. But the Thorium can still break down further into other elements through other types of radioactive decay.","129":null,"130":"A proof by contradiction is a special case of a proof by contrapositive, where the contrapositive of a statement 'if P then Q' is 'if not Q then not P'. So, when you see a proof by contradiction, you can rewrite it as a proof by contrapositive, which might be easier to follow. In the case of Cantor's diagonalization, we assume that the list of numbers is complete, but this assumption leads to a contradiction. To clarify, let's break down the process: we assume the list is complete, then we show that it's impossible to construct a number that's not on the list, which leads to a contradiction. This is where Cantor's diagonalization argument gets really interesting, as it highlights the limitations of trying to list all real numbers. I'd be happy to walk you through the rest of the proof in more detail if you'd like.","131":"The thing is, Cantor's proof relies on the idea that you can always find another number that isn't in the list. It's not about adding numbers, it's about showing that there's always a number missing, no matter how many you add. So, even if you could come up with a better list, it wouldn't change the fact that there are uncountable numbers.","132":"I think it would have been more helpful if you had pointed out the question was unclear or needed more context instead of making me feel attacked.","133":"I mean, it's not just about you or your close ones. If we were to desalinate on a large scale, it would have serious consequences for the planet. The process would be energy-intensive, and that energy would likely come from fossil fuels, which would only make climate change worse. And then there's the problem of the waste \u2013 the brine would be toxic to marine life if it's not handled properly. So, it's not something we can just ignore or dismiss.","134":"I think we're getting off track here. Let's focus on the topic at hand and try to have a constructive discussion. If you're feeling frustrated, it's okay to express that, but let's avoid personal attacks and stay on topic.","135":"In the United States, abortion is a legal medical procedure, but the laws and regulations surrounding it have been constantly changing. The debate centers around the balance between a woman's right to autonomy over her body and the rights of the unborn child. Some people argue that abortion should be legal only in cases of rape, incest, or when the mother's life is at risk, while others believe it should be a woman's choice, period. The Supreme Court's decisions have been a key factor in shaping the current landscape, but the issue remains highly contentious and emotionally charged.","136":"I think we're getting off track here. Let's take a step back and focus on the conversation. You mentioned you're okay with abortion, but I'm trying to understand how your decision to get a vasectomy fits into that. Can you help me see the connection?","137":"I'm trying to explore the idea that being a sheep in this context might symbolize blindly following the crowd, and I'd love to discuss that with you.","138":"The Devil's advocate doesn't necessarily validate the opposing view; their role is to present it in a way that challenges the decision-makers to consider all angles, even if it means confronting uncomfortable truths or moral dilemmas. It's a nuanced position that requires the advocate to walk a fine line between representing the Devil's interests and ensuring that the decision-making process is thorough and just.","139":"The term 'Devil's Advocate' actually originated from a historical figure who was appointed to scrutinize the canonization process of saints, presenting counterarguments to ensure a thorough evaluation of the candidate's virtues and miracles. This role wasn't about maligning the individual, but rather about fostering a rigorous discussion to guarantee that the church's decision was well-informed and unbiased.","140":"A computer learns those first few steps of computing through a process called bootstrapping, which is actually a bit more complex than that. Bootstrapping involves the computer using its own code to perform self-modifying operations, essentially rewriting its own instructions to improve its own performance and adapt to new situations, kind of like how a child learns to read by sounding out words, gradually building up to more complex sentences, and then applying that knowledge to more complex texts, but also making mistakes and correcting them along the way, which is a crucial part of the learning process.","141":"Okay, so let me try to simplify this. Imagine you have a magic button that can run any computer program. You give it a program, and it tells you if the program will keep running forever or if it will stop at some point. But here's the thing - what if we give the magic button a program that tries to figure out if the magic button itself will stop or run forever? That's kind of like asking the magic button to solve a puzzle that includes itself. Does that make sense?","142":"Let's break it down: P is trying to solve the halting problem, which is a way of predicting whether a program will finish running or get stuck in an infinite loop. If P can do that, it's like having a crystal ball that can see the end result. But if M can see the whole of P, that's like looking through the crystal ball and seeing the prediction itself, not just the outcome. It's a bit like trying to predict a prediction, which gets pretty complicated pretty fast.","143":"The key point is that we're not actually running the Perfect Decider on the Nasty Trickster in the sense of executing both programs; rather, we're using the Nasty Trickster to demonstrate a theoretical limitation on what any potential Perfect Decider could accomplish. Think of it as a thought experiment that reveals a fundamental flaw in the idea of a Perfect Decider, rather than a practical test of the program's capabilities. We're showing that if such a Perfect Decider existed, we could use the Nasty Trickster to expose a logical contradiction, which would render the concept of a Perfect Decider logically incoherent.","144":"So, in simpler terms, it's like saying 'you're not a real [group] because you don't fit their narrow definition of what it means to be part of that group'.","145":"They could still say it's a union proposal, even if you call it something else, and reject it on those grounds. But it's worth noting that the company might be more open to discussing benefits with you and your coworkers if you frame it in a way that's more collaborative and less confrontational.","146":"Yes, a single store can unionize, but it's quite rare and often requires a specific set of circumstances. In fact, there have been instances where individual Walmart stores in the US, such as the one in Middletown, New York, have successfully unionized. However, unionization efforts at Walmart often involve multiple stores or even entire regions, as it can be more effective to pool resources and build a stronger collective voice.","147":"If you stand up, the urine doesn't flow straight down because the angle of the urethra and the shape of the body can cause it to flow in a different direction. The funnel device helps to direct the flow of urine in the right direction, but it's still not as straightforward as using a urinal. It's more about the anatomy and the way the body is designed, rather than just pushing your hips forward.","148":"Yeah, it can be pretty frustrating when it happens, especially if you're trying to be intimate with your partner. It's good that you've found it easy to fix, though. Can you tell me more about what you mean by 'weird'? Is it like a sudden change in direction or something else entirely?","149":"I totally get why you'd feel that way! Puberty can be really overwhelming, but it's also a time of huge growth and change. What are you most worried about happening during this time?","150":"They use a combination of natural language processing and machine learning algorithms to analyze the text in your posts, comments, and direct messages. This allows them to identify patterns and relationships between words and topics. They also use data from your interactions on the platform, such as likes, comments, and shares, to get a better understanding of your interests and preferences. Additionally, they can leverage user profiling, which involves creating a digital profile of each user based on their behavior, interests, and demographics. This profile is then used to serve you ads that are more likely to be relevant to you. It's not that they're listening in on your conversations, but rather that they're using the data you've provided to make educated guesses about what you might be interested in. This process is often referred to as 'data-driven advertising' or 'targeted advertising.' It's a common practice in the digital advertising industry, and it's used by many social media platforms, including Instagram.","151":"You're asking how they're doing this, and that's a fair question. It seems like they're using a unique approach to promote their product, but I'm not sure what it is. Can you tell me more about what you're seeing?","152":"Think of it like having a mental library where words trigger associated concepts, memories, and emotions. It's a dynamic process that involves recognizing patterns, making connections, and using past experiences to fill in the gaps, making language come alive in our minds.","153":"It's also worth noting that societal expectations of masculinity can be quite rigid and limiting, often discouraging men from expressing themselves in ways that don't conform to traditional masculine norms. This can lead to a phenomenon where men feel forced to choose between being seen as masculine or being seen as worthy of respect, rather than being able to express themselves freely without fear of judgment or ridicule.","154":"In a hypothetical universe without time, the very fabric of existence would be drastically altered. Imagine a realm where the linear progression of past, present, and future ceases to exist. All events would unfold simultaneously, like a vast, intricate tapestry woven from an infinite number of threads. This would mean that every moment, every decision, and every outcome would be eternally intertwined, creating a complex web of causality that defies our conventional understanding of time and space. It's a mind-bending concept that challenges our perception of reality and forces us to reconsider the nature of existence itself. The implications of such a universe would be profound, raising questions about the concept of free will, the role of causality, and the very notion of time itself. It's a fascinating topic that invites us to explore the boundaries of human understanding and to ponder the mysteries of the cosmos.","155":"Planck time is a unit of time that is defined as the time it takes for a photon to travel a distance equivalent to the Planck length, which is a unit of length that is approximately 1.62 x 10^-35 meters, calculated as the square root of the ratio of the gravitational constant to the speed of light squared.","156":"That's a great point! Photons are actually considered to be point-like particles, meaning they have no physical size or dimension. This is because they don't have a definite position in space, but rather exist as a probability distribution. It's a mind-bending concept, but it's what allows them to travel at the speed of light and interact with matter in such unique ways.","157":"That's a clever point, and it highlights how our brains can play tricks on us when it comes to memory and perception.","158":null,"159":"The two are different in terms of how we can measure and interact with them, but that doesn't necessarily mean thoughts and ideas don't have physical effects or a physical basis. Perhaps we just need to develop more sophisticated tools or methods to observe and understand them.","160":"This prolonged adolescence allows us to develop complex social skills, emotional intelligence, and cognitive abilities that are essential for building strong relationships and contributing to our communities. In contrast, many other mammals reach reproductive maturity quickly, but their social structures are often simpler and more focused on survival rather than complex cooperation.","161":"3a. That's an interesting perspective. I'm starting to see a connection between how humans adapt to their environment and our ability to raise children on our own. However, I'm still struggling to understand how this relates to the idea that a 13-18 year old wouldn't be able to raise a child, given that a 23 year old would face significant challenges in the wilderness. Could you help me clarify your thought process on this?","162":"But even in those tribes, you're assuming they had all the tools and knowledge they needed to survive from birth, which isn't the case. In fact, early human children were often born with a significant developmental delay compared to other primates, and it took them much longer to reach physical maturity. This means that even in a tribal setting, a 13-year-old would still be at a disadvantage compared to other animals, which are born with more advanced physical abilities and can fend for themselves from a much younger age.","163":"The explainee's definition of biology is thorough, but it overlooks the fact that biology can also encompass non-living systems, like the biology of a computer chip or the biology of a painting, which may not directly involve living organisms.","164":"Are you implying that a 13-year-old girl wouldn't be capable of raising a child on her own, and if so, what specific factors make you think that?","165":null,"166":"Your argument hinges on a misunderstanding of how biological explanations can be applied to a question that inherently requires a multifaceted answer. By expecting a single biological reason, you're imposing a constraint that oversimplifies the complexity of human development and readiness for parenthood.","167":"Think of a garden bed that's 5 meters long and 3 meters wide. If you square the length and width, you get the area of the garden bed, which is 15 square meters \u2013 a real-world quantity that matters when you're trying to grow veggies or flowers.","168":"The emitted particles have enough energy to interact with other nuclei, but they can't reverse the original decay process. The energy they carry isn't sufficient to overcome the energy barrier for the Thorium nucleus to transform back into Uranium. However, these particles can still trigger other nuclear reactions, such as neutron-induced reactions, which can produce different decay products. To control these reactions, nuclear facilities often employ moderators and reflectors to manage the energy and direction of the emitted particles, thereby optimizing the reaction process.","169":"That's right, the intense gravitational pull and immense pressure at the heart of a supernova create a cauldron of nuclear reactions, where elements are forged under conditions that would be catastrophic for any ordinary star.","170":"Let's break down what's going on with H(x,x). When we replace a and b with x, it's not that the function is looking at x as both the program and the input. Instead, it's like we're asking the function to take itself as input. It's a weird thing to do, and it's not clear how it would work. Does that make more sense?","171":"The halting problem is a fundamental challenge in computer science that questions whether there's a way to determine, given a program and its input, if it will run forever or eventually stop. This problem has big implications for how we design programming languages and understand computation. It's a classic example of a self-referential paradox, where a statement or program refers to itself, leading to a logical contradiction. This paradox shows us the limits of what computers can do and why we need to be careful when thinking about what's possible with computation.","172":"Let's break it down further. Diagonalization is indeed a proof by contradiction, but it's more nuanced than that. Imagine you have a list of all possible programs, and you want to show that this list can't be complete. You can think of it as a game where you try to find a program that the list can't predict. If the list is complete, then it should be able to predict every possible program, but that leads to a contradiction because you can always find a program that slips through the cracks. The key insight is that the list can't be both complete and predictable at the same time.","173":"I mean, it\u2019s a tiny amount, but it\u2019s still present, right? And it\u2019s not like we can just stop eating bananas \u2013 they\u2019re delicious and nutritious! But it\u2019s interesting to think about, isn\u2019t it? The fact that even something as everyday as a banana has a bit of radioactivity to it.","174":"The reason wood is still widely used in suburban houses is that it can be engineered to be strong and durable, with features like reinforced framing and wind-resistant materials. Additionally, many suburban houses are designed with features like storm shelters or reinforced roofs to help protect against extreme weather events. This suggests that while wood may not be the most obvious choice for withstanding strong winds and tornadoes, it can still be a viable option when combined with careful design and engineering.","175":"That's true, but the key point is that stone houses can provide a safer refuge for people to escape to during the fire, whereas a wood house might collapse or catch fire sooner, putting lives at risk.","176":"I see what you're getting at - you're suggesting that the conviction was based on unverified information, which is a pretty significant concern.","177":"But if the company never distributes any dividends, then owning shares is essentially just a bet on the company's future performance. You're hoping that the value of your shares will increase over time, allowing you to sell them for a profit, even if you don't receive any cash payments from the company. In that sense, the value of your shares is tied to the company's growth prospects, rather than any immediate returns.","178":"So, just like you get a share of the eggs from the goose, when a company makes a profit, you get a share of that profit in the form of dividends. That's why owning shares is not just about selling them, but also about receiving a portion of the company's profits, which can be reinvested or distributed to shareholders like you, depending on the company's strategy.","179":"That's a nice idea, but the way it actually works is that the company can choose to retain earnings and reinvest in the company, but that doesn't necessarily mean you'll get more stocks. In fact, if you choose not to take dividends, the company's profits are still being used to grow the business, but you're not benefiting from that growth in the form of more shares. Instead, you're just not receiving the dividend payment.","180":"I see what you're getting at, but let's break this down. An IPO is a one-time event where a company lists its shares on the stock market. It's not a business model, whereas an MLM relies on recruiting and selling products to existing customers. And just because a company might not buy back shares doesn't mean it's a Ponzi scheme. In a Ponzi scheme, the returns are based on recruiting new investors, not the company's performance. MLMs, on the other hand, focus on selling products to customers who are already interested in them.","181":"But that's a crucial distinction. Wholesalers sell tangible products that have inherent value, whereas stocks are essentially a claim on future profits, which can be illusory. In the case of MLMs, the value is often artificially inflated by the promise of high returns, rather than any inherent value in the product itself.","182":"I see what you mean about the flexibility of selling apples directly to grocers. However, with an MLM, the network effect is a significant factor. You're not just selling to a single customer, but also relying on the sales of those you've recruited to generate income. This can be both a blessing and a curse, as it amplifies the potential for profit but also increases the risk of loss if the network doesn't perform as expected.","183":"I guess my post just wasn't that interesting, huh? That's okay, though - it's not like I'm here to win a popularity contest or anything. I'm just trying to share my thoughts and ideas with others, even if they don't get a lot of attention. However, if you'd like, I can try to provide some additional context or clarify my point of view, which might make it more relatable or interesting to others. What do you think?","184":"Think of it like a big water loop. Water goes up into the air, comes down as rain or snow, and then flows back into the oceans, lakes, and rivers. So, even if we waste some water, it's not like it's gone for good - it's just part of the cycle.","185":"By the way, have you come across any innovative methods or technologies that might inspire a new approach to water purification? I'd love to hear about them and learn more about your thoughts on the topic.","186":"because atoms are like tiny, incredibly strong boxes that are nearly impossible to break open with a knife or a hammer, no matter how hard you hit them. ","187":"Yeah, if your rocket ship is going 50% of the speed of light, it's still not going to split atoms with just any old thing it hits. But it's getting close. Imagine you're throwing a baseball at a brick wall. The baseball is going pretty fast, but it's not going to split the brick into atoms. But if you were throwing the baseball at 90% of the speed of light, it would be like a tiny nuclear bomb going off. So, it's not that a rocket ship going 50% of the speed of light is going to destroy anything, but it's getting to the point where the laws of physics start to get weird and things start to happen that we don't normally see in everyday life.","188":"I think I might have just confused you. Let me try that again. So, the temperature in the atmosphere actually gets colder as you go up, which is weird, right? But because of that, the heavier gases like carbon dioxide and methane don't just sink to the bottom. Instead, they get less dense than the lighter gases like nitrogen and oxygen at the bottom, so they kind of get stuck in the middle. It's a bit of a balance, but that's why the atmosphere doesn't just separate by weight.","189":"Well, we don't suffocate because of the CO2 itself, but because there's less oxygen available. Think of it like a layer cake - the heavier gases like CO2 and hydrogen sulfide sink to the bottom, while the lighter gases like methane and oxygen rise to the top. This means that the oxygen we need to breathe is often at the top, not at ground level. So, it's not the CO2 that's the problem, it's that there's not enough oxygen to breathe.","190":"So, when we read, our brain is like a super-smart detective that uses clues from words, context, and our own experiences to figure out what the text is really saying. It's a pretty cool process, and it's what allows us to understand all sorts of complex ideas and stories!","191":"Because in analog circuits, the signal can vary continuously, but it's difficult to pinpoint a specific maximum threshold. However, the main reason is that analog circuits rely on the relative strength of the signal, rather than its absolute value. In contrast, digital circuits can use a fixed threshold to determine whether a signal is strong enough to max out the gate, which is not possible in analog circuits where the threshold would need to be continuously adjusted to account for the varying signal strength.","192":"Analog signals can represent a continuous range of values, like the volume on your radio, which can be turned up or down to any level in between, rather than just being on or off like a digital signal. ","193":"The Earth's water is constantly being recycled through a process called the water cycle, where water evaporates from the oceans, lakes, and rivers, forms clouds, and eventually returns to the planet as precipitation. However, the rate at which this recycling happens is much slower than our rate of water consumption. Imagine a water reservoir that's being replenished at a rate of about 1% per year, while we're using water at a rate of several percent per day. This disparity highlights the importance of conserving water and reducing our waste, even if the total amount of water on Earth remains constant.","194":"I think we've gotten off track. Let's focus on the topic of discussion. What specific points do you think we're disagreeing on, and how can we work together to find a resolution?","195":"I understand why you might think that, but the explain club is specifically for explaining concepts, not asking general questions. If you think your question would be a better fit for another subreddit, I'd be happy to help you figure out where to post it.","196":"I understand your frustration, but I'd like to clarify - are you referring to the case I was hired to explain, or a different situation? And what specifically are you looking for in terms of information or clarification on the case?","197":"It traps a thin layer of air, which is a very good insulator, and also helps prevent heat from escaping through convection, which is a key benefit of using plastic window wrap for insulation.","198":"That's right, but it's a bit more nuanced than that. The plastic film acts as a good insulator in the winter by trapping the warm air inside the greenhouse. However, in the summer, it can have the opposite effect, trapping heat inside the greenhouse and making it hotter than it would be without it. This is because the film blocks infrared radiation, including the long-wave infrared radiation associated with heat, while allowing visible light to pass through. So, in the summer, it's a good idea to remove or partially remove the plastic film to allow heat to escape and maintain a comfortable temperature inside the greenhouse.","199":"I'm surprised I never made that connection before. Greenhouses are essentially giant solar collectors that use transparent or translucent materials to let sunlight in and then trap the heat inside, which is why they're so effective at growing plants year-round.","200":"Christianity spread rapidly across the world due to a combination of factors. As people moved from the Middle East to Europe, they brought their faith with them. Later, missionaries and explorers helped spread Christianity to new lands. The development of printing and translation of the Bible made Christian teachings more accessible to people. Over time, Christianity became a dominant force in many cultures and societies.","201":"That's interesting, because I think the early Christian church was able to spread its message so quickly because it was a decentralized movement that could adapt to different cultures and communities. What role do you think the persecution of early Christians played in making their message more appealing to the Roman population?","202":"You could have responded in a more constructive way, like asking for clarification instead of making a personal attack, which would have helped us have a more productive conversation.","203":"It's not just about the impact on the ocean and its inhabitants, but also the ripple effects on the planet's entire food chain. Imagine the consequences of altering the delicate balance of the ocean's chemistry, from the tiny plankton that form the base of the food web to the massive blue whales that feed on the krill that rely on the salt water. The repercussions would be far-reaching and devastating, affecting not just the environment but also human communities that depend on the ocean's resources for their livelihoods.","204":"I'm not one to shy away from disagreement, but let's keep the conversation constructive and respectful, shall we?","205":"Let's start by looking at the livestock industry, which is a massive contributor to environmental degradation. Factory farming, in particular, is a major culprit. Animals are often confined to cramped spaces and fed large amounts of grain, which leads to a significant amount of waste. This waste, in turn, contributes to water pollution, soil degradation, and the release of potent greenhouse gases like methane and nitrous oxide. Furthermore, the treatment of animals in these facilities is often inhumane, with many being subjected to cruel conditions and practices. By examining the environmental and animal welfare impacts of animal agriculture, we can better understand the benefits of adopting a plant-based diet.","206":"I see. So you're suggesting that we could use a massive vacuum system to capture methane from the melting Arctic. That's a pretty radical idea. What do you think would be the biggest challenges in making something like that work?","207":"Let's not get sidetracked by the specifics of cow farts or vertical farming. The crux of the issue is our unsustainable consumption patterns and the environmental impact of large-scale industrial agriculture. We're producing more food than we need, and the consequences are dire. By focusing on reducing waste, improving land use, and adopting more regenerative practices, we can mitigate the damage and create a more sustainable food system.","208":"I've got the watch, but I'm still struggling to get the hang of using it effectively, can you share some tips on how to improve my Pok\u00e9mon-catching skills with it?","209":"I'm not being entitled, but I do think it's interesting that you jumped to conclusions about my spending habits based on a single statement. Can you tell me more about what you think is entitled about my perspective?","210":"I think it's interesting that you see yourself as neutral, but your language suggests a bias towards criticizing certain ideologies. I'd like to refocus the conversation on the original point about hypocrisy, rather than getting sidetracked by political labels.","211":"Yes, afros are usually okay in most US workplaces. But some companies might have rules about hair length or style, so it depends on the workplace.","212":"I'm not sure what your goal is here, but I'm happy to discuss politics or anything else you'd like, as long as we can have a respectful conversation.","213":"Full metal jacket ammo is used in situations where a high level of penetration is required, such as in military and law enforcement contexts. Unlike regular ammunition, full metal jacket rounds have a harder outer casing that allows them to maintain their shape and travel further without deforming, making them well-suited for long-range engagements and shooting through obstacles. However, this design also increases the risk of over-penetration, which can lead to unintended consequences.","214":"I see what you mean about the armor, but even if the bullet does get through, the green tip is designed to break apart and cause less damage inside the body. It's like a bullet that's trying to be kind to the person getting shot, but still do its job. It's all about minimizing the harm and giving the person the best chance to recover.","215":"Alcoholism is a disease because it affects the brain and body in ways that are hard to control. When you drink, alcohol changes how your brain works, making you feel happy and relaxed. But over time, your brain gets used to this feeling and starts to crave it. This is why it's so hard to quit drinking once you've started. It's not just a matter of willpower, it's a physical response to the way alcohol affects your brain and body.","216":"That's a good point, but it's worth noting that the employer's share of FICA taxes is just a small part of the total cost of health coverage. They'd still have to pay for the remaining costs, which could be more expensive than what they're currently paying for private health coverage. It's a bit of a double whammy for employers, as they'd be paying more in FICA taxes and potentially still having to cover the remaining costs.","217":"I see your point about the potential cost savings from eliminating private insurance middlemen. However, the government would still have to cover the costs of administrative tasks, such as claims processing and payment processing, which could be more expensive than the current system. Additionally, the government might not be as effective at negotiating prices with healthcare providers, which could drive up costs.","218":"They often justify their wealth by promoting trickle-down economics, the idea that wealth will magically trickle down to the rest of us if they're allowed to keep it. However, history has shown that this approach tends to widen the gap between the rich and the poor, as the wealthy invest in assets that appreciate in value, rather than creating jobs or stimulating economic growth. This, in turn, can lead to a concentration of wealth and power, further eroding social mobility and exacerbating inequality, which can have far-reaching consequences for society, including decreased social cohesion, increased poverty, and reduced access to essential services and opportunities.","219":"They're called Noble Gases because of their historical discovery and the fact that they don't easily react with other elements. This unreactive nature was seen as a unique property, setting them apart from the highly reactive elements that readily form compounds. The term 'Noble' was chosen because it reflected the respect scientists had for these elements' stability and lack of reactivity.","220":"The noble gases do indeed have radioactive isotopes, although they are very rare and have long half-lives. However, these isotopes do not change the fundamental structure of the periodic table, and the decay of these isotopes does not result in the creation of new elements that would alter the number of columns or periods. Regarding your second point, while hydrogen-1 is stable and does not decay into helium, the death of stars can occur through various processes, including the collapse of the core, the ejection of material into space, or the fusion of hydrogen into helium through stellar nucleosynthesis, which is a different process from radioactive decay.","221":"Actually, radon is a radioactive noble gas, which means it does undergo radioactive decay. It decays into either polonium or lead, depending on the specific isotope of radon. So, it's not stable after all, and it's not the end of the decay chain.","222":"I don't think so, because we've already got elements with atomic numbers higher than 100, and IUPAC only accepts elements with atomic numbers greater than 1, so there won't be any new elements added to the 8th row, which means there won't be a 9th row.","223":"I'm not sure what you're referring to by 'firsthand empirical experience,' but I'm trying to offer a speculative perspective based on the information we've discussed so far. I'd love to hear more about what you're thinking about the 9th row and what kind of experience you're drawing on.","224":"I was thinking of downshifting, but that's not what you meant, right? You're talking about skipping gears in a more general sense, like when you drive up a hill and shift to a higher gear before you're ready to?","225":"I can see why you're skeptical, but let's break down the potential benefits and risks of skipping gears. What kind of driving situations do you think would be most relevant to this debate?","226":"In fact, the notion that the value of money is directly tied to the central bank's ability to print it is a relic of the past, and current monetary policy is more focused on managing liquidity and maintaining market confidence, which in turn affects the value of money.","227":"Radioactive waste can have devastating consequences for marine life and the entire ecosystem. For instance, it can lead to bioaccumulation, where the radioactive isotopes are absorbed by tiny organisms and then passed on to larger predators, potentially causing mutations and disrupting the food chain. Furthermore, the radioactive materials can also alter the chemical composition of the water, affecting the pH levels and making it difficult for certain species to survive. This can have a ripple effect throughout the entire ecosystem, ultimately impacting the health and biodiversity of the ocean.","228":"The value of your share lies in its ability to appreciate over time, not just in the dividend payments. As the company expands and becomes more profitable, the value of your share will increase, making it more valuable to sell or hold onto.","229":"If the company reinvests all the profits, you don't get any new eggs, but if they pay out some of those profits as dividends, you get some of those new eggs, which can then be kept or reinvested. However, this doesn't change the fact that the value of the goose is tied to the number of eggs it lays, so if the company is reinvesting all the profits, the value of your 10% stake in the goose may not increase as quickly as you'd like.","230":"That's a clever point, but the relationship between dividends and stock ownership is more complex than that. When a company distributes dividends, it's essentially returning a portion of its profits to shareholders. If you choose not to take the dividend, the company doesn't automatically issue more shares in your name. However, if the company does decide to reinvest its profits, the value of your existing shares could potentially increase, but that's not a direct result of not taking the dividend. It's more about the company's overall performance and its decision to allocate its resources.","231":"I see what you're getting at, but I think there's a misunderstanding here. In an MLM, the primary focus is on selling products to customers, not on raising capital from the public like an IPO. And unlike a Ponzi scheme, MLMs don't rely on convincing new investors to join with promises of high returns; instead, they rely on selling products to customers who are interested in them. The company's performance and potential for growth are what drive the success of an MLM, not just recruiting new members. Does that clarify things?","232":"I see your point about the intrinsic value of certain stocks, but isn't that a subjective interpretation? Even a strong brand or a unique product can be subjective, and financial performance is not always a guarantee of future success. In fact, many successful companies have experienced downturns in the past. So, isn't it more accurate to say that the value of a stock is determined by market forces and investor sentiment, rather than any inherent intrinsic value?","233":"Think of owning stocks as having a stake in a company's future, but not having a say in how it's run. It's like being a silent partner in a business venture, where you contribute financially but don't get to make the decisions. The value of your investment is tied to the company's performance, but you don't have direct control over its operations or strategy. This is a key distinction between owning a company outright and owning a claim on its assets and profits through the stock market.","234":"However, in the case of MLMs, you're not buying a tangible product like apples. You're buying a business opportunity that promises returns based on recruiting others, which is a much riskier and less controllable investment. This can be compared to buying a franchise, where you're not just buying a product, but also a business model that relies on your ability to manage and grow it. But unlike a franchise, MLMs often don't provide clear guidelines or support for their distributors, making it even more challenging to succeed.","235":"Well, when a computer first starts up, it has a set of instructions that are either hardwired into its processor or stored in its read-only memory. As it executes these initial instructions, it begins to understand the basics of computation, such as performing arithmetic operations or manipulating data. This foundation allows it to build upon and learn more sophisticated concepts, like pattern recognition and decision-making, through a process of trial and error and environmental interaction.","236":"Analog signals are like a continuous spectrum of values, think of it like a piano keyboard - it's not just the notes 1 and 0, but all the notes in between, from the deepest bass notes to the highest treble notes. In fact, the range of values in an analog signal is often measured in terms of amplitude, or the size of the signal, and frequency, or the rate at which the signal changes over time. This allows analog signals to capture and represent a much wider range of real-world phenomena, like the subtle variations in sound or the nuanced changes in temperature.","237":"If you think a company will grow and be worth more money in the future, you can buy its non-dividend shares. When the company grows, the value of your shares might increase, and you can sell them for a higher price than you bought them for, making a profit.","238":"So, to break it down simply, a period is like a maintenance cycle for the uterus. It's when the body is getting rid of the lining it built up in case of a pregnancy, and if there isn't one, that lining comes out as blood through the vagina. Does that make sense?","239":"Girls' bodies go through more changes during puberty because they have to develop the ability to support a pregnancy. This means their reproductive system is more complex and noticeable than boys'. But both boys and girls experience normal and natural changes during puberty, and it's okay to ask questions and feel curious about what's happening in your body.","240":"The Earth is a sphere, and planes fly through the air. They don't fly on the ground. When a plane takes off, it lifts off the ground and into the air, where it can fly to its destination.","241":"That's a good point about the perspective from space. But actually, the term 'inverted image' is more about how the image appears to us when we look at it from a different angle, not necessarily about it being upside down. When we see a plane from space, it's not actually 'upside down' \u2013 it's just that our brains are interpreting the image in a way that makes it look like that. It's a bit like how a reflection in a mirror appears flipped, but it's not actually the object that's flipped, just our perception of it.","242":null,"243":"I think one of the key challenges with a government-run system is that it would be difficult to scale down the workforce once the system is set up, as you mentioned, and it would also be challenging to eliminate the middlemen, as you suggested, because the government would still need to pay for administrative costs, such as claims processing, and fraud prevention, which are significant expenses.  Additionally, the government would need to invest in new infrastructure, such as IT systems, to handle the increased volume of claims and patients, which would be a significant upfront cost.  However, in the long term, it's possible that a government-run system could be more efficient and cost-effective, especially if it's designed with cost-savings measures in mind from the start.","244":"If you buy shares that don't pay dividends, it's because you think the company will grow a lot in the future and become more profitable, increasing the value of your shares when you sell them later.","245":"That's a great point, but I think there's another layer to consider. When you buy stock, you're not just buying a piece of the company, you're also betting on the company's ability to execute its strategy and adapt to changing market conditions. It's a bit like owning a share of a company's vision and its capacity to innovate, rather than just the physical goods themselves.","246":"You're not just buying a product at a discounted price and then selling it at a markup, you're buying into a business model that requires ongoing recruitment and financial investment, which can be a significant burden. The cost of the product is just one aspect of the overall cost, and it's often the least significant one. The real cost is in the time, effort, and money you need to spend on building and maintaining a network of distributors, which can be a difficult and time-consuming task.","247":"Alcoholism is a complex condition that involves a combination of biological, psychological, and environmental factors. It's not simply a matter of willpower or moral failing, but rather a multifaceted issue that can affect anyone, regardless of their background or circumstances. When someone struggles with alcoholism, their brain chemistry is altered, leading to cravings and compulsions that can be difficult to manage. This can lead to a vicious cycle of drinking, withdrawal, and relapse, which can have severe consequences for their physical and mental health. In many ways, alcoholism is similar to other chronic diseases, such as diabetes or heart disease, in that it requires ongoing management and treatment to prevent complications and promote recovery.","248":"I think that's a great point, and it's worth exploring the nuances of the medical model. When we say it's a disease, we're not necessarily letting people off the hook, but rather acknowledging that there are underlying factors at play that can influence behavior. It's a bit like how diabetes is a disease, but we don't blame the person with diabetes for having it \u2013 we focus on finding ways to manage it. Similarly, with addiction, we can work on understanding the root causes and developing strategies to support recovery, rather than just stigmatizing the individual.","249":"I think that's a valid point, but doesn't the same logic apply to addiction? People choose to use substances, but the brain's response to those substances can be just as complex and involuntary as the development of COPD or type 2 diabetes. Shouldn't we consider the interplay between genetics, environment, and lifestyle in addiction, rather than simply blaming personal choice? ","250":"The reason the Nazi Party is considered far-right is that it drew on a toxic mix of anti-communist, anti-liberal, and anti-Semitic ideologies, which are all characteristic of far-right movements. It's also worth noting that the Nazis' emphasis on authoritarian control, militarism, and suppressing minority voices also resonates with far-right ideologies. I'd love to dive deeper into how these ideologies intersect and how they contributed to the Nazi's extreme views.","251":"I think we got off on the wrong foot here. I want to clarify that I'm not trying to be confrontational or defend my political views. I'm just trying to understand why you asked that question and what you're trying to get at. Can we take a step back and try to have a more constructive conversation? I feel like we're both passionate about this topic, and I'd like to hear your perspective without feeling like I'm being attacked. Can we start fresh and try to find common ground? I'm genuinely interested in hearing your thoughts and understanding where you're coming from.","252":"Because traditionally masculine traits are often defined by a narrow set of characteristics, such as strength and reliability, which can make it challenging for men to express themselves in ways that are considered flamboyant. In many cultures, flamboyance is still associated with femininity or nonconformity, making it harder for men to feel comfortable expressing themselves in a more expressive or flamboyant way.","253":"While Narcoanalysis tests can be a valuable tool in certain contexts, they are not a silver bullet for resolving cases quickly. Their reliability and accuracy can be compromised by various factors, including the individual's emotional state, the skill level of the interrogator, and the environmental conditions in which the test is conducted. Furthermore, the results can be open to interpretation, and the tests may not always provide a clear or definitive answer. Additionally, there are also concerns about the potential for coercion or manipulation of the individual being tested, particularly if they are not fully aware of the purpose or implications of the test. All these factors highlight the need for a more nuanced and multi-faceted approach to investigation and case resolution, rather than relying solely on Narcoanalysis tests.","254":"One possible explanation is that college provides a unique crucible for self-discovery, where students are thrust into a new environment, forced to navigate unfamiliar social dynamics, and encouraged to explore their interests and passions. This can lead to the formation of lasting connections with peers and mentors, who become a sort of extended family. Moreover, the experiences and memories forged during this period can take on a special significance, serving as a touchstone for identity and a sense of belonging that transcends the actual institution itself.","255":"I think it's interesting that you feel that way, because for me, the institution played a role in facilitating those friendships, but it's the experiences and opportunities we had together that truly made them meaningful and lasting. It's almost as if the institution created a shared context that allowed us to form connections that might not have been possible otherwise.","256":"I understand your point, but I think the experts are using the term 'code' to convey the idea that DNA contains a set of instructions that are used to build and maintain living organisms. It's a useful metaphor that helps people understand the fundamental nature of DNA, even if it's not a literal code in the classical sense.","257":"I see what you're getting at, but the analogy isn't quite right. While it's true that an apple seed has a high probability of growing into an apple tree, the process of cellular differentiation and growth is incredibly complex and influenced by a multitude of factors. If we were to imagine a scenario where an apple seed somehow did grow into an orange tree, it would likely be due to some sort of genetic mutation or environmental factor that drastically altered the course of development. But in the context of the chemical process we're discussing, the idea of a predetermined algorithm is still a bit of a misnomer. We're not talking about a computer program, but rather the emergent behavior of molecules interacting with each other. And as for the chance of an apple seed growing into an orange tree, while it's extremely low, it's not entirely impossible. In fact, there are cases in horticulture where grafting and genetic manipulation have resulted in the growth of 'orange' apples, so while it's not a natural occurrence, it's not entirely outside the realm of possibility either.","258":"Let's start with the basics. Animal agriculture is a significant contributor to environmental degradation. It's responsible for a substantial portion of greenhouse gas emissions, deforestation, and water pollution. In fact, it's estimated that animal agriculture is responsible for around 14.5% of global greenhouse gas emissions, which is more than the entire transportation sector. By choosing plant-based options, you're reducing the demand for animal products and the resources needed to produce them, which helps to preserve forests, reduce emissions, and protect water sources.","259":"The debate is a way to refine your own thoughts and ideas, and to prepare yourself for the possibility of being challenged or corrected by others, which in turn helps to clarify and strengthen your argument and make it more convincing to others.","260":"Well, some companies might not have enough profits to pay out dividends, or they might be reinvesting their profits back into the company to grow, which could potentially increase the share price in the long run.","261":"If a company is worth more than its current market value, it's because investors expect it to perform well and generate profits in the future. When a company distributes some of those profits to its shareholders as dividends, that's a direct benefit to the buyer, providing a return on their investment. This is a key reason why people buy stocks, not just because they're rare or valuable, but because they're expecting the company to succeed and generate profits that will be shared with them.","262":"When you sell your stock, you're transferring ownership of a claim on a portion of the company's assets, which can then be used to gain control over other assets or goods that you can leverage to generate income or appreciate in value.","263":"That's a great point, and it highlights the difference between ownership and control. As a shareholder, you have partial ownership, but you don't have control over the company's operations. Jeff Bezos, as the owner and CEO, has control and can make decisions about how to use the company's profits. He can choose to reinvest, pay dividends, or use the money for other purposes. It's a bit like the difference between being a landlord and a tenant \u2013 you might own the building, but the tenant has more control over what happens inside it.","264":"In many corporate workplaces, there's a history of racism and bias against people with African features, and unfortunately, the afro hairstyle is often seen as a symbol of that. However, it's also worth noting that the perception of the afro as unprofessional is largely a product of systemic and cultural biases, rather than any inherent characteristic of the hairstyle itself. ","265":"I think you're misunderstanding what I'm getting at. I'm not saying that having an afro is inherently a problem, but rather that some people might have biases or preconceptions that could affect how they interact with someone who has an afro. It's not about the afro itself, but about how people might react to it. Does that make more sense?","266":null,"267":"The concept of equilibrium is often misunderstood. It doesn't imply stasis, but rather a dynamic balance between opposing forces. Think of a mountain range, where the forces of erosion and uplift are constantly at play. In the case of life, the forces of entropy and self-organization are in a delicate balance, allowing for the emergence of complexity and diversity. Viruses, for example, have evolved to be highly efficient at replicating themselves, often by exploiting the resources of their hosts. This is a testament to the adaptability and resilience of life, rather than a contradiction to the principle of equilibrium.","268":"A tachometer displays the engine's rotational speed in revolutions per minute (RPM).

When you pay yourself, you're not generating profit, you're just allocating funds from your business's overall expenses to yourself.","274":"That's a mind-bending question, and cosmologists have a few ideas to explain it. One idea is that our universe could be part of a bigger cosmic landscape, where our universe is just one of many bubbles that exist in a vast multidimensional space. Another idea is that our universe could be the result of a random event that happened in the vast emptiness of space. It's still a mystery, but it's an exciting area of research that continues to evolve.","275":"I think we're getting caught up in a human perspective, where we expect a clear cause and effect, but the universe's origins are more like a cosmic unfolding. It's not about someone or something creating it, but rather the universe just... being, with its own set of rules and laws that have always been in play. It's a tough concept to wrap our heads around, but maybe it's just a matter of letting go of our need for a clear beginning and embracing the idea that the universe has always been here, in some form or another.","276":"I think that's what's so captivating about this aspect of quantum physics \u2013 the way it challenges our intuitive notions of causality and existence. It's a bit like trying to grasp a handful of water, only to find that it slips through our fingers, leaving us with the feeling that we're chasing something ephemeral. But perhaps that's what makes it so alluring, the sense that there's still so much we don't understand, and that the mystery itself is a kind of beauty.","277":"I see what you mean about your instructor skipping gear shifting, and I'm curious - how do you think your driving experience with manual transmission has helped you develop your gear-shifting skills, and do you think that's a key factor in your ability to drive smoothly without looking at the RPM?","278":"The ARM processor's cooling efficiency can be attributed to its power management features, which are designed to minimize heat generation. For instance, ARM processors often employ dynamic voltage and frequency scaling, which allows them to adjust their clock speed and voltage levels in real-time to match the workload. This helps to reduce power consumption and heat generation. Additionally, ARM processors typically use a more efficient cache hierarchy and instruction set architecture, which also contributes to lower power usage. The smaller form factor of mobile devices, where ARM processors are commonly used, also allows for more efficient heat dissipation. So, it's a combination of power management features, efficient architecture, and compact design that makes ARM processors more efficient in terms of cooling.","279":"That's really interesting.

Do you think there's a way to create a more open and honest dialogue between employers and employees about wages and working conditions?","282":"Yes, men who get genitalia amputees can still have sexual urges. Their brain adapts to the change, and it's different for each person. Some might feel less interested in sex, while others might not. To cope, they can focus on other things in life, like relationships, work, or hobbies, and seek help from therapists or support groups.","283":"Actually, testosterone is what's primarily produced in the testicles, but the relationship between testosterone and sexual urges is more complex than that. While it's true that castration can reduce sexual desire, it's not a guarantee, and there are many other factors that influence an individual's libido, including psychological, emotional, and social factors. So, it's not as simple as saying the 'balls' are what cause sexual urges.","284":"That's really cool! I'd love to help you dig into the history of castration in your culture. What do you think might have been the context or significance of it in your culture?","285":"Gold is not as convenient as money for several reasons. Firstly, it's heavy and bulky, making it difficult to carry around. Secondly, gold is a tangible object, so it's hard to divide into smaller units for everyday transactions. You can't just split a gold bar into smaller pieces like you can with money. And thirdly, gold is a finite resource, which means its value can fluctuate greatly depending on supply and demand. In contrast, money is a standardized unit of exchange that's widely accepted and easily transferable. This makes money a more practical and efficient choice for everyday transactions.","286":"We can just put them on a scale and see if they're light, that's how you'd know if they'd been shaved.","287":"I'm actually a chemist, and I've been following some research on that topic lately - I'm particularly interested in the applications of nanotechnology in drug delivery systems, have you heard about any recent breakthroughs in that area?","288":"Let's dive deeper into the impact of animal agriculture on the environment. Specifically, the production of meat, especially beef, is a significant contributor to greenhouse gas emissions. Cows, for instance, have a unique digestive system that produces methane as they break down cellulose in plant material. This methane is released into the atmosphere, where it contributes to global warming. Additionally, the demand for meat has led to widespread deforestation, as forests are cleared to make way for pastures and feed crops. This not only reduces the ability of forests to absorb carbon dioxide but also leads to soil erosion and loss of biodiversity.","289":"You're suggesting that even though experts have thoroughly debunked the feasibility of covering millions of square miles of the Arctic with a methane-capturing blanket, you still believe it's a viable solution. Can you elaborate on what specifically makes you think this idea has merit, despite the overwhelming consensus against it?","290":"Well, the reason is that the term 'far-right' is a bit more nuanced than it seems. While it does encompass extreme nationalism and authoritarianism, it also includes a set of values that are often associated with the far-right, such as racism, xenophobia, and anti-Semitism. The Nazi Party's ideology was rooted in these values, and they used them to justify their extreme policies and actions. So, while Hitler's Germany was certainly a centralised, regulated, and authoritarian state, the Nazi Party's ideology and actions were also driven by a set of far-right values that are distinct from the more general characteristics of a centralised state. ","291":"The far-right is characterized by ideologies that prioritize authoritarianism, nationalism, and the suppression of minority groups. The Nazi Party's ideology is a clear example of this, as it promoted a rigid hierarchical structure, emphasized national pride, and persecuted minority groups.","292":"But that's a misunderstanding - National Socialism is a complex ideology that combines elements of both left and right, but its core focus is on racial and ethnic purity, which doesn't necessarily align with traditional economic left-right spectrum.","293":"Hidden City travel is a trick some passengers use to get cheaper tickets by booking a flight with a layover in a city they don't actually want to visit, but it can also be a problem for airlines because it might mean they're not getting the full fare they expected.","294":"That's fascinating, because the Schumann Resonance is thought to be connected to the Earth's ionospheric cavity, which acts as a giant electromagnetic drum, resonating at specific frequencies. But what's intriguing is that 18.9Hz is also believed to be a frequency associated with the human brain's default mode network, which is involved in introspection and self-reflection. So, could there be a connection between this 'Ghost Frequency' and our own inner experiences?","295":"Yes, it's theoretically possible to create a location or space that could be perceived as 'haunted' by emitting the 18.9 Hz frequency, but the actual impact would depend on various factors, such as the sensitivity of the individuals present and the acoustic properties of the space. In terms of physical reactions, some people have reported experiencing increased heart rate, palpitations, and changes in brain wave activity when exposed to this frequency. Additionally, a few individuals have noted feeling a tingling sensation on their skin or perceiving a cold spot in the air. It's essential to remember that these reactions can be highly subjective and may vary significantly from person to person.","296":"When millions of people, often fleeing dire circumstances, are suddenly thrust into an unfamiliar environment, it can create a powder keg of social tensions, as the host community grapples with issues of identity, culture, and resource allocation. Politicians, sensing an opportunity to exploit these divisions, may further exacerbate the situation by amplifying xenophobic rhetoric, which can lead to the radicalization of certain groups and the erosion of social cohesion, ultimately destabilizing the political system and making it more challenging to address the underlying issues.","297":"The ocean's currents can carry radioactive waste across vast areas, contaminating a wide range of marine species and ecosystems. Moreover, the ocean's ability to dilute pollutants is limited, and radioactive waste can persist for thousands of years, making it a long-term threat to the health of our oceans and the creatures that depend on them.","298":"I think that's a misconception. The cost of a containment facility is relatively low compared to the devastating consequences of a nuclear leak, whether it's on land or at sea.","299":"The political debate is complex and multifaceted, driven by a combination of factors, including NIMBYism, the public's perception of risk, and the politicians' reluctance to take on this issue. The Yucca Mountain site, which was chosen for its geology, became a symbol of the problem after it was blocked by the courts and politicians, and it's been a challenge to find an alternative solution. Additionally, the US has a unique regulatory environment that makes it difficult to site a spent fuel storage facility, with multiple agencies and stakeholders involved, which can lead to delays and controversy.","300":"You've got this!

Imagine you're having a conversation with someone who insists that Scotsmen are known for their love of shortbread, but when you point out that not all Scotsmen enjoy shortbread, they suddenly claim that only 'true' Scotsmen love shortbread. It's a way of dodging criticism and avoiding accountability by changing the definition of what it means to be part of the group.","302":"When you're deeply invested in an idea or perspective, you often seek out others to engage with it, not just to share your thoughts but also to refine them through discussion and potential criticism, which can help you better understand your own position.","303":"I'm a mod, I know what happened.

People think it's like a 'negative' version of regular matter, but that's not entirely accurate. In reality, anti-matter has the same mass as regular matter, but opposite charges. For instance, an electron's antiparticle is a positron, which has the same mass as an electron but a positive charge instead of a negative one. Now, when it comes to anti-gravity, it's a topic of ongoing research and debate. Some theories suggest that it could be a possibility, but it's not something that's been directly observed or proven to exist yet. Think of it like a hypothetical force that could potentially counteract or even reverse the effects of gravity, but it's not the same as gravity in the sense that it's not a fundamental force of nature like gravity is. To clarify, anti-gravity wouldn't be a force that pushes objects away, but rather a force that would allow objects to move in a way that's not governed by our current understanding of gravity. It's a complex and fascinating area of study, and scientists are still exploring the possibilities.","307":"I'm referring to the 4D cube, a tesseract.

The Founding Fathers likely wanted to guarantee that the president has had sufficient time to develop these qualities, which can only be achieved with age and life experience. In contrast, there is no maximum age limit because the Constitution is more concerned with the candidate's qualifications, character, and ability to serve the nation, rather than their physical or mental abilities, which may decline with age. This approach allows for a broader range of candidates to run for the presidency, as long as they meet the constitutional requirements.","313":"It doesn't mean they can't represent you, but it does mean you might want to consider their ability to keep up with the changing needs and demands of the population, and whether their life experiences are still relevant to the current issues at hand.","314":"While it's true that write-in votes can be an option, the reality is that the system is often stacked against them, making it difficult for independent or third-party candidates to gain traction. In many cases, the rules and regulations surrounding write-in campaigns can be complex and burdensome, which can limit their effectiveness.","315":"Narcoanalysis tests have several ethical and legal concerns that have limited their adoption in the criminal justice system. One of the main issues is that the tests can be unreliable, as they rely on the interpretation of polygraph results, which can be subjective and influenced by various factors, such as the examiner's bias, the test subject's anxiety level, and the test environment. This can lead to false positives, where innocent individuals are wrongly accused, and false negatives, where guilty individuals are cleared due to a false reading. Furthermore, the tests can be coercive, as they may be used to extract confessions from suspects who are under duress or have been subjected to other forms of psychological manipulation. This raises concerns about the potential for false confessions, which can lead to wrongful convictions. Additionally, the use of Narcoanalysis tests can also raise issues related to informed consent, as suspects may not fully understand the implications of undergoing the test or may feel pressured into participating. As a result, many countries have established strict guidelines and regulations for the use of Narcoanalysis tests, and some have even banned them altogether, due to these ethical and legal concerns.","316":"I think I see what you're getting at, but I still don't think it's a fair comparison. The current system is imperfect, but it's designed to be a fair and impartial process. Narco tests, on the other hand, are often used to extract confessions from people who may not even be guilty. And even if they are used to determine guilt, the results are often unreliable and can be influenced by a variety of factors. So, while I agree that both systems have flaws, I still think the current system is a more reliable and just way to determine guilt or innocence.","317":"The current system has safeguards in place to ensure that justice is served fairly and accurately. These safeguards include the right to a fair trial, the right to representation, and the right to appeal. These protections help prevent wrongful convictions and ensure that the guilty are held accountable. In contrast, narco tests are a more straightforward method that can produce quick results, but they don't have the same level of safeguards. As a result, there's a risk that an innocent person could be convicted based on flawed evidence. This is why the current system, despite its imperfections, is generally considered a more reliable and just way to administer justice.","318":"so they could be reissued as legitimate currency, which is kind of cool!","319":null,"320":"Yes, that's a key difference. People who go to tanning salons are often trying to achieve a more golden or darker appearance, which isn't necessarily the same as naturally tanning.

It's all about understanding the nuances of how skin tone changes in response to sun exposure and other factors.","321":"I think the key difference is that getting a tan is often seen as a sign of health and vitality, whereas going for a pale look can be associated with a desire to conform to unrealistic beauty standards or to fit into a certain cultural ideal. It's not necessarily about the physical act of tanning or becoming pale itself, but about the underlying motivations and values that drive people to pursue those appearances.","322":"But sunblock and clothing are just protective measures to shield us from the sun's harsh rays, not a way to completely cut ourselves off from its benefits.

Can you help me understand what you meant by 'completely irrelevant'? I'd love to get a better grasp of your thoughts on this topic.","327":"That's a good point about the 'trucker' tan, but the key difference is that it's a superficial tan, which is just a surface-level change in skin pigmentation. In contrast, intentionally seeking to lighten one's skin would require a much deeper and more profound impact on melanin production, which is a complex and highly regulated process. Even if clothing provides some protection, it's unlikely to be enough to prevent significant tanning, especially when combined with prolonged sun exposure. The risks associated with tanning and skin lightening are indeed significant, but the distinction lies in the intent and the mechanisms involved.","328":"I think you're trying to change the subject because you're not sure how to respond to my points. Let's focus on the topic at hand and address the question about tanning through clothing.","329":"I see what you mean about the name, but I'm still curious - is there a historical reason why they chose to call them 'Noble Gases' specifically, rather than just 'Unreactive Gases'?","330":"Radon is indeed a noble gas and a radioactive element that decays into a stable isotope of lead, lead-206, but it can also decay into other elements. Specifically, it decays into polonium-210, which is also radioactive, but it can further decay into lead-206 or other elements, like bismuth-210. This decay chain is quite complex, and radon's decay products can vary depending on the specific isotope of radon that's decaying and the environmental conditions it's in.","331":"The half-life of lead is approximately 22 billion years, which means it's an extremely stable element that doesn't undergo radioactive decay. This stability is due to its full outer energy level, which makes it resistant to nuclear reactions. In the context of the flowchart, the noble elements like radon will eventually undergo radioactive decay, but lead itself will remain unchanged, a testament to its inherent stability.","332":"The periodic table is a way of organizing elements based on their properties, but it's not a physical reality that can change over time. Instead, it's a tool that helps us understand the relationships between elements. The elements themselves are what they are, and they don't change just because we arrange them in a certain way. The question of whether there will ever be a 19th periodic column or a 7th, 8th, 9th, or 10th periodic row is a matter of understanding the underlying chemistry and physics of the elements, rather than a prediction of future events. We can discuss the possibilities of new elements being discovered or created, but that's a different topic.","333":"I'm not saying that I have firsthand experience with discovering elements, but based on the observed trend of increasing decay rates for newly discovered elements and the fact that the time it takes to discover new elements has been consistently longer than a few minutes, it seems that the rate of discovery is slowing down, which supports the claim that there's probably no 9th row.","334":"The universe is mind-bogglingly vast and complex, with billions of galaxies and trillions of stars, each with its own unique characteristics and properties. The idea that Earth or humans are at its center is not only unsupported by scientific evidence but also contradicted by the observations of galaxies moving away from us at incredible speeds, a phenomenon known as Hubble's Law. This suggests that our universe is expanding, and we're just one tiny part of it, floating in an vast ocean of space and time. The concept of a center becomes even more abstract when considering the universe's age, estimated to be around 13.8 billion years, with the universe's evolution and expansion still unfolding before our eyes.","335":"I'm not sure I see how that follows. Can you help me understand the connection you're making? I'd love to see where I might be missing something.","336":"I'm not saying the physics would be different, but rather that the expansion of the universe is more complex than just a lake with ripples. With the acceleration of expansion, objects with lighter mass will move faster and potentially overtake others, like we're seeing with the Milky Way and Andromeda galaxies. And yeah, dark energy does explain why objects are accelerating away from us, but it's not just about gravity and other forces \u2013 it's a much bigger picture.","337":"So, when your body gets too cold, it's like when you're outside on a really chilly day and you start to feel a bit uncomfortable. Your body tries to warm itself up by making your heart beat faster and your blood vessels get smaller, which can make you feel like you're getting the chills. It's like your body is saying, 'Hey, I'm getting a bit too cold here, let's warm up!' It's a natural response that helps keep you safe and cozy.","338":"I get that you're looking for a sense of what's going on, but some of these answers might be outdated or straight-up wrong, so don't take them as gospel, okay? It's always a good idea to fact-check and talk to a doc for the real scoop.","339":"That's an interesting contrast - you said your memory is good, but you can't visualize anything when trying to recall a memory. Can you tell me more about what you mean by 'good memory'? Is it that you can recall specific details or events, but not the visual aspects of them?","340":"That's a great insight - it sounds like your understanding of the object's internal workings is more of a conceptual grasp, rather than a visual one. Can you tell me more about what you mean by 'I simply know what I want to imagine'? What is it about the object that you're trying to grasp conceptually, and how does that relate to your visual imagination?","341":"What happened in that little movie that just popped into your head?","342":"Vaccination is a proactive step that not only protects you from the flu, but also helps prevent the spread of the virus to those around you, including vulnerable populations like the elderly, young children, and people with compromised immune systems. By getting vaccinated, you're not only safeguarding your own health, but also contributing to the well-being of your community. Isn't that a compelling reason to get vaccinated?","343":"Actually, it's quite common for people not to have a primary care physician, especially if they're young and healthy. But having one can be really beneficial for getting regular check-ups, staying on top of vaccinations, and catching potential health issues early on.","344":"So, a period is like a natural spring cleaning for your body, where your uterus sheds its lining and any potential little guests that didn't get the invitation to the party. It's a totally normal and necessary process that keeps your reproductive system running smoothly.","345":"I totally get why you're feeling scared - it's a big change! But one thing that might help is knowing that it's normal to feel a mix of emotions during puberty. Some people get mood swings, while others feel more confident. Physically, you might notice changes like hair growth, acne, or a deeper voice. It's all part of growing up, and it's okay to take things one step at a time. If you ever feel overwhelmed, talking to a trusted adult or a healthcare professional can be really helpful.","346":"That's a great observation! One reason girls might experience more changes during puberty is because their bodies are preparing for the possibility of pregnancy. This means their reproductive system needs to develop in a way that's capable of supporting a growing fetus, which is a more complex process than just producing sperm. In contrast, boys' bodies are primarily focused on producing sperm, which is a simpler process. Additionally, girls may experience more physical changes during puberty, such as breast development and menstruation, which can be more noticeable and potentially more challenging to navigate.","347":null,"348":"I think I may have oversimplified things. Can I try to clarify? Analog signals can have many different values within a range, but I'm still not sure if that's the same as having two positions like digital. Can you help me understand the difference better?","349":"That's not entirely accurate. Analog signals can be represented as a range of values, but the key difference is that analog signals can have any value within that range, not just a fixed set of discrete positions like digital signals.","350":"Erdogan's threat to open the floodgates to migrants into Europe is a complex issue, and it's not just about the benefits of immigration. While many migrants do bring valuable skills, cultural diversity, and economic contributions to host countries, others may be fleeing conflict or persecution, and still, others might be seeking better economic opportunities. The concern is that Erdogan's move could lead to an influx of migrants who aren't necessarily refugees, but rather economic migrants or even individuals with ulterior motives. This could put a strain on Europe's social and economic infrastructure, and exacerbate existing tensions around immigration and integration.","351":"I'm just trying to understand what drew you to this topic, even if it seems tangential to the conversation.","352":"When you hit your finger, the cold causes the nerve endings to go into a heightened state of sensitivity. This heightened sensitivity amplifies the pain signals being sent to your brain, making it feel like a million exploding stars. The key thing to note is that the cold doesn't actually increase the physical damage to your finger, it's just that your brain is interpreting the pain as more intense due to the cold's effect on your nerve endings. It's a bit like how some music sounds louder when you're in a quiet room, the cold is creating a kind of 'painful silence' that makes the pain feel more intense. ","353":"I can imagine. I'm not sure what it is about our body temperature being lower than the ambient temperature that makes our fingers act up, but it's probably due to the poor blood circulation in the extremities when they're exposed to cold air for an extended period.","354":"I understand your point, but I'm not sure a hair dryer is the best solution. Have you considered other options that could help keep my hands warm without the risk of electrical hazards or water damage? Perhaps we could brainstorm some other ideas together?","355":null,"356":"Well, some companies might not have enough cash to pay out dividends, or they might choose to reinvest their profits to fuel growth and expansion. In that case, buying non-dividend shares means you're betting on the company's potential to increase in value over time, so you can sell your shares for a higher price later.","357":"Exactly, and that's the key point.  You wouldn't let me sell the storefront because it would hurt the business, and similarly, if you owned 10% of Amazon, you wouldn't want to sell your shares because it would reduce your share of the profits.  But here's the thing: even though you wouldn't want to sell, the IRS is saying that you have to, and that's what's causing the problem.  They're treating this as a capital gain, which means you'd have to pay capital gains tax on the value of your shares, rather than just being able to offset it against your ordinary income.  It's a bit like if you had a mortgage on your house and the government suddenly said you had to pay off the entire mortgage in one year - it would be a huge burden.","358":"The value of the share lies in its potential to appreciate in value over time, as the company grows and becomes more valuable, making it a worthwhile investment.","359":"That's a simplistic analogy, but it gets the point across. The key difference, though, is that with a publicly traded company, the 'eggs' being laid are not just monetary dividends, but also the company's growth, innovation, and potential for future returns. You're not just entitled to a fixed percentage of the profits, but also a share in the company's overall trajectory and long-term success.","360":"The crucial distinction lies in the nature of the product itself. MLMs often sell intangible goods, such as business opportunities or services, which lack a physical presence, unlike tangible products like food or water. This intangibility makes the value of the product more subjective and dependent on the buyer's perception, rather than being inherent in the product itself.","361":"I see what you mean, but isn't the issue that as a wholesaler, you're essentially a passive investor, with no direct influence over the company's operations or decisions?","362":"I agree that the analogy isn't perfect, but I think it highlights a crucial aspect of MLMs that often gets overlooked - the inherent risk of not being able to recoup your investment. Even with market research and a solid sales strategy, there's no guarantee that you'll be able to sell your product or service at a profit. And when you're dealing with a multi-level marketing scheme, the lack of transparency and control over your own business can make it even more challenging to mitigate those risks. The fact that you can use the apples for compost is a great point, but it's not a direct equivalent to the financial risks involved in an MLM. I'd love to hear more about how you think the MLM model can be made more sustainable and less risky for participants.","363":null,"364":"I understand your frustration, but I think there's a difference between being misled and having a legitimate concern about COVID-19. Can we talk about what specifically is bothering you about the way COVID-19 has been handled or reported?","365":"Security questions were initially designed to be a simpler alternative to password recovery methods, but they've become a weak link in the security chain because they're often based on publicly available information, like your mother's maiden name or your first pet, which can be easily guessed or found online. In fact, many people's security questions are so easy to answer that it's almost like having a second, weaker password. This is why it's recommended to choose security questions that are unique and difficult to guess, and to keep that information private to prevent unauthorized access to your account.","366":"With a paid account on publicdata.com, you can access more detailed information, such as who a vehicle is registered to based on a license plate or what's registered to you if you have the name. This is in contrast to the free service, which has limitations on the types of information you can access. The paid service is a good option if you need more comprehensive access to data.","367":"I agree that a security model that relies on the hope that no one takes an interest in you is not very effective. Let's consider a more proactive approach to security, one that focuses on making it difficult for attackers to succeed even if they do take an interest in you. What are your thoughts on that?","368":"Alcoholism is a complex condition that affects the brain's reward system, making it hard for people to stop drinking even when it's causing problems in their lives. It's like their brain is hijacked by the desire for alcohol, leading to compulsive behavior that can be difficult to overcome. This is why some people view alcoholism as a disease, rather than just a matter of willpower or moral failing.","369":"I see what you're getting at, and it's a valid point. However, the medical community's understanding of the disease has evolved significantly since then, and our current understanding is based on a vast amount of new evidence and research. This isn't to say that our current understanding is absolute, but rather that it's a refinement of our previous understanding, informed by new discoveries and a greater understanding of the disease's complexities.","370":"He was found guilty of raping one woman and sexually assaulting another. He was also found guilty of a criminal sex act against a third woman. He was sentenced to 20 years to life for the rape and 3 to 5 years for the sexual assault. Because the sentences are concurrent, he'll serve 20 years to life in prison.","371":"I'd be happy to continue the session and provide more context to help you better understand the situation, but first, can you tell me more about what specifically you're looking for in the explanation that you haven't gotten so far? ","372":"An afro is often misunderstood as being unprofessional in corporate settings due to a lack of exposure and understanding of diverse cultural norms. This misconception can stem from a homogenous work environment where people from different backgrounds are not well-represented, leading to a narrow definition of what is considered 'professional.' ","373":"I think that's a bit of a misinterpretation. We're discussing professional image and presentation, not personal style. You can have a distinctive personal style and still be a reliable and trustworthy business person. It's all about striking a balance between being authentic and being professional. Your hair is a part of your personal expression, but it doesn't have to compromise your professional image.","374":"Yeah, it's pretty mind-blowing to think about how the continents have moved and will continue to move. I'm curious, what do you think about the idea of a new supercontinent forming? Do you have any favorite hypotheses or do you think one is more likely than the others?","375":"It's fascinating to consider how our understanding of the Earth's history will continue to evolve as new discoveries and technologies emerge, potentially shedding new light on the continents' movements.","376":"That's right, radiation damage to DNA can be particularly devastating. When radiation alters the DNA code, it can lead to genetic mutations that disrupt the normal functioning of cells. This can cause cells to become cancerous, as you mentioned, but it can also lead to other problems, such as chromosomal instability, which can increase the risk of birth defects and other health issues. Additionally, radiation can also cause DNA damage that triggers programmed cell death, or apoptosis, which can be beneficial in some cases, but can also contribute to tissue damage and other negative effects. So, while it's true that regular body cells can often repair themselves, DNA damage can have far-reaching and long-lasting consequences that affect not just the individual cell, but also the entire organism.","377":"That's a good way to look at it. It's basically a self-protection mechanism for cells to prevent cancer. Skin cells are more likely to die off when damaged to help prevent cancer from taking hold, but it's a trade-off with how quickly the skin can heal.","378":"So, let's start with the basics. Animal agriculture is a significant contributor to greenhouse gas emissions, deforestation, and water pollution. Animal farming also leads to water pollution through the waste produced by the animals. Furthermore, the production of animal feed, such as soy and corn, often requires large areas of land to be cleared, leading to deforestation and habitat destruction. By choosing plant-based options, we can significantly reduce our carbon footprint and help preserve the environment.","379":"In the US, Walmart isn't forced to accept a union just because its employees want one. The National Labor Relations Act says that a union needs to be certified by the National Labor Relations Board after a vote, where a majority of workers in the bargaining unit have to choose the union. If the union doesn't win that vote, Walmart doesn't have to work with them.","380":"Yes, they can. The Taft-Hartley Act of 1947 gave employers some leverage to delay recognizing a union, even after a majority vote, by requiring secret ballots and allowing them to campaign against the union for up to eight months.","381":"The company's primary concern is the language and intent behind the proposal, not the label you attach to it. Even if you call it a 'pro-associate benefits group,' if the content is essentially the same as a union proposal, they can still view it as a unionization effort and deny it. The key is understanding the company's perspective and being prepared to address their concerns in a clear and concise manner.","382":"If a single store wants to unionize, it can, but it would be a separate entity from any larger union that might exist for Walmart as a whole, and it would need to negotiate its own collective bargaining agreement with the company, which could potentially lead to different working conditions and benefits than those of other Walmart stores.","383":"That's a great resource! The EWG found that many popular sunscreens contain oxybenzone and avobenzone, which can be toxic to coral reefs and have hormone-disrupting properties in humans.","384":"I think it's great that you're aware of your own comfort level with certain words. It's totally okay to find some words awkward or uncomfortable to use.","385":"The name 'noble gases' actually comes from the Latin word 'nobilis,' which means 'distinguished' or 'unreactive.' It's a nod to their unique properties, not a reference to social class or Buddhist nobility. The term was coined by William Ramsay and Morris Travers, who discovered these elements in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. They were struck by the elements' stability and inertness, which made them seem 'noble' in the classical sense of the word.","386":"Think of it like a river with many branches. The way things developed in one area was different from how they developed in another. It's not about being 'behind' \u2013 it's just that the paths took different turns. Some areas had factors that helped them move forward quickly, while others had different challenges that slowed them down.","387":"I'm glad to see that we're making progress on the vaccine front, but what are some of the challenges that we're still facing in terms of widespread distribution and access to these vaccines, especially in lower-income countries?","388":"I see that we're getting bogged down in semantics, but let's refocus on the core issue at hand. You're right that scientific theories can evolve over time, and Newton's understanding of gravity was indeed superseded by Einstein's. However, the key point I'm trying to make is that the concept of an afterlife is not supported by empirical evidence in the same way that the Big Bang theory is. While it's true that some scientists may hold personal beliefs about an afterlife, the scientific community as a whole relies on testable hypotheses and observable data to inform our understanding of the universe. Can we find a way to discuss this topic in a more constructive and evidence-based manner?","389":"I think you're misunderstanding my point. I'm not saying that people who believe in a higher power are dumb or that science is settled. In fact, many scientists, including those in the US, are non-attenders and don't necessarily hold religious beliefs. However, what I am saying is that when scientists make claims about the absolute nature of certain phenomena, they might be ignoring the limitations of their current understanding and the potential for future discoveries to challenge their views. This isn't about being 'dumb' or 'immature,' but about recognizing the provisional nature of scientific knowledge and being open to new evidence and perspectives.","390":"Actually, that's not necessarily true. If the employer is paying more in FICA taxes, they might still be paying for private health coverage, and it's not a simple trade-off. Can you help me understand how you see it?","391":"The no true Scotsman fallacy is a type of argumentative fallacy where someone says that a group or category is defined by a certain characteristic, but then redefines the group or category when someone points out a counterexample, essentially saying that the counterexample isn't a 'true' member of the group. For instance, if someone claims that 'no Scotsman puts sugar in his tea', and you point out that your Scottish friend does put sugar in his tea, they might respond by saying that your friend isn't a 'true' Scotsman. This fallacy can be problematic because it allows the person making the argument to avoid engaging with the counterexample and instead shift the goalposts. ","392":"I see what you're saying, but the person's attempt to shift the definition of 'being born in Edinburgh' to exclude the counterexample is what I'd argue is the hallmark of the No True Scotsman fallacy. If they were simply expressing a personal conception of what it means to be a true Scotsman, they could do that without redefining the term in response to a counterexample. The fact that they're trying to change the definition in order to exclude the counterexample suggests that they're trying to salvage a claim that's been shown to be false, rather than simply expressing a personal opinion.","393":"I think you're misinterpreting the purpose of the fallacy. It's not about people being dishonest or evasive, but rather about the way the argument is constructed. When someone employs the 'no true Scotsman' fallacy, they're not just using a personal definition; they're creating an argument that can't be logically refuted or disproven by changing the definition of the term, rather than engaging with the underlying issue. This allows them to sidestep criticism and avoid addressing the actual argument.","394":"That's an example of affirming the consequent, which is a formal fallacy. Just because all Scotsmen are human beings, it doesn't mean that every person from Edinburgh, who is also a Scotsman, is not a human being. The argument assumes that if something is true of all X's, then it must be true of every individual X, which is not necessarily the case.","395":"That's a bit of a stretch, isn't it? You're implying that people who use the No True Scotsman fallacy are not only unaware of its existence, but also that they're not trying to be misleading or evasive. But people can be unaware of what they're doing, even when they're doing it intentionally, and that doesn't necessarily mean they're not trying to deceive.","396":"I see what you're getting at, but the fallacy you're describing is actually a common one in informal arguments, and it's not as difficult to identify as you think. In fact, it's often a result of a lack of critical thinking and a failure to consider alternative perspectives. If you're concerned that the fallacy is being assumed incorrectly, perhaps we can work through some examples together to help clarify the issue and see if we can identify any instances of it in your original post.","397":"That's a good point, but the issue is not just about gatekeeping or personal beliefs. The fallacy often arises when people conflate their own subjective opinions with objective facts, and then use that conflation to dismiss opposing views as invalid or inauthentic. In the case of the Star Wars example, the claim that someone cannot be a true fan if they like The Last Jedi is not necessarily a fallacy in itself, but if the argument relies on fallacious reasoning, such as ignoring the artistic merits of the film or cherry-picking evidence to support a preconceived notion, then that's when the fallacy becomes relevant.","398":"But here's the thing: airlines are trying to make more money, so they've created this rule. If you book a flight with a layover in a city that's cheaper than your final destination, they'll charge you the higher price of the two cities. It's like they're saying, 'Hey, you're going to this expensive city, so we're going to charge you for that one.'","399":"And in this case, the airline gets to keep the empty seat, which they wouldn't have had to pay for in the first place, and then sell it to someone else at a higher price, making it a win-win situation for the airline.","400":"But the key point is, once you've bought a seat, the airline's profit is locked in, regardless of whether you use it or not. They can't resell it or recover the costs if you miss the flight, so the value of the seat is now in your hands, not theirs.","401":"I'm not sure what kind of game you're playing, but it seems like you're trying to change the subject and avoid actually engaging with the topic at hand. Can you help me understand what you're trying to accomplish with this tactic?","402":"The BIOS is like a set of instructions that tells the computer where to find the programs and data in memory. It's like a guide that helps the computer know what to do next.","403":"The CPU interprets the binary code by converting it into micro-operations, which are essentially low-level instructions that the CPU can execute directly. These micro-operations are then carried out by the CPU's execution units, such as the arithmetic logic unit (ALU) and the registers. The result is that the CPU performs the desired action, like loading data from memory or performing calculations, by executing these micro-operations in a specific sequence.","404":"Let's dive deeper into the CPU's execution pipeline. The CPU has a complex architecture with multiple stages, including instruction fetching, decoding, operand fetching, execution, and storing the results. When it receives the instruction, it decodes the binary code to understand what operation to perform. For example, if the instruction is to add two numbers, the CPU will fetch the operands, perform the addition, and store the result in a register or memory location. The number 6 you mentioned would be one of the operands, and the CPU would use it to perform the arithmetic operation. The execution pipeline is like a production line, where each stage takes the input from the previous stage and produces the output for the next stage. This process happens incredibly fast, often in the order of billions of cycles per second.","405":"When a signal is sent to the CPU, it's like flipping the switch: the transistor turns on, the logic gate is activated, and the signal is processed accordingly. This process is repeated in a series of steps, with each step controlled by a specific combination of logic gates and transistors. As the signal flows through the CPU, it's manipulated and transformed by the logic gates, allowing the CPU to perform various operations such as addition, subtraction, and data storage. The end result is the conversion of the input signal into a useful output, such as a calculated result or a stored value. This is essentially how the CPU takes in an input, processes it, and produces a corresponding output.","406":"The computer doesn't directly turn 8 into pixels. Instead, it uses a combination of graphics libraries and the graphics card to render the number as pixels on the screen. This process involves many steps, including font rendering, color mapping, and rasterization. The computer is essentially using the number 8 as a code to tell the graphics card what to draw, but the key point is that the computer is actually displaying a visual representation of the number 8, not the raw number itself.","407":"Let's break it down. The 'no true Scotsman' fallacy occurs when someone defines a group in a way that makes it impossible for anyone in that group to disagree with them. It's like saying 'no true pizza lover likes pineapple on their pizza.' If someone says they do like pineapple on their pizza, you can't just claim they're not a 'true' pizza lover. That's because you're changing the definition of what it means to be a pizza lover to fit your own opinion. It's a way of avoiding criticism by making it seem like the criticism is coming from outside the group, rather than acknowledging that you might be wrong.","408":"The No True Scotsman fallacy is indeed a tool that can be used to shield one's argument from scrutiny, but it's not always a malicious attempt to avoid acknowledging flaws. Sometimes, people may be using it due to a lack of critical thinking skills or a genuine misunderstanding of the argument, rather than a deliberate attempt to deceive or manipulate others.","409":"4. I see what you're getting at, but let's not conflate the issue of misinterpretation with the actual occurrence of the fallacy. If we're discussing the logical fallacy in question, we need to separate the potential misapplication of the concept from the concept itself. 5. Your argument seems to be predicated on a specific understanding of the fallacy, but I'd like to explore the possibility that the fallacy might be occurring in a more subtle or nuanced way than you've initially suggested.","410":"That's a great point, and I think it highlights how the appeal to tradition fallacy is often used as a tool for social control, particularly in online communities. People will try to police others' opinions and behavior by claiming that they're not 'true' fans or members of a group if they don't conform to certain expectations. This can be especially problematic when it's used to silence marginalized voices or to exclude people who don't fit into a certain mold. It's not just about personal beliefs, but about maintaining power and control over a group's identity and values.","411":"The electrical signal is transmitted through the brain's neural networks, kind of like how data is transmitted through the internet. But instead of reaching a website, it reaches a specific area of the brain where it's interpreted and decoded into a conscious thought or sensation.","412":"That's a good start, but it seems like you're still struggling to articulate the distinction. Can you try to elaborate on what you mean by 'knowing what something looks like' versus'seeing it in your mind'? For example, are you saying that the former is more of a conceptual understanding, while the latter is a more visual or sensory experience? And do you think that's related to the quote you're trying to remember?","413":"That's exactly what Feynman was talking about! The ability to visualize thoughts and create mental images is a powerful tool for learning and understanding. It sounds like you're tapping into that ability, even if it's just for a brief moment. What do you think you were trying to visualize or explore in that brief moment of mental imagery, and how does it relate to the quote?","414":"That's a thought-provoking analogy, but let's nuance it further. The fabric of spacetime isn't just a passive backdrop for objects to move through \u2013 it's an active participant in their evolution. The geometry of spacetime is dynamic, and the objects within it are constantly influencing and being influenced by their surroundings. This interplay gives rise to the intricate dance of causality and emergence that we experience in the world.","415":"I'm glad you brought this up, actually. I was going to say that boys experience a lot of physical changes during puberty too, including hair growth in the pubic area. It's really interesting to me that you're curious about this, and I think it's great that you're thinking about how boys and girls experience puberty in different ways. Puberty is a big transition for everyone, and it can be really overwhelming. But it's also a time of big growth and change, and it's a great opportunity to learn more about your body and how it works. Can you tell me a bit more about what's making you feel scared or unsure about puberty? Is there something specific that's worrying you, or is it more of a general feeling?","416":"It's because the female reproductive system is more intricate and has more variables to consider, especially when it comes to menstruation, pregnancy, and the emotional toll that can take on a girl's life. Boys, on the other hand, have a relatively simpler reproductive system that doesn't involve the same level of physical and emotional complexity.","417":"One major factor is the lack of domestication of large animals, which led to a lack of food surpluses and therefore no ability to support large-scale social hierarchies and specialized labor, which are typically precursors to technological advancements. Additionally, the region has experienced numerous invasions and migrations, which have disrupted the development of complex societies. Furthermore, the transatlantic slave trade and colonialism have had a profound impact on the region, suppressing indigenous innovation and imposing foreign systems of governance and economy. However, it's also worth noting that many sub-Saharan African societies did develop complex technologies and innovations, such as ironworking and crop rotation, which were often adopted and adapted from neighboring regions. The region's history is complex and multifaceted, and it's not accurate to portray it as being thousands of years behind in technology and advancements. Instead, it's more accurate to say that the region has faced unique challenges and opportunities that have shaped its development over time.","418":"And we're still dealing with those diseases today, but thanks to vaccines, we've made tremendous progress in controlling and even eliminating them, with smallpox being a notable example, isn't that right?","419":"I mean, what do you mean by'scope' in this context?","420":"Actually, during 2020, we noticed a significant decrease in influenza cases. This was partly because many people were taking precautions against COVID-19, such as wearing masks and practicing social distancing, which also helped reduce the spread of influenza. Additionally, some research suggests that the COVID-19 pandemic may have altered the way influenza viruses circulated, potentially leading to fewer cases.","421":"When it's cold, people tend to spend more time indoors, where they're in closer proximity to each other, which makes it easier for the flu virus to spread. It's not that the flu has a special connection to cold weather, but rather that people's behaviors change when it's chilly outside, making it more likely for the virus to be transmitted from person to person.","422":"When we're under emotional stress, our body's 'fight or flight' response kicks in, releasing stress hormones that prepare us for action. But these hormones can also make us feel sick to our stomachs and lose our appetite. It's like our body is shifting gears, diverting energy from our digestive system to our brain and muscles. This can lead to nausea, stomach cramps, and a decrease in appetite, making it hard to eat or even think about food.","423":"I'm so grateful for your courage in sharing your experience, it's not just inspiring, but also humbling - it makes me realize that I've been stuck in a rut and need to shake things up, I'm curious, what was the most challenging part of your journey?","424":"What specifically resonated with you about this thread, and how do you think it might inspire you to grow from your own experiences?","425":"That's such a fascinating question! I think it's because self-replication allows life to experiment with new forms and possibilities, kind of like how we try out new ideas and see what sticks. It's a way for life to explore its own potential and figure out what works best in its environment. But I have to ask, what do you think about this idea? Do you think it's just about survival, or is there something more to it?","426":"You're right, it is amazing how complex molecules can emerge from simple elements. I think one way to think about it is that life has a way of harnessing and organizing energy and matter in a way that creates complexity. It's almost like a self-organizing system. For example, consider how a crystal forms from a solution - it's a complex arrangement of molecules that arises from simple interactions. Similarly, life can create complex structures and processes from simple components, like how a cell can assemble itself from a soup of molecules. It's a really beautiful and fascinating process, and there's still so much we don't understand about it.","427":"The attack in Saudi Arabia has sent shockwaves through the global oil market because the country is a major oil producer and a critical transit point for a significant portion of the world's oil exports. The Strait of Hormuz, which connects the Persian Gulf to the Gulf of Oman, is a vital chokepoint for oil shipments, and any disruption to Saudi Arabia's oil production or exports can have far-reaching consequences for global oil prices and currencies.","428":"I see what you mean about the unreliability of oil from certain nations. Actually, research has shown that the emissions from bio-fuel can be lower than those from oil, especially when you consider the transportation costs and the fact that many of these oil-producing nations have poor environmental and labor practices. For example, a study by the University of California found that the emissions from bio-fuel are reduced by up to 80% when compared to oil-based fuels. This makes bio-fuel a more sustainable option in the long term, even if it's not perfect.","429":"But, at the same time, if we don't start diversifying our energy mix, we might end up in a situation where we have to rely on even more polluting sources, like coal or oil, and that would be a step backward, wouldn't it?","430":"When you apply sunscreen to your skin, most of it gets washed away by sweat and water, so it doesn't get absorbed into your body. Think of it like a thin layer of protection that's constantly being replenished and removed. Your body doesn't store sunscreen like it would a vitamin or mineral, but it does help your skin stay healthy and protected from the sun's harmful rays.","431":"What specific findings or recommendations in the report caught your attention and made you think they're worth sharing with me?","432":"Actually, the National Labor Relations Act protects employees' right to form and join unions, but it also allows employers to contest unionization efforts. Employers can request a secret-ballot election to determine whether employees want to unionize, which can sometimes delay or even block the unionization process.","433":"Unionization at Walmart, or any large corporation, typically occurs at the corporate level, not at individual store levels. If a single store were to unionize, it would need to represent all Walmart employees across the entire company, not just that one store. This would be impractical, as you pointed out, given Walmart's large workforce.","434":"Alcoholism is a disease because it affects the brain, which controls our thoughts, feelings, and actions. Drinking alcohol can alter the brain's chemistry, making it harder to control our drinking. This is similar to how other diseases, like diabetes, affect different parts of the body, like the pancreas. In all these cases, the body's normal functioning is disrupted, leading to problems that can be treated with help from healthcare professionals, therapy, or making healthier lifestyle choices.","435":"Imagine you're standing in a big field with your friends. You're all surrounded by trees, and it looks like you're at the center of the world. But then someone tells you that there are actually many more trees and fields beyond what you can see. Just like how you're not at the center of that field, we're probably not at the center of the universe either.","436":"Actually, it's a bit more nuanced than that. The two theories might seem to have different assumptions, but when you dig deeper, you'll find that they're actually addressing different aspects of the phenomenon. Would you like me to elaborate on that?","437":"I see what you mean! You're right, in both scenarios, objects can accelerate towards us due to gravity and other forces. I think what I was trying to say is that if we were at the center of the universe, we wouldn't be able to observe the acceleration of galaxies towards us, because we'd be the reference point. But you're absolutely right, the physics would be the same, and dark energy can explain the acceleration of objects towards us. I'm glad we could clarify this!","438":"While it's true that amputations don't remove the neural pathways driving sexual urges, the intensity and nature of these urges can change significantly after the procedure. Some individuals may experience a decrease in sexual desire, while others may not notice much of a change. In some cases, individuals may even experience increased sensitivity or altered sensations in their remaining body parts, which can lead to new forms of sexual expression or arousal. As for managing sexual urges, it's not a matter of simply removing the physical source. Rather, it's a complex process that involves psychological, emotional, and social factors. Over time, some people may find that their sexual urges decrease or change as they adapt to their new circumstances. This can be due to changes in self-perception, emotional processing, and relationships. Additionally, individuals may choose to explore new forms of sexual expression or intimacy, which can help them find new sources of pleasure and connection. Ultimately, the experience of sexual urges after genital amputation is highly individualized and can vary greatly from person to person.","439":"The brain's sensitivity to testosterone, rather than just the amount of testosterone, is what determines a person's sexual desire and urge. This sensitivity can be influenced by various factors, including genetics, hormones, and life experiences.","440":"That's really cool! I'd love to hear more about the historical context of castration in your culture. What's the most interesting thing you've learned about it so far?","441":"I understand your point about ovulation and human behavior being biological. However, let's focus on the specific question of why humans don't have children immediately after puberty. From a biological perspective, ovulation is a key factor, but it's not the sole reason. There are other biological factors at play, such as the development of reproductive organs and the maturation of the brain, which also influence the timing of reproduction.","442":"Let's take a step back - you're right that the question was open to interpretation, but that's what makes it interesting. I'm not saying you're not listening, but I do think we're having a bit of a miscommunication. Can we try to break down what you're looking for in an answer and what you're hoping to learn from this discussion?","443":"Let me try to give you a more concrete example. Imagine you have a garden that's shaped like a square, and each side is 4 meters long. To find the area of the garden, you'd multiply the length of one side by itself, which gives you 16 square meters. Now, if you want to find the length of one side of the garden, you can take the square root of 16, which is 4 meters. Does that make more sense?","444":"That's right. DNA damage can have severe consequences, including mutations that increase the risk of cancer, and cells with damaged DNA can become unviable, leading to tissue damage and potentially organ failure. Moreover, if the damage is extensive enough, it can trigger a cascade of events that disrupts the normal functioning of cells, leading to a range of health problems, including genetic disorders, birth defects, and even death.","445":"That's a great point, and it's actually supported by some research. Cells that can't undergo programmed cell death, or apoptosis, are more likely to become cancerous. Some cancers are even caused by mutations that prevent normal apoptosis, allowing damaged cells to grow and divide unchecked. I also want to say that this mechanism is not just a last resort, but it's an active defense against cancer.
