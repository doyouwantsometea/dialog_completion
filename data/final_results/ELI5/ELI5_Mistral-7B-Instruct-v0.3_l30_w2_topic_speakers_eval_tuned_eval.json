You relearn whenever you get a new car and has to get used to how it feels - especially if it uses a different engine type, for example switching to diesel (or back) requires you to completely relearn how a car should feel.

This program showed that compared to the rest of the country alaska had reduced the cost of the average item for a household following implementation with a steady rise flowing that arose from inflation. Notably this inflation continued at a rate in line with the rest of the country meaning costs are still slightly lower in alaska than the nation at large. It was also interesting, as alaska in this time saw no significant change to full time workers as a proportion of the population but an increase in part time workers. This implies that those with good jobs were not leaving their jobs but those without were getting new ones that were mostly part time.","7":"You know, I almost included this in the last post but I decided not to include it to keep it simple.  The turbine is designed to bring the gas to supersonic speeds.  If we look at the conservation of energy, the gas needs to cool down to actually do this.  So a gas that's hotter can go faster in the turbine and faster velocities allow for more power to be generated.","8":"Look up \u201cisotopes of helium\u201d, \u201cisotopes of neon\u201d etc. on Wikipedia and there will be a section labelled \u201clist of isotopes\u201d which shows you a lot of information including what isotopes they decay into if they\u2019re radioactive.   No, noble gasses are not turning into a 19th column. what makes you think that?   Yes, hydrogen-1 will _never_ undergo radioactive decay.

It was just a hypocritical comment, I\u2019m not lambasting you because you may have spent money on something years ago.

If workers follow the proper laws and procedures and vote to unionize, a company can't just say \"no\" and send the cops to slaughter everyone like they used to.

In general they take deposits from individuals and make loans, as well as offering services like credit cards.   Investment banking works more with the markets directly relating to financial securities (stocks, bonds, derivatives, etc) and financial advisory services. But investment banks do not take deposits.   Want to have your company go public and be listed on a stock exchange? The can determine a listing price and distribution. Need to issue $10B in bonds, they can partner with other firms to create the terms and get them sold. Want to merge with another company? They help with due diligence and the terms and the funding (loans, stock conversions, etc.).  Traditionally (at least since the 1933 Glass\u2013Steagall legislation) these were separate institutions. Many banks collapsed (for instance) when they used deposits to speculate on the markets. These functions are still separate but can be housed in one corporation. And most investment banks chose or were pressured to become commercial banks (at least from a regulatory perspective) after the crisis of 2008.","23":"Keep in mind that commercial banks and investment banks now often coexist under one holding company.  Also, the concept of Broker-Dealer is important from a regulatory perspective.   wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Broker-dealer  Regulation is a whole other ball of wax (Chinese Walls!).","24":"Try this.

Well, for starters you're leaving a bunch of acceleration on the table by   &gt; skipping gears  And not using the peak of your power curve as much as you could be.   If you're consistently skipping the same gear that'll sacrifice a bit of longevity, though whether you'll keep the car long enough to need it is another question.   Fuel efficiency is definitely improved by using the bottom of your rev range, without going too low, which is literally impossible to judge accurately by feel for most people - though if you have perfect pitch that's not necessarily a concern.","26":"They \u201cget away\u201d with it because they\u2019re not doing anything illegal.

Because religious people like to think no one should ever enjoy sex, so someone who's whole job is doing sexy fun stuff is inherently an evil tempting influence.

For 1080p, thats 1920 x 1080 pixels x 3 numbers x 60 frames per second=373,248,000 numbers per second, or in more familiar units 3.73 MegaBytes per Second. That's what a MegaByte *is* 1 million 8bit numbers. Considering most PCs today have GigaBytes of memory and Terabytes of storage--1000 and 1million times larger respectively--video display isn't that taxing.  The monitor ultimately just turns lights on and off. The final number goes to each red\/green\/blue subpixel and controls a power supply, regulating how much voltage it puts out, which ultimately controls how much light is allowed through or blocked.","30":"Digital devices are designed to produce 1 of only 2 states ON and OFF. These are meant to be completely distinct, with no in between.  Analog devices still use transistors, but they allow for many shades of grey between 0 current an maximum current.   Transistors work like switches, with current flowing from the Source to the Drain, controlled by the Gate. This lets a tiny voltage at the Gate control a much larger current, like how a tiny valve can completely shut off a pipe.   Digital devices are designed to only have their gate ON or OFF. Analog devices can take a range of voltages through the gate that gradually turns on the current flowing through the device. This lets a tiny signal be amplified into a much bigger one, wiggling the \"valve\" creates a much stronger wiggle in the current through the \"pipe\", and this can turn the tiny electromagnetic field of a radio wave into something you can hear, with a little external power supplied by something else to drive the main current.","31":"That's right.  Remember there isn't really a real 'black'.  That is just a word we made up for what our brain does.  Pretend humans never developed eyes and we never evolved to have the sense of sight.  We have no idea of color or what things look like or anything.  Light particles are still bouncing around and being reflected off everything, everywhere, but in the case of the vantablack, when light hits that area, it just reflects less light than other surfaces. (less information is being reflected)  Another way to look at it is take a digital camera and point it at the car.  Well there is a sensitive chip in there that is like an eye.  The light hits the chip, and activate certain parts of that chip which the computer makes into an image on the screen.  The vantablack areas did not activate that part of the chip.  So the computer reads the image file and says... No data here!  and then when you look at it on the screen the computer doesn't light up that pixel and you perceive black there.","32":"Vaccinations train your body on how to fight diseases. It basically gives your body the \"I have seen that one before\" power over sickness.  However you need to be kind of healthy to get vaccinated. There are certain conditions under which you cannot receive vaccines (you are very young, your immune system is gone due to birth defects or cancer treatment,. ..).  These people rely on an effect called \"herd immunity\".  Basically you die if you get infected but you never get infected because everyone around you is vaccinated. This prevents a disease from spreading.  Unfortunately to achieve herd immunity roughly 98% of the population have to be vaccinated.  So for me personally as a vaccinated, healthy adult it makes no difference if you are vaccinated or not. For my little daughter or my cancer stricken relative it is a life or death situation (unfortunately quite literally).  Therefore if you are healthy and able to get a shot, go get a shot. It will safe someone's life.  (Kind of the same principle as you clear a lane for an ambulance. Yes it is inconvenient for you for 30 seconds but you help safe a live and you would expect others to do it for you).","33":"Depends on where you come from.

Yes, it is possible to have sex any time during the menstrual cycle *(which usually lasts about 28 days, but can vary several days either way)*.

It's a potential space... the walls usually are touching unless there's a tampon, finger, toy, penis, or baby moving through.          The uterus is kind of pear-shaped, about the size of a fist (depending on the person), and the small part connects to the cervix.","38":"Alright, so H(a,b) is when you describe what H does. You have to call them differently because they're different arguments, even if they could be the same.  H(x,x) is then running that routine with *specific* arguments.

The circular shadow of the Earth has an orientation that depends on what direction is \"down\" to the observer.

At the same time, there is a hemisphere of Earth where you can see the Sun (generally called \"daytime\").  Most of the time, where is an overlap between these two where you can see the Moon during the day (ignoring it's hard ...).  The eclipse is a \"special\" time where the two hemispheres touch at their edges.  As the Sun and Moon move apart, the overlapping section of the Earth in both becomes thinner and longer.  At the eclipse, it's at its thinnest, only minutes long, but it goes all the way around.

Every decision we make is simple based on the state of all our neurons in that specific moment.

Which brings us to an interesting conclusion, if everything can be predicted based on information in the now, can we really have conscious thought? is any decision based on free will? No.  We are the sum of our experiences and genes, nothing more nothing less. We are in a chaotic system where every tiny tiny decision or action from all of the 7billion ish humans on this planet affects every other human on the planet(butterfly effect is very real) This soup of cause and effect creates something that we interpret as free will.  we are a bunch of electrons going back and forth.","51":"OOOH, so bacteriophages are these amazings things.

I have no control over whether or not the grocers will buy them or not. I may end up with rotting apples because i didn't realize that people now hate apples...","53":"Generally, you won't be able to add back to the nucleus without fusion, which requires high energy and generally doesn't work well on elements heavier than iron as putting in more nucleons into such nuclei make them bound less strongly. This is why it is said heavy elements originate in supernovae, normal stars don't have the energy to fuse beyond iron. If the nucleus is unstable enough and gets run into, it can cause it to break apart, which is exploited by nuclear reactors to sustain the controlled fission reactions.","54":"Yes, pretty much. To add to a nucleus, you must overcome the electromagnetic repulsion from the protons enough that the strong force takes over. The strong force is a very short ranged force, unlike electromagnetism, and doesn't follow the inverse square law.","55":"&gt;  \"there must be a better way to generate a list containing all of the numbers, and my initial list wasn't generated optimally.\"   The key is, no matter how you generated the list, how well thought-out it was, since diagonal argument assumes nothing of what's in the list or how it was made, the same argument still proves it's not complete.","56":"Actualy, a vasectomy is not 100% guaranteed to prevent pregnancy, there's a chance for it to fail and for sperm to get through and the woman might still get pregnant.

You can send 5 volts of electricity to any electrical component, what happens when you do that is going to depend on what the component is designed to do (and also depends on whether you're sending AC or DC current).  If you send 5 volts to the digital processor in my example above, it would be interpreted as a 1\/On\/True however you want to represent that. A string of those might represent an instruction or something.  If you send the same 5 volts to a 12 volt analog LED, it might light up with about 40% brightness. Analog doesn't have \"positions\", that's the point.

It's easiest to think of them as waves, but more accurately, they are waves of points.

I\u2019m not sure how much simpler we can make this.","66":"&gt; My point is, I think that whatever amount we dump into the ocean would not matter much because when spread throughout the ocean, the average concentration would be sufficiently low that is does not matter.  My point, and everyone else\u2019s, is that this is just not true.  It would matter.  Fukushima mattered, Chernobyl mattered.    Nuclear waste isn\u2019t the same as a banana.

The idea of having tens of thousands of people try to run a company (each stock holder) would be a surefire way to end any company. Thus, like government, people are appointed to the board based on the majority of stock ownership.   I have no idea how you think just splitting stock would somehow be a solution for that, as every single stock issued dilutes the rest....

No one is forcing you to buy it...","72":"By that definition of mlm, then every wholesaler that sells to walmart, target etc is a mlm. In that case, mlms make the world function......  A ponzi scheme requires there to be an exaggerated or novalue behind the product being bought or sold. If everyone just held their stocks, (thus demand for buying stocks just froze), then people would sell their stocks (potentially liquidating the company) or stock holders would then demand dividends. Either way, there is value behind the product (ownership) being exchanged...

These concepts are stored without the use of either word or image, but are linked to the separate storages of the words and images, so those systems usually fire together.

You purchased some of their shares in 2005. Their employees designed a product called an Iphone, marketed it, made it and sold millions of it and continued to innovate making their company valued at hundreds of billions of dollars because of the money it makes. You own a part of the effort the company put into this. How is this different from you buying a chicken, cooking it and selling it for more? If you sold someone a 25% share of your chicken company, then that person is entitled to 25% of the value of the company. You no longer own 100% of that company. If all you did was sell one chicken, then you need to give that person 25% of the profits from that chicken.

It is simply odd that you make such a huge distinction between dividend and non-dividend paying shares. But you are free to do so. Hopefully if you ever intend to invest, you research the return history of various companies in recent history and validate your belief (dividend etc) against empirical performance.

This is false. The majority think that time is continuous, not chopped up into moments of Planck time.  &gt;Time as we experience it must have existed after the big bang, but at those early moments, only a few Planck time units after the big bang, space was not yet space. It was a massive ball of unimaginable amounts of energy,  This is also false. I'm not even sure what this is supposed to mean.  When you rewind the clock, things get closer and closer together until at some point, the energy is packed together so tightly that spacetime has to be described with quantum mechanics, but there are numerous problems with formulating such a theory.  &gt;I am hope full that when a nuclear clock is finally created (much more accurate than an atomic clock) we may start to unwrap some of the mysteries of time.  A nuclear clock also has nothing to do with the nature of time. It simply allows us to measure time more accurately, though its error will still be many times greater than a Planck time.","100":"This is complicated. It's easiest to think of them as waves, but more accurately, they are waves of points.  The energy is proportional to the frequency of the wave, and resolution is also proportional to the frequency, and so we define the Planck length as the length at which the energy of a photon is high enough to make a black hole.","101":"\"'Whataboutism' is a rhetorical device that involves accusing others of offenses as a way of deflecting attention from one's own deeds.\"  Bringing up that *Android* could do something, when talking about what *Apple* doing, is the most textbook example of whataboutism possible.

So in order to have the government provide the same level of healthcare, it likely will end up costing the government *more* because of how inefficient the government is at these kinds of things, in major part because the government isn't interested in a profit motive, and as a result isn't as interested in cost-savings measures.","103":"&gt;What is the evidence that government inefficiency would make the costs increase.  Government procurement is historically prone to cost overruns, bloat, and inefficiency. You can look at military spending for an example of this.  &gt;It would seem that taking out all of the private insurance middlemen would result in much lower costs.  But in the process, you get rid of the negotiators involved in drug\/treatment cost negotiations, and instead the government will just pay whatever the cost is without thinking about it, again because the government doesn't have significant means to fight for cost savings.  We already have a very similar problem with respect to student loans; the increased cost of college education in the US is largely due to the US government being so willing to pump money into higher education through student loans without any form of price controls or cost incentives.","104":"By that definition of mlm, then every wholesaler that sells to walmart, target etc is a mlm.

This combination makes up the genes.   It wasn't predetermined that this is what would happen.   It evolved that way.  So when the proteins form it does so based on the genes.  This is not the same thing as having it predetermined.  Which is why its not great to call it a code.  A code has an intended purpose.   Additionally the offspring of species don't always copy the DNA correctly from the parents and there is a mutation,  which is how we ultimately get new genes, then new species etc.  In the end it is just chemicals reactions happening.

Which, is in essense selling the partial ownership of those assets. It's not really different than you selling the physical goods yourself. You buy stock (partial ownership of physical goods), then you sell that ownership.","113":"Because the company can either reinvest that money into the company, ideally so the company becomes more valuable. Or, it can pay out dividends. The decision comes from whether the stockholders (in aggregate) think the company can use that money to make the company more valuable than what the stockholder can normally do.   Using you example earlier, if you made hundreds of your blood paintings, you wouldn't be rich, because no one would buy them. It's basic economics at that point, partial ownership of Amazon is more valued than your paintings are.   Amazon continues to expand its services and logistics network with the money it could spend on dividends. If it paid out dividends, it wouldn't be building as many new distribution centers and becoming more valuable to its customers who buy things from amazon. By doing so, it makes amazon ownership more valuable.","114":"&gt;Seems like another innocent man is in jail.  if that's how it seems to you, that's perfectly fine. the earth seems flat to some people, and them being wrong doesn't affect their lives any more than you being wrong will affect yours.","115":"There was no before.

It basically gives your body the \"I have seen that one before\" power over sickness.  However you need to be kind of healthy to get vaccinated. There are certain conditions under which you cannot receive vaccines (you are very young, your immune system is gone due to birth defects or cancer treatment,. ..).  These people rely on an effect called \"herd immunity\".  Basically you die if you get infected but you never get infected because everyone around you is vaccinated. This prevents a disease from spreading.  Unfortunately to achieve herd immunity roughly 98% of the population have to be vaccinated.  So for me personally as a vaccinated, healthy adult it makes no difference if you are vaccinated or not. For my little daughter or my cancer stricken relative it is a life or death situation (unfortunately quite literally).  Therefore if you are healthy and able to get a shot, go get a shot. It will safe someone's life.  (Kind of the same principle as you clear a lane for an ambulance. Yes it is inconvenient for you for 30 seconds but you help safe a live and you would expect others to do it for you).","152":"Depends on where you come from. In Germany you have a general practitioner that is \"your doctor\". It gets documented with your health insurance.  In Norway you get a doctor assigned and are not allowed to go to a different one, except for emergencies (afaik).","153":"You mean pubic hair? Yeah it usually grows in front, on down between the legs and a little bit on the butt hole area. It's just often seen as taboo, so some women shave or wax to get rid of it. But that's her decision to make and its perfectly find to keep it all or remove it all. Shaving and waxing can hurt and cause ingrown hairs which is one reason some may not want to remove the hair.","154":"Now that is a good question... I know I had some sex education in school but it wasn't very good. It's a common problem in schools because people are scared to talk about it. Some of the fear is that it will encourage kids to start having sex early but I think it's important for everyone to know how the body works. Everyone has one, so why hide it?  Kids need to know what is normal and what is not normal, so if there is a problem, they can talk to a doctor. Puberty is scary with everything changing and a lot of people feel shame about it when they shouldn't. I'm glad you're asking questions ahead of time so you're a little more prepared.","155":"It's just how the human body is. \u00af\\_(\u30c4)_\/\u00af Can't do much about it.

You can send 5 volts of electricity to any electrical component, what happens when you do that is going to depend on what the component is designed to do (and also depends on whether you're sending AC or DC current).  If you send 5 volts to the digital processor in my example above, it would be interpreted as a 1\/On\/True however you want to represent that. A string of those might represent an instruction or something.  If you send the same 5 volts to a 12 volt analog LED, it might light up with about 40% brightness. Analog doesn't have \"positions\", that's the point. We measure its voltage level.","158":"Because the board enacts the will of the stock holders, based on stockholder voting. The idea of having tens of thousands of people try to run a company (each stock holder) would be a surefire way to end any company. Thus, like government, people are appointed to the board based on the majority of stock ownership.   I have no idea how you think just splitting stock would somehow be a solution for that, as every single stock issued dilutes the rest....   At the end of the day, if you don't like a company that doesn't pay dividends, don't buy their stock. No one is forcing you to buy it...","159":"By that definition of mlm, then every wholesaler that sells to walmart, target etc is a mlm. In that case, mlms make the world function......  A ponzi scheme requires there to be an exaggerated or novalue behind the product being bought or sold. If everyone just held their stocks, (thus demand for buying stocks just froze), then people would sell their stocks (potentially liquidating the company) or stock holders would then demand dividends. Either way, there is value behind the product (ownership) being exchanged...  And yes, companies do typically buy back stock during recession (the opposite of dilluting) to manage stock prices, which is based on the majority of stock holders decision.","160":"So wholesalers.   A) there is intrinsic value, as you have partial ownership of material goods (what the company owns)   B) the competition is between companies, aka you can buy that companies stock or this companies stock. The stock values are extremely competitive within an industry.  It really feels like I'm helping you write a highschool econ paper...  Also given the way these things are being spread out, we will come back to ponzi schemes, one topic at a time (for now wholesalers or mlm","161":"You didn't answer or acknowledge the limitations of being wholesales (aka mlm), so i will assume this is based on mlm.  When i buy apples directly from an orchard, i take the risk (just like buying stock) that i can sell them at a profit to grocers (who sell them to the consumers who consume them). I have no control over whether or not the grocers will buy them or not. I may end up with rotting apples because i didn't realize that people now hate apples...","162":"Market research also shows that stocks are valuable, so your previous point is invalid. Why would i buy stock if i knew the value was frozen?  Your analogy would make purchasing any currency in foreign currency moot. I could invest in buying yen, i can't eat that, but correctly i can use it to buy apples.... likewise for bolts, 2 by 4s, etc....","163":"They get that info from your credit report\/history, which again, should be obtainable only with private info like your social, full name and signature or electronic equivalent.

So again, for the vast majority of people, they are not \"simple\" questions.","164":"That's the best security model because it works for 99.99% of people. Which is why the system is as it is.   The system works for most of the people, most of the time and is easy to use and implement.","165":"Uh, they're not \"unknown.\"  It's not like they publish or present shit under pseudonyms.  If you want, you can sit down and read a bunch of addiction medicine literature.

And yeah, doctors are generally who get to determine if something is a disease or not.","166":"&gt;Seems like another innocent man is in jail.  if that's how it seems to you, that's perfectly fine. the earth seems flat to some people, and them being wrong doesn't affect their lives any more than you being wrong will affect yours.","167":"It's understandable to think that since we probably never live to see any major change of the continents locations. Remember that this process that it's currently happening, takes hundreds millions of years to complete, so we can only suppose how it will end up.","168":"Imagine a brand new whole inteligent species from that time trying to figure it out how were the continents located using human fossils, artifacts and ruins as clues.  Well, we know for sure that Australia moves 7cm to the north every year, so in a couple million years it will probably clash with Indonesia, then all the way to the north until finally clashing with China.","169":"It's not just skin, it's called apoptosis and most cells in the body can do it.

It's an interesting process, multicellular organisms like humans aren't necessarily doing the best for individual cells, but for the whole.","170":"I'm not sure what you mean. All the things I said above are legal. If workers follow the proper laws and procedures and vote to unionize, a company can't just say \"no\" and send the cops to slaughter everyone like they used to. They can do all sorts of things to prevent unionization or retaliate for successful or unsuccessful efforts, but they can't just say \"no\" and that's the end.","171":"&gt; could they deny it  I don't know what you keep calling \"deny\".  So you've got a majority of Walmart employees signed on?  You either have a union or you don't.  If you don't have a union, then you don't have any of the legal protections given to unions in the U.S.  &gt; as opposed to every other corporation or company?  I don't know what this means or why you act like Walmart is the only non-unionized employer in the U.S.","172":"Not only is it absorbed but research has found that certain chemicals in sunscreens like oxybenzone, octinoxate, octocrylene, homosalate, and avobenzone are not only absorbed into the blood but are even found in the blood of a fetus of a woman who used it while pregnant. The research has even shown links to these chemicals and hormonal imbalance.","173":"No problem. When we found out about it years ago we check everything that contains any sunscreen. Even lip balms have the chems.  We switched to zinc\/ titanium dioxide organic sunscreens and our daughter who has more fair skin than either of us has yet to burn.

Also why did you put scientific in quotes? It's like you're implying the name isn't scientific.","175":"Sure if your hypothetical situation plays out exactly as you have said it would then yes it would happen as you say it would.

(Like having access to a particle collider in the apocalypse).","176":"I'm not sure why you seem to think the colonialism started in 1900. It wss well before that. Skipping over that misconception on your part, diseases in the region, poltical, cultural, and religious instability in the region in more recent years (ave further back). Coupled with the fact that several african nations in generations past collapsed (for a variety of reasons, disease, famine, etc) that could have stabilized things...","177":"They were also in Africa. There's another point I recalled, and that's that some diseases don't do well in the cold. The bacteria freezes. Sub-saharan Africa isn't known for being very cold.

Couple that with by the point America had to deal with much of that, we already had the infrastructure, and tech, to be able to fight it.","178":"Half of the planet has an iq under 100, plenty of dumbfuckery around.  A great deal of science is in fields that has nothing to do with the topic, a volcanogist has only his personal beliefs, mostly based on early life brain washing, lots are from places where lack of faith is deemed a detriment so you are not likely to find their true opinion, Saudi Arabia and the USA spring to mind. Despite that, US scientists aren't that church going, even assuming that every single one attending is a believer, very unlikely.  &gt;\tThe majority of scien- tists in the US (60 percent), UK (66 percent), and France (81 percent) are nonattenders; only a small fraction of French scientists attend services once a week or more (3.2 percent).

Perhaps if there was even vague evidence of something let alone conclusive proof, then it would be researched seriously as it would be a life changing event for everyone on the planet. How much research is being done?  Close to zero..   We can detect radio signals and have been doing so for over a century, we know the quantum realm behind it, we can smash atoms together and explain the results, all the shrapnel.  There are no mystery physics remaining to explain metaphysical bunkum, just waving your arms around and having a vague opinion that \"something\" happens with no means of explaining it, based on no evidence just a \"perhaps\" is not an easily defendable position. You have nothing.","180":"&gt;What is the evidence that government inefficiency would make the costs increase.  Government procurement is historically prone to cost overruns, bloat, and inefficiency. You can look at military spending for an example of this.  &gt;It would seem that taking out all of the private insurance middlemen would result in much lower costs.  But in the process, you get rid of the negotiators involved in drug\/treatment cost negotiations, and instead the government will just pay whatever the cost is without thinking about it, again because the government doesn't have significant means to fight for cost savings.  We already have a very similar problem with respect to student loans; the increased cost of college education in the US is largely due to the US government being so willing to pump money into higher education through student loans without any form of price controls or cost incentives.","181":"It's not a fallacy if you are arguing something subjective because if it is subjective then it is illogical. No True Scotsman can only apply if the assertion is something that can be disproven because NTS is applied when the assertion is changed to exclude the offending proof. Likewise, if you clarify your position it is also not No True Scotsman. However; if you argue something to objectively be the case... You know what, let's change the example slightly to be less ambiguous:     \"No person born in Edinburgh likes eggs\"   \"I was born in Edinburgh and I like eggs\"   \"No TRUE person from Edinburgh likes eggs\"     Can you see where logic has broken down here?","182":"Then every time you have seen an accusation of no true scotsman it has been used incorrectly. The person in my example was arguing exactly what they said because they were literally a hypothetical person who was arguing something easy to disprove. This is literally just a textbook example.      It seems to me that you are primarily concerned with what the accusee in each example \\*meant\\* but that's not what debate is about, to the point of apologism for literal straw men. A debate is entirely logical. \"People who I consider to be Scottish do not add sugar to their porridge\" is not something anyone would ever argue.","183":"1. Again, this falls entirely outside of the purview of your original question. 2. Your argument that the fallacy almost never happens in actual debate is pretty suspet. 3.

The two biggest numbers in Airline Economics are CASM and RASM.  Cost per *Available* Seat Mile and Revenue per *Available* Seat Mile.  How much is produced\/consumed for every seat, every mile.  Here's the thing.   Available is extremely important.  When passengers do the Hidden City, they remove the Available.       With a large airline like Lufthansa or Delta (who operates 4800 flights every day), it aggregates big time.  If *one* person on each flight does a hidden city, that's the equivalent of running 16 empty Boeing 777 flights every day.","185":"That process has already been explained to you in [another comment](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/explainlikeimfive\/comments\/gilmgj\/eli5_how_does_a_computer_learn_those_first_few\/fqgpkp3\/).  You seem to be under the assumption that every result calculated by the CPU is literally turned into pixels. That's clearly not the case, computers calculate all sorts of things for different purposes. The software needs to determine what to do with the result. In the case that the result needs to be displayed on screen, the software will tell the monitor how to do so (via the graphics processor).","186":"Do me a personal favor. In all prior examples, assume that the assertions are exactly as stated. There is no basis for \"Yeah but I didn't mean it that way...\". A Scotsman is a human person from Scotland.

The highest month is usually February) is lower than 2019-20.  Again, the reason is because of our precautions to covid are very effective at keeping flu number down. Influenza isn't usually a big deal, so we never go to great lengths to stop it. While Covid is very contagious, and Can result in hospitalization (influenza can too). The reason that we have been so precautious with Covid is because so many hospitals are at above 100% capacity. That was the entire point of flattening the curve, to keep the numbers at a more manageable rate for a long period of time. But people have let up on the precautions because everyone is understandably sick of the isolation","196":"The flu travels with winter. In the northern hemisphere, the season is from Oct-May and in the southern hemisphere, the season is from May-June (year, 8 months vs 6 months seems pretty unfair, but I think it's mostly because people don't live in Antarctica. Australia, South Africa, and Argentina and Chile aren't as cold as Canada or Russia).   Anyway, no, I don't think it would just go away like that.

The added complexity *in some contexts* clearly makes life more able to sustain itself, otherwise it wouldn't evolve. In places where it is not useful, it does not evolve. This is why viruses are simple - they don't benefit from added complexity.  As for exactly how they work, they take advantage of the complexity in their hosts. The complicated things like growing and protecting oneself and getting food and reproducing are all handled by the host cell. *Somebody* has to do those things, and the virus simply allows the host cell to do them.

Yeah, I imagine there are.  Should you give up on business because of that?  Probably not, and I hope you don't!

Yes, okay, discussion of biology was a necessary part of answering the question. It\u2019s a question that referenced puberty in mammals - it self-evidently was going to refer to biological topics. However, your question was asking for the biological reason that humans aren\u2019t ready for kids whilst animals are. The premise is false, and the reason the premise is false is due to social and not biological factors. As I\u2019ve said over and over and over.

The turbine speed and torque is going to be based on super complicated fluid mechanics stuff that I don't know to well.    No, it won't have the same energy output.  Lets say that substance 1 has a boiling point of 50 degrees Celsius and substance 2 has a boiling point of 100 degrees Celsius.  Lets also say that they require the same amount of energy to heat up 1 degree Celsius (1 kj).  Substance 1 absorbs 50 kj of energy but substance 2 absorbs 100 kj.  This means that substance 2 can have more energy extracted by the turbine.    The pressure doesn't actually have much to do with it, it's actually held constant during the boiling process and a pump is used to get the liquid to the right pressure.\nExplainee: Right, this explanation is all compatible with thermodynamics (more energy in=more energy out), but why? Why doesn't a gas molecule at the same pressure affecting the same surface area and moving at the same speed, just at a different temperature, not move the turbine the same amount? The turbine extracts energy by spinning. It doesn't convert heat energy at all, it converts the kinetic energy of the paddles spinning to electricity, and that kinetic energy is generated by pressure.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","8":"Explainee: ELI5: In Chemistry, why are they called the Noble Gases?

Or will radon eventually decay into something else? If it will decay into something else, then what will it decay into?\nExplainer: https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/3\/37\/Decay_Chain_of_Uranium-238.svg  https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/9\/93\/Decay_Chain_of_Actinium.svg  These are the decay chains of uranium-238 and uranium-235, as you can see both of them decay into an isotope of radon before decaying further.

You said something about talking to someone who you think is a virologist who said something no virologist would ever say.  So whoever you spoke to is somewhere between not a virologist at all and the world's worst virologist.  That said - you want to learn whether we're in a position to eradicate the flu - go talk to a (competent) virologist and stop dicking around on reddit.  And 47 reported cases may mean hundreds or thousands or tens of thousands of unreported (but still potentially contagious) cases.  47 may not mean what you think it means.  Most people who get the flu just deal with it, and many have mild symptoms not worth reporting.\nExplainee: yea but in theory if those minor cases isolate themselves for like 2 weeks or something would have their own bodies destroy the virus or could be vaccinated with a flu shot or something, while the major cases who get caught by the testing should be kept an eye on or isolated for even longer as needed.  Also can it exist in the air or on surfaces? Again with 47 cases I am sure it is within our grasp to completely get rid of it.

Too much damage to cellular structures can cause the cell to destroy itself, as can too much damage to DNA. This is why bad sunburn causes skin to peel off, the epidermal and dermal layers received enough damage to decide they need to kill themselves for the greater good. However, if DNA is damaged in certain ways, it can lead to cancer. It's not that DNA can't be repaired at all, it's that it is the \"master program\" for the cell and can be modified in ways that make the cell do things that it isn't supposed to.   You can also receive too much damage to important cells like in organs. It's actually therapeutic in some situations, such as using radioactive iodine to destroy some of a large thyroid, but many organs are not good at regenerating so the damage can hamper their functionality.\nExplainee: Never really thought about it that way. So skin cells \"voluntarily\" end it because probably evolutionarily speaking, the ones who didn't, developed cancer more often, limiting their own baby production.

This is less Computer Science and more Electrical Engineering.  An analog circuit is either \"on\" or \"off\", but its operation can also change based on the energy level. Usually we design the circuit for a specific voltage level (eg. 110V in a US household), and change the current draw to change its operation. Eg. to make a toaster coil hotter or a fan spin faster.  A digital circuit always just \"exists\", with its operation determined by the sequence of on\/off electrical signals transmitted through it. Note that it's the circuit as a whole that is designed to be \"digital\". Individual components like transistors or capacitors are inherently \"analog\", we just use them in different ways.  The concept of \"1s and 0s\" is just something we humans use to help work with digital circuits because of the constant stream of on\/off data going through the circuit - it's useful to represent it as binary numbers.

That's why dividends exist. It's not the only way to look at it though. Because without the business keeping that profit to invest back into the business, it could never grow, giving up increasing value in the future.  Take manufacturing, say that you build widgets, each widget nets x profit. That x value can be given out as dividends or it can be used to increase the number of widgets we make and sell. So, by giving up x now and letting the company build another production line of widgets, next year, i get 3x (2x for 2 years of profits, plus x for the new production line of widgets they made)\nExplainee: so that's fine, but what if the company never hands out dividends?

Maybe the analogy is not the best to price your point, but you can easily ensure you have sales before purchasing.   Also, you have the intrinsic value of apples which you can eat (I assume you're not allergic to it). So even though you may lose some of your money (the apples rot) you're guaranteed a certain level of return regardless. Hell, even rotten apples can be turned into compost for further loss mitigation. There's so much more flexibility there.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Point 1. You are correct. But that's not different in investing in nike shoes or luxury bags to resell later. The value of the stock comes from perception rather than anything thay can be more objectively discerned (dividends). E.g. Nike shoes are inherently shoes, so they have a level of intrinsic value. But is it worth 1k, is a matter of perception.  Point 2. Actually that highlights my point. If you invest in yen and try to use it in another country, it is very likely most places will not accept the currency unless you are willing to trade at a decent or significant loss. So that investment makes no sense because it is unusable until converted, which requires a person willing to trade it.   Furthermore, from another comment, someone said that money is useless until spent, which I fully agree with. But the reason why money always remains valuable is because it is the only form of negotiation with the government for the world's most valuable asset: land.\n","75":"Explainer: Anytime.

Exotic isotopes that don't fit the general pattern are extremely short-lived, so they basically don't exist.  Also, 2 billion years is not very long, the most stable isotope of Bismuth for example has a half-life of 19 billion billion years to decay into Thallium, and over the 14 billion years the universe has existed stars have only managed to transmute about 2% of mass into anything else than hydrogen and helium.\nExplainee: Also, do you think it's possible that either naturally or \"artificially\" that new elements will be made?

The BOD (representatives of the shareholders - mostly large shareholders themselves) decide on the dividend policy.

So if a company doesn't pay dividends it is usually a joint consensus of the management and the owners (shareholders) of the company.

You can look at military spending for an example of this.  &gt;It would seem that taking out all of the private insurance middlemen would result in much lower costs.  But in the process, you get rid of the negotiators involved in drug\/treatment cost negotiations, and instead the government will just pay whatever the cost is without thinking about it, again because the government doesn't have significant means to fight for cost savings.  We already have a very similar problem with respect to student loans; the increased cost of college education in the US is largely due to the US government being so willing to pump money into higher education through student loans without any form of price controls or cost incentives.\n","103":"Explainer: Not necessarily; it's not a one-to-one shift, and generally the companies (correctly) think they can do a better job insuring their employees than the Feds can.

This is a key feature of this kind of parties that transcend the classical political classification that is left\/right wing. Nowadays it's more common for populist parties in Europe (don't know much about other parts of the world) where you see a combination of popular policies on both the left and right wing to 'attract' more followers if you call it that, but then also joined with a lot of far right policies, often played down to not be classified as such that easily.\n","125":"Explainee: ELI5: How does \"Hidden City\" travel cost airlines?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: &gt; The main thing that makes money is selling tickets &gt;&gt; Not true.  100% incorrect. &gt; But if the plane is underweight they can also make more by shipping cargo &gt;&gt; Weight is weight.

Isotopes are atoms with the same number of protons but different numbers of neutrons.

This is less Computer Science and more Electrical Engineering.  An analog circuit is either \"on\" or \"off\", but its operation can also change based on the energy level. Usually we design the circuit for a specific voltage level (eg. 110V in a US household), and change the current draw to change its operation. Eg. to make a toaster coil hotter or a fan spin faster.  A digital circuit always just \"exists\", with its operation determined by the sequence of on\/off electrical signals transmitted through it. Note that it's the circuit as a whole that is designed to be \"digital\". Individual components like transistors or capacitors are inherently \"analog\", we just use them in different ways.  The concept of \"1s and 0s\" is just something we humans use to help work with digital circuits because of the constant stream of on\/off data going through the circuit - it's useful to represent it as binary numbers.

In that case, mlms make the world function......  A ponzi scheme requires there to be an exaggerated or novalue behind the product being bought or sold.

Either way, there is value behind the product (ownership) being exchanged...  And yes, companies do typically buy back stock during recession (the opposite of dilluting) to manage stock prices, which is based on the majority of stock holders decision.\nExplainee: The difference with wholesalers, is that there is intrinsic value, i.e. Food, water, etc. Stocks don't have intrinsic value.

But that's not different in investing in nike shoes or luxury bags to resell later. The value of the stock comes from perception rather than anything thay can be more objectively discerned (dividends). E.g. Nike shoes are inherently shoes, so they have a level of intrinsic value. But is it worth 1k, is a matter of perception.  Point 2. Actually that highlights my point. If you invest in yen and try to use it in another country, it is very likely most places will not accept the currency unless you are willing to trade at a decent or significant loss. So that investment makes no sense because it is unusable until converted, which requires a person willing to trade it.

This is why bad sunburn causes skin to peel off, the epidermal and dermal layers received enough damage to decide they need to kill themselves for the greater good. However, if DNA is damaged in certain ways, it can lead to cancer. It's not that DNA can't be repaired at all, it's that it is the \"master program\" for the cell and can be modified in ways that make the cell do things that it isn't supposed to.   You can also receive too much damage to important cells like in organs.

Its like I can almost imagine it but not really. Unfortunately its really hard to explain for me.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Thats one amazing quote, I like it. After reading the flooding comments, I really focused on imagining things and for the first time, literally right now, I made up a little colorless movie of a sheep jumping through a yard and then it somehow turned into a suit wearing sheep and it robbed a bank and then I lost focus. Yeah I dont know what happened really\nExplainer: The whole piece is worth reading - it talks about how some people count to themselves audibly (imagining a voice counting, as it were), and some people count to themselves visually (imagining watching a clock) - and how the different types of thinking to yourself affects your ability to do different things simultaneously.      Goes on to describe how Feynman then tried to learn to do both (as have I since reading this. And like Feynman, have failed).      More importantly, the larger point of the story is about how even basic everyday things that are \"universal\" can be done in completely unexpected and, frankly, alien seeming ways for other people! :)\n","191":"Explainee: ELI5: What exactly is a period and what happens?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: So do boys get it not just on the top to?

Skipping over that misconception on your part, diseases in the region, poltical, cultural, and religious instability in the region in more recent years (ave further back).

Most of Africa doesn't even have paved roads.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Smallpox, tuberculosis, polio, tetanus, etc. were all deadly American diseases. Only difference is America developed vaccines.\nExplainer: They were also in Africa. There's another point I recalled, and that's that some diseases don't do well in the cold. The bacteria freezes. Sub-saharan Africa isn't known for being very cold. Meanwhile it's going to be 19f here tomorrow (ergo, sone doseases that would thrive in sub-saharan Africa would be dead\/dormant here, but still thriving there).  Couple that with by the point America had to deal with much of that, we already had the infrastructure, and tech, to be able to fight it.\n","193":"Explainer: Correct.

Now can you explain to me where did Influenza go? Is it gone forever? Can it come back? Can 47 people bring it back?\nExplainer: The flu travels with winter. In the northern hemisphere, the season is from Oct-May and in the southern hemisphere, the season is from May-June (year, 8 months vs 6 months seems pretty unfair, but I think it's mostly because people don't live in Antarctica. Australia, South Africa, and Argentina and Chile aren't as cold as Canada or Russia).   Anyway, no, I don't think it would just go away like that. You say there's 47 reported cases in Canada, but that doesn't mean it's not in other countries, and it doesn't mean that people aren't slightly sick or asymptomatic and not going to doctors.\n","196":"Explainer: So you didn't answer, but I assume you mean 2020-21 (which isn't over. The highest month is usually February) is lower than 2019-20.  Again, the reason is because of our precautions to covid are very effective at keeping flu number down. Influenza isn't usually a big deal, so we never go to great lengths to stop it. While Covid is very contagious, and Can result in hospitalization (influenza can too). The reason that we have been so precautious with Covid is because so many hospitals are at above 100% capacity. That was the entire point of flattening the curve, to keep the numbers at a more manageable rate for a long period of time. But people have let up on the precautions because everyone is understandably sick of the isolation\nExplainee: I am comparing the 2019 - 2020 flu season which ended about a month ago according to Canada.ca, to the 2018 - 2019 flu season.

Can you explain the physics of it to me?\nExplainer: People or goods travel, the virus travels. It just sticks around more in winter weather.   Technically you could still get the flu in the summer, but it's much more unlikely. It's already pretty unlikely to get it in the outer months of the season, but outside of the season it's a lot less likely.  But right now it'll still be in the US and Canada, and in a few months it'll be more prominent in Brazil, and then next year it'll come back. And it will have mutated, just like it does every year, but hopefully we'll have predicted a correct vaccine and it won't be too bad\n","197":"Explainee: ELI5: Why does life (and viruses) \"want\" to self replicate?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: I get that viruses are simple because they dont benefit from added complexity, but I mean in terms of chemistry even viruses are incredibly complex compared to the elements on the periodic table. How does one go from these elements to long strains of acid thats specificly coded to replicate itself in a system that at all times tends toward an equlibrium?\nExplainer: Many systems can be self-sustaining so long as they have 'food'. While we don't know the exact path that life followed as it formed, it seems safe to say that a very rudimentary von Neumann 'machine' molecule or arrangement of molecules came to be which then developed more and more complex 'programs' that eventually became DNA.

The physics that I have learnt on this topic.

It's an interesting process, multicellular organisms like humans aren't necessarily doing the best for individual cells, but for the whole.\n","211":"Explainer: There are a few effects; ionization will break apart biologically important molecules, which can then become \"radicals\" which can break apart more molecules or damage proteins. Too much damage to cellular structures can cause the cell to destroy itself, as can too much damage to DNA. This is why bad sunburn causes skin to peel off, the epidermal and dermal layers received enough damage to decide they need to kill themselves for the greater good. However, if DNA is damaged in certain ways, it can lead to cancer. It's not that DNA can't be repaired at all, it's that it is the \"master program\" for the cell and can be modified in ways that make the cell do things that it isn't supposed to.   You can also receive too much damage to important cells like in organs. It's actually therapeutic in some situations, such as using radioactive iodine to destroy some of a large thyroid, but many organs are not good at regenerating so the damage can hamper their functionality.\nExplainee: Never really thought about it that way.

point is, knowing the RPM is important for maintaining your vehicle and shifting gears correctly. Whether you have professional driving instruction or not, understanding the functioning of a tachometer is essential to avoid damaging your car. So while it might not be a strict requirement for changing gears, it's a good practice and a skill useful to prevent vehicle malfunction.","1":"Of course it's possible that I am wrong. I was giving a general comment about paying for fool-proofing. When it comes to driving a car and following driving instructions, it's important to listen to skilled individuals like engineers, driving instructors, and motoring journalists. They have the knowledge and experience to guide you correctly regarding proper driving techniques, which includes shifting gears.","2":null,"3":"Tachometers give you an accurate reading of the vehicle's engine speed in revolutions per minute (RPM). This is crucial in manual transmission vehicles, as the correct RPM is needed to change gears smoothly. For automatic vehicles, it serves as an additional tool for tracking the engine's performance, monitoring fuel efficiency, and preventing damage to the engine. The tachometer helps drivers to understand their car's behavior better, which can improve driving experience and safety.","4":"That is because human beings have laws and societal norms, not biological limitations, that regulate when they can become parents. The maturity and preparedness needed to raise a child successfully is also more than just physical development, it involves emotional and intellectual maturity as well. These are factors that are not biologically determined, but rather developed through life experiences and personal growth. Therefore, the question you initially presented is not primarily a biological one, but more related to sociocultural and personal development matters.","5":"The 'decent mix' you saw is composed mostly of anecdotal and popular assumptions, which do not accurately address the biological factors behind human and animal maturity disparities. You're conflating social narratives with biological facts, and that's where the confusion lies. The difference in maturity, as I've emphasized, is primarily due to environmental and social conditions, not biological ones. If you were asking about social norms dictating when or why humans or animals reproduce, that would be a different conversation entirely. However, your question was specifically about the biological reason for the difference in readiness between humans and animals, and the majority of answers provided are unfounded in biological facts.","6":null,"7":"The gas moving at a faster speed will hit the turbine blades more often in the same given time period. This means that the blades will change direction and spin more times, generating more kinetic energy. Since kinetic energy is half mass times velocity squared (1\/2 * mv^2), a faster moving gas molecule has a higher kinetic energy, so the turbine will generate more electrical energy.","8":null,"9":null,"10":"The flu virus can survive on surfaces for days, and it can transmit through the air via droplets produced by coughing or sneezing. While it's true that minor cases of flu may recover on their own with no treatment, those cases can still be contagious during their recovery period. As for getting rid of the flu, it's important to note that it is different from a disease like measles, which we have already eradicated. Influenza is highly contagious, and it mutates frequently, making it difficult to create a vaccine that is effective against all strains every year. With 47 cases, it's a manageable outbreak, but if left unchecked, it can explode into a full epidemic. When it comes to viruses like herpes, they have a much longer incubation period, and once someone is infected, they carry it for life. Eradicating a virus like herpes is much more challenging, and we're still working on developing effective treatments for it.","11":"I don't care about your donations. Let's discuss the topic in a respectful manner.","12":null,"13":"A game can also be a sport, as they both involve competition and skills. The main difference being that a sport is usually more physically demanding and has an official set of rules and regulations.","14":"The 'off'ness is a dissonance that occurs when the triplets are played with a rhythm that is slightly off beat in comparison to the intended time signature. This creates an effect of tension and instability in the music, which listeners might perceive as 'off' or imperfect.","15":"Things can seem more complicated for girls because of menstruation. This is a process that happens every month where the body sheds the lining of the uterus if no egg has been fertilized. Boys don't have a uterus, so they don't have periods.","16":"Sponge can't boil because it's not a liquid and will degrade and fall apart in boiling water","17":"I wasn\u2019t framing it as an insult, it\u2019s just interesting that you hold such a strong stance against spending yet have spent money in the past. That\u2019s all I\u2019m saying.","18":"I'm not arguing about political ideologies, I was making a joke about your hypocrisy in complaining about micro purchases in a game, while not batting an eye when you spend money on other things. It was a joke, not a declaration of political beliefs.","19":"There are various reasons why they may not have double-checked the mathematical calculations, such as the pressure of the secret operation, the urgency to develop a bomb, or the certainty they had in their calculations. However, it's also possible that they did check, but they made a mistake in their experiment, which ultimately led to the failure of their atomic bomb project.","20":"They can't directly prevent workers from unionizing, but they can make the process so complicated and intimidating that it's difficult for workers to successfully unionize. For example, in the US, workers need to collect signatures from a majority of employees to demonstrate interest in unionizing. However, it's not uncommon for employers to use various tactics to dispute the validity of the signatures, making it difficult to meet the necessary threshold.","21":"Sounds like a fun way to handle pesky earworms! That song you mentioned is 'Since U Been Gone' by Kelly Clarkson, a real classic.","22":"An investment bank is a type of financial institution that manages and invests money for other companies, governments, and ultra-high-net-worth individuals. They help in raising capital by underwriting or acting as the client's agent in the issuance of securities. One of the key areas of investment banking is market making, which involves buying and selling securities to provide liquidity and maintain a bid-ask spread in a market. In market making, the investment bank acts as both a buyer and a seller to ensure there is always a ready market for a given security. To better understand market making, you might want to look up the role of an investment banker, details about various types of securities like stocks and bonds, and how trading works. Since you mentioned it's a report, it would also be beneficial to study market liquidity, the role of an investment bank in creating liquidity, and the different market structures like exchange-traded and over-the-counter markets.","23":"I see, so it's more like a curriculum for your workplace. That sounds interesting and helpful!","24":null,"25":null,"26":"because the manufacturer is selling 'White-Labelled' products to both Walmart and the original brand, allowing the retailer to produce their own house brand with similar ingredients and packaging but at a lower cost compared to the original brand.","27":"But as we've discussed, the question was about biological factors that contribute to humans being less ready for children compared to animals. The answers you received that were not based on biology are the exception, not the rule. Your initial statement about the majority of answers being the same implied they were all based on biology, which was not the case. The question was about biological readiness for childbearing, and social factors were not relevant to answering that question.","28":"I think it's due to historical and cultural prejudices that associate sex work with immorality and exploitation. These perceptions have been reinforced over time and are now deeply ingrained in our society.","29":"Each pixel has its own unique address wired up, so the computer sends out a series of coordinates or addresses of the color values it wants displayed. These addresses correspond to physical pixel positions, and the monitor turns on the correct red, green, and blue lights at the right intensity based on the R, G, and B values received.","30":"The key difference is that in digital, only two distinct voltage levels are used\u2014either 0 or 1\u2014representing 'off' or 'on'. Analog, on the other hand, can represent a continuous range of values, not just 0 and 1. And regarding your question about how a digital produces only one of two, it's because transistors in digital electronics are either in a satellite state (not conducting) or an active state (conducting), which corresponds to the binary digits 0 and 1, respectively. The output from one transistor is strong enough to completely max out the Gate of another if it's in the active state, resulting in a binary 1. If it's in the satellite state, no voltage is applied to the Gate, which results in a binary 0.","31":"Yes, it is really black in that it is extremely dark and absorbs all the light falling on it, effectively blocking out any information about the colour or the object itself from reaching your eye, which causes your brain to perceive it as black.","32":"That's correct. Vaccination helps protect you from getting sick with the flu. However, it also benefits those who are at higher risk of serious complications if they get the flu, but are unable to be vaccinated (like infants, elderly or people with certain health conditions). By getting vaccinated, you lower the chance of transmitting the disease to them. So, yes, indirectly, not getting vaccinated could potentially pose a risk to others.","33":"You can consider insurance, which typically covers doctor visits. Health insurance often has a list of providers you can choose from. If you're under 18, your parents may have a pediatrician, or you can find a primary care doctor on your own once you're an adult.","34":"Actually, the amount of water on Earth isn't a constant. It constantly cycles between the ocean, the atmosphere, and the land. When we 'waste' water, it means we use it in a way that it cannot be used again in its current quality, like using potable water for flushing the toilet or for cleaning the street. This is bad practice because it increases the cost required to purify water, and wastes a natural resource.","35":"If you lying to them doesn't cost them money, then why are they trying to hide it from customers? If customers knew that they were charging full price for a service that's only breaking even, they might not buy it. This would lead to lower profits. That's why they are fighting it.","36":null,"37":"Actually, the vagina is actually on the outside and it's the cervix that is closer to the uterus. The cervix connects the uterus and the vagina. During pregnancy, due to the increase in hormones, the cervix softens and starts to dilate in preparation for childbirth.","38":"The program H(x,y) takes in two inputs x and y. In your case, x is being used as both an input and an identity for the program itself. H(x,x) means the program H is being applied to x as both its inputs, hence it uses x twice.","39":"You can usually find one by referring to your local healthcare provider or even searching online for health clinics in your area. It is important to have regular check-ups for preventive medicine and treatment.","40":"The 'off'ness refers to the slight mismatch in timing between the individual triplets in the performance. In a harmonically perfect world, the three notes that make up a triplet should all be perfectly synchronized. However, in this video, you can see that the performer is not playing the notes at exactly the same length. This slight variation is what is referred to as the 'off'ness.","41":"You've proposed a simplistic solution without understanding the complexity and scale of the problem, and then deflected criticism by accusing people of being impatient and rude. It's unproductive and counter-productive to the conversation. If you have more detailed ideas or resources to suggest, please share them. Instead, you've been unnecessarily combative and haven't engaged in good-faith discussion.","42":"Water is constantly cycling between the Earth, the atmosphere, and living things. However, the clean drinking water we need is actually a very small fraction of the total water on Earth. Finding and accessing this clean water is not always straightforward or easy. For example, many communities lack access to clean drinking water because they lack the infrastructure (like pipes or wells) to get it to their homes. Additionally, treating water to make it safe for drinking can be a complex and expensive process, which may not be possible in areas where resources are limited.","43":"The age requirement for the presidency is set by the Constitution, which doesn't specify a maximum age, but states that one must be at least 35 years old, a US citizen for at least 14 years, and a 'natural born' citizen (born in the United States or through parentage to US citizens). This is meant to ensure a certain degree of maturity and experience, but there is no upper age limit.","44":"Actually, writing in a name on the ballot is still considered a vote, but it won't be counted towards the official election results unless the candidate has been formally certified and is already on the ballot. However, it can be symbolic of a dissatisfaction with the mainstream candidates.","45":"Yes, they can deny unionization if a majority of the employees do not vote in favor of it. However, if a majority signs a pro-associate benefits group proposal and it meets the same requirements as a union, it may be considered a union under a different name, but with the same legal protections. Not every corporation or company may have the same stance on this as Walmart, but Walmart is known for its opposition to unions.","46":"A single store can unionize, but in your case you would need a majority of Walmart employees across all stores to sign up for the union. Unionizing at a store level is not possible. Additionally, it's not necessary to have the same amount of people that live in New Hampshire and Vermont (which is approximately 1.4 million as of 2021) to unionize for Walmart, as the required number of employees to unionize varies depending on factors such as the number of employees in a single location and the type of union being formed.","47":"That's not what I'm arguing for. The principle is fairness, not equating the outcomes. If someone is capable of doing the same work, they deserve to be paid the same, regardless of the outcome.","48":"This situation is possible due to the Moon\u2019s orbit along the ecliptic plane, which is nearly aligned with the Earth\u2019s equator. During a selenelion eclipse, the Moon rises in the east while setting in the west, passing through the Earth's shadow. The sunlight that illuminates the topside of the Moon comes from the side opposite to the Earth, as it appears lower in the sky and not directly behind the Earth, which creates the unique effect of a shadow on the moon\u2019s rising side.","49":null,"50":"However, I can't say where consciousness comes from either.","51":null,"52":"You're correct that market research shows stocks are valuable, but the key difference is that with apples, you can determine the demand and sell directly to consumers. With stocks, you rely on a middleman (brokers) to determine the demand and price, and you're at their mercy in terms of the price you can sell at.","53":null,"54":"You're on the right track! Supernovae have an incredibly high temperature and pressure, which causes atoms to undergo nuclear fusion at a much faster rate than in normal stars. The extreme conditions create a situation where the gravitational force balances the electron pressure, forming a stable equilibrium for a short period of time. This, in turn, allows for the fusion of heavy elements beyond iron, creating the heavy elements we see in the universe.","55":"However, Cantor's proof does not rely on the optimality of the list or the method used to generate it. The proof demonstrates that no matter how the list is constructed, it cannot contain all real numbers. It's the inherent structure of real numbers that makes them uncountable, not the specific method used to generate a list.","56":"It seems like you're getting upset, but I'm just trying to understand your perspective. It was unclear whether you were agreeing or opposing the idea of having a castrated partner as you mentioned getting a vasectomy. Furthermore, I asked for your thoughts on the topic because your initial statement seemed to contrast with your subsequent statement about being okay with abortion. I apologize if I came off as hostile.","57":null,"58":"P is a program that checks if another program M, with a given input, will halt or diverge (run forever). Turing showed that no program, including P, can determine if every program can be proven to halt for all given inputs. This is known as the Halting Problem. The Self-Referential Proof is a way of demonstrating this. If P is a program that can solve the Halting Problem, then P can also be used to demonstrate that it is not possible for P to solve the Halting Problem itself. This is done by creating a program P' that, when run, will simulate P with itself and its own input as arguments. In this scenario, if P can be proven to halt, then P' would not halt, and vice versa. This shows that P cannot, in fact, always correct determine the halting status of all programs, contradicting the assumption that P can do so and establishing the Halting Problem.","59":"During a menstrual cycle, a female's body sheds the lining of the uterus. This lining, along with blood, is discharged through the vagina through a process called menstruation. This typically occurs every 28 days, but it may vary, and each period can last anywhere from 3 to 7 days.","60":"But it's an interesting topic! Did you know that scientists believe a massive asteroid collided with Earth around 66 million years ago, leading to the extinction of the dinosaurs? This event is known as the Cretaceous-Paleogene (K-Pg) extinction event.","61":"Photons don't have size as they are massless particles and behave as waves. The energy of a photon is related to its frequency or wavelength. When we say black holes have a certain amount of energy, we are referring to the total amount of energy contained within a specific amount of space, including all types of energy like kinetic, potential, and electromagnetic.","62":null,"63":"The halting problem is a problem in computer science related to algorithmic efficiencies. It states that there can be no general algorithm to determine if a arbitrary program will run forever or halt (stop running) on a particular machine. Self-referential proof is a proof strategy where a statement is made about a definition and the definition is then used within the proof itself, as in G\u00f6del's Incompleteness Theorems. Even though you mentioned the self-referential proof, I couldn't find a connection to the halting problem.","64":"The diagonalization proof doesn't rely on specific assumptions about the 'better' way to generate the list. Instead, it shows that regardless of how you list the numbers, a pattern can always be found to create a new number that's not on the list, which disproves the hypothesis of a list containing all numbers.","65":"In reality, concentrating the radioactivity, as you mentioned, is a major concern, especially in the food chain. Just because the average concentration throughout the ocean may be low, it does not mean that the concentrations in fish, or other animals that may be consumed, would also be low. This is a common misconception that we are trying to disprove.","66":null,"67":"Answer: Wood is actually quite fire resistant compared to traditional construction materials like straw or thatched roof. In addition, wood houses are easier and cheaper to construct, and more environmentally friendly. They are also better insulated, which can save homeowners on energy costs. However, when a fire does occur, it might spread faster compared to a stone house due to the flammable nature of wood. But houses can be built with fire-resistant treatments to help slow the spread in case of a fire.","68":"So, in the case of a stone house, it's more likely that only one or a few houses will burn, allowing many people more time to evacuate and firefighters more time to extinguish the fire, compared to a large number of wooden houses burning at a faster rate.","69":"No, Weinstein was convicted based on credible evidence, not based on a rumour.","70":"The value of your shares is not only in the dividends they provide, but also in the potential growth of the company they represent. By allowing the company to reinvest profits, it can grow, increasing the overall value of the company, and thus, the value of your shares. Your shares are like owning a piece of the business, and just like a business, it may reinvest its profits to grow and increase its value over time.","71":"Well, the board of directors makes decisions based on the best interest of the company as a whole, not just the individual shareholders. Dividends can potentially limit the company's growth and future opportunities, so they are not necessarily paid out if the board believes it's beneficial to reinvest the profits. Regarding your point about dilution, it's true that having a larger percentage of fewer shares can be more valuable than a smaller percentage of many shares, but dilution can also make each share worth less in total, which can dilute the value of your ownership over time. Lastly, a company is not a Ponzi scheme or an MLM just because it doesn't give out dividends. These are investing schemes where participants rely primarily on recruiting new participants to pay existing participants, and that's not the case with a publicly-traded company.","72":"C) the competition is among investors, not companies. The stock market determines the price of a company's stock based on various factors such as the company's profitability, market conditions, and investor sentiment. D) wholesalers do not issue shares or stocks, unlike companies which do during an IPO. They are not involved in the stock market.","73":"In the case of MLMs, the product is not necessarily something that has intrinsic value like food or water. The value of the product is often based on the multi-level marketing structure itself, where participants make money by recruiting others. This structure can lead to a situation where the product might not have a real market value outside of the MLM scheme. Additionally, the profit for the wholesaler in your example comes from the markup they apply on the products they sell to retailers, whereas in an MLM, the income is often directly proportional to the number of recruits and their sales, not the actual value of the product.","74":"But in MLMs, you're not buying physical assets like apples or Nike shoes that have intrinsic value. You're buying a product with a set market value and then trying to sell it to others at a markup, which is similar to investing in stocks or currency. However, unlike stocks or currency, you're also required to recruit and sell to others to secure your own sales and commissions. This additional layer of dependence on recruiting others for sales makes MLMs riskier, as it introduces a reliance on others' sales for your own success, rather than relying on the inherent value or demand for the product. Furthermore, the value of your currency (commissions) in an MLM is directly tied to the pyramid scheme structure, where new recruits' product purchases pay the commissions for older members. This structure causes the value of the currency (commissions) to depreciate over time, as older members drain the resources and new recruits fail to sustain the same levels of purchases. So, while there is some flexibility to sell to others, the structure and reliance on recruitment make MLMs a riskier investment than physical assets or more traditional investment forms.","75":"I thought that would make you feel better.","76":null,"77":null,"78":"Well, it's not that easy. Once a relativistic spacecraft reaches such high speeds, stopping it becomes a major challenge. The ship would need to reverse its direction and apply an equally strong force to counteract its forward momentum. This would require immense amounts of energy and time, even if the engine were able to slow down. Slowing down the spacecraft would cause it to travel a significant distance before eventually coming to a halt, making it impractical as a mode of transportation to a specific point, such as a planet. In addition, the force required to bring the spacecraft to a stop would generate immense heat, potentially causing damage to the spacecraft itself. For these reasons, it's more efficient to slow down the spacecraft gradually as it approaches its destination, rather than trying to stop it abruptly.","79":"Instead, language understanding relies on associating words with their underlying meaning (semantics). This meaning doesn't have to be conveyed through images; rather, it's based on how the word is defined, and how it functions within sentences. For example, if a word is a noun, it likely represents a person, place, thing, or idea, and the sentence should make sense if you replace it with another noun. If it's a verb, it implies an action. Your ability to understand and use language is based on learning these associations through context and experience.","80":"The effects of desalinating large amounts of seawater on the environment include increased greenhouse gas emissions, increased energy consumption, potential destruction of marine ecosystems, and increased cost. Desalination plants require a large amount of energy to run, and most of that energy comes from fossil fuels, leading to increased greenhouse gas emissions. Additionally, the process of desalination can have negative impacts on marine ecosystems, as it can kill off certain types of marine life and disrupt the balance of the ecosystem. Finally, desalination is a very expensive process, and it can be difficult to justify the cost of building and maintaining desalination plants when there are other sources of water available, such as rainwater or recycled water.","81":"Oh, I see your point. Let me clarify, by 'astute need', I mean that the topic requires a higher level of understanding and attention. In this case, it seems you're looking for an in-depth explanation, which typically requires concentrated effort and time. You may prefer to purchase the full hour to ensure all your questions are addressed thoroughly.","82":"What I'm saying is, when you desalinate water, you're removing all the minerals that the ocean naturally contains. This can disrupt the balance of nutrients in the aquatic ecosystems, affecting marine life and the overall health of the oceans. In addition, desalination plants are energy-intensive, requiring large amounts of fossil fuels to run, which contribute to greenhouse gas emissions. They also require a significant amount of land, and the intake and discharge of water can have harmful impacts on fragile coastal ecosystems. Desalination is a last resort option for water scarcity in areas like the Middle East and California, but it's not a sustainable or environmentally-friendly solution to the global water crisis.","83":"It sounds like you're proposing a large-scale, mechanical solution to capture methane from the melting Arctic. While it's great that you're actively thinking about ways to mitigate climate change, it's important to consider the feasibility and environmental impact of such a project. To build and maintain vast networks of vacuum tubes over millions of square miles of arctic tundra could be very resource-intensive and have significant ecological disruptions. Additionally, there are existing technologies for capturing and utilizing methane from livestock and industrial sources that are more economically and environmentally viable. It would be worth exploring these options further before investing in large-scale projects.","84":"I mean it's a different context, my wife bought a watch that's been saving us money on pokeballs for years, whereas I'm spending money on the game itself. You seem to have a problem with me spending money but not with your wife having an expensive watch.","85":"I'm not claiming any affiliation with the political party, but if you think pointing out a hypocritical statement makes me 'republican', it seems like you're the one with the entitlement here. It's funny how you're labeling people based on their observations.","86":"Yes, it is possible to create new elements artificially through nuclear reactions. However, the number of new elements that can be created naturally or artificially is limited. As of today, only 118 stable elements and about 2700 unstable radioactive isotopes have been discovered. Creating new elements beyond the currently known 118 stable elements would require extremely high-energy bombardments, which are difficult to achieve and even more difficult to sustain. As for the number of elements that can be created in total, it is not infinite due to the stability of certain elements and the energy required to create them.","87":null,"88":"Although it's theoretically possible for scientists to discover new isotopes that might fill up the 8th row, it's highly unlikely for the 9th row due to the instability of the heavier elements. The trend suggests that the heavier the element, the shorter its half-life, and the 9th row would consist of even heavier elements.","89":null,"90":"Thinking ahead, the time frame for discovering elements beyond those on the 7th row would significantly increase as we move further down the table. The detection and creation of elements require more resources and technology, which makes it more challenging. As for your question about element 10,000, predicting the exact time it could be discovered is not feasible, as it depends on future advancements in science, technology, and our understanding of the universe. To compare, the elements in the 8th row are yet to be discovered, making the 9th and subsequent rows even more elusive. The progress may become slower than the 70-year span for the 7th row elements, although some improvements in technology could accelerate the process.","91":"Yes, it's possible that I could be wrong on this issue.

However, there's a crucial difference between these scenarios and being in a Multi-Level Marketing (MLM) business. In MLM, the primary focus is not on the product's intrinsic value, but on recruiting more people to join the network and buy the product, with the goal of earning a commission both on the product sales and the commission earned by those you recruit. This creates a pyramid structure, where the revenue generation heavily relies on the recruitment of new members. Unlike apples or shoes, these products don't have an inherent value independent of the network. In the end, the success in an MLM greatly depends on the growth of the network, which can be unpredictable, unlike the demand for a consumer product like apples or shoes.","97":"Investing in non-dividend shares is about long-term growth rather than short-term profits, as these companies reinvest their earnings back into the company to grow and increase their value in the future. This is often the case for companies in growth phases or industries such as technology or startup companies. While you might not get immediate returns through dividends, your shares could potentially increase in value if the company grows successfully, resulting in a larger return when you decide to sell.","98":"It's also important to note that while owning a large percentage of shares gives more control, it also comes with more financial risk.

This is a major concern, as government inefficiency can cause costs to increase once it takes over the healthcare sector.","103":"For instance, studies have shown that when the government administers healthcare programs, they tend to have higher administrative costs compared to private insurers. This is due to bureaucratic complexity and a lack of incentives to control costs. Additionally, government programs may face political pressures that can lead to unnecessary services or overspending. This, combined with the absence of a profit motive, can result in higher overall costs.","104":"C) Non-dividend shares (stocks without dividends) on the other hand have no intrinsic value in the sense that there are no tangible goods you own, just a claim on the company's future earnings. D) The value of these shares is determined by supply and demand in the stock market. E) Unlike wholesalers, there's no direct competition between companies for the same stock (as it's all the same stock of the same company). Instead, competition happens between buyers and sellers in the stock market. F) In some cases, a company might buy back its own shares, which can affect the market price. This is what you referred to as 'company buying shares back during recessions.'

Although the value can depreciate, the potential for diverse uses and income streams makes wholesaling a more flexible investment option.","107":"It's true that apples have intrinsic value to some extent, but the value of a product in an mlm (like apples to a grocer) is determined solely by the potential buyer, not the intrinsic value of the product. To illustrate this, let's consider two scenarios: 1. If I were to buy Nike shoes and try to sell them to a consumer directly, their value would still depend on the buyer's perception just like with apples. However, the consumer could end up not liking the shoes, leading to unsold inventory. 2. Similarly, investing in a currency like the yen involves a risk of accepting a loss due to exchange rates or accepting a lower value in exchange for the usability of the currency. The main difference between investing in apples and these examples is that the potential buyers in mlm are also sellers, and their decision to buy affects their own earning potential along with yours, creating a complex and fluid market. Therefore, in an mlm, the value of the product isn't just decided by the intrinsic value, but also by the perceived earning potential based on the market size and the efforts of the sellers.","108":null,"109":"A code is usually thought of as a prescriptive system with an intended purpose.

Therefore, tanning is generally considered socially acceptable, while lightening the skin is not.","142":"In the context of preventing tanning and actively lightening the skin, wearing clothes can prevent tanning but doesn't help to lighten the skin. If our focus is on preventing tanning, even through clothes, it's still relevant as the concern still stands. My argument is that taking measures to prevent tanning is valuable, even if it's through wearing clothing rather than products or treatments, while your argument seems to be dismissing the importance of preventing tanning altogether.","143":"Your argument is that covering your skin with clothes doesn't prevent tanning. But the link you provided confirms that clothes can allow the sun's harmful rays to reach your skin and cause tanning.

As for your question about element 10,000 being found in 700 years, it's difficult to predict as the rate of discovery slows down as we move further down the periodic table. However, the pattern of growth in the atomic mass tends to slow down as well, so it's possible that discovering newer elements may become less challenging over time. As for your comment on the improvement in discovery time from thousands of years to 70 years, keep in mind that the rate of discovery had accelerated significantly during the 20th century thanks to advancements in technology and experimental methods.

The concept of dilution refers to the dilution of the value of existing shares due to an increase in the total number of shares outstanding. If a company issues new shares to pay dividends, this can potentially dilute the value of existing shares, as the total value of the company is spread over a larger number of shares.

The profit margin is usually low, and most revenue is earned from the new recruits, not from selling the product. Also, in the case of investing in physical goods like apples or luxury items, you can always find other ways to make use of the product, like selling it at lower prices, using it for personal consumption, or repurposing it in some way.

It's already pretty unlikely to get it in the outer months of the season, but outside of the season it's a lot less likely. But right now, it'll still be in the US and Canada, and in a few months it'll be more prominent in Brazil, and then next year it'll come back. And it will have mutated, just like it does every year, but hopefully we'll have predicted a correct vaccine and it won't be too bad.","197":"Life and viruses self-replicate because they have a 'code' or genetic material, like DNA or RNA, that contains instructions for building more copies of themselves. This 'self-copying' ability is essential for survival, as it allows the organism to reproduce and pass its genetic information to offspring. Over time, through mutations and natural selection, this genetic material has evolved to become more complex, enabling the organisms to perform more intricate processes and survive in a wider range of environments.","198":"Yes, you're correct that DNA is quite complex. To explain, imagine a simple 'program' as a set of instructions that tell a system how to behave, such as 'grow', 'replicate', 'move', or 'respond to light'. A rudimentary von Neumann machine is a concept in mathematics and computer science that describes a self-replicating automaton. In simpler terms, this could be a basic system that can make copies of itself using other materials around it. As these copies are made, any changes or mutations in the instructions (the 'program') can be passed along to the new copies. Over millions of years, these mutations could lead to the creation of more complex 'programs'. Although it is highly unlikely, it's not impossible that such a process could eventually result in the development of DNA, which contains a set of instructions for building and maintaining a living organism.","199":"Your body does not absorb or metabolize most sunscreens. Instead, small amounts are excreted through urine or left on the skin. Sunscreens are not stored in any specific way by the body.","200":"If the majority of Walmart employees have signed on to form a union, then they can file a petition with the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) and request an election to verify the majority support. If successful, the NLRB will certify the union and Walmart would be required to recognize and negotiate with the union. However, before the election, employers often try to dissuade employees from unionizing through various means such as anti-unionism campaigns. If the majority of employees have not signed the union petition, then Walmart can't be forced to recognize a union, but they must still follow federal laws that protect the rights of employees to organize and form a union.","201":"Well, typically, a union can be formed at a single store location if there are enough employees willing to join. However, the process can be challenging due to various factors such as employer resistance. In the case of Walmart, because of its size and the number of employees, the process can be quite complex and may require organizational efforts across multiple locations. But to answer your question about New Hampshire and Vermont, the total population of those two states is approximately 4.3 million people as of the latest census, while there are over 1.6 million employees worldwide working for Walmart as of 2022. So it's not quite on the same scale.","202":"the event of not getting the 1\/100 would have the probability of (99\/100)^100, which is approximately 0.37 with 100 trials","203":"Organic compounds are another large grouping.

However, we can't strictly assert that we are not the center of the universe. The prevailing theory, that is, the Big Bang theory, suggests the universe expanded from a singularity, but doesn't imply a central point around which it expands. ","205":"As of now, the physics behind the expansion of the universe is purely theoretical, hence the opposing views on the matter. The physics that I have learnt on this topic indicates that Hubble\u2019s theory suggests no absolute center to the universe, rather every point in the universe is accelerating away at a specific speed (Hubble constant). From any given vantage point, whether on a planet in another galaxy or earth, you would observe the same effect of galaxies both blue and red-shifted.","206":"No, it's not just the genitals or the balls that cause sexual urges. The testicles produce testosterone for male sexual drive, but the brain plays a crucial role as well. The brain is considered the biggest sexual organ because it controls sexual thoughts, feelings, behavior, and responses. In the case of a man who has had his genitals amputated, they would still have sexual urges, but they might seek out alternative ways to satisfy these urges, such as through masturbation, prostitutes, or intimate relationships.","207":"But you're the one who said that humans don't have children immediately after reaching puberty is not a biological fact. You accepted that your own premise was false. So it seems you're the one who is shifting the conversation from biology to social reasons. If the question is about biology, as you initially suggested, then the answer is still biological. The social reasons and human behavior you mentioned are indeed factors, but they are not the primary focus of the question.","208":null,"209":"'Quantum randomness' is a popular term, but it's a bit misleading. Quantum mechanics (QM) does describe a world of uncertainty and unpredictability, but not in the 'anything can happen at any time' sense. Instead, QM predicts that certain quantities related to a particle are uncertain or indeterminate until they are measured, that is, 'observed'. The mathematical way this uncertainty is expressed is with probabilities, not randomness in the everyday sense of the term. Therefore, the 4D objects in the universe still follow definite rules and behaviors dictated by their initial conditions and the laws of nature.'","210":"When cells are damaged, they activate certain mechanisms to kill themselves, a process known as apoptosis. Apoptosis helps in removing damaged cells, preventing the spread of harmful substances to other cells in the body.

Essentially, a tachometer provides valuable information about the engine's RPM that can aid in smooth and efficient driving. By keeping a watch, you can ensure you're maintaining the optimal RPM range while shifting gears, thus reducing strain on your engine and enhancing the overall lifespan of your vehicle. However, if you've received professional driving instruction and have always taken good care of your cars, then I appreciate that you have the necessary skills for operating your vehicles effectively.","1":"You're correct to seek the advice of experienced individuals like engineers, driving instructors, and motoring journalists when it comes to driving techniques. Properly shifting gears is an important aspect of driving, and it's crucial to follow their guidance for a safe and enjoyable driving experience.","2":"Business can cater to various individuals, given its expansive nature encompassing diverse companies and departments with varying levels of flexibility. Some business jobs may place an emphasis on conventional appearances, which could potentially pose a challenge for individuals who value self-expression. However, this should not discourage you from pursuing a career in business, as there are numerous opportunities for self-expression and innovation within the realm of businesses. My advice would be to explore different industries and companies that align with your values and personality to find a suitable work environment.","3":null,"4":"It's important to note that while a 13-year-old may have the physical ability to carry a child, it's generally recognized that they may not have the emotional maturity or resources necessary to provide a stable and supportive environment for a child. This is more about societal norms and personal growth than it is about biology.","5":"Actually, the responses you saw were largely based on anecdotes and common beliefs, which do not explain the biological reasons for the difference in maturity between humans and animals. You seem to be mixing social interpretations with biological facts, which is causing confusion. The main factor behind the maturity difference is environmental and social conditions, not biological ones.","6":"Intriguing perspective you've shared. Though it seems like a contentious issue, I'd be happy to share some insights from a research study I've come across. It's possible that while there may be initial benefits, long-term effects remain uncertain due to various factors including corporate profiteering. Moreover, it's crucial to address the root cause of homelessness, providing affordable housing and addressing the systemic issues at play. If you're interested, I can certainly send the study for further reading.","7":"Faster moving gas molecules hit the blades more often in a given time period, causing the turbine to spin faster. This generates more kinetic energy, which can be converted to electrical energy.","8":"Radon is indeed not the end of the decay chain for uranium. Urarium-238 and uranium-235 undergo several steps of decay, and radon appears along these routes. After radon, various other radioactive isotopes are produced, which continue to decay and transform until they reach a stable element. This continuous process aims to achieve stable, non-radioactive forms.","9":null,"10":"Given that the flu virus can survive on surfaces and be transmitted through the air via coughing or sneezing, minor cases of flu may still be contagious, even while they recover. However, it's worth noting that eradicating influenza is not the same as a disease like measles, which we have already eradicated. The flu is highly contagious and mutates frequently, making it difficult to create a vaccine effective against all strains each year. Although 47 cases is a manageable outbreak, if left unchecked, it could develop into a full epidemic. Regarding viruses like herpes, they have a longer incubation period and once someone is infected, they carry it for life. Eradicating a virus like herpes is considerably more challenging, and we're still striving to develop effective treatments for it.","11":"I'd appreciate if we could focus on the topic and converse in a respectful manner.","12":"Evolutionarily, the cell death might have been a beneficial trait to prevent potentially harmful mutations from occurring and leading to cancer, particularly in the case of sunburn. Skin cells may not be able to repair extensive DNA damage caused by ultraviolet radiation, promoting apoptosis to limit cancer cell proliferation. This trade-off between eliminating damaged cells and the risk of reduced reproduction could have played a role in the evolution of our bodies' mechanisms to counteract skin damage.","13":null,"14":"The 'off'ness referred to here is essentially a dissonance that arises when the triplets deviate slightly from the exact rhythm indicated by the original time signature. This subtle inconsistency can produce a tension or instability in the melody, and it might feel unsettling or unexpected to some listeners.","15":"Indeed, you've posed a thoughtful question. While the biological development in boys and girls may share similarities, there are key differences due to the presence of unique reproductive systems. As for girls, menstruation is one of the most notable distinctions. This monthly cycle involves the shedding of the uterine lining if fertilization doesn't occur. Boys, missing a uterus, do not experience menstruation and, therefore, their biological development might appear simpler in this regard. I encourage you to ask any questions you may have, and I will do my best to help!","16":"Interesting point! However, a sponge is not a liquid and will break down in boiling water. Boiling water won't effectively sanitize a sponge due to its porous nature. Traditional methods like microwaving or bleaching can help keep your kitchen sponge clean.","17":null,"18":"Apologies for any misunderstanding.

This can be particularly useful for performance driving, where maintaining ideal RPM for maximum power and efficiency is essential. Further, it helps to gauge the correct time for shifting gears, ensuring smooth transitions and reducing the likelihood of engine strain or damage. While skipping gears might seem safe and might not lead to significant, immediate wear, it can contribute to the degradation of the transmission over time, which is why adhering to proper shifting techniques is generally recommended.","26":"Dave can indeed feel frustrated, but the practice allowed by manufacturers to sell 'White-Label' products to multiple retailers has been a common business strategy for years. The original brand can't legally stop another brand from selling similar products, as long as they're not direct copies and each product meets required health and safety standards. Retailers, on the other hand, can leverage these partnerships to offer more affordable options while still maintaining a satisfactory quality level for their customers.","27":null,"28":null,"29":"Each pixel is addressed individually, via a network of physical wires that connect the computer and the monitor. To adjust intensity, different amounts of electrical current are sent, with higher amounts creating brighter colors and lower amounts creating darker ones. Modern monitors contain billions of transistors, each one no larger than a small cluster of atoms, enabling the precise control of individual pixels.","30":"When a transistor is activated, it allows more current to flow through it. This stronger current can completely drive the Gate of another transistor, resulting in a binary '1'. If the transistor is not activated, no current flows through it, and hence it cannot drive the Gate of another transistor, effectively outputting a binary '0'.","31":null,"32":"That's right. By getting vaccinated, you help protect not only yourself but also others who may be at a higher risk of serious complications from the flu, such as infants, the elderly, and individuals with certain health conditions. Essentially, vaccination reduces the chance of you passing the virus to people who can't be vaccinated, thus lowering the overall risk of spreading the disease.","33":"You can explore health insurance options which usually cover regular doctor visits. Many plans come with a list of participating physicians from which you can choose. If you're still a minor, your parents might have a pediatrician, or you could find a family doctor once you become an adult. Alternatively, you could visit community health centers or clinics for routine check-ups and consultations.","34":"When we 'waste' water, it means we use it without considering its future use or waste it in ways that make it difficult to reuse, such as using drinking water for activities like flushing the toilet. This is inefficient and should be avoided to conserve our water resources.","35":null,"36":null,"37":null,"38":"Let me clarify. In the function H(x,y), the two inputs are x and y. When we use H(x,x), we're essentially having the function H process the same input x twice. This is why it seems like the program and the input are the same. However, it's important to note that the function is still taking two separate arguments - x and x. It's simply using the same value for both, leading to the identity condition (x=x).","39":"You can also consider visiting a community health center or using online doctor services for routine check-ups and advice if you don't have a personal doctor. Regular check-ups help ensure your health and catch any issues early.","40":"The 'off'ness you're hearing is due to minute discrepancies in timing between the individual notes in a triplet, making them slightly mismatched. While the notes are indeed playing at the intended positions as per the score, there's a slight deviation in the duration between these notes, leading to the perceived 'off'ness in the performance.","41":null,"42":"Cleaning water for reuse takes significant time, resources, and infrastructure. It's not always feasible to carry out this process everywhere, such as in remote areas or communities without access to proper facilities.","43":"The age requirement for the presidency, set by the Constitution, requires a minimum age of 35 years, a US citizenship for at least 14 years, and a 'natural born' citizen status. There's no specified maximum age, which allows individuals of any age to run for office. However, this doesn't mean that people are forced to elect elderly candidates; they have the freedom to not vote for any candidate, to vote for a third party or independent candidate, or to vote for a write-in.","44":"Actually, writing a name on the ballot is your vote, and it's still recorded. But, to be counted towards the official election results, the candidate you've chosen should have been formally certified and should already be listed on the ballot. However, it can symbolize a protest vote or dissatisfaction with the mainstream candidates.","45":null,"46":"A single Walmart store can unionize, but it typically requires a majority of Walmart employees in all of its stores to sign up for the union. This is different from the store level unionization. Furthermore, the number of employees required to unionize for Walmart varies depending on the number of employees in each location and the type of union being formed. It doesn't require the same number of employees like the population of New Hampshire and Vermont.","47":"Well, I'm advocating for equity - everyone who does the same job ought to receive the same pay. It shouldn't matter if the outcomes differ; if the work is equal, the compensation should be too.","48":"The apparent mismatch is due to an optical illusion created by the atmosphere. As the Moon rises, it appears to be illuminated from the side opposite to the Earth, and the Earth's shadow can be seen on the Moon's ascending half. This occurs because light is scattered throughout the atmosphere creating a bright band around the planet. As the Earth rotates, the location where the shadow appears on the Moon seems to shift, but it is actually the Earth's rotation that causes this illusion.","49":"From any point on the sunset ring, you can't see both the moon and the sun simultaneously due to their positions in the sky. The moon would be visible on the opposite side of the Earth, where it's dark at the time you are observing the sunset ring. The moon rises when the sun sets and sets when the sun rises on the opposite hemisphere.","50":"We acknowledge the lack of consensus on the nature and origin of consciousness. While I don't share your belief in a non-physical realm influencing thoughts, I can't definitively say that it doesn't exist. The butterfly effect is an interesting concept, but its practical application remains debatable due to our limited understanding of the universe's intricacies. Therefore, it's essential to approach these matters with an open mind until sufficient evidence is presented.","51":"In fact, isolating bacteriophages from a specific environment can be a complex process that involves culture media, special techniques, and rigorous screening. Bacteriophages can be found naturally in diverse environments such as soil, water, and even human bodily fluids, but their isolation and characterization for therapeutic use can take significant time and labor. It's important to note that bacteriophages are not as easily mass-produced and regulated as traditional antibiotics, so their commercial availability for over-the-counter use is still a complex challenge. As for the investment in phage therapy research, the landscape can be influenced by several factors, including government policies, private funding, and the perceived risks and benefits compared to established treatments.","52":null,"53":"When a Uranium atom decays into Thorium, the process is highly unlikely to be reversed due to the substantial difference in energy levels between the decay particles and the binding energy of Thorium. The decay particles, such as alpha or beta, lose energy as they travel and collide with other atoms, making it impossible for them to re-induce decay in Thorium. This is a phenomenon known as the conservation of energy.","54":"The scenario you've described is quite similar to the magnetic forces at play. In a supernova, the gravitational force and immense pressure push against the electrons of atoms, much like how magnetic repulsion causes force between two magnets at a certain distance. When the conditions are just right, the electrons are forced into an unstable equilibrium, creating a situation where the gravitational force balances the electron pressure. This temporary equilibrium allows for the fusion of heavy elements beyond iron in the supernova, leading to the formation of many of the heavy elements we see in the universe today. However, it's crucial to note that, unlike magnets, atoms do not lock in at a distance in this context.","55":"The proof doesn't hinge on the optimality of the list or the generation method. Instead, it's based on the nature of real numbers, which are inherently uncountable. The diagonalization method used in the proof allows for the creation of a number that cannot be found on any list, but the specifics of 'reals' and 'integers' relationship might be assumptions you're not fully grasping.","56":null,"57":"To clarify your question, the concept of '1s and 0s' primarily applies to digital electronics. Unlike analog circuits, digital circuits can only be in two stable, discrete states - on and off, or 1 and 0, respectively. This binary nature enables digital circuits to perform calculations and store data in a precise manner, making them the foundation of modern computing. However, it's essential to understand that individual components within digital circuits, such as transistors, can still exhibit an analog nature because they can vary in their conductivity levels.","58":null,"59":"In a menstrual cycle, the lining of the uterus is shed, causing the discharge of blood and tissue through the vagina in a process called menstruation. While it's possible that menstrual flow might leak if you stand for extended periods, this is not typical, as the body usually creates a seal during menstruation to prevent the flow from leaving the vagina. However, if you encounter leaks, you might want to consider using period-proof undergarments or pads, and adjusting your position to minimize pressure on the abdomen. It's important to remember that women's bodies are unique and can display subtle differences. Therefore, it's crucial to prioritize personal comfort and hygiene during menstruation.","60":"Did you know that a massive asteroid is believed to have collided with Earth around 66 million years ago, causing the extinction of the dinosaurs? This event, known as the Cretaceous-Paleogene (K-Pg) extinction event, is an intriguing topic that we can delve deeper into if you're interested!","61":null,"62":null,"63":"The Halting Problem and Self-Referential Proof seem to be two different concepts within computer science, but I'll try to connect them for you. The Halting Problem is about finding a general method to predict if an arbitrary program will run infinitely or terminate. Now, Self-Referential Proof is a strategy that uses definitions within the proof itself, as in G\u00f6del's Incompleteness Theorems. A possible connection is that if we have a self-referential program (a program where its own execution is part of its input), the Halting Problem might be applicable to question if this program will run infinitely or halt.","64":"Here's a clarification on the diagonalization proof. It doesn't require any specific method for generating the list. Instead, it demonstrates that by creating a pattern among the listed numbers, a new number can always be derived that isn't part of the list, disproving the notion of a list containing all numbers. It's not about the optimization of the list generation method, but the possibility of finding patterns and creating new numbers based on the patterns found.","65":"Actually, the quantities of radioactive materials dumped into the ocean can indeed have significant consequences for oceanic ecosystems, as well as the food chain that relies on it. The misconception lies in assuming that average concentrations throughout the ocean would render the radioactive waste harmless. On the contrary, these concentrations can still be damaging, as observed in cases like Fukushima and Chernobyl. Additionally, the danger from nuclear waste isn't necessarily proportionate to the destructive power of a nuclear bomb. Different isotopes have different half-lives, meaning they decay at varying rates. This is a crucial factor to consider when weighing the risks associated with nuclear waste disposal.","66":null,"67":null,"68":null,"69":"Weinstein was convicted based on credible evidence, not just based on a rumor.","70":null,"71":null,"72":null,"73":null,"74":null,"75":"I apologize if my comment came across as insensitive.

Good luck with your post!","76":null,"77":"When it comes to dividing an atom, it's not feasible with common tools like a knife or a hammer because atoms are much smaller than the width of a human hair and are held together by extremely strong forces known as nuclear forces. To split an atom, we need to supply more energy than it naturally has in a process known as nuclear fission. Due to the high energy requirements and the instability of splitting atoms, this process is usually controlled in a nuclear reactor or used in atomic bombs. Now, if we consider space travel and a hypothetical spaceship moving at half the speed of light, the kinetic energy involved would indeed be immense. By the theory of relativity, as an object approaches the speed of light, its mass and energy become equivalent, resulting in a significant increase in kinetic energy. This means even a small amount of debris, like a few grams of dust, could cause catastrophic damage to the spacecraft, similar to a nuclear explosion. Such spacecraft are called 'relativistic spacecraft,' and while they're fascinating to consider, they're currently impossible to build due to the challenges in providing the necessary propulsion and creating materials that can sustain the immense forces involved.","78":"Well, stopping a relativistic spacecraft once it's reached such high speeds is a formidable challenge. The spacecraft would need to reverse its direction and apply an equally strong force to counteract its forward momentum. This would require prodigious amounts of energy and time, even if the engine were able to slow down gradually. Slowing down the spacecraft would cause it to travel a significant distance before eventually coming to a halt, making it impractical as a mode of transportation to a specific point, such as a planet. In fact, the force required to bring the spacecraft to a complete stop would generate immense heat, potentially causing severe damage to the spacecraft itself. Instead, it's more efficient to slow down the spacecraft gradually as it approaches its destination, rather than stopping it abruptly. This way, we can ensure the spacecraft lands safely and doesn't cause any unintended harm.","79":"Instead, understanding language is about associating words with their hidden meaning (semantics), not necessarily with images. For instance, if a word acts as a noun, it typically represents a person, place, thing, or idea. The sentence should make sense if you exchange it with another noun.

Additionally, desalination plants are energy-intensive, requiring large amounts of fossil fuels to operate, leading to increased greenhouse gas emissions. They also require significant amounts of land, and the intake and discharge of water can have adverse effects on fragile coastal ecosystems. Desalination should be considered a last resort option for water scarcity in regions such as the Middle East and California, but is not a sustainable or environmentally-friendly solution to the global water crisis.","83":"It sounds like you're imagining a large-scale, mechanical solution to capture methane from the melting Arctic. While it's wonderful that you're thinking creatively about ways to aid the planet, it's crucial to ponder the practicality and ecological impact of such a project.

As of now, only 118 stable elements and about 2,700 unstable isotopes have been discovered. To create new elements beyond the currently known 118, you would need incredibly high-energy blasts, which are challenging to achieve and hard to maintain. So, while the number isn't exactly known, we don't think it's infinite as some elements are particularly stable, and creating them takes a substantial amount of energy.","87":null,"88":"Considering the current understanding of chemistry and the trend of element instability, it's highly improbable that we'll ever see a 9th periodic row.

On the island, no central authority controls the money supply, so initially the new supply wouldn't change the total amount in circulation. However, if the increased supply isn't matched by increased demand for goods or services, over time it could lead to a drop in the shells' value or inflation, as more shells enter the economy. The point is, on an isolated island without a central bank, a fluctuation in the money supply can affect its value.","93":"The government indeed issues bonds, and it does accrue interest on these bonds, some portion of which is paid annually through taxes.

For example, Nike shoes are still just shoes, but their worth might be inflated due to the market's perception, much like how people might undervalue your apples. Another example is investing in a currency like the yen, which faces risks from fluctuating exchange rates or lower values. However, the primary difference between investing in apples and these examples is that in an MLM, the potential buyers are also sellers, and their decision to purchase affects both parties' earnings, creating a fluid market. In such a market, the value of a product isn't only determined by its intrinsic value, but also by the perceived earning potential based on the market size and the efforts of the sellers.","108":"In essence, your question seems to encompass two aspects: the significance of relationships formed at educational institutions, particularly during college and high school, and the importance of alumni donations to these institutions. While bonding with classmates can create enduring friendships, the sentiment of 'alma mater,' or nurturing educational establishment, stems from the notion that these educational institutions offer a shared experience and learning opportunity that shapes one's identity and perspectives. As a result, graduates may want to give back to their alma mater in various ways, such as donating funds, to support future students, improve infrastructure, and reinforce their sense of loyalty and belonging.","109":"The role of DNA can be likened to a blueprint or a set of instructions for protein formation, much like a recipe for baking a cake. DNA itself didn't set out to define specific traits. Instead, it provides the necessary sequence of chemicals needed for protein synthesis, which in turn guides the development of unique traits based on the organism's evolutionary history and occasional random mutations. These traits may include characteristics that allow a species to survive and adapt in its environment.","110":"In a sense, you could say it's a kind of biological algorithm.

To elaborate on your analogy, if you mass-produced your blood paintings and they remained unsold, you wouldn't become rich, as they would be devalued due to oversupply. Similarly, a small portion of ownership in a successful company, like Amazon, is worth more than many unsold paintings because the company continues to grow and provide valuable services to its customers, which in turn increases the value of its shares.","113":null,"114":"To clarify, I was just referring to our tutoring session's pricing structure.

These subatomic particles can spontaneously materialize and disappear, and it is believed that their interactions might have led to an intense concentration that ultimately resulted in the Big Bang. This isn't an event with a conventional cause, but rather a self-sustaining process within the quantum vacuum.","116":"The concept of 'invention' is indeed just an analogy. In reality, the universe as we know it came into existence due to the spontaneous expansion of a singularity. From our current understanding, this resulted from an initial quantum fluctuation that happened in an infinitely dense and hot state known as the Planck epoch. At this level, the laws of physics as we know them no longer apply, and the very notion of causality becomes difficult.

They're designed with a focus on power conservation and heat dissipation. The simplicity of their architecture allows for more power-efficient operations, leading to lower power consumption and heat generation.

However, Walmart does have the right to evaluate this proposal, and while they must adhere to federal laws that protect employee rights to organize, they could potentially challenge the legitimacy of the proposal. It's important to remember that while many corporations and companies may not have unions, each organization has its own policies and practices regarding employee organization and collective bargaining.","201":null,"202":"It's always fascinating to see determination like yours--even with such slim odds, you put it to the test 100 times. And interestingly, there's only about a 37% chance that you won't get the 1\/100. Don't stop asking questions!","203":null,"204":"Indeed, the galaxies surrounding ours, such as the Andromeda Galaxy, are moving away from us as part of the ongoing expansion of the universe. This is evidenced through observations of redshift, which indicates that galaxies are receding from one another.","205":"Right now, there's a lot of debate about the physics of the universe's expansion because it's still a theory. According to Hubble's theory, there's no center to the universe, and every point is moving away from every other point at a specific speed (Hubble constant). From any location in the universe, you'd see this same effect of galaxies either moving away from us (redshift) or towards us (blueshift).","206":null,"207":"Although you suggested that humans don't have children immediately after puberty as a point of contention, you also acknowledged that the premise was false. Given the initial focus on biology, the answer regarding the delay in childbearing after puberty would be rooted in biological mechanisms, namely hormonal balances and maturation processes. There might be social factors as well, but the primary focus remains biological.","208":"Apologies if my responses seemed repetitive. I'm emphasizing the biological aspect of your question because it seemed there might be a misunderstanding. You asked for the biological reason why humans aren't ready for kids at puberty, while animals often are. I believe the social factors play a significant role in this difference. The biological responses some other users provided may help us understand some physiological aspects, but they don't address the primary question I'm trying to answer. However, I do recognize that you received a variety of responses, some of which made compelling points.","209":"In quantum physics, the concept of randomness is somewhat nuanced. While it's true that the behavior of particles can be unpredictable and appear random, it's not true randomness of the kind you might think. Unlike everyday randomness, quantum randomness is not an inherent property of the particles but is caused by the 'wave-particle duality' and the 'superposition principle'. This means that until a measurement is made, particles can exist in many states simultaneously and only when measured, do they 'collapse' into a definite state with a probability distribution. So, it's not that quantum physics has proven true randomness that's beyond just unpredictable; rather, it's the indeterminacy and probabilistic nature of particles that can sometimes seem like true randomness to us.","210":"Apoptosis is actually a process activated by many types of cells in the body, not just skin cells. It helps maintain our health by removing damaged or malfunctioning cells that could potentially harm the body by releasing harmful substances. This process ensures the survival of only healthy cells, contributing to the overall well-being of the organism.","211":"Indeed, it's an interesting evolutionary perspective you've raised. When cells, such as skin cells, experience excessive damage due to ionization, it could potentially lead to errors in DNA replication, increasing the chance of mutations that might cause cancer. By choosing to die, these cells might be serving a protective role, limiting the spread of potential harmful mutations in their descendants. This self-destruct mechanism, known as programmed cell death or apoptosis, seems to have evolved as a mechanism to maintain the integrity and health of tissues, while minimizing the risk of cancerous
