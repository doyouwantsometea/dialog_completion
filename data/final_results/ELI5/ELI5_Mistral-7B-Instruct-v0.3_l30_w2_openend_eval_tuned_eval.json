I stopped caring when your post was removed, just been stringing you along seeing how worked up you can get about it.

You relearn whenever you get a new car and has to get used to how it feels - especially if it uses a different engine type, for example switching to diesel (or back) requires you to completely relearn how a car should feel.   Once you've learned how your car (or other motorized transport) feels at all speeds, you don't need any of the instrument panel except maybe a way to estimate how much fuel you have left.","7":"&gt;I'm not sure what I'm supposed to be missing by not looking at the RPM when changing gears?  Well, for starters you're leaving a bunch of acceleration on the table by   &gt; skipping gears  And not using the peak of your power curve as much as you could be.   If you're consistently skipping the same gear that'll sacrifice a bit of longevity, though whether you'll keep the car long enough to need it is another question.   Fuel efficiency is definitely improved by using the bottom of your rev range, without going too low, which is literally impossible to judge accurately by feel for most people - though if you have perfect pitch that's not necessarily a concern.","8":"Yes, and girls in \u201cearly tribes\u201d regularly had kids as teenagers.

Yes, okay, discussion of biology was a necessary part of answering the question. It\u2019s a question that referenced puberty in mammals - it self-evidently was going to refer to biological topics. However, your question was asking for the biological reason that humans aren\u2019t ready for kids whilst animals are. The premise is false, and the reason the premise is false is due to social and not biological factors. As I\u2019ve said over and over and over. You may as well be asking \u201cwhat\u2019s the economic rationale for the earth rotating around the sun\u201d.   And for your last sentence - I\u2019m not the one trying to steer this away from a question about raising children and into a semantic debate about   I\u2019m gonna respond every single time btw. ","12":"That's true, I have read some data myself about alaska which has had a ubi program since 1980. This program showed that compared to the rest of the country alaska had reduced the cost of the average item for a household following implementation with a steady rise flowing that arose from inflation. Notably this inflation continued at a rate in line with the rest of the country meaning costs are still slightly lower in alaska than the nation at large. It was also interesting, as alaska in this time saw no significant change to full time workers as a proportion of the population but an increase in part time workers. This implies that those with good jobs were not leaving their jobs but those without were getting new ones that were mostly part time.","13":"You actually want the high boiling point.  We want the fluid to have certain properties when it comes out of the boiler (we don't actually want steam) and when we have a high boiling point, we can put in more energy.  Also, water can store a lot of energy before it actually changes temperature, way more than acetone.    The turbine speed is related to how much fluid you pump through it, not the temperature although the fluid type can effect that.  The thing that varies with the temperature is the torque, how hard the turbine can try to turn stuff.","14":"Look up \u201cisotopes of helium\u201d, \u201cisotopes of neon\u201d etc. on Wikipedia and there will be a section labelled \u201clist of isotopes\u201d which shows you a lot of information including what isotopes they decay into if they\u2019re radioactive.   No, noble gasses are not turning into a 19th column. what makes you think that?   Yes, hydrogen-1 will _never_ undergo radioactive decay. Stars are different, they are fusing elements together, it\u2019s a completely different process to radioactive decay.","15":"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/3\/37\/Decay_Chain_of_Uranium-238.svg  https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/9\/93\/Decay_Chain_of_Actinium.svg  These are the decay chains of uranium-238 and uranium-235, as you can see both of them decay into an isotope of radon before decaying further. So no radon is not at the end. Many radioactive isotopes undergo these sequences where they keep decaying into other isotopes until they get to a stable one.","16":"&gt;Oh cool, so does that mean that, like radon, all of the noble elements will eventually turn into lead?  What makes your ask this question? Helium will never \u201cdecay\u201d into lead, nor will neon etc.   When stars explode a large amount of heavier elements are formed, but again this isn\u2019t the same process.    &gt;Could lead ever decay into something else? Is there a half-life of lead?  I\u2019ve already told you that every single element has radioactive isotopes, see: https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Isotopes_of_lead - note just how many radioactive isotopes lead has, many are decay products from other elements, lead is the heaviest element that still has stable isotopes.   Isotopes are atoms with the same number of protons but different numbers of neutrons. Only specific configurations of protons and neutrons are stable, everything else is unstable and undergoes radioactive decay.   &gt;If lead does decay into something else, it would probably take us billions of years to find out, right?  See the link above    I think checking out some educational YouTube videos would help you. Try this one: https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=fES21E0qebw","17":"There already is a 7th row, and within our lifetimes there likely will be some elements added to the 8th row.   There will never be a 19th group unless IUPAC decides to change the layout of the periodic table (which it won\u2019t do). Just a note on this, the periodic table actually looks like this: https:\/\/encrypted-tbn3.gstatic.com\/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcRJaY9NjvEqGbvN3HSDyyO3GKilL7zoRWTdyTCf-3xYkqXqSvTt0V_onoGqvw (google Wide Periodic Table if that doesn\u2019t work), so technically it has 32 columns but those between groups 2 and 3 aren\u2019t given group numbers.","18":"Why do you think I have any actual firsthand experience in this field? I read journals and understand the science.   It took about 70 years for the rest of the elements in the 7th row to be created, that was elements 95-118). The last few discovered decay within fractions of seconds. The faster something decays the harder it is to create and then detect.   We will likely see element 120 within 5 years, but getting to element 169 (which would be the first element on the 9th row) is going to to take a lot longer and will need improvements in technology if it can even be created at all.   Is there a reason you are so obsessed with this?","19":"Is it really important though? None of these elements have real world applications. It\u2019s mostly a dick waving contest.   If it\u2019s boring in school it\u2019s mostly because of boring teachers or boring curricula, or both. Chemistry is an amazing science because it\u2019s so essential to everything around us.   If it takes 5 years to discover element 119, and even if it takes 5 years past that for each other element you\u2019re looking at nearly 50000 years. And that\u2019s a theoretical number pulled out of nowhere with no basis in reality. There\u2019s other problems to overcome, like heavier elements needing electrons to travel at faster than the speed of light and somehow overcoming the repulsion of protons in the nucleus.","20":"Ha ha ha ha ha!!!

You people are so easily corralled like the cows you all are. WAKE up. You have been made to believe the common cold is COVID.  Every time in your life when you were sick with fever and sore throat and took a few ibuprofen and went into work or school you killed people... Only difference is we were not using the media to hyper inflate and sensationalize it to remove a president. I don't like Donald and I would never vote for him and I can see through this scam.

Lol","21":"It is funny how that episode came out four years ago and yet all of the people still believe what our media says. It's kinda silly. That is a great episode though. Ha ha","22":"The reason people panicked when Covid started is because it is way more contagious than the flu. If it was \u201cjust another flu\u201d it would\u2019ve been over a long time ago.","23":"There is more to the world than just Canada. If everyone with the flu quarantined until it was dead then it likely wouldn\u2019t be gone forever because it also jumps between animals.","24":"Social distancing and mask wearing is even more effective at reducing the spread of influenza than COVID-19, and we're generally more vigilant about cleaning and hand washing these days, which also provides protection against the spread of influenza.  So we've received a substantial bonus from (generally) following COVID-related restrictions.","25":"I said go talk to a virologist to get answers to your questions about getting rid of the flu.  You said something about talking to someone who you think is a virologist who said something no virologist would ever say.  So whoever you spoke to is somewhere between not a virologist at all and the world's worst virologist.  That said - you want to learn whether we're in a position to eradicate the flu - go talk to a (competent) virologist and stop dicking around on reddit.  And 47 reported cases may mean hundreds or thousands or tens of thousands of unreported (but still potentially contagious) cases.  47 may not mean what you think it means.  Most people who get the flu just deal with it, and many have mild symptoms not worth reporting.","26":"But that's simply an inference from things we \\*do\\* perceive. You have no way of knowing that those stars you mentioned exist, you simply trust many different things, from the scientists who say they found the data to the possibility that the universe is built on a firm set of rules that can be extrapolated from.  &amp;#x200B;  The point is, you may be able to \\*infer\\* that something exists, but all you really know is what you perceive, everything else is guesswork. Hence the question of \"if a tree falls in the woods and no one is around to hear it, does it make a sound\" is only a \"flawed principle\" if you treat the theories science has discovered as some hard and fast absolute, which they are not. What if the universe actually worked such that collisions only cause vibrations if someone is around to observe them? How would any scientific principle ever discover that, given that science is based on observation?","27":"To be clear, I am not advocating for a distrust of science. This is philosophy, which is focused on very different things.  &amp;#x200B;  A key point is to imagine that we \\*do\\* live in that universe, where unless something is observed by a human it doesn't happen. How would that affect us?     Not one bit.  &amp;#x200B;  If the universe only operates differently if it has no way of being observed, then by definition it can't affect us. Science is still as useful as it always was. The point of philosophy is to consider the \"what ifs\", and see whether that has any bearing on how we \\*should\\* behave.","28":"And why do you think that has an effect on me?  Waste your money the way you want to; no skin off my back.  Hell, for all you know, I support Sanders, too.","29":"There are a few effects; ionization will break apart biologically important molecules, which can then become \"radicals\" which can break apart more molecules or damage proteins. Too much damage to cellular structures can cause the cell to destroy itself, as can too much damage to DNA. This is why bad sunburn causes skin to peel off, the epidermal and dermal layers received enough damage to decide they need to kill themselves for the greater good. However, if DNA is damaged in certain ways, it can lead to cancer. It's not that DNA can't be repaired at all, it's that it is the \"master program\" for the cell and can be modified in ways that make the cell do things that it isn't supposed to.   You can also receive too much damage to important cells like in organs. It's actually therapeutic in some situations, such as using radioactive iodine to destroy some of a large thyroid, but many organs are not good at regenerating so the damage can hamper their functionality.","30":"Sports are games? A sport is defined as \"an activity involving physical exertion and skill in which an individual or team competes against another or others for entertainment.\" How is hockey not a sport?","31":"Games can be sports. It can go both ways. I just gave you a dictionary definition of a sport of which hockey meets all the criteria. You honestly can't be this stupid.","32":"The 2nd and 3rd notes of the triple are \"off\" from the normal beat of the music...yes, they are correct according to the score. The 1st note of the triplet is most often on a downbeat so it sounds like it is in the right place.   Sorry, I'm sure I'm going in the wrong direction here. If you can give us some more guidance it might trigger a better answer. I definitely know what it's like to struggle for a term re: music theory. It makes sense, but only after you've already studied lots of it.","33":"Now that is a good question... I know I had some sex education in school but it wasn't very good. It's a common problem in schools because people are scared to talk about it. Some of the fear is that it will encourage kids to start having sex early but I think it's important for everyone to know how the body works. Everyone has one, so why hide it?  Kids need to know what is normal and what is not normal, so if there is a problem, they can talk to a doctor. Puberty is scary with everything changing and a lot of people feel shame about it when they shouldn't. I'm glad you're asking questions ahead of time so you're a little more prepared.","34":"On top of what everyone has said, it could also be a psychological issue. Some symptoms of depression, for example, can manifest as increased sleep, decreased levels of energy and lack of focus.","35":"It's good that you're aware of it, but keep in mind that proper diagnosis can only come for a licensed professional. If this has been happening, it might be a good idea to get a professional opinion. I meant more to say that it's sometimes difficult to differentiate between illnesses of the body and illnesses of the mind, specially around things like sleep, which are connected to both. It could also be a part physical, part psychological.","36":"I haven\u2019t played Pok\u00e9mon go since it was popular 5 years ago...

It was just a hypocritical comment, I\u2019m not lambasting you because you may have spent money on something years ago. Also, not that it matters, but I couldn\u2019t be farther from a republican lmao. But the fact that you somehow think calling me that is an epic comeback says a lot about you.","38":"If materialism is true then consciousness must be a direct product of matter. It could be that a sufficiently complex organization of matter leads to consciousness (self aware matter) as an emergent phenomena in our universe.","39":"I realise that, thats why I'm telling you to do it yourself.  Its not a particularly rational approach to take for atomic theory, but there are good tangible ways to test it.  Heisenberg was found in a cave with holding a lump of cadmium next to an open nuclear reactor. People told him to check the math because he math was wrong. Oppenheimer showed that very very conclusively.","40":"No they thought they needed more than they did, the firing mechanism is where they messed up.   And ya I do, they messed up the math, partially because the guy in charge of the math hated it when people told him to check it.. You can find his notes and look at it.  If they did then they had the pieces and they just calmly decided not to use the bomb and lose the war because I guess they felt bad about the whole war thing. You are right, that makes more sense.","41":"They can't legally prevent workers from unionizing, so they use fear, intimidation, and propaganda to prevent unionization efforts in the first place. Every major business does this. Most new hires will be bombarding with training videos and employee handbooks saying unions are bad.  They can have anti-union literature and posters in break rooms. They can fire people who express pro-union sentiments and claim it was for another reason. They can threaten to do all kinds of thing. ","42":"I'm not sure what you mean. All the things I said above are legal. If workers follow the proper laws and procedures and vote to unionize, a company can't just say \"no\" and send the cops to slaughter everyone like they used to. They can do all sorts of things to prevent unionization or retaliate for successful or unsuccessful efforts, but they can't just say \"no\" and that's the end.","43":"LOL...

Also, the concept of Broker-Dealer is important from a regulatory perspective.   wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Broker-dealer  Regulation is a whole other ball of wax (Chinese Walls!).","46":"You will have to wait a lot of time to see that, as currently the land mass is about (in 250 million years) to form a new supercontinent if the continental drift doesn't drasticaly change it's course in the next million years.  There are several hypothesis and models about how this will look like, these are: Novopangea, Pangea Proxima\/Ultima, Aurica and Amasia.  The thing is that in most of them, the mayority of the land mass will be found in the northern hemisphere (for example, in the Amasia hypothesis, all the land mass is on the northern hemisphere except for the Antarctica). So you should be asking this in 250 million years in the future.  Note: I may be wrong, I just happened to see this on a video.","47":"The earth have existed for eons, and during that time the continents shape has changed multiple times.  So yeah, Pangea is just one of them, just that we know much more of it because of all the evidence left from the age of dinosaurs, that happens to be a lot.","48":"It's understandable to think that since we probably never live to see any major change of the continents locations. Remember that this process that it's currently happening, takes hundreds millions of years to complete, so we can only suppose how it will end up.","49":"Imagine a brand new whole inteligent species from that time trying to figure it out how were the continents located using human fossils, artifacts and ruins as clues.  Well, we know for sure that Australia moves 7cm to the north every year, so in a couple million years it will probably clash with Indonesia, then all the way to the north until finally clashing with China.","50":"You were looking at just economic policy, there are policies other than economic - namely social and foreign.

If physical things *can* interact with non-physical things, I\u2019d love for someone to explain it to me.","52":"Yes but neurosurgery proves that fucking with the brain itself causes changes in what consciousness feels like. Since the brain is a physical thing, consciousness must be physically caused, since no one has yet explained how non-physical things could interact with physical things. In other words, if conscious thought were on \"another plane,\" fucking with the brain itself shouldn't cause changes in consciousness. But it does.","53":"&gt;I'm not sure what I'm supposed to be missing by not looking at the RPM when changing gears?  Well, for starters you're leaving a bunch of acceleration on the table by   &gt; skipping gears  And not using the peak of your power curve as much as you could be.   If you're consistently skipping the same gear that'll sacrifice a bit of longevity, though whether you'll keep the car long enough to need it is another question.   Fuel efficiency is definitely improved by using the bottom of your rev range, without going too low, which is literally impossible to judge accurately by feel for most people - though if you have perfect pitch that's not necessarily a concern.","54":"They \u201cget away\u201d with it because they\u2019re not doing anything illegal.

Not saying I agree that sex work should be stigmatized but it's definitely different from encouraging a crowd to do a chant at a sporting event.","57":"Puritanical religious bullshit? I dunno. Because religious people like to think no one should ever enjoy sex, so someone who's whole job is doing sexy fun stuff is inherently an evil tempting influence.  Which in turn forces most sex-work underground, where it gets mixed up with other illegal activities, further making it seem like something only \"losers\" do.  God forbid two consenting adults have fun.","58":"I touched on that already. The computer processes a bunch of numbers, and then sends values to your screen in the format [R,G,B] where R, G, and B are 3 numbers that range from 0 to 255 or from 00000000 to 11111111 in binary. The Monitor turns on each pixel to the corresponding value (take a magnifying glass and look at your monitor, there really are tiny red, green, and blue lights making up the screen!) and that is interpreted by your brain as an image.","59":"Why would that limit the resolution? You just send a set of 3 numbers for each pixel. For 1080p, thats 1920 x 1080 pixels x 3 numbers x 60 frames per second=373,248,000 numbers per second, or in more familiar units 3.73 MegaBytes per Second. That's what a MegaByte *is* 1 million 8bit numbers. Considering most PCs today have GigaBytes of memory and Terabytes of storage--1000 and 1million times larger respectively--video display isn't that taxing.  The monitor ultimately just turns lights on and off. The final number goes to each red\/green\/blue subpixel and controls a power supply, regulating how much voltage it puts out, which ultimately controls how much light is allowed through or blocked.","60":"&gt;How does it send to each?  Lots and lots of wires.  &gt;How does it do shades?  As I said, each number ranges from 0 to 255, where 0 is \"black\" and 255 is \"as bright as it can\".  &gt;How many transistors are we talking about here?  Tens of billions. At this point, transistors in modern chips have features 5 nanometers across, that's only about 45 silicon atoms across. They really pack them in.","61":"&gt;Analog devices still use transistors, but they allow for many shades of grey between 0 current an maximum current. Transistors work like switches, with current flowing from the Source to the Drain, controlled by the Gate. This lets a tiny voltage at the Gate control a much larger current, like how a tiny valve can completely shut off a pipe. Analog devices can take a range of voltages through the gate that gradually turns on the current flowing through the device.   Remember, 1 and 0 are just what we call ON and OFF. Its all a matter of how much current is flowing. We get to choose how to interpret that.","62":"When I redirect I do my best to point OP to a sub that fits better. I think that's important for this sub as much as any other. Most are glad for the help.","63":"So what is happening here is the vantablack is absorbing all the light.  So there is light bouncing off the car and coming into your eye.  So it's not like there is some information coming from the car into your eyes and brains saying, 'hey its really really black right here'.  What is happening is the cells in your eye are not getting any information at all, and those cells in turn do not activate the brain in the same way.  So your brain perceives it as what we call black.  But its really just a lack of information.","64":"That's right.  Remember there isn't really a real 'black'.  That is just a word we made up for what our brain does.  Pretend humans never developed eyes and we never evolved to have the sense of sight.  We have no idea of color or what things look like or anything.  Light particles are still bouncing around and being reflected off everything, everywhere, but in the case of the vantablack, when light hits that area, it just reflects less light than other surfaces. (less information is being reflected)  Another way to look at it is take a digital camera and point it at the car.  Well there is a sensitive chip in there that is like an eye.  The light hits the chip, and activate certain parts of that chip which the computer makes into an image on the screen.  The vantablack areas did not activate that part of the chip.  So the computer reads the image file and says... No data here!  and then when you look at it on the screen the computer doesn't light up that pixel and you perceive black there.","65":"exactly.  If you look a picture of the stealth bomber (B2) its the same.  Looks like a void space in the sky.  Now with the car, I'm not sure how legal that is.  Probably varies from country to country.

It basically gives your body the \"I have seen that one before\" power over sickness.  However you need to be kind of healthy to get vaccinated. There are certain conditions under which you cannot receive vaccines (you are very young, your immune system is gone due to birth defects or cancer treatment,. ..).  These people rely on an effect called \"herd immunity\".  Basically you die if you get infected but you never get infected because everyone around you is vaccinated. This prevents a disease from spreading.  Unfortunately to achieve herd immunity roughly 98% of the population have to be vaccinated.  So for me personally as a vaccinated, healthy adult it makes no difference if you are vaccinated or not. For my little daughter or my cancer stricken relative it is a life or death situation (unfortunately quite literally).  Therefore if you are healthy and able to get a shot, go get a shot. It will safe someone's life.  (Kind of the same principle as you clear a lane for an ambulance. Yes it is inconvenient for you for 30 seconds but you help safe a live and you would expect others to do it for you).","70":"Depends on where you come from.

If a sound wave falls outside of that range, you are not going to be able to hear it.  However, that doesn't mean that you aren't able to perceive it in other ways.  We can \"feel\" sound waves outside of our normal range of hearing - both above and below the 20\/20,000 thresholds.  The 18.9 Hz wave is no different - you can't hear it, but you can feel it is there.  In many people, this feeling manifests itself as fear or paranoia.  You can \"feel\" something in the room, but none of your other senses register anything consciously.  This incongruence greats discomfort,t which manifests as fear.  It is called the \"Ghost Frequency\" because it is theorized that many \"haunted\" areas simply produce tones close to 18.9 Hz (through resonance or other natural quirks) and people associate the fear response with a \"presence\" in the area.","72":"You have like 5 people telling you the same thing and all you do is argue.

Communicate.","77":"Alright, so H(a,b) is when you describe what H does. You have to call them differently because they're different arguments, even if they could be the same.  H(x,x) is then running that routine with *specific* arguments. Essentially, it runs H(a,b), but with a=x and b=x. The cause of the transformation is that we're no longer looking at the definition of H, but at the application of H.","78":"Depends on where you come from. In Germany you have a general practitioner that is \"your doctor\". It gets documented with your health insurance.  In Norway you get a doctor assigned and are not allowed to go to a different one, except for emergencies (afaik).","79":"The 2nd and 3rd notes of the triple are \"off\" from the normal beat of the music...yes, they are correct according to the score. The 1st note of the triplet is most often on a downbeat so it sounds like it is in the right place.   Sorry, I'm sure I'm going in the wrong direction here. If you can give us some more guidance it might trigger a better answer. I definitely know what it's like to struggle for a term re: music theory. It makes sense, but only after you've already studied lots of it.","80":"The rainwater has to be cleaned, the grass only lasts a summer and has to be baled for winter or supplemented with feed that has to be made in factories. They have to be sheltered in lit and heated sheds. They have to be milked and the milk is trucked into factories to make dairy products. And so on. Farming isn't just a matter of throwing a few cows in a field and then leaving them to it till you're ready to kill them.","81":"Internationally, skin whitening has received criticism even within the Asian communities because racism towards darker skinned Asians is still extremely prominent in countries like Vietnam or the Philippines, that have more diverse skin tones. There's still an underlying vein that whiteness is equated with attractiveness, and a lot of the motivation behind skin whitening stems from that idea.","82":"No, not really, because for that to be the case, racism would have to be considered a historical past time, and not something that still actively happens in many societies across the globe. There is still a stigma within the fashion industry that lighter skin is better, there's been work done to change this narrative, but we still have a long way to go in that sense.","83":"The CPU is designed so that if you feed it certain \"numbers\" (the binary numbers are just for human usability - it's all just a series of electrical signals to the CPU) it will perform certain operations. Some of those operations expect additional numbers to be input as part of the instruction (usually, addresses of memory that contain the data). This is all just based on the complex physical arrangement of the transistors and other components within the CPU.  We have a lookup table of what numbers represent what instructions. It's called an **instruction set**. A popular one is x86, which you can read about [here](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/X86_instruction_listings#Original_8086\/8088_instructions).","84":"The CPU is designed that way based on the arrangement of transistors and other components.

If you want to see what it looks like inside a CPU you can watch [this video](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=Fxv3JoS1uY8).  The best I can do for ELI5: using transistors you can build logic gates. Using logic gates you can build logical functions. Transistors can also control which logic gates get activated based on a given input. You change which transistors are activated by sending signals to certain CPU pins in a certain order. The CPU is designed such that it would automatically read instructions from certain pins when powered on (which is where the BIOs\/boot process comes in). [Transistors to gates](https:\/\/www.cs.bu.edu\/~best\/courses\/modules\/Transistors2Gates\/).  If you have the basic building blocks to form transistors and\/or logic gates, you can build a fully functional computer, which is how people have simulated computers inside other software such as Minecraft or Factorio.","85":"That process has already been explained to you in [another comment](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/explainlikeimfive\/comments\/gilmgj\/eli5_how_does_a_computer_learn_those_first_few\/fqgpkp3\/).  You seem to be under the assumption that every result calculated by the CPU is literally turned into pixels. That's clearly not the case, computers calculate all sorts of things for different purposes. The software needs to determine what to do with the result. In the case that the result needs to be displayed on screen, the software will tell the monitor how to do so (via the graphics processor).","86":"They get that info from your credit report\/history, which again, should be obtainable only with private info like your social, full name and signature or electronic equivalent.

You seem to think that the business model is still like it was in the 50's where planes were only half full and everything was free.   It's not.  Deregulation changed all of that.   The current business model is: pack as many people as possible in the plane (by enticing them with low prices) and then selling them stuff while you've got them essentially held hostage.  &gt;but this is completely unrelated to whether people get off in ATL.  The operating cost is.      Tell me about the plane full of people that wanted to buy a ticket and couldn't.  Is those tens of thousands in lost revenue unrelated?","94":"COVID is significantly more contagious than influenza, and COVID (unlike the flu) is prone to superspreader events.  So you'll see far more COVID spread than influenza spread under the same conditions.","95":"The constitutional reason would be \"Then don't vote for them.\" Unlike a minimum age, which is supposed to impose a minimum amount of life experience as a qualification, there's no such thing as \"too much experience\" in this context. You're free to note vote for them if you feel they don't represent you, but being \"representative of the people\" isn't a requirement.","96":"That's not true.

The circular shadow of the Earth has an orientation that depends on what direction is \"down\" to the observer.

At the same time, there is a hemisphere of Earth where you can see the Sun (generally called \"daytime\").  Most of the time, where is an overlap between these two where you can see the Moon during the day (ignoring it's hard ...).  The eclipse is a \"special\" time where the two hemispheres touch at their edges.  As the Sun and Moon move apart, the overlapping section of the Earth in both becomes thinner and longer.  At the eclipse, it's at its thinnest, only minutes long, but it goes all the way around.  Note, this presumes that you don't have any trees, mountains, or buildings in the way, and the people in the video clearly had to trek to a specific place near them to achieve this.","102":"The rules are definitely different for creative people.  :)  Business people want an aura of \"I am reliable and trustworthy and won't do anything to surprise you\".

Yeah, I imagine there are.  Should you give up on business because of that?  Probably not, and I hope you don't!

The idea of having tens of thousands of people try to run a company (each stock holder) would be a surefire way to end any company. Thus, like government, people are appointed to the board based on the majority of stock ownership.   I have no idea how you think just splitting stock would somehow be a solution for that, as every single stock issued dilutes the rest....

The alpha\/beta\/gamma particles coming out might crash around and damage other atoms, but this is a result of the decay and doesn't precipitate more decay in most cases (fission can be an exception).  &amp;#x200B;  For fission, you can imagine the nucleus like a deformed ball. Unstable nuclei will \"oscillate\" such that the ball will get more spherical and more elongated repeatedly. If it manages to stretch to far, it'll break apart.

Sure, some of them are from people being idiots and not using birth control. But a lot are from birth control failing. So people did take precautions (birth control) and still got pregnant (despite taking precautions not to).   So really, what you're saying, all those women would have to do, is not have sex. Which, in a way, is a valid point. But given the way humans are, that's not a feasable advice and not something you can base your argument on.

You can send 5 volts of electricity to any electrical component, what happens when you do that is going to depend on what the component is designed to do (and also depends on whether you're sending AC or DC current).  If you send 5 volts to the digital processor in my example above, it would be interpreted as a 1\/On\/True however you want to represent that. A string of those might represent an instruction or something.  If you send the same 5 volts to a 12 volt analog LED, it might light up with about 40% brightness.

When you rewind the clock, things get closer and closer together until at some point, the energy is packed together so tightly that spacetime has to be described with quantum mechanics, but there are numerous problems with formulating such a theory.  &gt;I am hope full that when a nuclear clock is finally created (much more accurate than an atomic clock) we may start to unwrap some of the mysteries of time.

If so, then why does the fact that that is also true of a 13-18 year old mean that humans aren\u2019t capable of raising kids at the age of 13-18?  2. If you took a hamster that was raised in a cage and did the same experiment, it would die. So why doesn\u2019t that mean that hamsters are also incapable of raising young?  3a. If humans had never developed past a hunter-gatherer society and still personally foraged for food, do you agree that humans would generally have better survival skills than we do now?  3b. If we don\u2019t have the same survival skills as wild animals because of our modern society with all its incredible complexity and resources, is that a result of cultural and social changes, or biological ones? ","150":"That\u2019s exactly the argument you did make though:  &gt; If you just threw a 13 year old into the wild with no clothes, tools, or food, they'd be dead. Those other animals would live, their tools are physical. The human's tool is the brain which isn't fully developed until AFTER what would we would even consider to be adulthood","151":"Yes, and girls in \u201cearly tribes\u201d regularly had kids as teenagers. So we\u2019re back to square one.   You now will say they had support from mothers and aunts. So do orangutans. So do lions. I\u2019m not an anthropologist but as far as I\u2019m aware that\u2019s also true of the majority of animals that live in groups. So why is it that they\u2019re \u201ccapable\u201d of raising children but a 17 year old girl isn\u2019t?   What\u2019s your actual question again? ","152":"Oh Jesus Christ, you\u2019ve actually posted the definition of \u201cbiological\u201d. Copy and pasted from the dictionary. Fuck me sideways  You said \u201cit is biological\u201d. Specifically what were you referring to by \u201cit\u201d? That\u2019s what I was I was asking about.   ","153":"The answer to that question is \u201cyes\u201d. Six or seven people have told you as much.   The reason that humans don\u2019t have children immediately after reaching puberty, is not biological.   Remember you\u2019ve accepted that your original premise, that the question was predicated on, wasn\u2019t true? Why you doing this","154":"Woo I absolutely nailed you with that last response. Literally just repeating your own hypocritical words back to you. oh man I can\u2019t believe you handed me that opening on a plate like that, too perfect.   Have a good day in work, I hope you\u2019ve learned from all of this","155":"Radioactive decay is very much a quantum process, and the half-life comes from the binding energy and stability of the nucleus. The alpha\/beta\/gamma particles coming out might crash around and damage other atoms, but this is a result of the decay and doesn't precipitate more decay in most cases (fission can be an exception).  &amp;#x200B;  For fission, you can imagine the nucleus like a deformed ball. Unstable nuclei will \"oscillate\" such that the ball will get more spherical and more elongated repeatedly. If it manages to stretch to far, it'll break apart. This is a decent analogy, though being somewhat quantum mechanical it isn't quite that simple.","156":"Generally, you won't be able to add back to the nucleus without fusion, which requires high energy and generally doesn't work well on elements heavier than iron as putting in more nucleons into such nuclei make them bound less strongly. This is why it is said heavy elements originate in supernovae, normal stars don't have the energy to fuse beyond iron. If the nucleus is unstable enough and gets run into, it can cause it to break apart, which is exploited by nuclear reactors to sustain the controlled fission reactions.","157":"So as an example, S(t) could be \"Count how many words the sentence t has and add two.\" You could then look at S(S) and see that S has 11 words and so get 13 in total. Does such a program S make sense to you?","158":"&gt; The actual proof, I imagine, involves a whole bunch of symbols  It's not super hard to understand. If you can understand Cantor's diagonalization argument, then it should be doable. There's also a little bit of interplay between programs and functions that might be a bit hard to follow at first.  https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Cantor%27s_diagonal_argument","159":"&gt; (I'm one of those people who'd say \"just add the number you've created to the list\"  The assumption initially made was \"this list contains all the numbers\". No other assumptions. If you have to start adding numbers, then the list didn't contain all numbers, and you've proven that this assumption \"list with all numbers\" is impossible. Doesn't matter how clever you are, how many hours you spend adding exceptions you found, what you end up with is a list, and you've proven it won't contain all the numbers.","160":"&gt;  \"there must be a better way to generate a list containing all of the numbers, and my initial list wasn't generated optimally.\"   The key is, no matter how you generated the list, how well thought-out it was, since diagonal argument assumes nothing of what's in the list or how it was made, the same argument still proves it's not complete.","161":"I feel like you\u2019re being purposely obtuse here.  Potassium is slightly radioactive, but you also need it to live.  Uranium, plutonium, and the like are not essential for life, and are magnitudes more radioactive.

I\u2019m not sure how much simpler we can make this.","162":"A big tornado will rip down everything in its path, unless it\u2019s a reinforced concrete bunker with quite thick walls. And even if you do that, the house is still going to get ripped down to that structure unless you build it like a vault with bulletproof windows and doors, so you are talking probably $500,000 fo a house the size of a small apartment. It just doesn\u2019t make sense. And like someone else said, tornadoes happen often, but still hit such a tiny minority of houses. It\u2019s just not that often that houses will get hit.","163":"I have no idea if this is the case. Because I do not have information on something does not mean that it was done with ill intent.

That's why dividends exist. It's not the only way to look at it though. Because without the business keeping that profit to invest back into the business, it could never grow, giving up increasing value in the future.  Take manufacturing, say that you build widgets, each widget nets x profit. That x value can be given out as dividends or it can be used to increase the number of widgets we make and sell. So, by giving up x now and letting the company build another production line of widgets, next year, i get 3x (2x for 2 years of profits, plus x for the new production line of widgets they made)","165":"Why would there need to be another purpose other than selling it? If i buy antique or collectors items, they don't pay dividends, i only get cash value when i see them. Likewise, whenever i buy most things (like as a business owner buying inventory to sell) they own their inventory, but get zero value until it is sold.","166":"Because the board enacts the will of the stock holders, based on stockholder voting. The idea of having tens of thousands of people try to run a company (each stock holder) would be a surefire way to end any company. Thus, like government, people are appointed to the board based on the majority of stock ownership.   I have no idea how you think just splitting stock would somehow be a solution for that, as every single stock issued dilutes the rest....   At the end of the day, if you don't like a company that doesn't pay dividends, don't buy their stock. No one is forcing you to buy it...","167":"By that definition of mlm, then every wholesaler that sells to walmart, target etc is a mlm. In that case, mlms make the world function......  A ponzi scheme requires there to be an exaggerated or novalue behind the product being bought or sold. If everyone just held their stocks, (thus demand for buying stocks just froze), then people would sell their stocks (potentially liquidating the company) or stock holders would then demand dividends. Either way, there is value behind the product (ownership) being exchanged...  And yes, companies do typically buy back stock during recession (the opposite of dilluting) to manage stock prices, which is based on the majority of stock holders decision.","168":"So wholesalers.   A) there is intrinsic value, as you have partial ownership of material goods (what the company owns)   B) the competition is between companies, aka you can buy that companies stock or this companies stock. The stock values are extremely competitive within an industry.  It really feels like I'm helping you write a highschool econ paper...  Also given the way these things are being spread out, we will come back to ponzi schemes, one topic at a time (for now wholesalers or mlm","169":"You didn't answer or acknowledge the limitations of being wholesales (aka mlm), so i will assume this is based on mlm.  When i buy apples directly from an orchard, i take the risk (just like buying stock) that i can sell them at a profit to grocers (who sell them to the consumers who consume them). I have no control over whether or not the grocers will buy them or not. I may end up with rotting apples because i didn't realize that people now hate apples...","170":"Market research also shows that stocks are valuable, so your previous point is invalid. Why would i buy stock if i knew the value was frozen?  Your analogy would make purchasing any currency in foreign currency moot. I could invest in buying yen, i can't eat that, but correctly i can use it to buy apples.... likewise for bolts, 2 by 4s, etc....","171":"I am of the mindset that those with grammatical errors in their sentence structure and an inability to articulate themselves clearly in their written responses to others are fun to fuck with because they be dumb.

I mean all the comments are saying you can't. Yes you absolutely can. As many pointed out the Strong Nuclear Force &gt; Electromagnetism &gt; Weak Nuclear Force &gt;  Gravity in terms of strength.  &gt;Sounds like we are right back to the start of this lesson again. Let's put some real numbers on this. The \"weak\" nuclear force is 10 to the 25th power stronger than Gravity. That's 100,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 times stronger! Electromagnetism - the force we know best - is 10 to the 36th power stronger than Gravity. That's 10,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 times stronger! The \"strong\" nuclear force is 10 to the 38th power stronger than Gravity. That's 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 times stronger!   You can split any atom with a knife. If you have enough kinetic force.   The forces involved here would be about...  Probably from 1\/10th the speed of light to some where up to 90% of it.  If you're really curious here is a old comic.  https:\/\/what-if.xkcd.com\/1\/  Basically you won't be spiting atoms with any normal actions you do in your daily life.  But if your knife flew probably 1\/10th the speed of light into anything you'd be doing nuclear fusion and there by fission.","176":"Most sci fi if you notice avoids it.  Star Trek uses Defector Shields. As in some sort of shield of particles that basically vaporize the incoming dust, they also travel around by warping space so they ship isn't moving at all the space around it is. It's a difficult concept to grasp if you don't understand space-time basics. It's like they're creating a hole infront of themselves and falling into it while making a hill behind them   https:\/\/i.pinimg.com\/originals\/11\/57\/8b\/11578b9e7cb8e0f4bf02c96796dc6521.jpg  Star Wars just gives no fuck.   Star Gate uses \"hyper space\" so you go into another \"dimension\" to and then come back.  https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Interstellar_travel_in_fiction  It all depends on the show but most good shows make it realistic enough and have science advisors telling them obvious flaws.   Like in the video game Mass Effect they discovered a way to remove \"mass\" from objects and even go negative so it's possible to go faster than light, and their ships travels like normal ones would accelerating half of the trip then turning around and accelerating backwards to arrive at the destination at normal speeds. They also use shields to protect from stuff.","177":"It does. It's particularly notable when the gases are those other than the standard air mix of nitrogen, oxygen, CO2, and argon. Plus water vapor.  For example, if you open a manhole, the hydrogen sulfide will be near the bottom, because it's heavier than air. If the space has carbon monoxide in it, it could be near the top, as it's slightly lighter than air. CO2 is heavier than air, which is why you can use it to create a a ground fog. Methane is lighter than air, but flammable vapors of organic solvents tend to be heavier.   This is super important because you have to know where to look for these things before sending workers into confined spaces. Stratification of gases is a key understanding.","178":"Your brain stores knowledge more as abstract concepts. The word links to that concept, and the image links to that concept. See a cat and your brain identifies it as a cat then gives you the thought \"that's a cat\". See the word cat and your brain identifies the meaning of a cat and then gives you the image of a cat in your imagination. These concepts are stored without the use of either word or image, but are linked to the separate storages of the words and images, so those systems usually fire together. This is also how you can know what you want to say but not quite recall the word for it - your brain has accessed the abstract concept, but has misplaced the link between it and the word for it.","179":"Yeah well maybe you should figure out how to filter my saltyness while you're at it.

Plastic film blocks  infrared radiation, particularly the long wave infrared associated with heat while letting visible light through.","184":"&gt; So does this mean leaving the plastic up in summer would block out heat?  It will trap the heat inside your house just like it does in the winter.  This is how greenhouses work.","185":"I mean, yes, technically, it will block low  wavelength IR from coming in, just like it blocks it from going out.  However, it still lets in the higher wavelength stuff, which your furnishings absorb and re-emit as low frequency IR.","186":"The teachings of Christ were popular. There's no denying that. Like anything else, Christianity first spread by word of mouth. One community adopts, and then another, and so on. I think it's also worth noting that these early Christians were probably much more in line with Christ's teaching and did what they could to help those who had been hurt by the Roman Empire. And of course Christ was a martyr. People love a good marty. But really, there are a lot of reasons that contributed to the spread of Christianity, but the religion certainly wouldn't be where it is today had it not been adopted by the greatest power earth had ever known.","187":"Yeah well maybe you should figure out how to filter my saltyness while you're at it.

Intelligent people have looked at the task of covering millions of square miles of the planet with a covering to capture some gas and decided that it makes absolutely no sense, and would then also completely ruin the ecosystems that would have to be covered, as well as taking an absurd amount of materials, resources, and energy to complete, and they decided it would be much more feasible to find other solutions that are actually possible.","192":"&gt; It could be as simple as vacuuming it up with big harvesters.

Radon is a noble gas but it's radioactive with a half life of 3.8 days decaying into Polonium.   Most elements lighter than lead (have isotopes that) are stable and won't change while pretty much all element heavier than lead will decay over time into lead. Over astronomical time scales stars will continue to change the ratio of hydrogen and helium to heavier elements but the majority of  will stay lighter than Neon.","202":"First, elements decaying always become lighter. Second, lead is stable and does not decay. The only way elements become more massive is through nuclear reactions in stars.    The general trend is that very light elements become heavier and very heavy elements become lighter until they reach Lead\/Thallium. Exotic isotopes that don't fit the general pattern are extremely short-lived, so they basically don't exist.  Also, 2 billion years is not very long, the most stable isotope of Bismuth for example has a half-life of 19 billion billion years to decay into Thallium, and over the 14 billion years the universe has existed stars have only managed to transmute about 2% of mass into anything else than hydrogen and helium.","203":"Theoretically, there can be more massive elements but the most massive ones we've artificially created already are so unstable they decay within nano- to microseconds - in practical terms these elements don't matter because they barely exist.","204":"Not necessarily; it's not a one-to-one shift, and generally the companies (correctly) think they can do a better job insuring their employees than the Feds can.  So in order to have the government provide the same level of healthcare, it likely will end up costing the government *more* because of how inefficient the government is at these kinds of things, in major part because the government isn't interested in a profit motive, and as a result isn't as interested in cost-savings measures.","205":"It\u2019s not bad... per se. They don\u2019t put money back into the economy, or rarely do. Think of it in terms of neighborhoods. You have poor, upscale, and rich.

What happened if someone from coach tries to sit in 1st? There you go.","206":"Without trying to sound crass you seem to have got the wrong picture of elements here. Hydrogen does not decay into helium, hydrogen-3 (tritium) does decay into helium-3, but hydrogen-1 and hysrogen-2 do not undergo radioactive decay at all, they are stable isotopes of hydrogen.   ALL elements have radioactive isotopes, that includes noble gasses. They will all decay into other elements eventually.","207":"Look up \u201cisotopes of helium\u201d, \u201cisotopes of neon\u201d etc. on Wikipedia and there will be a section labelled \u201clist of isotopes\u201d which shows you a lot of information including what isotopes they decay into if they\u2019re radioactive.   No, noble gasses are not turning into a 19th column. what makes you think that?   Yes, hydrogen-1 will _never_ undergo radioactive decay. Stars are different, they are fusing elements together, it\u2019s a completely different process to radioactive decay.","208":"&gt;Oh cool, so does that mean that, like radon, all of the noble elements will eventually turn into lead?  What makes your ask this question? Helium will never \u201cdecay\u201d into lead, nor will neon etc.   When stars explode a large amount of heavier elements are formed, but again this isn\u2019t the same process.    &gt;Could lead ever decay into something else? Is there a half-life of lead?  I\u2019ve already told you that every single element has radioactive isotopes, see: https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Isotopes_of_lead - note just how many radioactive isotopes lead has, many are decay products from other elements, lead is the heaviest element that still has stable isotopes.   Isotopes are atoms with the same number of protons but different numbers of neutrons. Only specific configurations of protons and neutrons are stable, everything else is unstable and undergoes radioactive decay.   &gt;If lead does decay into something else, it would probably take us billions of years to find out, right?

The last few elements discovered on the 7th row already decay within fractions of seconds, and there\u2019s 50 elements to fill up the 8th row yet to be discovered before the 9th row.","210":"Why do you think I have any actual firsthand experience in this field? I read journals and understand the science.   It took about 70 years for the rest of the elements in the 7th row to be created, that was elements 95-118). The last few discovered decay within fractions of seconds. The faster something decays the harder it is to create and then detect.   We will likely see element 120 within 5 years, but getting to element 169 (which would be the first element on the 9th row) is going to to take a lot longer and will need improvements in technology if it can even be created at all.

I stopped caring when your post was removed, just been stringing you along seeing how worked up you can get about it.   Of course skipping gears is ok, it's just wrong in certain situations but not to a degree that can't be overcome by adding several hundred kilograms of metal to your vehicle.","213":"Just to be clear, I trust you don't consider your question relevant to actually money as it's used in 2020 -- Ben Bernanke has long since made clear that modern money is a question of editing numbers on a computer and not any resource found lying around.","214":"How do you think money comes into being? Only about 3% of money is printed. As the Bank of England explains here, money mostly comes about through the issuance of loans (https:\/\/www.bankofengland.co.uk\/quarterly-bulletin\/2014\/q1\/money-creation-in-the-modern-economy) and those loans come about by editing a spreadsheet.","215":"When the government takes the issuance of the central bank, no real debt is incurred in the sense of household debt, but it is politically expedient to act as though that is the case. The only real value in the world is material resources and labour -- money is an obfuscating game above all that.","216":"You're getting a little technical for me now, I just read where my interest takes me and am not able to follow all the implications of this!  Money in modern society is more or less fictional with limits placed arbitrarily to benefit one or another faction of the ruling class. Debt is the main way money is introduced into the economy and there would be no money circulating if all debts were paid, as far as I understand.  Some books that opened my eyes about this were David Graeber's Debt: The First Five Thousand Years and Kate Raworth's Donut Economics. I also like reading about Modern Monetary Theory which is based on some of these ideas -- although I don't agree with the thinking of all MMTers (and am certainly not smart enough to say that to their faces).","217":"&gt; Why is it political though, shouldn't it be a clear cut science issue cause it has to be built somewhere anyways?

It's not the only way to look at it though. Because without the business keeping that profit to invest back into the business, it could never grow, giving up increasing value in the future.  Take manufacturing, say that you build widgets, each widget nets x profit. That x value can be given out as dividends or it can be used to increase the number of widgets we make and sell. So, by giving up x now and letting the company build another production line of widgets, next year, i get 3x (2x for 2 years of profits, plus x for the new production line of widgets they made)","220":"\"Because you need to\".... then only buy stocks that give our regular dividends.

You purchased some of their shares in 2005. Their employees designed a product called an Iphone, marketed it, made it and sold millions of it and continued to innovate making their company valued at hundreds of billions of dollars because of the money it makes. You own a part of the effort the company put into this. How is this different from you buying a chicken, cooking it and selling it for more? If you sold someone a 25% share of your chicken company, then that person is entitled to 25% of the value of the company. You no longer own 100% of that company. If all you did was sell one chicken, then you need to give that person 25% of the profits from that chicken. A share isn't an IOU - it means that the owner of the share is part-owner of the company.","223":"CC: u\/covalick  &gt;We are not even sure what the smallest unit of time is, though many suspect it is planck time.   This is false. The majority think that time is continuous, not chopped up into moments of Planck time.  &gt;Time as we experience it must have existed after the big bang, but at those early moments, only a few Planck time units after the big bang, space was not yet space. It was a massive ball of unimaginable amounts of energy,  This is also false. I'm not even sure what this is supposed to mean.  When you rewind the clock, things get closer and closer together until at some point, the energy is packed together so tightly that spacetime has to be described with quantum mechanics, but there are numerous problems with formulating such a theory.  &gt;I am hope full that when a nuclear clock is finally created (much more accurate than an atomic clock) we may start to unwrap some of the mysteries of time.  A nuclear clock also has nothing to do with the nature of time. It simply allows us to measure time more accurately, though its error will still be many times greater than a Planck time.","224":"This is complicated. It's easiest to think of them as waves, but more accurately, they are waves of points.

Kids need to know what is normal and what is not normal, so if there is a problem, they can talk to a doctor.

It\u2019s the same thing for College, fundraising is a way for the school to make money to fund new infrastructure and other things. People donate money for many reasons some being they want to allow other children experience things they experienced or help expand programs that are beneficial.

But, that buying is an effect, not the cause. The prices goes up because people believe that the company is worth more than what it is selling for. If a company has 100 shares (each stock is 1% ownership, and the stocks are a dollar each, then on the stock market, the company is worth 100$. If the company's balance sheet (net worth in actual assets) is worth 120$, then people will buy it (assuming no other variables) because by buying it, you get 1.20$ for 1$. As more people buy it, the availability of the stock decreases, which makes each share sell for more.   Never ever buy stock just because someone else did or that it is expensive. The value of the stock is based on the company it represents.","249":"The inherent value comes from the owned assets of the company. The company owns physical goods (land, equipment, cash, etc) stock is ownership of that company and thus ownership of the goods owned by the company.","250":"No, instead, you can sell the stock you bought for money. Which, is in essense selling the partial ownership of those assets. It's not really different than you selling the physical goods yourself. You buy stock (partial ownership of physical goods), then you sell that ownership.","251":"Because the company can either reinvest that money into the company, ideally so the company becomes more valuable. Or, it can pay out dividends. The decision comes from whether the stockholders (in aggregate) think the company can use that money to make the company more valuable than what the stockholder can normally do.   Using you example earlier, if you made hundreds of your blood paintings, you wouldn't be rich, because no one would buy them. It's basic economics at that point, partial ownership of Amazon is more valued than your paintings are.   Amazon continues to expand its services and logistics network with the money it could spend on dividends. If it paid out dividends, it wouldn't be building as many new distribution centers and becoming more valuable to its customers who buy things from amazon. By doing so, it makes amazon ownership more valuable.","252":"Again, I'm saying that I haven't seen it as a hindrance to employment today like it was 25-35 years ago. People were more formal all the way around in their employment back then. Men wore suits or ties at least, women wore blouses and slacks or even skirts and dresses. Today, all of that is rare. Very rare. That's mainly why afros aren't frowned upon like they were back then. But also like I said, PC sort of prevents people from even discussing it.  As far as the prejudice goes - it's just a guess, but the few people I know that have commented on giant afros see a connection between them and protestors. So, people likely view huge afros as a form of protest. Employers don't like to even consider hiring people that they consider to be agitators, generally speaking.   Note: I'm limited on how often I can post, so I'm having to go back and edit other comments instead of replying directly.","253":"By definition, protesters and agitators don't conform and try to be agents of change. But existing employees typically don't want anything to change. Therefore, they generally don't get along with noncomformists.  That also could explain why there tends to be prejudice against afros by others - they're not interested in any change in the status quo.","254":"As a header, life doesn't want anything. All systems will tend towards an equilibrium. Imagine you're hitting a golfball around a field for a million years, and there's a single rabbit hole somewhere in that field. Odds are the ball will eventually wind up in that hole, and once it does it is going to stay there.  The ball being in that hole is loosely analogous to life - it is something that is very unlikely but given enough time and the right circumstances it will eventually happen.  As for why life is stable, that's sort of by definition. If it weren't stable, then it wouldn't be life. Plenty of little bits of molecules stuck together in the ocean over several million or billion or trillion years, but they all fell apart. The one that didn't fall apart and instead replicated itself by complete accident was the one that survived long enough to evolve into humans, who promptly named this self-sustaining process \"life\".","255":"Stability and complexity are unrelated. The added complexity *in some contexts* clearly makes life more able to sustain itself, otherwise it wouldn't evolve. In places where it is not useful, it does not evolve. This is why viruses are simple - they don't benefit from added complexity.  As for exactly how they work, they take advantage of the complexity in their hosts. The complicated things like growing and protecting oneself and getting food and reproducing are all handled by the host cell. *Somebody* has to do those things, and the virus simply allows the host cell to do them. Viruses don't even really understand how to make more viruses - they simply turn themselves over to the advanced machinery of the host and allow the host to use its own 'knowledge' of replication to make more virus.","256":"&gt;Feel free to google whether it's ok to skip gears and you will get article after article saying   Whatever you want it to.   \"There are websites on the internet that agree with my preconceived notions\" also applies to whether vaccines cause autism and if the Earth is flat.","257":"Hmm?

If anyone disagrees, please provide evidence that is stronger than I think it does, therefor it is.

What you're suggesting results in variables with absolutely no name whatsoever. (array[0], array[1], array[2] are hardly descriptive).

Twice now in fact.  The purpose of a judicial system is to determine who is and who is not guilty of a crime.  The system you're proposing is a crap shoot that has nothing to do with guilt or innocence.  Our current system, while far from perfect, does work at least in theory.","290":"&gt;So explain to me your thought process behind reaching the conclusion that current system &gt; narco tests when both aren't perfect.   Breaking your arm isn't good.  Neither is bone cancer.  Breaking your arm is better than having bone cancer though.","291":"&gt;But in legal terms, explain to me how narco tests are worse than the current system  Because it's less accurate.   &gt;narco tests can be conducted much faster than doing the paperwork, gathering the evidence, back and forth cross-examinations  Yes.  Arbitrary determinations of guilt based on weight are faster too.  Why not that system?","292":"I still don't see how this is in any way a better system.

Even if you go to the beach with cloth over your skin, you\u2019ll still be exposed to the sunlight, and it\u2019ll still make you darker. Just the same as how you can get a sunburn through the clouds. The only way to actively make your skin lighter would be to avoid sunlight altogether, and if there are alternative methods, just as someone else mentioned, they\u2019d likely be very unhealthy for you or your skin.","298":"I edited it out already because I realized it was immature, but you were absolutely being patronizing while barely putting up any sort of argument, you were misguidedly condescending and it made me want to insult you.

No, noble gasses are not turning into a 19th column. what makes you think that?   Yes, hydrogen-1 will _never_ undergo radioactive decay. Stars are different, they are fusing elements together, it\u2019s a completely different process to radioactive decay.","300":"&gt;Oh cool, so does that mean that, like radon, all of the noble elements will eventually turn into lead?  What makes your ask this question? Helium will never \u201cdecay\u201d into lead, nor will neon etc.   When stars explode a large amount of heavier elements are formed, but again this isn\u2019t the same process.    &gt;Could lead ever decay into something else? Is there a half-life of lead?  I\u2019ve already told you that every single element has radioactive isotopes, see: https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Isotopes_of_lead - note just how many radioactive isotopes lead has, many are decay products from other elements, lead is the heaviest element that still has stable isotopes.   Isotopes are atoms with the same number of protons but different numbers of neutrons. Only specific configurations of protons and neutrons are stable, everything else is unstable and undergoes radioactive decay.   &gt;If lead does decay into something else, it would probably take us billions of years to find out, right?

The last few elements discovered on the 7th row already decay within fractions of seconds, and there\u2019s 50 elements to fill up the 8th row yet to be discovered before the 9th row.","303":"Why do you think I have any actual firsthand experience in this field? I read journals and understand the science.   It took about 70 years for the rest of the elements in the 7th row to be created, that was elements 95-118). The last few discovered decay within fractions of seconds. The faster something decays the harder it is to create and then detect.   We will likely see element 120 within 5 years, but getting to element 169 (which would be the first element on the 9th row) is going to to take a lot longer and will need improvements in technology if it can even be created at all.

The universe is not static, and doesn\u2019t have a barrier for said galaxies to rebound off of. It is constantly accelerating expansion. For example if you drop a rock in a lake, the waves ripple outwards, not towards the rock. But if some galaxies, had a lighter mass, they would be moving faster and possibly overtake others as will happen with the Milky Way and andromeda","306":"As of now, the physics behind the expansion of the universe is purely theoretical, hence the opposing views on the matter. The physics that I have learnt on this topic. According the Hubble\u2019s theory on the matter, there is no center of the universe, rather we are all accelerating away at a speed, and no matter which vantage point in the universe you took,  whether on a planet in another galaxy or earth, you would see the same effect of galaxies both blue and red shifted","307":"They are all guesses or anecdotes pretty much. The question itself is a medical question and while there are standard answers OP should ask a doctor because it could be symptomatic of something else\/worse.","308":"This subreddit does not allow anecdotal or guess based answers.

Goes on to describe how Feynman then tried to learn to do both (as have I since reading this. And like Feynman, have failed).

It basically gives your body the \"I have seen that one before\" power over sickness.  However you need to be kind of healthy to get vaccinated. There are certain conditions under which you cannot receive vaccines (you are very young, your immune system is gone due to birth defects or cancer treatment,. ..).  These people rely on an effect called \"herd immunity\".  Basically you die if you get infected but you never get infected because everyone around you is vaccinated. This prevents a disease from spreading.  Unfortunately to achieve herd immunity roughly 98% of the population have to be vaccinated.  So for me personally as a vaccinated, healthy adult it makes no difference if you are vaccinated or not. For my little daughter or my cancer stricken relative it is a life or death situation (unfortunately quite literally).  Therefore if you are healthy and able to get a shot, go get a shot. It will safe someone's life.  (Kind of the same principle as you clear a lane for an ambulance. Yes it is inconvenient for you for 30 seconds but you help safe a live and you would expect others to do it for you).","313":"Depends on where you come from.

Yeah it usually grows in front, on down between the legs and a little bit on the butt hole area. It's just often seen as taboo, so some women shave or wax to get rid of it. But that's her decision to make and its perfectly find to keep it all or remove it all. Shaving and waxing can hurt and cause ingrown hairs which is one reason some may not want to remove the hair.","315":"Now that is a good question... I know I had some sex education in school but it wasn't very good. It's a common problem in schools because people are scared to talk about it. Some of the fear is that it will encourage kids to start having sex early but I think it's important for everyone to know how the body works. Everyone has one, so why hide it?  Kids need to know what is normal and what is not normal, so if there is a problem, they can talk to a doctor. Puberty is scary with everything changing and a lot of people feel shame about it when they shouldn't. I'm glad you're asking questions ahead of time so you're a little more prepared.","316":"It's just how the human body is. \u00af\\_(\u30c4)_\/\u00af Can't do much about it. Lots of religions have stories that give reasons if that's something you believe in.  Although I think it is pretty flippin awesome that women can grow a child inside of her.

A wire is either carrying enough voltage to decide that it's \"On\", or it's not in which case it's \"Off\". There is no in between.  So for example a processor that operates with a 5 volt data pin, the manufacturer might decide anything below 2.5 volts is a \"off\" and anything 2.5 volts or above is \"on\".

Just because the average cost of a car is high doesn\u2019t mean someone poor has to buy an expensive car, it just means people who have money like to spend it on cars.  I have the income to do so, so I spend a lot of money on my daughter because it makes me happy.  And that increases the average but others don\u2019t have to.  Basically the number is high because people want to spend money on their kids.  Nobody needs a $1000 crib.","324":"Sort of.  Since people are having fewer kids they have the ability to do more for the kids they do have.  Also having kids at an older age means they have more money.  Also, it inflates the cost when both parents work so they have to pay child care, but rarely does someone work if they can\u2019t make more than childcare costs.  So instead of staying home with their children, they earn $40,000 per year and pay $20,000 per year in child care.  In the end they have more money than if they stayed home with their kids, but studies like these make it look like it is costing the family $20,000 more than previous generations.    I buy a lot of stuff that would be considered for my daughter because it makes my life easier or because I get more enjoyment buying something for her than something for myself.  But all those costs go into looking like it is just expensive to have kids.","325":"No, it suddenly gives you the right to 10% of Amazon's ownership, in the aggregate.

That's why dividends exist. It's not the only way to look at it though. Because without the business keeping that profit to invest back into the business, it could never grow, giving up increasing value in the future.  Take manufacturing, say that you build widgets, each widget nets x profit. That x value can be given out as dividends or it can be used to increase the number of widgets we make and sell. So, by giving up x now and letting the company build another production line of widgets, next year, i get 3x (2x for 2 years of profits, plus x for the new production line of widgets they made)","327":"Why would there need to be another purpose other than selling it? If i buy antique or collectors items, they don't pay dividends, i only get cash value when i see them. Likewise, whenever i buy most things (like as a business owner buying inventory to sell) they own their inventory, but get zero value until it is sold.","328":"So wholesalers.   A) there is intrinsic value, as you have partial ownership of material goods (what the company owns)   B) the competition is between companies, aka you can buy that companies stock or this companies stock.

I have no control over whether or not the grocers will buy them or not. I may end up with rotting apples because i didn't realize that people now hate apples...","330":"Market research also shows that stocks are valuable, so your previous point is invalid. Why would i buy stock if i knew the value was frozen?  Your analogy would make purchasing any currency in foreign currency moot.

However, if DNA is damaged in certain ways, it can lead to cancer. It's not that DNA can't be repaired at all, it's that it is the \"master program\" for the cell and can be modified in ways that make the cell do things that it isn't supposed to.

So in order to have the government provide the same level of healthcare, it likely will end up costing the government *more* because of how inefficient the government is at these kinds of things, in major part because the government isn't interested in a profit motive, and as a result isn't as interested in cost-savings measures.","359":"Then every time you have seen an accusation of no true scotsman it has been used incorrectly.

They've got an empty seat that they couldn't book in advance and can't sell.  They can charge more because of economies of scale.    They route most passengers through their hub cities in order to consolidate and save on cost.  If you've ever waited tables, think of it like consolidating your tray.  Every time you go to the kitchen, you pick up stuff for more than one of your tables because it's far more efficient than making point to point trips back and forth between single tables.","364":"&gt;the airline has just made exactly the same profit as it would have if I'd flown  No, they haven't.

The two biggest numbers in Airline Economics are CASM and RASM.  Cost per *Available* Seat Mile and Revenue per *Available* Seat Mile.  How much is produced\/consumed for every seat, every mile.  Here's the thing.   Available is extremely important.  When passengers do the Hidden City, they remove the Available.

Waste your money the way you want to; no skin off my back.  Hell, for all you know, I support Sanders, too.","367":"The \"spots\" are always \"touching\". In other words, the wires are always physically connected. The way programmers change what data (electrical signals) is fed into those wires is by storing instructions into memory. How does the CPU know to retrieve those instructions and execute them? Ultimately it's hardwired to do so as part of its design and manufacture. Ever heard of the BIOS on a motherboard? That's the program permanently stored in Read Only Memory (ROM) that kicks off that whole process.","368":"BIOS is a program written to a ROM memory chip at the motherboard factory, that provides the initial instructions to the CPU. This includes initialising all the connected hardware, and eventually telling the CPU to start loading instructions from some storage media (which ideally contains an operating system). We call this process *booting*. The CPU is already hard-wired as part of its design, to load this BIOS program from the motherboard it's plugged in to.","369":"The CPU is designed so that if you feed it certain \"numbers\" (the binary numbers are just for human usability - it's all just a series of electrical signals to the CPU) it will perform certain operations. Some of those operations expect additional numbers to be input as part of the instruction (usually, addresses of memory that contain the data). This is all just based on the complex physical arrangement of the transistors and other components within the CPU.  We have a lookup table of what numbers represent what instructions. It's called an **instruction set**. A popular one is x86, which you can read about [here](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/X86_instruction_listings#Original_8086\/8088_instructions).","370":"The CPU is designed that way based on the arrangement of transistors and other components. Feed it a \"6\" and it will add the next two numbers. Feed it an \"8\" and it will store a number into memory. How exactly the transistors are arranged to do so is not even remotely ELI5, and the people who know it are paid millions for their expertise. If you want to see what it looks like inside a CPU you can watch [this video](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=Fxv3JoS1uY8).  The best I can do for ELI5: using transistors you can build logic gates. Using logic gates you can build logical functions. Transistors can also control which logic gates get activated based on a given input. You change which transistors are activated by sending signals to certain CPU pins in a certain order. The CPU is designed such that it would automatically read instructions from certain pins when powered on (which is where the BIOs\/boot process comes in). [Transistors to gates](https:\/\/www.cs.bu.edu\/~best\/courses\/modules\/Transistors2Gates\/).  If you have the basic building blocks to form transistors and\/or logic gates, you can build a fully functional computer, which is how people have simulated computers inside other software such as Minecraft or Factorio.","371":"That process has already been explained to you in [another comment](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/explainlikeimfive\/comments\/gilmgj\/eli5_how_does_a_computer_learn_those_first_few\/fqgpkp3\/).  You seem to be under the assumption that every result calculated by the CPU is literally turned into pixels. That's clearly not the case, computers calculate all sorts of things for different purposes. The software needs to determine what to do with the result. In the case that the result needs to be displayed on screen, the software will tell the monitor how to do so (via the graphics processor).","372":"Do me a personal favor. In all prior examples, assume that the assertions are exactly as stated. There is no basis for \"Yeah but I didn't mean it that way...\". A Scotsman is a human person from Scotland. A person born in Edinburgh is just that.  If person 1 says \"All X's are Y's\"   Then person 2 says \"X1 is an X but not a Y\"   Then person 1 says \"Then X1 is not an X because all X's are Y's\"   Where X1 exists in the subset of all X  Then JUST GOING BY INFORMATION THAT IS PRESENT, PERSON 1's ARGUMENT IS FALLACIOUS.","373":"1.

Btw, I'm trying to track down a quote about imagination and describing\/visualising things, from which (if my memory is right) the camshaft example comes","377":"The whole piece is worth reading - it talks about how some people count to themselves audibly (imagining a voice counting, as it were), and some people count to themselves visually (imagining watching a clock) - and how the different types of thinking to yourself affects your ability to do different things simultaneously.      Goes on to describe how Feynman then tried to learn to do both (as have I since reading this. And like Feynman, have failed).      More importantly, the larger point of the story is about how even basic everyday things that are \"universal\" can be done in completely unexpected and, frankly, alien seeming ways for other people! :)","378":"I think when talking about \"randomness\" It is more practical to ask about predictability.  Its impossible to tell if an event was random or just unpredictable, so I do not think there is much distinction. If its impossible to tell whether a spin left electron will be spin up or spin down, how would it matter if its \"truly\" random or not, as long as it is indeed \"truly\" unpredictable.","379":"You mean pubic hair? Yeah it usually grows in front, on down between the legs and a little bit on the butt hole area. It's just often seen as taboo, so some women shave or wax to get rid of it. But that's her decision to make and its perfectly find to keep it all or remove it all. Shaving and waxing can hurt and cause ingrown hairs which is one reason some may not want to remove the hair.","380":"Now that is a good question... I know I had some sex education in school but it wasn't very good. It's a common problem in schools because people are scared to talk about it. Some of the fear is that it will encourage kids to start having sex early but I think it's important for everyone to know how the body works. Everyone has one, so why hide it?  Kids need to know what is normal and what is not normal, so if there is a problem, they can talk to a doctor. Puberty is scary with everything changing and a lot of people feel shame about it when they shouldn't.

Skipping over that misconception on your part, diseases in the region, poltical, cultural, and religious instability in the region in more recent years (ave further back). Coupled with the fact that several african nations in generations past collapsed (for a variety of reasons, disease, famine, etc) that could have stabilized things...","382":"They were also in Africa. There's another point I recalled, and that's that some diseases don't do well in the cold. The bacteria freezes. Sub-saharan Africa isn't known for being very cold. Meanwhile it's going to be 19f here tomorrow (ergo, sone doseases that would thrive in sub-saharan Africa would be dead\/dormant here, but still thriving there).  Couple that with by the point America had to deal with much of that, we already had the infrastructure, and tech, to be able to fight it.","383":"So you didn't answer, but I assume you mean 2020-21 (which isn't over. The highest month is usually February) is lower than 2019-20.  Again, the reason is because of our precautions to covid are very effective at keeping flu number down. Influenza isn't usually a big deal, so we never go to great lengths to stop it. While Covid is very contagious, and Can result in hospitalization (influenza can too). The reason that we have been so precautious with Covid is because so many hospitals are at above 100% capacity. That was the entire point of flattening the curve, to keep the numbers at a more manageable rate for a long period of time. But people have let up on the precautions because everyone is understandably sick of the isolation","384":"The flu travels with winter. In the northern hemisphere, the season is from Oct-May and in the southern hemisphere, the season is from May-June (year, 8 months vs 6 months seems pretty unfair, but I think it's mostly because people don't live in Antarctica. Australia, South Africa, and Argentina and Chile aren't as cold as Canada or Russia).   Anyway, no, I don't think it would just go away like that. You say there's 47 reported cases in Canada, but that doesn't mean it's not in other countries, and it doesn't mean that people aren't slightly sick or asymptomatic and not going to doctors.","385":"Yeah after my big breakup (guy walked out after 21 years) I lost 17 pounds in 10 days.

The added complexity *in some contexts* clearly makes life more able to sustain itself, otherwise it wouldn't evolve. In places where it is not useful, it does not evolve. This is why viruses are simple - they don't benefit from added complexity.  As for exactly how they work, they take advantage of the complexity in their hosts. The complicated things like growing and protecting oneself and getting food and reproducing are all handled by the host cell. *Somebody* has to do those things, and the virus simply allows the host cell to do them. Viruses don't even really understand how to make more viruses - they simply turn themselves over to the advanced machinery of the host and allow the host to use its own 'knowledge' of replication to make more virus.","389":"Oop - I slipped into nerdspeak.

The universe is not static, and doesn\u2019t have a barrier for said galaxies to rebound off of. It is constantly accelerating expansion. For example if you drop a rock in a lake, the waves ripple outwards, not towards the rock. But if some galaxies, had a lighter mass, they would be moving faster and possibly overtake others as will happen with the Milky Way and andromeda","403":"Testosterone is largely produced in the testicles, and it is distosterone that provides a large amount of the driving force of male sexual urges and desire.

They are electrically charged and very much react with other things. Nuclei are in generally pretty strong (they call the binding force the strong force for a reason), so it takes a good bit of energy to break them up, and as atoms tend to be electrically neutral, they won't attract the alpha particles. It's generally much easier to add\/remove electrons than nucleons.  &amp;#x200B;  The LHC doesn't generally fuse anything, it just smashes things really hard, which creates new particles because of how the fundamental interactions can create new particles from energy.","410":"There are a few effects; ionization will break apart biologically important molecules, which can then become \"radicals\" which can break apart more molecules or damage proteins. Too much damage to cellular structures can cause the cell to destroy itself, as can too much damage to DNA. This is why bad sunburn causes skin to peel off, the epidermal and dermal layers received enough damage to decide they need to kill themselves for the greater good. However, if DNA is damaged in certain ways, it can lead to cancer. It's not that DNA can't be repaired at all, it's that it is the \"master program\" for the cell and can be modified in ways that make the cell do things that it isn't supposed to.   You can also receive too much damage to important cells like in organs. It's actually therapeutic in some situations, such as using radioactive iodine to destroy some of a large thyroid, but many organs are not good at regenerating so the damage can hamper their functionality."},"dialogue":{"0":"Explainee: ELI5: Why do cars have tachometers?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","1":"Explainer: So you do have an idea of where I got it from?\nExplainee: Driving instructor told you skipping gears is wrong?

There are several hypothesis and models about how this will look like, these are: Novopangea, Pangea Proxima\/Ultima, Aurica and Amasia.  The thing is that in most of them, the mayority of the land mass will be found in the northern hemisphere (for example, in the Amasia hypothesis, all the land mass is on the northern hemisphere except for the Antarctica).

The computer processes a bunch of numbers, and then sends values to your screen in the format [R,G,B] where R, G, and B are 3 numbers that range from 0 to 255 or from 00000000 to 11111111 in binary. The Monitor turns on each pixel to the corresponding value (take a magnifying glass and look at your monitor, there really are tiny red, green, and blue lights making up the screen!) and that is interpreted by your brain as an image.\nExplainee: Shouldn't that limit resolution? And how does the monitor know that the numbers mean the color?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","60":"Explainer: Why would that limit the resolution? You just send a set of 3 numbers for each pixel. For 1080p, thats 1920 x 1080 pixels x 3 numbers x 60 frames per second=373,248,000 numbers per second, or in more familiar units 3.73 MegaBytes per Second. That's what a MegaByte *is* 1 million 8bit numbers. Considering most PCs today have GigaBytes of memory and Terabytes of storage--1000 and 1million times larger respectively--video display isn't that taxing.  The monitor ultimately just turns lights on and off. The final number goes to each red\/green\/blue subpixel and controls a power supply, regulating how much voltage it puts out, which ultimately controls how much light is allowed through or blocked.\nExplainee: How does it send to each?

So there is light bouncing off the car and coming into your eye.  So it's not like there is some information coming from the car into your eyes and brains saying, 'hey its really really black right here'.  What is happening is the cells in your eye are not getting any information at all, and those cells in turn do not activate the brain in the same way.  So your brain perceives it as what we call black.  But its really just a lack of information.\nExplainee: So it is really black in that it is a) very black and b) absorbing the light so that we are not receiving the information needed to distinguish the colour?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","65":"Explainer: That's right.  Remember there isn't really a real 'black'.  That is just a word we made up for what our brain does.  Pretend humans never developed eyes and we never evolved to have the sense of sight.  We have no idea of color or what things look like or anything.  Light particles are still bouncing around and being reflected off everything, everywhere, but in the case of the vantablack, when light hits that area, it just reflects less light than other surfaces. (less information is being reflected)  Another way to look at it is take a digital camera and point it at the car.  Well there is a sensitive chip in there that is like an eye.  The light hits the chip, and activate certain parts of that chip which the computer makes into an image on the screen.  The vantablack areas did not activate that part of the chip.  So the computer reads the image file and says... No data here!  and then when you look at it on the screen the computer doesn't light up that pixel and you perceive black there.\nExplainee: That is hilarious in that when they paint a car or ball or whatever.

Anyway, in some ways counterfeit money might actually be harder long-term to pull off, since people get better and better and verifying it (people will probably also get better at faking it)  Or, if a dollar is literally identical in every single way that would also help fight the matter   Eitherway I think we should work om both practices   Although, I don't know if I like the possible \"sneakiness\" of counterfeiting\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","68":"Explainer: Alchemists predate electricity by a couple hundred years.

In that case, mlms make the world function......  A ponzi scheme requires there to be an exaggerated or novalue behind the product being bought or sold. If everyone just held their stocks, (thus demand for buying stocks just froze), then people would sell their stocks (potentially liquidating the company) or stock holders would then demand dividends. Either way, there is value behind the product (ownership) being exchanged...  And yes, companies do typically buy back stock during recession (the opposite of dilluting) to manage stock prices, which is based on the majority of stock holders decision.\nExplainee: The difference with wholesalers, is that there is intrinsic value, i.e. Food, water, etc. Stocks don't have intrinsic value. And there's competition for the same objecrlt, e.g. Tomatoes. MLMs don't have competition, because you buy it from the company only.  And company buying shares back during recessions is what I mean by non-dividend shares as not being not intrinsically valuable. People only sell things that have less value while being held. So non-dividend shares are valuable like art. Whatever the buyers decides.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","111":"Explainer: So wholesalers.   A) there is intrinsic value, as you have partial ownership of material goods (what the company owns)   B) the competition is between companies, aka you can buy that companies stock or this companies stock.

I have no control over whether or not the grocers will buy them or not. I may end up with rotting apples because i didn't realize that people now hate apples...\nExplainee: But that's not doing market research. Maybe the analogy is not the best to price your point, but you can easily ensure you have sales before purchasing.   Also, you have the intrinsic value of apples which you can eat (I assume you're not allergic to it). So even though you may lose some of your money (the apples rot) you're guaranteed a certain level of return regardless.

I do think I understand what a proof by contradiction is supposed to do.  You start with an assumption:  \"P.\"  Then, through reasoning, you show that \"P\" leads to something that cannot be true (e.g., 2 + 2 = 0), therefore (assuming the steps hold) the initial assumption is the thing that cannot be true.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","116":"Explainer: &gt; (I'm one of those people who'd say \"just add the number you've created to the list\"  The assumption initially made was \"this list contains all the numbers\".

I do think I understand what a proof by contradiction is supposed to do.  You start with an assumption:  \"P.\"  Then, through reasoning, you show that \"P\" leads to something that cannot be true (e.g., 2 + 2 = 0), therefore (assuming the steps hold) the initial assumption is the thing that cannot be true.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","160":"Explainer: &gt; (I'm one of those people who'd say \"just add the number you've created to the list\"  The assumption initially made was \"this list contains all the numbers\".

Take manufacturing, say that you build widgets, each widget nets x profit. That x value can be given out as dividends or it can be used to increase the number of widgets we make and sell. So, by giving up x now and letting the company build another production line of widgets, next year, i get 3x (2x for 2 years of profits, plus x for the new production line of widgets they made)\nExplainee: so that's fine, but what if the company never hands out dividends?

Either way, there is value behind the product (ownership) being exchanged...  And yes, companies do typically buy back stock during recession (the opposite of dilluting) to manage stock prices, which is based on the majority of stock holders decision.\nExplainee: The difference with wholesalers, is that there is intrinsic value, i.e. Food, water, etc. Stocks don't have intrinsic value. And there's competition for the same objecrlt, e.g. Tomatoes. MLMs don't have competition, because you buy it from the company only.

I have no control over whether or not the grocers will buy them or not.

Maybe the analogy is not the best to price your point, but you can easily ensure you have sales before purchasing.   Also, you have the intrinsic value of apples which you can eat (I assume you're not allergic to it).

Radon is a noble gas but it's radioactive with a half life of 3.8 days decaying into Polonium.   Most elements lighter than lead (have isotopes that) are stable and won't change while pretty much all element heavier than lead will decay over time into lead.

Second, lead is stable and does not decay. The only way elements become more massive is through nuclear reactions in stars.    The general trend is that very light elements become heavier and very heavy elements become lighter until they reach Lead\/Thallium. Exotic isotopes that don't fit the general pattern are extremely short-lived, so they basically don't exist.  Also, 2 billion years is not very long, the most stable isotope of Bismuth for example has a half-life of 19 billion billion years to decay into Thallium, and over the 14 billion years the universe has existed stars have only managed to transmute about 2% of mass into anything else than hydrogen and helium.\nExplainee: Also, do you think it's possible that either naturally or \"artificially\" that new elements will be made?

I have no control over whether or not the grocers will buy them or not. I may end up with rotting apples because i didn't realize that people now hate apples...\nExplainee: But that's not doing market research. Maybe the analogy is not the best to price your point, but you can easily ensure you have sales before purchasing.   Also, you have the intrinsic value of apples which you can eat (I assume you're not allergic to it). So even though you may lose some of your money (the apples rot) you're guaranteed a certain level of return regardless. Hell, even rotten apples can be turned into compost for further loss mitigation.

An opportunity which you've taken from the airline by lying.  They can't resell it.   They *don't* have an extra dessert, they've got an empty seat.   They can't put that seat back on the shelf, and they can't sell it to someone else because you said you were going to be in it.  How about this: The more full a plane is, the less per seat it costs to operate.   Very simple.   More people to share the fixed hourly cost of fuel, crew, maintenance.....  Consolidating though hubs keeps the planes full and costs go down.  Empty seats means the cost per passenger goes up.         \nExplainee: I agree that a plane with unsold seats is less profitable.

Now what is \"market value\"? In a perfectly competitive market it's just enough to cover operation costs + additional airline overhead.

While we don't know the exact path that life followed as it formed, it seems safe to say that a very rudimentary von Neumann 'machine' molecule or arrangement of molecules came to be which then developed more and more complex 'programs' that eventually became DNA.  Again, such developments are very unlikely, but given the sheer number of molecules forming and breaking in the oceans even now, on the order of quintillions or more every second, over the course of trillions of years, it shouldn't be too shocking that it happened *once*.\nExplainee: Im sorry a rudimentary what? Remember Im five years old.  What was the mechanism for the development into more and more complex programs? Simply sheer chance? Is there something in the chemistry that specificly makes it likely that these molecules are \"programed\" in endlessly different \"programs\" untill we have DNA?

They claim it pollutes much less CO2 than regular diesel, sure it isn't Zero but it's an improvement all the same.  only something like hydrogen fuel has zero CO2. And even than the process of making it could be harmful.

Someone who is castrated back in the day to be a eunuch to protect the queen pretty much lost all of their sexual urge and desire and were thus safe to protect the queen because they did not have the ability for romantic or sexual interest in her.\nExplainee: That's interesting, thank you!

Although they say that the biggest sexual organ is actually our brain because it has a lot to do with what we think, how we think, what we have learned, and how we feel. One of the other replies to my comment was talking about castration as a form of punishment especially back 30 to 60 years ago, a very interesting movie about that is called \"The imitation game\" we're a man is working with the code breakers of the world war to try to figure out how to stop the enemy and was very successful at it, but it was struggling with his sexuality and a time and place where it was illegal to not be straight Here's a short article from mental floss attacks a little bit about a few famous castrated people http:\/\/mentalfloss.com\/article\/22367\/6-famous-eunuchs\nExplainee: I see, this is very interesting.

Why you doing this\nExplainee: You seem to think just because someone comments something, I take it as truth. The answer, even if my question has a false premise, is STILL biological.

Yes, okay, discussion of biology was a necessary part of answering the question. It\u2019s a question that referenced puberty in mammals - it self-evidently was going to refer to biological topics. However, your question was asking for the biological reason that humans aren\u2019t ready for kids whilst animals are. The premise is false, and the reason the premise is false is due to social and not biological factors. As I\u2019ve said over and over and over. You may as well be asking \u201cwhat\u2019s the economic rationale for the earth rotating around the sun\u201d.

Some made good points. And I feel like your logic is lacking. The only social answers were the ones provided once the commenter framed my question in a nonbiological way. I was still looking for biological answers. And I got some good ones. There are other factors other than \"that's just how you view it\".   And ya know what fine, go ahead and reply every time.

tachometer measures engine RPM (Revolutions Per Minute) at any given point in time during the operation of the engine. The driver uses the tachometer to ensure that the engine is operating at an optimal RPM for a specific gear or speed, which helps to avoid engine damage or inefficient fuel consumption. In summary, tachometers provide crucial information to the driver regarding engine performance.","1":null,"2":"Actually, there is a right and wrong way to skip gears. It can cause damage to the transmission if done improperly, but it is generally allowed under certain circumstances. If you're interested, I can explain more about when and how it's safe to skip gears.","3":"I didn't post it for upvotes, I posted it because I felt it adds value and wants others to learn from it.","4":"Water waste can reduce the usable amount of water, even though the total amount of water on Earth remains constant. This happens because some water gets polluted and cannot be used directly, or it gets evaporated and taken away by wind and other processes. In addition, a large fraction of the water extracted for human use doesn't get returned to the natural water cycle, instead, it is permanently removed as waste.","5":"You know, as a woman, when it comes to childbirth, it's not just about the physical pain. The emotional toll can be immense. Many women experience symptoms like anxiety, depression, and PTSD, which can last for months or even years after childbirth. It's like an added layer of suffering that not many people talk about.","6":"A tachometer measures the rotational speed of the engine in revolutions per minute (RPM). The tachometer provides important information to the driver about the engine performance and the optimal performance range of the engine. By keeping an eye on the tachometer, the driver can make sure the engine is running efficiently and prevent undue wear and tear on the engine components.","7":"It seems like you have a good handle on driving manual transmission, and there's no clear deficiency or issue to address with not looking at RPMs when changing gears. However, paying attention to the RPMs can potentially help you be more efficient by optimizing engine operation, especially in situations like slowing down, accelerating quickly, or dealing with hilly terrains.","8":null,"9":"Biology is indeed a science that studies living organisms and their characteristics. However, your statement about the definition of biology being too broad seems to be misguided. It might seem as if the term 'biological' in a broader context could be used to describe anything related to living organisms, but in a more strictly academic sense, it's used to differentiate biological concepts and processes from those that are non-biological. For example, in a physics class, some concepts can be used to explain biological phenomena, but they would not be considered 'biological' in terms of the subject matter being studied. In summary, while biology does encompass a broad range of subject matter related to living organisms, it is still its own distinct field of study, and the term 'biological' is used to clarify its subject matter.","10":"So, you meant whether or not a 13 year old girl, in terms of her physical and mental maturity, would be capable of raising a child on her own without adult supervision. That's what you were referring to by 'it'.","11":"My point is, even though your question had a false premise, the reason why humans don't have children immediately after reaching puberty doesn't change. The reason is not just biological, but also sociological and cultural. The biological part is that the body takes time to mature and stabilize hormonal levels for optimal reproductive health. The sociological and cultural parts are due to factors such as education, economic stability, and social norms that encourage delayed childbearing.","12":null,"13":"Because substances with lower boiling points are gases at room temperature. When these gases are used in power generation, they expand rapidly, doing work, but they quickly return to their original state, releasing the energy back into the surroundings. We need liquids with higher boiling points, like water, that can be heated and turned into steam, which can do work much more effectively in a power cycle.","14":"The Noble Gases were named 'Noble' because they did not react with other elements, much like the nobility of olden times. They are generally inert and unwilling to participate in chemical reactions. This is analogous to how the nobility of those times held positions of power and prestige but did not actively participate in manual labor or day-to-day activities.","15":"Radon will decay over time into different isotopes, specifically radon-222 decays into polonium-218 and then into lead-214, which then decays into bismuth-214, and after that it decays into lead-210. This is known as the radon decay chain.","16":"No, Lead is a stable element and doesn't decay. It has no half-life. Unlike some other elements, Lead is not radioactive, and it will not turn into another element over time.","17":"Yes, since all the elements have been discovered and lead is the heaviest stable element, there cannot be any additional elements that would fit in a new row on the periodic table.","18":"The decay rate of known elements on the 7th row provides an indication of the stability of the atoms, which suggests that heavier elements may not exist or are too unstable to be naturally occurring in the normal state of the universe.","19":"As for your question about element 10,000 being found in 700 years, it's impossible to say for certain without knowing the exact processes for synthesizing elements 119 and beyond. However, it's safe to say that if we extrapolate the trend of element discovery and the time it took to discover the 7th row elements, the number of years might indeed increase exponentially. We're currently in the 7th row which has elements 1 to 118. The 8th row (elements 119-126) might be discovered in 5 years, the 9th row (elements 127 to 169) might take much more time, possibly decades, and the 10th row (elements 170-183) could take even longer. As for your point about the thousands of years it took for a good portion of the elements to be recognized, yes, you're absolutely right. The discovery of the elements has been a long and gradual process that spans centuries. However, with the advancements in technology and nuclear science, we're now able to create elements much faster than before.","20":"During the off season, the common cold virus survives by infecting humans and other hosts who may experience fewer symptoms and not seek medical care, or by living on surfaces for a short time. The virus does not hibernate or die off completely, but it becomes less common due to fewer opportunities to spread. As people come in contact with each other again in schools, offices, and public places during the onset of fall and winter, the common cold virus is more likely to spread due to closer proximity and less ideal weather conditions for viruses to be eradicated by sunlight and warm temperatures.","21":"That's why I say it's frustrating to see people buying into this. We're essentially living a parody of our own lives. It feels more like a twisted reality show where truth and fantasy are blurred.","22":"Well, influenza didn't 'go' anywhere, but its activity significantly decreased in 2020 due to COVID-19 precautions such as social distancing, wearing masks, and increased hand hygiene. These measures, intended to prevent the spread of COVID-19, also helped reduce the transmission of influenza.","23":"No, the number of flu patients does not affect its existence. We would require a vaccine or antiviral treatment to completely eradicate the flu.","24":"The influenza season was similar in the northern hemisphere to previous seasons, occurring between October 2019 and May 2020, but the increased global precautions due to the COVID-19 pandemic led to a notable reduction in the number of reported influenza cases in 2020 compared to previous years","25":"Sure, let me help you with your question. That being said, I'd just like to clarify that the discussion we had earlier about Coronaviruses and Influenza Viruses was to provide context and dispel any confusion. Now, let's focus on your question.","26":"Things like radio waves or particles at a microscopic level cannot be perceived directly by our senses, but their existence can be inferred through indirect evidence, such as using specialized equipment and tools to measure their effects on our world.","27":"But not blindly. Science is a tool for understanding the world, and while it's a very powerful one, it's based on our observations. So while we should trust the evidence and the process of science, we should also be open to the possibility that our current understanding could change as new evidence comes in.","28":"Please remember, the point of our conversation is about learning and understanding each other. Hurling personal attacks or making donations to certain political candidates doesn't contribute to constructive dialogue. Let's continue with respect and kindness.","29":"Absolutely! This is because radiation, particularly ionizing radiation, can directly interact with the DNA molecules and rip electrons from atoms in the DNA structure, creating breaks in the double helix. These breaks can alter the DNA sequence, leading to mutations. These mutations can disrupt the normal functioning of cells and prevent them from reproducing correctly, potentially leading to cancer or other diseases.","30":"No, I never said that. In fact, hockey is a popular sport played on an ice rink with two teams having six players each. The main objective is to score the most goals by hitting a puck into the opponent's net.","31":"Games are games, but sports require physical exertion and skill and are usually played in a competitive manner for entertainment. While hockey involves physical exertion, it primarily focuses on scoring points, which makes it more similar to a game than a sport.","32":"The 'off'ness is a timing issue, where the notes played by the triplets aren't falling on the exact beats as indicated by the musical score. Listen again, and you'll hear that the third note in every triplet falls slightly late.","33":"Well, schools often try to teach about these things in a formal and scientific manner, but they might miss out on discussing them in a practical or relatable way. That's why it's important to ask questions and learn about puberty and bodily changes from trusted sources. You can always ask your parents, doctors, or friends who may have gone through it before.","34":"This can occur due to sleep disorders like insomnia or sleep apnea. In these conditions, the quality of sleep may be poor despite lasting for a long time. Additionally, mental health issues such as depression and anxiety can also affect the quality of sleep.","35":"I recommend that you consult a doctor or mental health professional to better understand your symptoms and to get the help you need if necessary.","36":"Boiling water only works for killing germs in objects that can conduct heat evenly, like metal or glass. However, a sponge is porous and can retain water. When placed in boiling water, it holds onto the water rather than allowing it to infiltrate throughout its structure, so not all parts of the sponge get heated to the boiling point.","37":"And you, Mr\/Mrs\/Mx know-it-all, are the epitome of what's wrong with discussing fiscal issues. Your sarcastic jabs and unwarranted insults are a clear reflection of your biased viewpoint, making any constructive dialogue impossible. But, of course, you wouldn't understand that because you're too busy patting yourself on the back for your supposed superior intellect.","38":null,"39":"They are called Noble Gases because in their outermost electron shell, they are all fully filled with electrons, much like the Aristocratic class back in the day who were identified by their wealth and power which were symbolically represented by the full set of noble titles like Duke, Earl, Count, etc.","40":"It's possible that they did check their calculations and merely made an error, but it's also possible that they were aware of the requirements and chose not to allocate the necessary resources. The war was nearing its end, and the German effort to develop a nuclear weapon was not their top priority. Hitler was more focused on winning the war conventionally. They might have diverted their resources towards other war efforts, like building tanks or aircraft, rather than investing in a possibly failed project. Moreover, Heisenberg, being a physicist and a patriot, was morally conflicted about developing nuclear weapons and may have deliberately slowed down or sabotaged the project.","41":"Well, Walmart is a private company, and it operates under the laws of the United States. In the US, private companies are not legally required to recognize or deal with unions. They can choose to negotiate with unions voluntarily, but there is no legal obligation to do so. Unions can only be recognized if agreed upon by both the company and the union, and this is often a contentious process.","42":"Well, there are also some legal methods they use to discourage unionization. For example, they might offer benefits and perks to workers that are better than what a union would negotiate, potentially creating a situation where workers don't see the need for a union. They can also hire anti-union consultants who specialize in creating a business environment hostile to unionization. These consultants provide companies with strategies and tactics to discourage unionization, such as conducting mandatory, one-on-one, anti-union meetings with employees, distributing anti-union literature, or even setting up anti-union websites. In extreme cases, companies might even transfer, lay off, or hire permanent replacements for union organizers or workers who support a union, which is often referred to as union-busting.","43":"That's an interesting perspective! Have you considered using this method to solve other similar dilemmas in the future?","44":"Yeah, just play the song and it'll be out of your head, worked like a charm back in those days.","45":"I see, so it's more like a professional document aimed at providing an overview of the topic for others. If I were to describe it in familiar terms, I would say it's similar to a college-level report on a specific subject for others to reference.","46":"Because the equator is the widest point of the Earth and as you move further from it, the circumference (and therefore the area) of the Earth decreases. At the North Pole, the Earth is almost a point (0 radius), while at the South Pole, it has a positive but much smaller radius. The Northern Hemisphere has a larger landmass simply because it contains both the equator and the greater Arctic Region, while the Southern Hemisphere only contains the Antarctic, which is mostly ice.","47":"Yes, supercontinents have occurred several times over earth's history. Pangea is just one of them. The other you mentioned, Tectonics, refers to the ongoing process of plate movement. The supercontinents I mentioned, Aurica, Novopangea, Pangea Proxima\/Ultima, and Amasia, are all hypothetical for the future. They are all predictions based on current plate movements and estimates of where the plates will be in millions of years.","48":"Actually, the theory of plate tectonics suggests that continents move several centimeters per year, meaning that they have moved large distances over millions of years, leading to the formation of continents like Pangea and Gondwana in the past.","49":"Correct, and they might even be able to witness some of the smaller changes that occur in our lifetime. But it's difficult to predict precisely what form future continents will take since the factors at play are so complex and have many variables. Our current understanding of the Earth's movements is based on a wide range of data, including ancient and current geological evidence. However, as our knowledge evolves, so might our models and predictions, so it's exciting to think about the possibilities.","50":"That's correct. The stance on regulation can also be influenced by historical context and cultural factors, in addition to policy and ideology. For example, some right-wing policies may have emerged due to a strong emphasis on free market capitalism and minimal government intervention, which leads to less regulation.","51":"Well, it's a complex process that neuroscientists are still trying to fully understand. In essence, when the electrical wave reaches the cortex, it triggers a cascade of events, including changing ion concentration and releasing various chemicals. These activities eventually lead to a network of neurons firing together, and it is believed that this pattern, or 'neural envelope,' is the basis for our conscious thoughts. However, how these patterns translate into the subjective experience we call consciousness is still a topic of active research.","52":"That's an interesting perspective! It seems you're suggesting that your thoughts might not be solely a product of your brain, but rather could be derived from a source beyond your physical body. Though there's no scientific evidence supporting such a notion currently, it's an interesting idea to ponder.","53":"A tachometer is a gauge in a car that measures the engine's RPM (Revolutions Per Minute). This is important because the engine operates most efficiently at its peaks, and maintaining a consistent RPM helps ensure smooth driving and can prevent damaging the engine. However, in modern cars, computers typically manage this task automatically, so tachometers are less crucial in daily driving than they used to be.","54":null,"55":"Human sexual maturity is reached at a younger age compared to many other mammals, but humans typically mature slower overall. This includes brain development, which in humans takes a longer time. This delay in full maturity is crucial for humans as it allows for a period of education and social learning. This process helps humans develop complex skills like language, problem-solving, and cultural knowledge that are useful in a society. As a result, humans tend to delay their first time of reproduction, which decreases competition for resources during the crucial developmental stages of the young ones.","56":"Strippers and cheerleaders both work in roles that focus on body and appearance, but the main difference lies in the context and the narrative surrounding their work. Cheerleaders are often associated with sports teams and are usually considered as a part of school or college culture. Their performances are usually upbeat, energetic, and designed to boost the morale of their teams. On the other hand, strippers work in a sexually charged environment, often in adult clubs, and their performances are usually intended to be sexually arousing. This is why the stigma surrounding strippers is more intense compared to cheerleaders.","57":"Historically, it's due to societal norms and morals dictating that sex should only occur within the context of a committed romantic relationship. This view has been perpetuated by various religious and cultural beliefs over centuries.","58":"Well, let me explain it in simpler terms. When you type a number into your computer, it gets stored in a certain part of the computer's memory. Then, the processing unit (CPU) starts working on it. The CPU follows specific instructions (algorithms) written by programmers to manipulate those numbers. Once the processing is done, the results are sent to another part of the memory known as the display memory. The display memory then sends these results to the screen, where they appear as the thing that you see.","59":"Each pixel is represented by one set of these three numbers. Therefore, more pixels imply that more numbers are needed which in turn implies more data being processed and sent by the computer. The standard resolution for computer monitors is quite high (for example 1920x1080 means 1920 pixels in the horizontal direction and 1080 pixels in the vertical direction, and this requires around 2 million numbers to represent them, which is less than the overall range of numbers from 00000000 to 11111111 which is around 8 million numbers. So, the resolution of a screen doesn't exhaust the range of possible values for the RGB triplet. The monitor knows the colors by knowing the correspondence between the numbers and the intensity of the red, green, and blue lights. This correspondence is established during the setup or manufacturing of the monitor, and it's the same for all computers.","60":"Each pixel in the set for each frame is a coordinate in a 2-dimensional image that is then mapped to the monitor's physical pixels. As for shades, or variations in brightness, the final number for each subpixel determines how much voltage is provided to the subpixel. Because the voltage can be adjusted in increments, light can be allowed to pass through the subpixel in degrees, effectively creating a gradient. As for the number of transistors, it's a complex topic as it depends on the specific technology and hardware design being used, but typically each subpixel will have its own transistor in a matrix array, so for a 1920x1080 display we're looking at about 6,220,800 transistors, not including additional control and driving circuitry.","61":"Yes, analog signals can take a continuous range of values. When an analog signal is being processed, it's usually converted into a digital representation using a process called analog-to-digital conversion (ADC). This process divides the range of possible signal values into multiple small fixed steps, or discrete values. The ADC then records the nearest discrete value to the original analog value. This digital representation can then be manipulated as needed and eventually converted back into an analog signal using digital-to-analog conversion (DAC).","62":"Maybe it would be beneficial to implement a system where questions are directed to the appropriate subreddit based on the nature of the question. This could make the subreddits less populated, hence making them easier to use. Additionally, making the process of locating the relevant subreddit clearer can also help.","63":"Solar light is absorbed or reflected by Earth, which gives it daylight. On the other hand, in space, there is no celestial body to absorb or reflect the solar light, so space appears dark even with the presence of the sun. Any light source in space (like stars) are generally very far away, and their lights take a long time to reach Earth, so they look as distant points of light rather than sources of daylight.","64":"' Yes, that's correct. vantablack is so highly absorptive that it virtually eliminates the reflection of light. This makes the material appear extremely black, not because it is inherently that color, but because there is very little light being reflected back to your eyes. As a result, the cells in your eyes don't receive much information about the color or brightness of the surface, and your brain perceives it simply as black.'","65":"So if you look at something painted with vantablack from a distance, say, like a car or ball, it won't be visible because the reflection of light from the vantablack is so little that it looks empty or like there is a black hole or void in its place.","66":null,"67":"But, using counterfeit currency for profit is illegal and unethical. It's not a viable solution for making gold profitable. The idealists you mention may indeed have their reasons, but promoting illegal activities isn't a solution. As for the return to the gold standard, it's a popular topic among certain economic circles, and the Free Silver Party, as you mentioned, was a political party in the U.S. during the late 19th and early 20th centuries that advocated for the expansion of the gold and silver coinage. Regarding counterfeiting money, it's important to note that while people may get better at detecting it, counterfeiters also become more sophisticated over time. It's a cat-and-mouse game that would be better to avoid.","68":"Well, if you were to flood the world with gold as you suggested, the value of gold would plummet, making it as worthless as any other material. The allure of gold is largely due to its scarcity, and once that scarcity is removed, people would no longer view it as a valuable luxury. In a post-scarcity society, as you described, people would focus on the practical and beneficial aspects of things, rather than their symbolic or historical value.","69":"Flu shots help protect you from the flu, which is a contagious respiratory illness caused by the influenza virus. It can lead to serious complications like pneumonia, hospitalization, or even death in some cases. By getting vaccinated, you reduce your risk of getting sick and also minimize the spread of the flu to others around you. It's especially important for high-risk groups, such as young children, older adults, pregnant women, and people with chronic health conditions.","70":"Yes, it's common for people to have a regular family doctor or primary care physician. You can find one by asking for recommendations from friends or family, or by searching online for local providers.","71":"That's because it is very close to our listening frequency, which makes it hard for us to distinguish it from normal sounds, creating an eerie or ghostly effect.","72":"Water can be wasted by using more than is necessary for a particular task, such as leaving the tap running needlessly while brushing your teeth, using sprinklers excessively in the garden, or allowing water to run off a driveway or roof into the street. This water could be saved for later use, leaving the total amount of water on Earth unchanged, but we could be using it more effectively.","73":"You need to take a step back and see that you're also contributing to the same issue by disputing each and every input. It's not about who's right or wrong here, it's about learning and understanding. Rather than arguing, why not consider different perspectives and make a well-informed decision?","74":"Do you mean why are they not taking a loss? Since they've already recovered the initial cost of the flight, they are making money for the rest of the flight, even if all passengers get off in Atlanta.","75":"I disagree. While it's true that they have already sold the tickets, the airline still incurred operational costs for each flight. If the tickets were sold at a price lower than the operational costs, the airline is losing money on each flight, even if they have sold out. Additionally, the revenue from cargo shipping might not compensate for the losses incurred from underpriced tickets.","76":"A period, also known as a dot, is used in writing to signal the end of a declarative sentence. When you see a period, it means the statement that comes before it has arrived at a full stop. For example, 'I am a student.' That period indicates that this is a complete sentence, and all the information you need has been provided.","77":"To clarify, in the context of the subroutine, H(a,b) was generalized to H(x,y) and then further simplified to H(x,x) for convenience during the processing. The function H(x,x) compares x with itself, but the program and the input of H(x,x) are distinct in this context. Additionally, the expression P(P) is referring to a function P applied to itself, which can be challenging to conceptualize as it leads to a infinite loop of applying the function to its own output. This is often resolved by having a base case or a stopping condition in the definition or call of the function.","78":"Well, some people don't have a regular doctor. If that's the case, you can visit a clinic or walk-in center to get vaccinated and ask about the diseases you mentioned.","79":"When multiple notes play together, especially if they are different pitches, the 'off'ness is caused when the notes do not blend perfectly due to their unique frequencies. You can hear this slightly discordant effect in the video when the triplets play.","80":"Moreover, maintaining clean water for the animals, constructing shelters, breeding, feeding during winter or drought, and ensuring their health through vet visits are all additional aspects of raising farm animals that require a significant amount of energy and resources.","81":null,"82":"While it's true that individual perceptions of beauty can vary, it's important to recognize that the historical and ongoing cultural emphasis on white skin, and the associated connotations of beauty, power, and success, has played a significant role in shaping these personal perceptions. This emphasis on white skin, rooted in colonialism and capitalism, has been perpetuated through various media and beauty standards, and has contributed to the normalization of skin whitening within many Asian communities. Thus, while personal preferences may differ, it's crucial to acknowledge the role of systemic factors in shaping these preferences and to strive for a more inclusive understanding of beauty.","83":"A computer doesn't learn like humans; it's programmed. The first instruction set for a computer was developed by John Von Neumann and is called the Von Neumann architecture. It consists of a central processing unit (CPU) that reads and executes instructions from memory. The CPU performs basic mathematical and logical operations. The computer was hardwired, not programmed, to perform these initial tasks as there was no way to store and reuse programs.","84":"It's important to clarify that a CPU doesn't inherently 'know' what to do with a number it processes. Instead, a CPU executes instructions based on its internal design. When a number (known as an opcode) matches an instruction in the instruction set (stored within the CPU), it performs the associated operation. For instance, if the opcode 6 corresponds to the instruction 'Load from Memory', the CPU will fetch the data stored at the memory location specified in the next number (known as the operand) in the binary code.","85":"programs convert the numbers into commands that the computer's graphic card can understand, resulting in the creation of pixels on the screen.","86":null,"87":"Actually, that's not entirely accurate. While some public records, like property ownership, are accessible to anyone through sites like publicdata.com, other sensitive personal information, like credit reports or social security numbers, are not. These typically require a legitimate request and verification process to protect individual privacy.","88":"From a security perspective, it's always best to have multiple layers of protection, not just rely on the assumption that you won't be targeted. Having a more proactive approach, such as implementing measures that protect against general attacks as well, can help make your system more secure.","89":"I understand that you believe there might be a feasible way to harvest methane from the melting Arctic. However, your proposed methods require substantial resources, investment, and government approval, which are not typically provided for unproven or impractical ideas. Although it's possible that someone might take up the challenge and develop a viable solution, the current evidence and mainstream scientific opinion suggest that the resources and potential negative environmental impact make this idea unrealistic","90":"Water can be wasted by not reusing it, overusing it, or letting it flow out without properly collecting it. This leads to more water being consumed or evaporated than necessary, which eventually reduces the world's total available fresh water supply.","91":"Because the process of cleaning contaminated water is energy-intensive, costly, and not always effective, especially when it comes to removing chemical pollutants. In addition, cleaning seawater or wastewater for potable use is not a feasible solution due to high economic cost and scarcity of fresh water resources. Therefore, it is crucial to conserve clean freshwater and not waste it.","92":"Sir with all due respect, your skepticism towards a renowned scientist like Sean Carroll is misplaced. Newton's laws of motion and the law of universal gravitation, while being groundbreaking in their time, have been succeeded and refined by Einstein's theory of relativity. Carroll's work on the cosmological principle and the role of dark matter and dark energy in the universe has been widely recognized and respected in the scientific community. While it's great to question and challenge theories, it's equally important to acknowledge the evidence and consensus that supports them.","93":"However, if every single person on the plane got off in Atlanta, they would indeed be operating an empty plane from ATL to MCN, resulting in a loss since they would have incurred the costs of flying the plane but would not have generated any revenue for that specific leg of the journey. This is in contrast to a full flight to MCN, where they would have generated revenue from ticket sales for all passengers, even if some of them got off at ATL along the way.","94":"It didn't go anywhere; instead, it was replaced by the COVID-19 pandemic in the news and public discourse as it became the major global health concern for 2020.","95":"In the United States Constitution, there are specific qualifications to become a President. These include being a natural-born citizen, being at least 35 years old, and having lived in the U.S. for at least 14 years. There is no maximum age mentioned. While some people believe there should be a maximum age for the role, no such limit currently exists in law.","96":"However, age itself is not a disqualifying factor. The focus should be on their policies, leadership capabilities, and alignment with the voters' values.","97":"Only the two major parties (Democrats and Republicans) have their candidates on the ballot in most US states. If you write in a candidate, they must be registered as a write-in candidate beforehand, and even then, they often have little chance of winning. So your statement about only two options is partially true in the context of candidates with a chance to win, but it's not true in the sense that you have the freedom to vote for whomever you wish.","98":"Yes, companies can impose certain limitations and policies on the unionization process, such as restricting the criteria for employee eligibility, requiring a higher threshold for employee support for a union to be established, or using various tactics like mandatory anti-union meetings to discourage union support. However, these practices are subject to scrutiny by labor boards which evaluate if they violate laws designed to protect employee rights to unionize.","99":"An unequal outcome doesn't necessarily mean it isn't fair. In fact, equal pay for equal work is fairness","100":"Well, a selenelion eclipse occurs when the Moon is setting at the same time as it moves into the Earth's umbra (the darkest part of the shadow). Since the Earth's shadow is conical, its top part also covers the part of the Moon that we can't normally see when the Moon is high in the sky. As the Moon sets, the top part of that shadow, which is aimed at the Moon, causes the illuminated portion of the Moon to appear upside down, hence the 'selenelion' eclipse.","101":"Yes, theoretically speaking, from certain locations on the sunset ring, you should be able to see both the Moon and the Sun at the same time. This is known as an astronomical phenomenon called a transit. However, during such an occurrence, the Sun would be so bright that the Moon would appear as a small, dim shadow. It's important to note that these conditions are quite rare, as the Moon's orbit is inclined by about 5 degrees to the Earth's ecliptic plane. For the Moon to be visible in the sky during the Sun's day, Earth would need to be at a very specific location in its orbit. The Sun's disc would block most of the Moon's visibility, making it challenging to observe directly. Binoculars or telescopes might be necessary to catch a glimpse of the lunar transit during this rare alignment.","102":"Because, in traditional corporate settings, a well-groomed and subtle appearance is considered professional. An afro often deviates from this expectation, as it can be considered too casual or unkempt. However, the stigma around afros is slowly fading as social norms evolve, and some companies have even adopted more inclusive and accepting grooming policies.","103":"No, artistic flair can exist in any career. It's about how you channel your creativity. You could incorporate unique ideas into your work, whether in business or another field, without changing your hairstyle if you value it.","104":"Business can still be a suitable career regardless of a person's preference for self-expression. However, it's important to balance self-expression with professionalism to navigate the corporate world successfully. Also, keep in mind that certain industries might have more conservative dress codes or appearance standards.","105":"I agree with you that we don't know everything and there are many things that are still debated upon. The ideas I've presented are based on the current scientific understanding, but as you correctly pointed out, science is always evolving and what we consider as facts today may change tomorrow. The butterfly effect, for example, is a concept from chaos theory, and while it's a fascinating idea, it's still not fully understood or proven. Similarly, the question of free will and its relationship with predictability is still an active area of research in fields like neuroscience and philosophy. So, we should keep an open mind and continue to explore and question these ideas as new evidence emerges.","106":null,"107":"Antibiotics are prescription-only medications because using them improperly can lead to antibiotic resistance, which is the ability of bacteria to withstand the effects of antibiotics, making infections harder to treat. If antibiotics were easily available over the counter, people might misuse them for self-treatment or overuse them, contributing to antibiotic resistance. Prescription by a healthcare professional helps ensure the antibiotics are appropriately used to treat bacterial infections, reduce the risk of antibiotic resistance, and improve treatment outcomes.","108":"Phages can be extracted from the environment, such as seawater or soil, through a process called enrichment. Basically, you add your target bacteria to a sample of the environment and allow the phages to multiply. The phages will then infect the bacteria and start reproducing, eventually out-competing the bacteria and making it easier to separate the phages out. After separation, the phages can be purified and concentrated, then used as a treatment for bacterial infections. As for why we aren't investing more time and resources into phages, it's because they are a fairly new treatment option, and there's still a lot we need to learn about them. Additionally, there are regulatory, intellectual property, and investment barriers that make it difficult to bring phage therapy into widespread use. However, research is ongoing, and there are already a number of approved phage therapy products available in countries like Europe and Russia.","109":"Generally, non-dividend paying stocks are expected to reinvest their earnings back into the company for growth rather than distribute them as dividends. These stocks can provide capital appreciation over time if the company performs well. Also, they are often referred to as growth stocks.","110":"The difference with stocks, is that the intrinsic value comes from the company's performance and the perception of its future performance. MLMs, on the other hand, rely on recruitment and selling of more products to make money. If there's no further recruitment or product sales, the system collapses as there's no value inflow, unlike wholesalers or stocks where the value could potentially come from other sources like demand for the product or company performance.","111":"But in the case of wholesalers, they do not own the goods they sell. They buy goods in bulk from manufacturers at a lower price, and then sell them to retailers at a higher price to make a profit. The ownership of the goods remains with the manufacturer or supplier, not the wholesaler.","112":"Well, in the case of MLMs, you're not just buying apples from an orchard. You're buying a business package, which includes the rights to sell a specific product line, often along with recruitment incentives. The 'grocer' in this case is the consumer who may or may not have a demand for your specific product. Unlike apples, MLM products are often unique to the company, not something widely available in the market. So, there's no intrinsic value other than the product's perceived value. And while you can definitely try to offset losses by using the products yourself or finding other uses for them, the main financial gain is expected to come from recruiting others to join your team and sell the product. This recruitment process adds an additional layer of uncertainty, as your income is heavily dependent on others' success, rather than just your own sales. This is a significant difference between running a traditional business and participating in an MLM.","113":"In many real-world applications, squaring numbers and square roots are used to represent the area of a square. If a side of a square is 'a', then the area of the square is (a*a) or 'a' squared. This is why squaring numbers represents the area of squares. Similarly, if you know the area of a square and want to find the side length, you'd take the square root of the area because the square root of 'a' squared is 'a'. So, understanding squaring numbers and square roots can help you understand the area of squares in the real world.","114":"The halting problem, proposed by Turing, is a problem in computation theory which asks whether there exists a decision process that takes as input a program y and a problem D, and decides whether or not the program y will eventually halt when run on input D.","115":"The Cantor's Diagonalization Argument is a proof that shows an infinite set cannot be put into one-to-one correspondence with the natural numbers. You might find it easier to understand if you are familiar with sets, sequences, and the concept of a diagonal of a matrix. In essence, the argument shows that there must be a pattern in every sequence, and we can construct a new sequence that differs from every sequence in the original set in the pattern it exhibits. This creates a contradiction, proving that the original assumption - that the set can be put into one-to-one correspondence with the natural numbers - is false.","116":"However, the point of Cantor's proof is that there is no way to generate a list or a set that contains all the numbers (of every integer size). This result is independent of the optimization or the method used for list or set generation. It's a fundamental property of infinity. In other words, it's not about the optimization of your list, but about the nature of the numbers that the list is trying to encompass.","117":"Oh well, I'm just telling it as it is. If you don't like it, feel free to move on.","118":"Desalination of seawater is expensive and energy-intensive, requires large amounts of water for cooling, and can disrupt marine life during the process. Additionally, the discharge of concentrated brine back into the ocean can lead to increased salinity and harm ecosystems. Lastly, the production of desalinated water for irrigation can deplete freshwater reserves, particularly in arid regions.","119":"I'm offering a perspective here. You're aggressively defending your own viewpoint and dismissing others without considering their points. Could you maybe try to engage with their arguments respectfully instead?","120":"The abortion debate is a complex and polarized issue, centered around the morality and legality of terminating a pregnancy. The debate primarily centers around when does life begin, the rights of the fetus versus the rights of the pregnant person, and the potential consequences of abortion on the mental and physical health of the pregnant person. Pro-choice advocates believe that the decision to have an abortion is a personal one, and that the bodily autonomy of the pregnant person should be respected. Pro-life advocates believe that all life is sacred, and that an unborn fetus has the same rights as a born person, and that the life of the fetus should be protected at all costs.","121":"I understand that you've had a vasectomy, which is a form of birth control. However, the topic we are discussing is about abortion. It's not about individual personal choices, but rather the broader social and ethical implications of abortion.","122":"Because if you are, then you surely aren't thinking for yourself, you're just following the flock.","123":"It means to deliberately argue against a motion, idea or decision, even if you may personally believe or agree with it. This is to ensure that all pros and cons are considered and no potential concerns or counterarguments are overlooked.","124":null,"125":"A computer doesn't learn in the human sense, but it can be programmed to perform basic computing tasks using machine code or assembly languages. However, in the context of machine learning, the first few steps involve feeding large datasets to the computer, and using algorithms to help the computer find patterns in the data. These patterns are used to make predictions or decisions. This is a very simplified explanation and there are many complexities involved in machine learning, but this gives a general idea of how a computer learns.","126":null,"127":"In the context of your question, P is a particular problem that is used in the definition of M. M's decision-making is based on a program and its inputs, and whether the program will halt or continue running infinitely when given those inputs. P is one such problem within this context, specifically an example of a problem that is undecidable, meaning it cannot be determined by running a program on a Turing machine if the problem will halt or continue running indefinitely. Therefore, understanding P helps to illustrate why M's decision-making is logically inconsistent, as M attempts to predict the halting problem when it itself is an undecidable problem.","128":"Explainee's understanding is correct, which means there's no contradiction in the explanation so far. However, to further clarify the interaction between the two hypothetical programs (Perfect Decider and Nasty Trickster) and to avoid any confusion, a more detailed explanation of the way they are intended to interact could be provided, such as explicitly stating that when the Nasty Trickster is presented with the Perfect Decider, it trickily runs indefinitely if told to halt, and halts if told to run indefinitely. This would make it clearer that the Perfect Decider is incorrect in its prediction about the Nasty Trickster.","129":"But if you're debating with yourself, you're essentially arguing a point to convince yourself of something, so it's still interpersonal communication since you're engaging with your own thoughts.","130":"Walmart, being a private entity, has the right to determine its own internal policies and operations without a union. While employees may certainly advocate for unionization, the company is not obligated to recognize a union unless it has been certified after an election conducted by the National Labor Relations Board.","131":"Yes, corporations or companies, in general, could still potentially deny or refuse to acknowledge such a proposal, especially if it seems similar to a traditional union request. They might argue that it could be a precursor to unionizing or could interfere with their current labor laws and policies. It's essential for you to research the specific policies of the corporation and seek proper legal advice to ensure your actions are within their guidelines.","132":"I'm not sure I understand your question. A single store can't represent the entire corporation. However, employees from a specific location can potentially form a local union. That's different from having a union represent a large portion or all of the company's employees nationwide.","133":"The period is a mark that indicates the end of a sentence. It's one of the four basic punctuation marks, along with the comma, question mark, and exclamation point. It's a full stop, meaning that following the period, there is no more content in the same sentence.","134":null,"135":"It's important to understand that females have a structure called the labia minora. Sometimes, during certain activities, the labia minora might get pushed to the side, which can make the opening of the vagina appear differently. This is quite normal and there's nothing to worry about as long as it's comfortable for you.","136":"Well, one reason could be biological differences. For example, girls start puberty earlier and menstruate, which adds an additional layer of complexity and potential health issues. Also, societal expectations and body image issues might be more pronounced for girls, leading to more complications, especially as they grow older.","137":"They don't actually listen to you, but your online behavior like browsing history, search history, and social media activity is collected and analyzed by algorithms to show targeted ads based on your interests.","138":"Did it occur to you that the store where you purchased the device might have informed the phone company because of the cash transaction? And hence they could have tracked you down based on the product details and replaced your old device with the new one?","139":"You are assuming that the platform offering the product is listening to you and able to identify the product you're referring to without knowing its name. This is an example of confirmation bias because you are expecting a particular outcome (the identification of the product) and interpret the evidence (their response) in a way that confirms your expectation, without considering alternative explanations. In your case, it's more likely that you have some characteristics of the product in mind which led you to recognize the product when it was eventually mentioned.","140":"You might think it's a conspiracy, but the scientific community has evidence that supports the idea of an asteroid impact causing the extinction of the dinosaurs. However, it's an important piece of our planet's history. It's never too late to learn something new!","141":"I'm sorry, I didn't realize you already provided an explanation. However, if someone needs further clarification, please don't hesitate to ask.","142":"We don\u2019t exactly link words to pictures, but we construct mental models in our mind using our knowledge of the language and the world, to generate meaning.","143":"Well, in the context of our universe, time doesn't exactly 'exist' in a literal sense. Time is what we use to measure change in the universe, like the movement of objects, the passing of seasons, etc. However, these changes happen because of the laws of physics that are constant. So, theoretically speaking, if there were no physical objects or interactions, there would be no need for time. This is more of a philosophical or theoretical discussion since our universe as we know it wouldn't function without time.","144":"Photons don't have a size or physical extent in the way that we typically think of objects. They are considered massless and point-like particles.","145":"Explainer: That's actually a good way to clear your mind. I've heard of people doing something similar when they can't stop thinking about something.","146":"You're missing the point. While it's true that scientific beliefs can change over time and some historical theories have been revised or replaced, the theory of gravity has had substantial evidence supporting it since Newton's time. Sean Carroll's belief in an afterlife is not a scientific claim backed by evidence and experiments like gravity. Thus, it's not comparable.","147":"I'm not saying that believing in a higher power necessarily makes someone a dumbfuck, but when science cannot currently provide an answer, it's often more rational to rely on evidence rather than personal beliefs and biases.","148":"Yet, there is no scientific evidence or proof that consciousness or thoughts can exist independently of a material, physical brain. Currently, our understanding of consciousness is limited to the brain's activity, and any suggestion of an alternative realm seems unsupported by evidence.","149":"Human beings have a longer growth and development process compared to most mammals. This includes a more extensive learning phase before they become adults. Mating without this maturity can lead to detrimental consequences for both the individual and the offspring. Additionally, the delay in mating allows us to focus on building our skills and establishing ourselves in our communities, increasing our chances of success in raising a family.","150":null,"151":"I am not discussing a modern teenager, I am referring to a member of an early tribe who may have had access to some tools, but not nearly as developed as what we have today.

To clarify, 'human biology' doesn't necessarily mean the study of human plants and animals within a specified region, but instead the study of the physiology, behaviors, and other characteristics of humans, regardless of location.","153":"OK, so you meant to say 'The question of whether or not a 13 year old girl has reached a stage of biological development that is suitable for her to raise a child on her own.'. Is that correct?","154":"As for your question about good answers, they were still providing non-biological reasons. I understand that you may have gotten answers that you found interesting, but they didn't provide information relevant to the biological reasons why humans aren't ready for kids at puberty compared to mammals. As for continuing this dialogue, feel free to reply when you have the time. I'm here to help and answer your question to the best of my ability.","155":"Consider a square with sides of length x. The area of the square is the number of square units it occupies. In this case, the area is x*x (the product of the lengths of the sides, also known as squaring x). Now, if you were to measure the length of one side of this square using only a ruler, it would give you just one number - the side length, say y. So, now your goal is to find out the side length x using only y. That's where square roots come in: the square root of y (written as \u221ay) is the number that, when multiplied by itself, gives y. In other words, \u221ay * \u221ay = y, or y = (\u221ay)\u00b2.","156":null,"157":"The Halting Problem is a problem in computability theory, stating that there is no general solution to determine whether a given Turing machine or other mechanical procedure, with an arbitrary input, will finish running or go into an infinite loop. If such a solution existed, it would be possible to construct a program that can solve its own halting problem - in other words, a program that decides whether it will halt or run forever when given a particular input. This leads to a paradox known as the Self-Referential Proof. However, G\u00f6del, Church, and Turing independently proved that no such program can exist.","158":"The Halting Problem is a problem in computability theory that asks whether, for any given program and input, it is possible to determine, before running the program, whether the program will run forever or will eventually stop and produce an output. This problem is undecidable, meaning there is no algorithm that can solve it for all programs. The Self-Referential Proof is a formal proof demonstrating the undecidability of the Halting Problem by building a program that does nothing but try to prove whether a given program with a given input will halt or run forever, while contradicting itself in the process if there were a program that could solve the Halting Problem.","159":"Maybe instead of starting with the diagonalization argument, we could first cover the basics of set theory. That way, you'll have a better understanding of what sets, elements, and functions are. Once you understand these concepts, it will be easier to follow the diagonalization proof. After sets and functions, I'd recommend going over how to represent sets with infinite elements (like the set of all real numbers), and the notion of order or arrangement within a set. With this foundation, we can take a closer look at Cantor's diagonalization argument and see how it's being used to prove that certain sets are uncountable. If you still have trouble, I can walk you through the proof step by step.","160":"But adding numbers to the list without knowing if it contains all the numbers or not, does not change the fact that the initial assumption was incorrect because it hasn't been proven all numbers are contained in the list. A different method of generating the list might work, but you still need to prove it contains all numbers to contradict Cantor's proof.","161":"No Banana has an amount of radiation that can pose risk to humans at the scale present. The radioactivity in a banana is so small, it's safe to eat. But with lead, it's easy for humans to ingest a harmful amount, which is why we need to limit lead exposure.","162":"Most suburban houses in the USA are made of wood because it is a cost-effective and versatile building material. Despite the strong winds and tornadoes in certain regions, modern homes are designed and built to withstand these harsh conditions. Additionally, wood is biodegradable and provides better insulation compared to other common materials like steel or concrete. For instance, the roof trusses in houses made of wood can be lightweight, making them easier and cheaper to transport and assemble than heavy concrete or steel construction. However, it is crucial to adhere to building codes and regulations to ensure the safety and durability of the house.","163":"No, he was convicted based on evidence presented in court, not on a rumor.","164":"They appreciate in value over time.

If the stock\u2019s price increases, you can sell the shares for a profit.","165":"One purpose of shares is also to give the owners a piece of the company's long-term growth potential. If the company does well, it could eventually lead to an increase in the share price, meaning you could sell your shares for a higher price, earning a profit. Additionally, if the company issues new shares, your current shares may also retain a proportionally higher value due to the increase in the overall size of the company. So, while dividends are one way to receive returns from a company, the potential for long-term growth can also add significant value to your shares.","166":"Because the board of directors is responsible for managing the company's finances and resources, and they decide whether to reinvest the profits or distribute them as dividends to shareholders. Your suggestion of gaining more stocks as a result of reinvesting dividends in the company is called Dividend Reinvestment Plan (DRIP), but it's not a standard practice for all companies, and it depends on the board's decision.","167":"But in an MLM, the focus is on recruiting new members and selling them products rather than on producing products or services to meet an independent market demand. In contrast, in an IPO, a company sells shares to the public to raise capital for expansion, research, or other purposes. There is no requirement for an IPO to rely on constant recruitment of new investors. Instead, the value of the company's shares increases or decreases based on the demand for the shares in the market. A Ponzi scheme, while it does rely on recruiting new investors to pay returns to older ones, it does so under false pretenses, promising high returns through an investment in a supposedly lucrative enterprise, when in fact the returns are simply coming from the investments of newcomers, not from any legitimate earnings.","168":"But in the case of MLMs, the products often have inflated prices and are overly marketed, leading to questionable value. Unlike stocks, the demand for these products is often artificially created through recruitment and pressure sales tactics, rather than based on their intrinsic value or competition in the market.","169":"Explainer: Yes, exactly. That's a great point. When you invest in wholesale, you're buying into a specific company's inventory or assets. If you were to buy stocks from different companies, you're not directly owning their goods, just a percentage of their ownership. This is why wholesale investments can be more directly linked to the physical goods market, whereas stock investments are more about the company overall and its performance in the stock market.","170":"That's a valid point, but remember in an MLM context, the 'apples' don't have intrinsic value. You're not selling a commodity like apples, but a product with a market value that heavily depends on the sales tactics and network of the individual sellers. In addition, the compensation plan often focuses on recruiting new members rather than direct sales, making it difficult to predict or ensure sales before buying inventory. Lastly, the apples can't be turned into compost as they're not physical goods, making loss mitigation like that impossible.","171":"I'm glad to know you aren't affected by social approval. For my part, I appreciate the engagement and discourse, regardless of votes.","172":"Actually, while the total amount of water on Earth is indeed a constant, the amount of water that's easily accessible and safe to drink in a particular location can change due to various factors like over-extraction, pollution, and climate change. That's what we mean by wasting water.","173":"Well, when you listen to a song, your brain tends to remember it because of its melody, rhythm, and lyrics. Sometimes, bits of the song get stuck in your mind due to repetition, emotional connection or association with a particular event or person. This is called an earworm. The exact reasons why this happens are not fully understood, but it's believed to be a result of the way our brain processes and stores information, particularly musical information.","174":"Definitely give it a try and let me know if it works for you as well!","175":"Actually, you can't split an atom using a knife or a hammer because an atom is too small to be affected by those items. Also, the amount of force required to split an atom is enormous, far beyond anything you could generate by hitting it with a hammer or knife. This force is usually provided by very high-energy particles. Additionally, splitting an atom releases a lot of energy in the form of radiation, which can be dangerous.","176":"The reason is that to decelerate, we'd need an immense amount of force proportional to the mass and speed of the spacecraft. This would require such a massive amount of fuel that it becomes impractical. Also, as you slow down, your craft would still be moving at a significant fraction of its top speed, making it difficult to control and land safely. So, we'd have to slow down gradually over a long period of time, which would require a very large amount of time as well. Essentially, it's more efficient and practical to keep the engines going at a lower power level during deceleration, rather than trying to stop completely and then start again to slow down and maneuver for landing.","177":null,"178":"Not exactly. Instead, our brain understands words based on their meaning and the meanings of the other words around them. It's more like building a mental model using the meanings of words and the relationships between them.","179":"Water can be wasteful in our daily usage. Technically the overall 'amount' of water doesn't change because water cycle constantly renews it. However, humans can 'waste' water by using more than necessary or by not recycling or reusing it. For example, letting the faucet run for a long time while brushing teeth or watering the lawn excessively during non-evaporation hours can contribute to water waste.","180":"The process of desalination is energy-intensive and results in greenhouse gas emissions. Additionally, it can disrupt marine ecosystems, affect the local climate, and deplete groundwater resources in some regions if freshwater runoff is used in the process.","181":"Actually, your post was removed because it doesn't follow the guidelines set by our community. However, I'd be happy to help you find a more suitable place to ask your question.","182":"Apologies for any confusion earlier.

It's not meant to imply any wrongdoing or guilt.","183":"It works by creating an airtight seal around the window, reducing the amount of air that can flow in or out, and thus minimizing heat transfer. This thin plastic film is also a good insulator of heat itself, further enhancing the energy efficiency of the window.","184":"Yes, that's correct! Keeping the plastic film up during summer would help to reduce heat gain in your home by blocking out some of the long-wave infrared radiation and thereby preventing your home from heating up too much.","185":"Now in summer, wouldn't you want exactly the opposite? To let the heat out instead of trapping it in. That's why greenhouses have vents or fans.","186":"Constantine's conversion and the eventual making of Christianity the official religion did not happen overnight. Christianity started to spread through the Roman Empire during the 2nd century. This was largely due to the missionary efforts of figures like Paul and the martyrdom of early Christians. By the 3rd century, Christianity had a significant following, especially among the lower classes in the Empire. While it faced persecution under many emperors, its tenets appealed to a growing number of people. The movement gained momentum in the 4th century, and Constantine's tolerant attitude toward Christianity, as well as his own conversion, paved the way for the religion's growth. It was Constantine's successor, Theodosius I, who made Christianity the official religion of the Empire in 380 AD.","187":"I'd be happy to help you out, but next time, let's approach the question more constructively.","188":"The process of desalinating seawater requires large amounts of energy. This is primarily because the process involves distilling seawater, which is very energy-intensive. This increased energy usage contributes to greenhouse gas emissions, which in turn leads to further global warming, climate change, and other environmental issues. Additionally, desalinating seawater could potentially disrupt marine ecosystems, as the process involves intake and discharge of large volumes of seawater. Brine, which is a byproduct of the process, can kill marine life if it's discharged back into the ocean. Furthermore, desalination plants have been shown to harm local freshwater resources, as they require a significant amount of water to operate, potentially depleting nearby freshwater supplies.","189":"I didn't say that everyone was wrong, I just think it's necessary to look at multiple sources before accepting an answer, and it's quite rude to dismiss everyone's opinions like that. You could respectfully agree to disagree or admit not knowing something. Let's keep this discussion civil.","190":"and also, you could implement stricter gun control laws, regular checks, and penalties for unlawful possession, which would make it harder for warlords to amass a large number of weapons in the first place","191":"Did you know that meat production is responsible for a significant portion of greenhouse gas emissions? According to the United Nations, the meat industry generates more greenhouse gas emissions than all the vehicles in the world combined. This is because livestock produce a lot of methane, a potent greenhouse gas, when they digest their food. Going vegan can help reduce these emissions and slow down global warming. Moreover, livestock farming requires vast amounts of water. It takes about 1,800 gallons of water to produce just one pound of beef. That's enough water to meet the needs of 50 people for a day! Dairy does not fare much better, as it takes about 500 gallons of water to make a gallon of milk. By contrast, plant-based foods require much less water to produce. For example, it takes only about 39 gallons of water to produce a pound of vegetables. So, by going vegan, not only can you help combat climate change, you can also help conserve water resources. In addition, deforestation is a major concern when it comes to livestock farming. Large areas of forests are cut down to create pastures for livestock or to grow animal feed. Deforestation contributes to carbon emissions and loss of biodiversity. By choosing to go vegan, you can help protect forests and the countless species that call them home. Lastly, it's worth mentioning that plant-based diets are healthier for humans too. They are lower in saturated fats, higher in fiber, and rich in vitamins and minerals. So, not only can going vegan saves the environment, but it can also improve your health. It's a win-win situation!","192":"Your current response implies a lack of trust in the existing system to address the problem you've raised. To correct this, you could say something like: 'I understand your frustration, but I'm encouraged by the possibility that as a society, we can innovate and collaborate to find feasible solutions, as you've suggested with the vacuum harvesting idea. However, it's essential to acknowledge the complexity of such a project, which requires collaboration from individuals with various skills and resources, from engineering and manufacturing, to securing investments and gaining government approval. Trusting in a collective effort to address this issue can lead to significant progress, and I have faith that someone, maybe even multiple people, will rise to the challenge.'","193":"Here's the thing, while your suggestion is innovative, it doesn't take into account the immense quantity of methane that escapes daily. A vacuuming system, as you described, would require immense energy and operational costs to run continuously. Unfortunately, the scale of these operations would outweigh the benefits, making it highly impractical. Regarding your other points, you are correct that overcompensation and animal abuse are concerns, cow flatulence does contribute to greenhouse gases, tending to livestock consumes non-renewable resources, and land efficiency could be better optimized with vertical farming.","194":"I'm not sure how my game device purchase affects the effectiveness of my argument, as it seems we're discussing strategies in a game, not financial investments.

The term 'metal jacket' refers to the outer shell of the bullet, which is made entirely of a hard metal like copper or brass, whereas in conventional ammunition, the bullet has a lead core and a thin layers of the same hard metal or a gilding metal to hold the lead and protect the bullet's nose from deforming upon firing. The main purpose of FMJ ammunition is to create a narrower and more pointed hole in the target, promoting better penetration and decreasing the risk of bullet deformation during flight. This makes it ideal for target shooting and military applications where the aim is to penetrate the target effectively.","199":null,"200":"Alcoholism is a disease because when you drink alcohol, it changes the way your brain functions. The brain becomes dependent on the substance, and when you try to stop drinking, your body goes through withdrawal symptoms.

Just like those diseases, alcoholism can be managed with treatment and support, but it's a lifelong condition that requires ongoing care.","201":"Actually, the name 'Noble Gases' comes from their chemical inactivity, referred to as their 'noble' or 'inert' behavior. They are stable and don't easily react with other elements. The name doesn't have any specific references to aristocrats or Buddhist-style references to nobility.","202":"Over long periods, heavier elements continuously decay into lighter elements. However, the decay chain eventually stops at Lead-206, which is a stable isotope. So no, not everything will eventually be super heavy or super light.

On one hand, it could stimulate the economy by funding projects, creating jobs, and contributing to charitable causes. However, extreme wealth inequality, which results from a lack of wealth redistribution, can lead to social and economic issues. For instance, it can exacerbate poverty, hinder political representation, and foster a sense of alienation among the less wealthy. Moreover, monopolies and market manipulation can occur when a single individual or family accumulates too much wealth, potentially stifling competition and innovation. Ultimately, a more equitable distribution of wealth is beneficial for creating a more just, stable, and prosperous society.","206":"They are given the name noble gases because they are very stable and unreactive. The name is not meant to be a political or religious reference, but rather a scientific one. The nobility in this context refers to the Latin word 'nobilis', which means supreme or first rate, describing the high stability and inactivity of these elements.","207":"The noble elements will not decay into other elements because they are not radioactive. For the period of time in which the universe has existed, no noble element has been observed to undergo radioactive decay. As for your question about a 19th column, the periodic table is organized based on the atomic number, not the element's position in the decay process. Therefore, the periodic table remains unchanged with 18 columns. Regarding your question on hydrogen-1, it is stable and doesn't undergo radioactive decay. However, when hydrogen is under extreme temperatures and pressures, such as inside a star, it can fuse with other hydrogen atoms to create helium through a process called nuclear fusion, which is different from radioactive decay.","208":"Well, actually, lead isn't a radioactive element. It doesn't decay into something else. It's one of the stable elements, so it doesn't undergo radioactive decay to form other elements. It has no half-life.","209":"No, there cannot be a 9th row. The number of rows in the periodic table follows the number of periods, which is 8 in the present context. Adding a 9th row would contradict the current structure of the periodic table.","210":"There have been attempts to synthesize new elements up to atomic number 118, but the half-lives of these elements are so short that it's nearly impossible to observe their properties or confirm their existence conclusively for long enough periods. Additionally, the costs and technical requirements to synthesize these elements are immense. Therefore, it's unlikely that we will find 50 long-lived elements to fill the 8th row and move on to the 9th row anytime soon.","211":"I've actually heard it from multiple sources, not just my driving instructor.

This borrowing creates demand for money, which can influence interest rates and economic growth. The money is then paid back with interest, which provides a source of income for lenders.","216":"When the government issues bonds, it does incur a debt. The government borrows money from investors (usually through banks) by selling them government bonds, and promises to repay the principal and interest when the bonds mature. The central bank can buy these government bonds from the investors, which is known as quantitative easing. However, this does not directly cause inflation, as the money created to buy the bonds is not necessarily passed on to the general public. Instead, the banks receive reserves and can lend more money to others, which can potentially stimulate economic activity and possibly lead to inflation if there is an excess of money chasing insufficient goods and services.","217":null,"218":null,"219":"For growth, often. Non-dividend shares from companies reinvest their earnings to grow their business rather than paying out dividends. This can lead to significant long-term capital appreciation if the company's growth strategy is successful.","220":"That analogy makes sense, but it's important to note that unlike a goose, a company doesn't lay golden eggs daily. Companies generate revenue, but they often re-invest that money back into the company to grow rather than dividing it among shareholders. The purpose of having shares is to provide a way for a company to raise capital from investors, who then become partial owners of the company, sharing in its profits through dividends, and in its success through the possible increase in the value of their shares.","221":"People buy these stocks with the expectation that the company will grow and its value will increase, making the shares more valuable than when they were purchased. So while the intrinsic value may not be tangible like food or water, there is still perceived value that drives the buying and selling of shares. This perceived value is not based on the actual product, but on the potential future growth and profits of the company. This is different from MLMs where the products have little to no competition and are only sold through the company, not on open markets.","222":"You buy non-dividend shares not for immediate income, but for long-term capital appreciation.

The Earth is round, but it's more accurate to visualize it as an oblate spheroid. When a plane takes off from an airport, it moves towards the direction of its destination, often appearing to 'fly over' the Earth's surface. This is possible because airplanes can fly in three dimensions, not just horizontally but also up and down (climbing or descending). So, while it might look like a plane is 'flying on' the bottom of the globe, it's really just traveling through the air, moving along a path around the Earth's surface due to the Earth's rotation and gravity.","228":"Yes, that's correct. It would appear upside down to an observer in space as the plane's tail would be pointing towards the earth and the nose would be pointing away.","229":"because Apple has a reputation for having more secure and user-friendly systems compared to Android, and using Android as a counterpoint in a discussion about Apple's security is a way to divert attention from the original issue, often by pointing to another company's flaws, which is known as whataboutism.","230":"That's assumptions, as employers might choose to pass these increased costs onto employees through reduced wages, or absorb the costs themselves. On the other hand, if the savings from eliminating private health premiums exceed the increased FICA tax payments, employees could potentially see a net decrease in their total compensation.","231":"So, in the case of non-dividend stocks, the value is also subjective and based on the market demand, much like in the case of MLMs where the value of the product is also primarily based on the perceived value by the customers, rather than an intrinsic value.","232":"You could say that wholesaling involves dealing with specific types of goods, not just any random items. So, it's more like apples vs apples and oranges vs oranges, rather than apples vs oranges.","233":"But in MLM, the risks are much higher because the product's value isn't intrinsic like apples. If you can't sell them, the products often go unsold and become dead inventory. There's less flexibility because you're often tied to a specific brand or product, and you don't have the option of turning them into compost or using them for personal consumption. Furthermore, even if you do manage to sell them, the profit margins are usually very low, making it difficult to make a significant income.","234":" Alcoholism is a disease because it affects the brain similar to other diseases like Alzheimer's or Parkinson's. When one drinks alcohol, it alters the chemical balance in the brain which can lead to addiction. Over time, this can cause changes in brain structure and function, resulting in compulsive alcohol consumption despite negative consequences. Just like with any other disease, appropriate treatment can help manage alcoholism, but it's not something one can simply quit without help.","235":"Smoking is not technically considered a disease, but it is the cause of several diseases such as COPD and lung cancer. It is classified more as a habit, or addiction, and the physical damage it causes to the body is what constitutes the diseases.","236":"National Socialism is a mixture of capitalism and statism, and economically, it was skewed towards big business and the wealthy. Economically, it is closest to modern far-right policies. Politically, the far-right generally advocates for authoritarianism, which was a hallmark of the Nazi Party. So, the definition of 'far-right' encompasses the Nazi Party.","237":"There isn't any inherent reason why flamboyant heterosexual males are less common than flamboyant homosexual males. Personalities and expressions of individuals can vary greatly, regardless of sexual orientation. However, societal norms and expectations associated with masculinity can lead to some men feeling pressure to conform, which may suppress the expression of some of their more flamboyant traits. This is not to say that flamboyant heterosexual males do not exist; they certainly do. But it's important to acknowledge the potential influence of societal factors in the perceived difference between the expression of masculinity and flamboyance in men with different sexual orientations.","238":"Narcoanalysis tests can't be used in every trial because they have several limitations. Firstly, they only work when the person being tested has recently consumed drugs, so their effectiveness is time-sensitive. Secondly, the results can sometimes be unreliable and are often influenced by the person's state of mind, including their fear, stress, or willingness to cooperate. Lastly, these tests are invasive and can cause discomfort or harm, especially if not administered properly. For these reasons, they are not used as a regular tool in law enforcement investigations.","239":"Because schools provide not only education, but also experiences, connections, and a sense of identity that often lasts a lifetime, leading people to feel a deep-rooted attachment to their alma mater.","240":"While I'm glad you've found your own approach to building and perceiving relationships, I want you to understand that it's common and natural for people to feel a sense of gratitude towards the institutions that facilitated these connections. It's not so much about thanking the institution per se, but rather acknowledging the role it played in bringing these important people into your life.","241":"Well, when it comes to the emotional connections and culture surrounding the school, those are also reasons why people put effort into fundraising events. Some alumni feel a strong connection to their alma mater and want to give back in any way they can, including financially. Others may want to preserve the tradition and legacy of their school by contributing to its improvement.","242":"In such a private, closed system, there won't be a market reaction at first because the supply of seashells has increased but its demand remains the same (since no one knows about the new discovered shells), so the value of the shells would tend to decrease. However, when people start to notice the decreasing value of shells and find out that their purchasing power has reduced, they might start to question the scarcity of the shells, which could make them suspicious about the discovery of new shells. This could potentially disrupt the market and undermine the belief in the shell-based economy.","243":"But that is a historical practice that was necessary when money was backed by gold, and we have since moved away from that. Modern central banks, such as the Federal Reserve, create money through a process called fractional-reserve banking where loans create new money. This new money is digital, and its creation involves editing numbers on a computer, not printing physical banknotes.","244":"Government borrows money because it may need funds for investment in public infrastructure, welfare programs, or paying off prior debts. Another reason is that the interest earned on the borrowed money can be used to fund government operations. Additionally, borrowing can help stabilize the economy by absorbing excess supply of money during periods of high economic growth.","245":"In a broad sense, the genetic code is decoded through the process of transcription and translation. Genes are segments of DNA, and each gene contains the instructions for a specific protein or RNA molecule. The first step, transcription, involves copying the DNA sequence into a complementary RNA sequence. This RNA molecule then leaves the cell nucleus and enters the cytoplasm, where the second step, translation, takes place. Translation is where the RNA serves as a template for the synthesis of a protein by a ribosome. The ribosome reads the RNA sequence in groups of three nucleotides, or codons. For each codon, it selects a specific amino acid from a pool, following the genetic code, which is a table that defines the correspondence between codons and amino acids. By stringing together a series of amino acids in a specific order defined by the gene, the ribosome synthesizes the protein. This protein, in turn, functions to perform various tasks within the cell, such as enzymes that catalyze specific biochemical reactions, structural components like cell walls or parts of the cell membrane, and regulatory proteins controlling various processes. This process helps explain how a seed or seedling knows what, how, and when to grow, as each part is built from specific proteins whose synthesis is guided by the gene expression. There's no intelligence necessary to interpret the genetic code, as the entire process is driven by the physical and chemical interactions between molecules and governed by the laws of chemistry and physics.","246":null,"247":"That's correct! You express your ideas to engage, challenge, and learn from others. This interchange of thoughts forms the essence of a debate, bringing diverse perspectives into conversation.","248":"Well, non-dividend shares are usually bought for long-term capital gains. They grow in value over time, and when you sell them, you pay capital gains tax on the profit. This can be a significant source of investment return, especially if the company performs well.","249":"In essence, inherent value in a stock is often derived from its potential future value due to factors like market growth, earnings, or the company's strategic positioning. A stock that doesn't return dividends may still have inherent value if it shows strong growth prospects or is perceived to be a good investment by potential buyers.","250":"Yes, as an individual shareholder, you don't have the ability to sell the individual assets of the company like land or equipment directly. However, you can sell your shares to another investor, who will then become the owner of those assets indirectly.","251":null,"252":"In corporate workplaces, maintaining a well-groomed appearance is expected to instill a sense of professionalism and adhere to certain norms associated with the culture of the office. An afro, while celebrating African American heritage, can sometimes be deemed as unprofessional due to its perceived 'ethnic' or 'casual' appearance that may not align with the conservative and standardised dress codes prevalent in some corporate environments.","253":"Nothing necessarily, but cultural or personal biases might exist that contribute to miscommunication, discomfort, or misunderstanding, leading to tension among coworkers. It's crucial for employees to have a welcoming and inclusive work environment.","254":"Self replication is not about 'want' but rather about inheritance. Life forms and viruses reproduce so that the genetic material passed on to the offspring is identical or very similar to the parent. This ensures that the organism retains the essential traits necessary for survival and reproduction. In nature, organisms with better 'reproductive strategies' have a higher chance of survival and propagation.","255":"The tendency for self-replication in viruses and other life forms is driven by a process called evolution, which selects for traits that enhance survival and reproduction. Over billions of years, variations in the genetic material of organisms have generated a wide spectrum of life forms, each optimized for its specific environment. While a stable, unchanging state might be considered an equilibrium in a sense, life as we know it is far from static; it's dynamic and ever-changing, driven by mutations, recombinations, and natural selection. This dynamism allows life to adapt and persist in the face of changing environmental conditions, making it seem counter-intuitive but actually very efficient in the grand scheme of things.","256":"A tachometer is an instrument in a vehicle that measures engine revolutions per minute (RPM). It allows drivers to see how hard the engine is working and to avoid running the engine at dangerously high RPM for extended periods. High RPM can cause engine damage, so a tachometer helps drivers to maintain a safe operating range and keeps the engine running smoothly and efficiently.","257":"Yes, I could be mistaken, but the general consensus from trained professionals is that skipping gears is not harmful to the car, as modern cars have mechanisms to handle it. However, it might not be the most efficient way to drive and could potentially damage the clutch over time if done excessively.","258":"It belongs in the question club, not the explain club.","259":"It seems like you're frustrated with the situation, and I understand why. That's why I'd like to clarify that when I mentioned 'an astute need' for tutoring, it was in a reference to the content's complexity or the urgency, not a judgment of your abilities. I apologize if I caused any confusion or distress.","260":null,"261":"The Big Bang was not caused by something, but rather it was an expansion of space-time itself. Before this expansion, the universe was in a state of extreme density and high temperature. So technically, there was not 'nothing', but something extremely dense that then expanded and led to the Big Bang.","262":"I understand your frustration. It's a complex concept that requires rewiring our traditional understanding of causality. Imagine observing a coin flip without knowing the initial position of the coin. You see the result (heads or tails) but have no knowledge about the cause (the initial position). In quantum physics, particles behave in a similar way, popping in and out of existence, and their precise state at any given moment is unknown until we measure it. The big bang is another example. The most widely accepted theory suggests the universe began as a singularity, a dense point from which it expanded rapidly. The cause for this expansion is unknown, yet we can observe its effects. To sum it up, although we can't always identify a direct cause, the effects are still visible and measurable.","263":null,"264":"Well, it can lead to misunderstandings and resentment among coworkers. It could also create an uncomfortable work environment, as people might feel the need to disclose their own salaries out of necessity or to avoid appearing poorly compensated. Additionally, discussing salaries may violate company policies or labor laws, particularly in some countries.","265":"Well, my personal experience has been quite different in that context. I've worked in environments where discussing salary was not only acceptable but encouraged, such as startups or creative agencies. However, I must agree that it seems there's a divide based on generations, as it seems less common among younger generations. Perhaps there's a change in mindset happening among the newer workforce","266":"That sounds really tough. It seems like you've been facing resistance in unionizing. Have you considered reaching out to a labor union for support? They might have resources or guidance on how to move forward without getting fired.","267":"Men who undergo genital amputation still experience sexual urges due to the survival of the peripheral nerves associated with sexual sensations. However, these biological signals aren't directed towards the amputated organ. There are alternative methods for sexual gratification, such as masturbation with the remaining intact body parts, or the use of prosthetics. In some cases, relationships and psychological support are critical for managing these urges.","268":"Money has evolved over time to become a more convenient and efficient method of exchange. Unlike gold, it's easier to divide into smaller units, transport, and store. Additionally, it's not subject to degradation, as gold is, and it can be easily verified, which isn't always the case with gold. Lastly, money represents a standard of value, making transactions and pricing more uniform. This is why people prefer using money over gold for most trades.","269":"That would be time-consuming and uneconomical as weighing each coin individually takes much more time than just counting the coins. Hence, we started using machines to stamp the coins with a specific weight.","270":"Yes, I'm fascinated by it and have been reading about different chemical reactions lately.","271":null,"272":"I see your point, but it's important to remember that while some smart individuals might come up with promising ideas, implementing them at a large scale requires resources, support, and collaboration from various sectors, including industry, government, and finance. These resources aren't readily available for every great idea, and it's a long and complicated process to secure them. Also, as you've pointed out, even if a solution seems feasible in theory, it's crucial to consider its practicality, environmental impact, and long-term sustainability.","273":"Here is what I can add to your points - #5 The technology required to vacuum methane from the ground at a large scale and in a timely manner is not yet available or economically viable. #6 Even if it were, the sheer volume of methane being released would be an overwhelming task to capture and store effectively. #7 Methane capture would only be a temporary solution, as more methane would continue to be released as the permafrost melts and thaws over time. #8 The best solution to combat climate change and mitigate the impact of melting permafrost is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and stop further destruction of the environment. #9 Investing in renewable energy sources and supporting efforts to combat deforestation could help to achieve this goal.","274":null,"275":"No, the National Socialists in Germany had a centralized plan for the economy with state control, but it was also extremely nationalist, racist, and authoritarian.

For example, a round-trip ticket from City A to City B and back may be sold for the price of a one-way ticket from City A to City C, where City C is a connecting city. This strategy works because most people prefer to fly directly between City A and City B. However, if a passenger still wants to visit City C, they can book separate, cheaper one-way tickets. This is referred to as hidden city ticketing or hidden city trick.","277":"When millions of unwanted people come here, it can lead to social tension and conflicts, as the host population may perceive immigrants as taking away their jobs, resources, and affecting their culture. This can result in xenophobic sentiments and potentially political instability.","278":"Good job, keep motivated and don't forget to share your progress!","279":"Explainee: Correct!

If you think your post should be here, feel free to message the moderators for reconsideration. :~)","281":"I would be more than happy to provide a detailed explanation. In the question's removal case, the issue is often not about disliking the question, but rather about the site's guidelines. For example, questions should be asked in good faith, should not be asking for opinions, and should provide enough context for answering. A juror, on the other hand, has to evaluate evidence, apply the law, and make a decision based on this information in a court of law. While both tasks involve evaluation, understanding the reasoning behind a juror's decision is much more nuanced and complex than understanding a question's removal.","282":"I'm referring to the 'astute need' for tutoring. You seem to be misunderstanding the context of my previous statement and making baseless assumptions. My apologies for any confusion.","283":"In a nutshell, anti-matter does exist and can be created under certain conditions in particle accelerators on Earth. However, when anti-matter meets matter (like in the case of an electron and a positron), they annihilate each other, producing energy in the form of gamma rays. Regarding your question about anti-gravity: No, anti-gravity isn't currently a scientifically proven phenomenon. While gravitons (the hypothetical particles that mediate the force of gravity) haven't been directly observed yet, they have been proposed to exist. If they exist, they would be massless and have spin 2, unlike photons (which are the particles mediating the electromagnetic force) that have spin 1. Therefore, if gravity did have an 'opposite', it wouldn't be a simple inverse of the force we know, but a whole new force mediated by a different type of particle.","284":"You are probably thinking about the Rubik's Cube, not the Tesseract. The Tesseract is a four-dimensional cube and it cannot be visualized in a three-dimensional world. Therefore, a picture of it would not be helpful here and it does not move like a Rubik's Cube. The model of the Tesseract that I am referring to has 8 cubes arranged in a specific pattern, and seems strange due to the perspective, even though it appears to have fewer cubes.","285":"No, they aren\u2019t literally listening to you.

However, if you feel strongly about having a fresh perspective, you could consider supporting candidates from younger generations. This is typically a democratic principle where the citizens elect the representatives they believe will best represent their interests. In the end, it's important to do thorough research on each candidate's policies and background before deciding whom to support.","289":"Narcoanalysis is a psychological technique used to bring repressed memories to the conscious mind, but it requires the person to be under the influence of a truth serum, typically sodium pentothal. While it can be useful in certain situations, there are several reasons why it's not used in every trial. Firstly, the results of narcoanalysis are often not admissible in court due to concerns about the reliability of the information obtained while under the influence of the drug. Secondly, the process of administering and interpreting the results of a narcoanalysis requires specialized training, making it expensive and time-consuming. Lastly, there are ethical concerns about using the method, as it involves potential harm to the person being subjected to it through the use of a powerful sedative. Therefore, it's only used in specific cases, such as helping to identify the perpetrators of serious crimes like murder, where traditional methods have failed.","290":"I did not say the current system is better in every way than narcoanalysis tests. I pointed out that the primary purpose of the judicial system is to determine guilt or innocence, and that the system you suggested, which relies on narcoanalysis, is a significant departure from that purpose as it is not based on evidence and testimony but on the subject's state of mind induced by a substance. The current system, while imperfect, is designed to address and account for human factors like bias, manipulation, and deceit, whereas your proposed system would bypass these issues, but at the cost of disregarding the fundamental principles of a fair and evidence-based trial.","291":"I'm using the analogy of breaking an arm vs having bone cancer to illustrate that, while neither the current system nor narco tests are perfect, the current system - which is slow and cumbersome - is 'worse' in a sense that it takes much longer to reach a conclusion, while narco tests, despite their flaws, are faster and more straightforward.","292":"That would be a more accurate measure. However, it would make the coins cost more to produce since they would be heavier, and also larger in size. For the convenience of the common people, it would be more feasible to continue with the current method, despite the potential for shaving. This is because, even though shaving reduces the value of the coin, it is still recognizable as the coin it is meant to be, and can continue to serve its purpose as a medium of exchange. Additionally, detecting shaved coins would fall under the domain of the police and other law enforcers, who would take any necessary action against those who commit such acts.","293":"Tanning is often seen as a way for a white person to achieve a 'healthy' outdoorsy appearance and a sign of leisure or wealth, as it implies having time to spend in the sun. However, for non-white individuals, lightening their skin is often seen as an attempt to emulate European beauty standards and to distance themselves from perceived negative stereotypes associated with their own ethnicity. It's important to note that skin color is a matter of personal preference, but cultural and societal factors can influence how people perceive and react to different skin tones. It's essential to promote understanding, respect, and acceptance of all skin colors and to challenge harmful beauty norms.","294":"Well, tanning is a natural response to the sun's ultraviolet rays, promoting the production of melanin in your skin to protect it from burns. On the other hand, intentionally lightening your skin is often associated with harmful practices, such as the use of harmful chemical products or even skin-bleaching creams, which can have serious health consequences. These practices are not natural and can lead to various skin problems, including permanent scarring and an increased risk of skin cancer. Therefore, it's more concerning to intentionally lighten your skin than to limit sun exposure naturally.","295":"Yes, it's perfectly fine to use sunblock or wear clothing, including covering your face, as it ensures you're protected from harmful UV rays while still allowing you to get the necessary amount of sunlight for vitamin D production and maintaining a healthy sleep cycle and hormones.","296":"Clothes do prevent tanning to a certain extent. However, they don't completely block UV rays, which can cause tanning or a sunburn. The degree of protection depends on the fabric and clothing type. For instance, clothes made from thicker materials offer more protection than thin ones like a t-shirt versus a tank top. Also, some UV rays can pass through the fabric and reach the skin. For example, UVA rays can penetrate clothing deeply, causing damage to the skin and contributing to the aging process. However, it's important to note that sunlight exposure is not the only factor that determines skin color. Skin tone is influenced by a combination of genetics, melanin production, and environmental factors. Therefore, while clothes can help limit tanning, going out of your way to lighten your skin would require other methods, some of which might be harmful to your skin and health.","297":"The topic we're discussing is about skin care remedies. It doesn't make sense to discuss preventing tanning vs actively lightening the skin in the context of skin care as they are two different aspects. One is about sun protection while the other is about lightening pigmentation. I didn't mean to patronize you.","298":"And the website you're trying to argue with backs up the claim - https:\/\/goodlookingtan.com\/can-you-tan-through-clothing\/ states that while all materials are different, clothes should not be relied on to prevent the sun\u2019s harmful rays from reaching your skin.","299":"The name 'Noble Gases' comes from their inert nature and lack of reactivity, which is similar to the nobility in the feudal age who were exempted from certain duties.

While some organisms might not be able to produce viable offspring, they can still share a common ancestor. This is known as 'species'. The ability to interbreed is one of the criteria used to define a species, but it is not the only one.","306":"No, that's not quite accurate. In the context of the expanding universe, if we were at the center, we would not be able to observe galaxies 'moving towards us' because they are all moving away. The way I described it, the Milky Way and other galaxies are not moving towards us in the sense that they're approaching our location, but rather we, and everything else, are moving apart. For the example of objects in a lake, the waves do not move towards the dropped rock as it creates the ripples, just as the galaxies don't move towards us, but instead, we move away from them due to the cosmic expansion. However, I agree that dark energy can account for objects that appear to be accelerating towards us due to their motion within the frame of the expanding universe, but the overall movement is a result of the cosmic expansion itself. I apologize if my explanation was confusing earlier.","307":"It's known as autonomic dysreflexia. This condition is typically associated with spinal cord injuries in the thoracic region of the spine.

In contrast, buying stocks of different companies allows you to invest in different sectors or industries, but the stocks are not directly comparable because they represent ownership in different companies with different business models and strategies.","330":"You're correct in saying that there is more flexibility in my example with apples, but in the context of MLMs, the product is often overpriced and unsellable to retail consumers, as they can buy the same product at a lower price at regular stores. The 'intrinsic value' you mentioned doesn't exist for most MLM products, and even if it does, it's often not the main selling point. The major concern with MLMs is the high initial investment and the pressure to recruit new members to make sales targets, rather than relying on the sale of products. Unlike the orchard example, you're not purchasing apples to eat them yourself; you're buying them to resell at a profit. In MLMs, however, even with recruitment, it can be difficult to make significant profits due to high competition and the unsustainable business model.","331":"The common cold is caused by various strains of viruses, primarily the rhinovirus. During the off season, these viruses don't just disappear; they continue to exist in the environment. They can survive on surfaces, like doorknobs and toys, for several hours. When the cold weather starts again, the virus spreads easily in closed environments where people are in close contact. Also, our bodies get less exposure to the virus during the warmer months, which is why we don't get colds as often then.","332":"Because passwords are intended to be a user's first line of defense against unauthorized access, they are made complex so as to be difficult for potential attackers to guess or crack. On the other hand, security questions are meant as a secondary form of identification. They tend to be simple and personal, making it easy for account holders to remember. However, since the answers are often publicly available information or can be guessed, they should be supplemented by other forms of authentication like multi-factor identification for increased security.","333":"Well, even though some personal information can be publicly available, it's important to note that not everyone shares such details. Also, even if one can find a list of possible high schools or streets you lived on, it requires time and effort to narrow down the correct answer. Moreover, such questions are designed to be personalized, so even if some information is public, it's unlikely that all the specific combinations of questions would be easily found. Finally, the security questions used in applications are usually more obscure compared to common facts about someone's life.","334":"If using a service like publicdata.com, while it may provide certain information, it's important to note that not all information is available publicly. Some information, like your credit report or history, requires private information such as your social security number, full name, address, or other identifying details. Hence, such services can potentially expose your personal information to those who may misuse it.","335":"I agree that it's not an ideal situation. However, the focus here is on preventing large-scale cyber threats. When we talk about targeted attacks, they are usually carried out by highly skilled attackers, often nation-state actors. For an average user or smaller organization, the resources to defend against such attacks can be overwhelming. Thus, the emphasis is on defending against broad-spectrum attacks that could impact a larger number of people.","336":"Alcoholism is considered a disease because it's a chronic and often relapsing brain disorder. It's influenced by a combination of genetic, psychological, and environmental factors. Over time, excessive alcohol use can damage parts of the brain responsible for memory, learning, coordination, and judgment. Thus, alcoholics can't control their drinking despite the damaging effects it has on their lives.","337":" No, I wouldn't have argued against all the doctors in the past. The understanding of diseases and their causes evolve with time based on new research and evidence. In the 30s, the consensus was different, but we now have a better understanding of this condition as a disease.","338":"","339":"It sounds like you're referring to something else. To clarify, the term 'astute need' meant a critical need or requirement for the tutoring session. If you have additional questions or concerns, I'd be happy to address them.","340":"An Afro might be considered unprofessional in corporate workplaces due to the stereotype that an Afro hairstyle is associated with a more casual or informal setting, and the professional world often demands a more conservative look to fit their company's image and adhere to customer expectations, although these perceptions can vary depending on the industry and cultural background.","341":"There are certainly roles in business that would appreciate individuality and self-expression, but it's important to be mindful of the culture of the specific company you're applying to. Some companies might have a more conservative dress code or policies in place. If you're open to a conversation about different career paths within business that might cater to your self-expression, I'd be happy to help.","342":"The reason is that the equator is the widest part of Earth, meaning the circumference at the equator is greater than at either of the poles. However, the northern hemisphere includes the majority of Earth's continents, which take up more space. Also, water areas like oceans and lakes are counted as part of a hemisphere, and Earth's oceans are concentrated towards the equator, with smaller land areas in both hemispheres. The difference in land area between the two hemispheres is not as significant when you consider Earth's total surface area.","343":"That's correct! The high-energy particles in radiation can cause breaks and mutations in the DNA molecules of cells. This damage can disrupt the normal functioning of cells and hinder the body's ability to repair or replace them. Over time, this can lead to the development of cancer or other serious health complications, especially if a large number of cells are affected.","344":null,"345":"Walmart is a private company, and as such, the government does not force them to allow unions. Workers must unionize voluntarily and prove that a majority of the workforce supports the union in order for a union to be recognized. Walmart can actively discourage unionization through a variety of tactics, such as anti-union training for managers, threatening employees with job loss for union activity, and moving stores to avoid unionization.","346":"No, they cannot legally deny a majority vote of employees to unionize. The National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) guarantees workers the right to form and join unions, and to bargain collectively for better wages, hours, and working conditions. However, employers can challenge the unionization attempt through various means and they can attempt to influence their employees' decision.","347":"They can't deny it outright, as it's not explicitly a union, but they may have policies against any employee groupings aimed at collective bargaining, regardless of label. However, it's important to check their specific policies and consult with a labor attorney about the legality of such proposals.","348":"Sunscreen primarily stays on the outermost layer of your skin and is not absorbed into the body. Some ingredients of sunscreen, like oxybenzone, can enter the bloodstream in trace amounts, but the body doesn't metabolize it. Instead, a small percentage is excreted through urine. The remaining sunscreen breaks down over time on the skin through regular washings and exposure to sunlight, which helps to limit its accumulation in the body.","349":"You might want to check the toxicity of the sunscreens there as EWG rates them by their skin absorption and potential harm.","350":"the scientific term is 'vulva', 'vajayjay' is a slang or colloquial term used for it. If you are curious and want to use the scientific term, you can use 'vulva' instead.","351":"Actually, it's named after the Latin word 'Nobilis', meaning noble or rare. These gases were discovered in the late 19th century, and they were so inert or unreactive that they were considered rare among the elements. Unlike other elements, they didn't need to combine to form compounds, hence the name 'Noble.'","352":"I see your point about ideological attachments to the gold standard and its historical political impact. However, from an economic perspective, counterfeiting is still problematic. For one, it's illegal and undermines trust in the financial system.Secondly, even if counterfeiters manage to produce near-perfect replicas, there's always the risk of being caught. Lastly, the gold standard, as a rule-based monetary system, provides predictability and stability, which can contribute to economic growth and development.","353":"The issue then would be managing the scarcity of other materials and ensuring equitable distribution. Gold, although considered valuable, is a non-essential and limited resource. In a post-scarcity society where all necessary materials are abundant, Gold would be considered a luxury. It would create disparities if some people had more gold than others, especially if it was used as a medium of exchange. It's essential to focus on providing for everyone's basic needs and ensuring equality in the distribution of these essential resources.","354":"Because of historical factors such as colonization, slavery, and lack of investment in infrastructure, Sub-Saharan Africa lags behind other regions in technological and economic advancements. Colonial powers often exploited the region's resources, leaving little room for development, and when they left, many countries were left with weak institutions and infrastructures. Additionally, the debt many countries inherited from colonial powers has burdened them, making it difficult to invest in technology and education. However, it's important to note that progress is being made, and many African countries are making strides in technology and development.","355":"Though all these diseases were indeed deadly, it's important to note that the scale of impact was significantly lower and prolonged due to better healthcare systems and vaccination programs in America. Compared to the Black Death, these diseases, while still harmful, are generally manageable with modern medicine.","356":"Sean Carroll is not saying that everyone who doesn't believe in the afterlife is wrong. He is simply sharing his perspective as a prominent physicist and cosmologist based on the scientific knowledge we have currently. It's important to consider various perspectives and evidence when forming our own beliefs, not just dismiss someone's opinion because they are a scientist.","357":"Yet, we do have evidence and understanding about how information is transmitted and processed in various parts of the brain, such as the neurons and synapses. The 'magic' that you refer to could potentially be explained by these processes, or some other undiscovered phenomenon, but assuming the existence of a supernatural or non-material cause without sufficient evidence is not based on facts or logic.","358":"But private health plans are not included in FICA taxes, so there won't be direct offset.","359":null,"360":"The 'No True Scotsman' fallacy is also not limited to conversations. It can be found in written arguments as well. Its prevalence may not be as common in everyday discussions, but it is still relevant in logical reasoning. The fallacy is taught in logic classes to help people identify flawed reasoning and avoid such fallacies in their own arguments. Moreover, even if it is rare in good faith arguments, it can still be used maliciously to manipulate people by appealing to a false sense of superiority or exclusivity within a particular group.","361":"But in an intellectual sense, it is possible for someone to make a logical error, such as the fallacy you mentioned, without being able to identify it themselves. Misinterpretations can occur even in the most thoughtful conversations, especially if one is not familiar with the specific logical fallacy in question.","362":"But that doesn't mean the people making such arguments are always correct. The fallacy lies in assuming that their personal belief determines the objective truth of the matter, and ignoring evidence to the contrary. While the fallacies may not be invoked frequently in formal debate or academic contexts, their informal usage is common in discussions about personal beliefs and preferences.","363":"Airline ticket pricing works in a complex manner. In the context of Hidden City tickets, two cities are used. Travelers book a ticket going from City A to City B with a layover at City C, but instead, they get off at City C because the price of the ticket for going non-stop to City C is cheaper. Hidden City tickets can seem like a win for passengers. However, when passengers book these tickets, airlines lose revenue for the longer trip. This is because airlines use a network pricing strategy to set the price of tickets, considering multiple factors like demand, competition, and distance. They predict that passengers who start their journey in City A may also end their journey there. This is why the price for a non-stop flight from City A to City C might be cheaper than the fare from City A to City B with a layover even though the direct flight is longer. So, Hidden City tickets can actually cost airlines because they are losing the revenue of the longer flight from passengers who choose the Hidden City trick.","364":null,"365":"Yes, you are correct. The business model can be different for different airlines. In the case of Lufthansa, a mid to high-end airline, the profit margin from ticket sales might be higher and ancillary revenue sources, such as food, beverages, and in-flight merchandise, might not be as crucial. However, it's still important to fill as many seats as possible to make the most of the ticket revenue. So, while free services are offered on some airlines, revenue from ancillary services can be substantial on others, and filling every seat maximizes the airline's overall profit.","366":"Oh, I didn't know that. That's...interesting. However, discussing about political donations doesn't change the topic at hand. Let's focus on understanding and respecting each other's perspectives.","367":"A computer, when first turned on, does not 'learn'. Instead, it follows a set of instructions, called a binary program, which are stored in its memory. This program has been pre-loaded during manufacturing and it dictates the initial operations that the computer performs. For example, it may display a welcome message on the screen, or start an operating system like Windows or MacOS. Over time, as the computer is used, its software can be updated or new programs can be installed, which may allow it to perform more complex functions and 'learn' in the sense that it can adapt to your usage patterns and preferences.","368":"Yes, essentially. The BIOS initiates the process that allows the CPU to read the memory where the program instructions are stored, and then execute them to perform the desired tasks.","369":null,"370":"So, the CPU performs actions based on the instruction set, which is a table of numbers (or mnemonics) that correspond to specific operations. When the CPU reads the number it calculated (let's call it the opcode), it will look up this number in the instruction set to find the corresponding operation. Once it finds the operation, it executes it. The opcode often needs additional information to actually carry out the operation, such as the memory address that contains the data or the destination register. These additional numbers are called operands, and they are often specified in the instruction as part of the instruction's binary representation.","371":"by relying on the specific program, which interprets the numerical value 8 as instructions to place a certain number of dots (pixels) on the screen, depending on the resolution of the monitor and the visual representation chosen by the program's designer.","372":"'No True Scotsman' is considered a fallacy because it is a way of dodging criticism by narrowing the definition of a group after it has been criticized (or condemned). It is used when someone says that members of a particular group behave in a certain way, which can be criticized, and then argue that the critic is actually talking about a different group by changing the defining criteria of the original group. So, if someone says 'All Scottish people are cheap', and when confronted about their Scottish friends who are not cheap, they would argue that the 'real Scotsmen' are not the ones they were referring to","373":"The No True Scotsman fallacy is a commonly known logical fallacy, and its existence is not limited to real-life conversations. Its importance lies in the fact that it illustrates a pattern of flawed reasoning that people might unconsciously or naively adopt in various contexts, not just in heated debates. The fallacy highlights the dangers of overgeneralizing, moving the goalposts, and employing stereotypes in arguments.","374":"I agree that it might be difficult to definitively prove the occurrence of the fallacy in all cases, especially in informal settings like actual debates. However, the burden of proof often lies with the one making the claim. In this case, the argument that the fallacy almost never happens in actual debate needs some evidence to support it. Otherwise, it could simply be an unfounded assumption.","375":"In those cases, they might be correct that the fallacy is not being committed, but they are using the term 'fallacy' incorrectly. The fallacy of Appeal to Ignorance can only be applied when a claim is made about the absence of evidence, not about personal beliefs or assumptions. So, while it's important to consider the context, what these people are doing is not an example of the fallacy of Appeal to Ignorance.","376":"it seems like you have a photographic memory for facts and details, but you might not have the ability to create or recall mental images, a condition known as 'aphantasia'.","377":"It reminds me of Feynman's anecdote. Just like how he learned that thoughts can be visual as well as verbal, your mind seems to work in a similar way. You imagined a scenario that started with a simple sheep jumping in a yard and then it turned into something completely different. This demonstrates the creative and visual aspect of thinking that Feynman talks about.","378":"To some extent, you're on the right track. In a four-dimensional model, everything that exists at a given point in three-dimensional space would be described by four coordinates - three for the location in space and one for the time at which the object exists at that location. However, unlike a static collection of objects, the four-dimensional view allows us to visualize the changes in those objects over time. So it's not so much a collection of static objects, but a dynamic 'fabric' of objects flowing through time.","379":"Amenorrhea, or the absence of menstruation for three months or more in women of reproductive age, is often experienced in cases of pregnancy or after menopause. It can also occur due to stress, extreme weight loss, intense exercise, or certain medical conditions. The ovaries stop releasing eggs, and the lining of the uterus thins and then is shed. However, in not-pregnant, non-menopausal women, a period typically occurs approximately every 28 days, lasting 3-7 days, and is the shedding of the uterus lining. Over this period, a thickened layer of tissue builds up in the uterus in anticipation of a fertilized egg. If the egg isn't fertilized, the body no longer needs the uterus lining, so it breaks down and is expelled, which is what we know as menstruation.","380":"Don't worry, it's all part of growing up. Your body will start to change, and it's completely normal. You'll start to develop hair in places like your armpits and around your genitals. Some boys choose to remove the hair, and some don't. It's all about personal preference.","381":"It's important to remember that 'thousands of years behind' is an oversimplification. Africa has a rich history of innovation and technological advancements, such as the invention of the plow, ironworking, and the counting system. However, the recent history of many sub-Saharan countries has been marred by colonialism, slavery, exploitation, and resource extraction. These factors have hindered the economic development and technological progress of the region. Additionally, instability, civil wars, and poor governance have prevented the long-term growth and investment necessary for technological advancements. These issues have created a cycle of poverty and underdevelopment that the region is still trying to break free from today.","382":"Explainee: Yeah, exactly. Europe didn't develop vaccines for the Black Death due to lack of understanding of the disease. In the case of the diseases in America, once scientists understood their causes, they were able to develop vaccines to prevent their spread.","383":"It didn't go anywhere. Instead, it was overshadowed by a new virus called SARS-CoV-2, which is the cause of COVID-19. As a result of measures taken to control the spread of COVID-19 such as social distancing and lockdowns, the number of influenza cases also significantly reduced.","384":"Influenza didn't disappear but it significantly decreased during the 2020-21 season due to the COVID-19 precautions like social distancing, mask-wearing, and travel restrictions have been very effective in reducing the spread of both viruses. However, as you've seen, influenza can re-emerge if people stop following precautions. The question of whether 47 people can bring it back is impossible to answer exactly, but if a large enough group of people contract the virus, it can be re-introduced into the population.","385":"Your body releases stress hormones, such as adrenaline and cortisol, during emotional stressors. These hormones cause your body to reallocate resources away from digestion towards more immediate needs, like fighting or fleeing, which can lead to feelings of nausea and loss of appetite.","386":"Thanks so much! I don't consider myself that strong, but I did push myself to make changes and take control of my life. You can do it too, even the smallest changes can have a big impact.","387":"Thank you so much for saying that! Remember, it's okay to lean on your loved ones during tough times, and it's great to see everyone in this community coming together to offer support. You're valued here, and I'm here for you whenever you need to talk or share. Let's continue to support each other on this journey.","388":"It's not quite accurate to say that life or viruses 'want' to self-replicate, as they don't have consciousness or desires. Instead, they have evolved through natural selection to pass on their genetic material, which allows them to produce more organisms (in the case of life) or more viruses, thereby increasing their representation within their environments.","389":"The rudimentary thing I was talking about is called a \u2018von Neumann machine\u2019 - a self-replicating system. In this theory, the first self-replicating molecules (the 'programs') were able to make copies of themselves using the elements from their environment, essentially multiplying and evolving into more complex molecules and over time, complex structures, such as DNA. This evolution was likely a result of both chance and natural selection, as the molecules that were able to better survive and replicate became more common over time.","390":"However, the greenhouse gasses emitted by bio-fuel are considerably lower than those emitted by oil. Moreover, using bio-fuel reduces our dependence on fossil fuels, which can contribute to energy independence in the long run.","391":"The first issue you bring up about energy consumption could be true but bio-diesel can be made from non-food agricultural waste and other organic wastes, reducing the burden on arable land. The second issue about cost could also be mitigated by the fact that bio-diesel is produced domestically, reducing the need for costly imports.","392":"The sunscreen gets absorbed by your skin, but it doesn't get metabolized by your body. It doesn't get stored either in a usable form. Instead, most of it is excreted from your body through urine, and the remaining parts get expelled through sweat.","393":"Be sure to check the EWG's 2018 database for a comprehensive list of sunscreens and their safety ratings.","394":"It depends on the specific jurisdiction. In most cases, they can't deny the unionization once a majority vote of employees has been achieved, but there are several legal ways they can discourage unionization or dispute the vote.","395":"I'm not a lawyer, but it's possible that management could question the legitimacy of the proposal or the intent behind it. However, if it does not violate any specific laws or company policies, and if it doesn't disrupt the work environment, they may not be able to simply deny it. They might want to engage in discussions or negotiations regarding the proposal.","396":"You will not get the 1\/100 outcome, since you are trying all possible outcomes and you are trying exactly 100 times, which is the same as all 100 possible outcomes.","397":"I thought you said infinite plus anything is still infinite, which would imply that 1 is equal to 1 plus infinite; contradicting your initial statement.","398":"Alcoholism is a disease because it is a chronic and often relapsing brain disorder caused by excessive and repeated use of alcohol. This results in the deterioration of the brain's structure and function, leading to harmful behaviors and an inability to control the intake of alcohol despite its negative effects on health and lifestyle.","399":"The four other types of materials besides metals are nonmetals, metalloids, polymers, and biomolecules.","400":"Organic compounds are another large grouping. For example, water (H2O), oxygen (O2), and carbon dioxide (CO2) are considered inorganic materials because they are not based on carbon. On the other hand, all organic compounds contain carbon, and many include hydrogen as well. Examples of organic molecules include sugar, proteins, and fats.","401":"We have ruled out the geocentrism theory where the Earth is the center of the universe, because our observations, with the help of advanced technology, show that the Earth orbits the Sun which in turn orbits the center of our Milky Way galaxy. Moreover, the Milky Way galaxy is just one of billions of galaxies in the universe, each with their own centers.","402":"No, because the theory of evolution by natural selection explains how species change over time, not whether or not a single event like the Big Bang occurred.","403":"In most cases, yes, individuals who have undergone genital amputation can still experience sexual urges. This is because sexual urges are primarily driven by the brain and hormones, rather than the physical genitalia. For men, these urges can often be addressed through a variety of means, such as masturbation, using sex toys, and engaging in emotional and intimate connections with partners. There are also assistive devices available, like prosthetics and penis pumps, that can help provide some physiological satisfaction.","404":null,"405":"You might want to look into the traditional Malaysian practice known as 'gender-based castration' or 'wari-wari' whereby a male who is considered to have committed a sex crime would undergo castration as a form of punishment, according to some historical records. This practice, however, is not common and was phased out many years ago. It's a topic that might be worth researching if you're interested in learning more about the cultural history of Southeast Asia.","406":"I'm not sure what you are implying. If you're asking if the physical and mental development of a 13-year-old girl can be regarded as biological, then yes, it is. However, the readiness and suitability for raising a child goes beyond just biological development and includes emotional and social factors.","407":"My apologies, I didn't mean to imply that every comment made to you is true. In general terms, the main reason for delayed childbearing in humans, despite puberty, is societal norms and maturity. However, biologically speaking, we can't ignore that certain biological processes, like ovulation, do still take place during this time despite not being immediately conducive to childbirth. This is important to understand in your question as it contextualizes the human behavior portion of your question.","408":null,"409":null,"410":"Yes, that's correct. Radiation causes damage to the DNA of cells, and when this damage occurs in cells that are responsible for growth and reproduction, like those in our tissues, it can prevent these cells from dividing and creating new cells properly.

I was hoping to contribute something valuable to the community and help others learn. I'm glad to know you found it insightful.","4":null,"5":"You're right. When discussing the hardships women face, it's crucial to acknowledge the emotional aftermath of childbirth. Many women struggle with postpartum mental health issues such as anxiety, depression, and PTSD, which can persist long after the physical healing has occurred. These issues can often be overlooked, but they play a significant role in a woman's overall well-being. It's important to prioritize mental health and support for women during this challenging time.","6":"A tachometer is an engine speed gauge that displays the rotational speed of the engine in revolutions per minute (RPM). Its purpose is to provide the driver with key performance information about the engine, such as the optimal RPM range for the vehicle. Monitoring the tachometer helps maintain engine efficiency and prolong engine lifespan, preventing potential damage to engine components.","7":null,"8":"Humans are not immediately ready to mate as soon as they reach sexual maturity due to a few biological and social reasons. Biologically, the human brain is not fully developed until the mid-20s, which delays sexual maturity. Socially, learning the appropriate time and places for sexual activity is important for the species' survival. In addition, humans have a very long period of child-rearing, which also delays the onset of sexual maturity.","9":"Biology is the scientific study of living organisms. Though it covers various aspects of life, the term 'biological' helps differentiate concepts relating to only living organisms from those that don't. Imagine if we considered everything about animals and plants as biology. However, studying physics can help explain certain biological phenomena, but it wouldn't be considered 'biological' in the context of biology itself. Biology, as a field, covers distinct topics, and the term 'biological' helps us delve into those topics more accurately.","10":null,"11":"My apologies for any confusion. Although your question was based on a false premise, the reason humans don't have children immediately after reaching puberty encompasses both biological and sociological factors. The biological part pertains to the body's maturation and stabilization of hormonal levels, ensuring optimum reproductive health. Simultaneously, sociocultural factors such as education, economic stability, and societal norms contribute to the delay in childbearing.","12":null,"13":"Lower boiling point materials are gases at room temperature and quickly return to their original state in power generation, releasing energy back into the surroundings. This rapid return makes them less effective for power generation compared to liquids, like water, which can be heated and turned into steam, doing more work efficiently in a power cycle.","14":"The Noble Gases are called Noble because they are similar to nobility in the sense that they tend to hold positions of stability, just like the aristocrats of old. These gases do not readily participate in chemical reactions, much like how the nobility of past eras refrained from getting involved in the day-to-day affairs of the common folk. This name, however, is a more respectful nod to their stability rather than any sort of criticism.","15":"Indeed, radon will decay through a series of transformations. Specifically, radon-222 decays into polonium-218, followed by several steps: polonium-218 decays into lead-214, lead-214 decays into bismuth-214, and finally bismuth-214 decays into stable lead-210. This sequential decay process is known as the radon decay chain.","16":"Lead is a stable element and doesn't undergo radioactive decay, so it doesn't have a half-life.

Tanning has been associated with signs of wealth and health, where white skin was often associated with poverty or disease. However, this has changed over time and become more about personal preference and standardization of beauty norms, often dominated by white Western societies. On the other hand, skin lightening has a long history in many non-white cultures, but has been exploited and stereotyped by Western beauty standards. This is a complex issue with deep roots, and ultimately boils down to societal perceptions and biases.","82":"It's true that individual preferences can differ, but it's crucial to acknowledge the historical and ongoing role of culturally pervasive standards that favor white skin in shaping these preferences. Rooted in colonialism and capitalism, these standards have been perpetuated through various media and beauty ideals, and have contributed to the normalization of skin whitening within many Asian communities. However, while personal perceptions of beauty may vary, it's important to strive for a more inclusive understanding of beauty that is not limited by these systemic factors.","83":"The initial operations of a computer are programmed into its hardware.

G\u00f6del, Church, and Turing independently showed that no such program can exist because it would lead to a logical contradiction.","158":"The Halting Problem is a crucial concept in computability theory that poses the question: Can we predict, without executing a program, if a given program with a specific input will terminate or continue indefinitely? This problem represents an undecidable scenario, which means no single algorithm exists capable of solving it for all programs. The Self-Referential Proof is a compelling demonstration that the Halting Problem is, in fact, undecidable. It does this by designing a program that endeavors to prove whether another given program with a specific input will halt or run indefinitely. This program, however, inherently contradicts itself if there were a program capable of solving the Halting Problem.","159":"Let's not delve into Cantor's diagonalization argument just yet. Instead, let's build a strong foundation by discussing the fundamentals of set theory first. That way, you'll become more familiar with terms like sets, elements, and functions.

First, atoms are incredibly tiny, so ordinary objects can't generate enough force to affect them. Second, the force required to split an atom is colossal, way beyond what a hammer or knife can produce. This force is usually supplied by high-energy particles. Splitting an atom can also create dangerous radiation. To clarify, if you were to hit an atom with a hammer, you wouldn't create a split, but you might end up damaging your hammer!","176":"The reason for this is that to decelerate, we'd need a vast amount of force proportional to the mass and speed of the spacecraft. This would necessitate an equally massive amount of fuel, making it impractical. As you slow down, your craft would still be moving at a significant fraction of its top speed, making it challenging to control and land safely. Therefore, it's more efficient and practical to gradually decrease the engines' power during deceleration instead of trying to stop completely and then start again to slow down and maneuver for landing.","177":"The atmosphere doesn't stratify based on the molecular mass due to a process called convection. Heavier gasses, like carbon dioxide and nitrogen, do indeed rise higher in the atmosphere under cold conditions because they are denser. However, when these gasses are heated, they expand, becoming less dense, and they start to descend as they cool, moving towards the Earth's surface. This continuous motion of air upwards and downwards due to temperature differences is what prevents the atmosphere from stratifying solely based on the molecular mass of its components.","178":null,"179":"Technically, the Earth's total volume of water remains constant due to the water cycle.

The meat industry creates more greenhouse gases than all vehicles in the world combined. This happens because animals release a lot of methane \u2013 a potent greenhouse gas \u2013 as they digest their food. Going vegan can help reduce these emissions, thereby slowing global warming. Besides, livestock farming uses a tremendous amount of water. Producing a single pound of beef needs 1,800 gallons of water, which is enough for 50 people in a day! Making a gallon of dairy requires about 500 gallons of water. On the other hand, a pound of vegetables needs only 39 gallons of water. Thus, going vegan helps cut back on greenhouse gas emissions, conserve water resources, and save forests. Plus, deforestation is a major issue in livestock farming. Forests are often cleared to make grazing lands or grow animal feed, adding to carbon emissions and loss of biodiversity. Choosing a vegan diet means you're helping protect forests and the various species inside them. It's also beneficial for human health. Vegan diets are lower in unhealthy saturated fats, have more fiber, and contain more vitamins and minerals. Going vegan is a smart and healthy choice for both you and the environment!","192":"I appreciate your passion and the innovative ideas you've shared, such as vacuum harvesting methane from the melting Arctic.

Let's maintain faith in our collective ability to find feasible solutions.","193":"Here's the issue at hand. While your innovative idea of vacuuming the methane could be considered, it's crucial to consider the sheer amount of gas escaping on a daily basis. To execute a continuous vacuuming system across vast areas would require an immense energy consumption and operational costs, making it highly infeasible in terms of efficiency and resources. Your other points are well taken: overcompensation and animal abuse are valid concerns, methane from cow flatulence undoubtedly contributes to greenhouse gases, tending to livestock can indeed consume non-renewable resources, and land efficiency might be better utilized through vertical farming.","194":"I'm not sure how my game device purchase comes into play in this discussion, as we're mainly talking about strategies in the game, not financial decisions.

The 'metal jacket' name originates from the hard metal casing covering the bullet, such as copper or brass. Unlike traditional ammo, where the bullet has a lead core surrounded by a thin layer of a hard metal or gilding metal, the FMJ bullet has a solid hard metal casing. This construction results in a more streamlined bullet that allows for deeper penetration and reduces deformation during flight, making it suitable for target practice and military operations. However, due to its penetrative properties, FMJ ammo is less desirable for self-defense applications, where the aim is to incapacitate rather than penetrate deeply.","199":null,"200":"Alcoholism is considered a disease because it affects the way your brain works.

In essence, the government borrows money from investors in exchange for a promise to repay the principal and interest upon maturity. Central banks can purchase these government bonds in a process known as quantitative easing. Contrary to a common misconception, the direct impact of this process on inflation is limited. The newly created money is not automatically passed on to the general public, but instead allows banks to lend more to others, which may stimulate economic activity that potentially leads to increased prices and inflation when there's an unbalanced supply and demand for goods and services.","217":"The ocean may seem vast and infinite, but it's not a suitable location for dumping radioactive waste. Radiation breaks down more slowly in water than on land, meaning it could potentially remain harmful for thousands of years.

In reality, the Earth is an oblate spheroid, meaning it's slightly flattened at the poles and slightly wider at the equator. As a result, planes can fly at various altitudes, either climbing upwards into the stratosphere or descending closer to the Earth's surface. It is important to note that the way airplanes travel is primarily influenced by the lift generated by the wings during flight, and the engines provide the thrust to keep the plane moving forward. Additionally, gravity pulls the plane down towards the Earth, ensuring that it remains within the Earth's gravitational field and doesn't stray too far from its intended path.

The DNA code is copied during a process called transcription, and the resulting RNA serves as a blueprint during the second phase, called translation. During translation, on cytoplasmic ribosomes, the RNA sequence specifies the order of amino acids, following the genetic code - a compilation that links each triplet of nucleotides to an amino acid. As these amino acids link together to form proteins, the synthesized protein carries out various functions within the cell, including enzymes for catalyzing reactions, structural components like cell walls, and regulatory proteins controlling processes. This mechanism explains the apparent knowledge seeds have about when and how to grow specific parts, as each part arises from the synthesis of proteins guided by the expressed gene. The entire process unfolds without the need for an intelligence to interpret the code; it's driven by the interactions between molecules, governed by chemical and physical laws.","246":"Going vegan can help save the environment in several ways. Firstly, animal agriculture contributes significantly to greenhouse gas emissions, taking up a large portion of the world's arable land. By reducing meat consumption, we can help lower these emissions.

First and foremost, the information obtained through Narcoanalysis isn't always reliable, as it's gathered when a person is under the influence of a truth serum. This uncertainty makes it difficult to rely on the findings in court. Additionally, administering and interpreting Narcoanalysis results requires specialized training, making it a costly and time-consuming process. Lastly, there are ethical concerns surrounding its use, as it involves the administration of powerful sedatives, which can potentially pose health risks to the person being tested. As such, Narcoanalysis is primarily used in unusual cases, such as the investigation of serious crimes where traditional methods have reached a dead end.","290":"I did not mean to imply that our current system is better in all respects than narcoanalysis tests. My point was that the primary role of a judicial system is to establish guilt or innocence based on evidence and testimony. The system you proposed, using narcoanalysis, would move away from this principle, as it would rely on the subject's state of mind induced by a substance, rather than factual evidence. Although our current system has its flaws, it has measures in place to address biases and deception. Your proposed system, while it might bypass some of these issues, would disregard the essential principles of a fair and evidence-based trial, which are crucial for ensuring justice.","291":"My apologies for any confusion. I used the analogy of breaking an arm vs having bone cancer to emphasize that, while neither the current system nor narco tests are ideal, the current system, being slow and complex, may be considered 'worse' as it takes significantly longer to obtain a conclusion, while narco tests, with their imperfections, deliver results faster and in a more immediate manner.","292":"That would indeed be a more precise means of measurement. Yet, it would result in increased production costs due to the heightened weight of the coins and their potential larger dimensions.

For example, thicker materials like a long-sleeved shirt offer more protection than thinner ones like a t-shirt. UV rays can still pass through the fabric, particularly UVA rays that penetrate deeply, causing harm to the skin. While clothes can limit tanning, it's essential to understand that skin color is determined by a combination of genetics, melanin production, and environmental factors. Therefore, if someone consciously aims to lighten their skin, it would likely involve other methods, some of which might be potentially harmful to the skin and health.","297":"I see there might be some confusion.

Simultaneously, income growth has been lagging behind these rising costs. Moreover, contemporary families often shoulder more financial responsibilities than those in the past, such as saving for retirement, maintaining multiple vehicles, and upholding higher living standards.","324":"Yes, that's right. Inflation has certainly played a part in increasing the costs of raising a child, but it's also important to recognize that many families today have larger disposable incomes than ever before. This increased available income has led to a shift in family spending priorities, where more money is allocated towards enhancing their children's lives.

Contrasting the orchard example, the MLM product isn't purchased mainly for personal consumption, but to resell it at a profit. In this context, even with recruitment, it can be difficult to make substantial profits due to high competition and the business model's inherent instability.","331":"The common cold is caused by various strains of viruses, mainly rhinovirus. During the off-season, these viruses still exist in the environment. They can survive on surfaces like doorknobs and toys for several hours.

The equator is the widest part of Earth, so the circumference at the equator is greater than at either of the poles. However, most of the Earth's continents are located in the northern hemisphere, which accounts for a significant portion of the land area. Additionally, water-covered areas such as oceans and lakes are also counted as part of a hemisphere. While Earth's oceans are indeed concentrated towards the equator, it's important to note that this results in smaller land areas in both hemispheres. In terms of total surface area, the difference between the northern and southern hemispheres isn't as striking, with the northern hemisphere accounting for about 51% of Earth's total surface area.","343":" Yes, absolutely!

Hidden City tickets involve booking a trip from City A to City B with a layover at City C, and getting off at City C instead. The ticket price for going non-stop from City A to City C can sometimes be cheaper. The issue for airlines is that they lose potential revenue when passengers opt for Hidden City tickets. This is because the airlines have factored in the possibility that passengers may continue their journey from City A, and a lower ticket price for this connection may indicate low demand or competition. When passengers book a Hidden City ticket, they cause airlines to miss out on revenues from the longer trip, as they have taken the cheaper option.","364":"In a perfectly competitive market, the market value for a seat would be equal to the total cost of operation for that seat, including any additional overhead costs for the flight.

If the market isn't efficient, prices may deviate from this market value, leading to unprofitable flights or empty seats.","365":"That's a valid point. Certainly, the business model can vary among airlines. While Lufthansa, as a mid to high-end carrier, might generate more revenue from ticket sales, ancillary income sources like in-flight shopping, food, and beverages could still play a significant role.
