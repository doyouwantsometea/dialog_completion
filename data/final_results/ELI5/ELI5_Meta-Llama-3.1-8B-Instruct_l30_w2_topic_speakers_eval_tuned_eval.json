By providing everyone with a basic income you can get people who are living on the streets the money they need to buy a house and join the market. These new people in the economy represent a group that can move into much of the empty property around the country of only they had some money to do so.","16":"You actually want the high boiling point.  We want the fluid to have certain properties when it comes out of the boiler (we don't actually want steam) and when we have a high boiling point, we can put in more energy.  Also, water can store a lot of energy before it actually changes temperature, way more than acetone.    The turbine speed is related to how much fluid you pump through it, not the temperature although the fluid type can effect that.  The thing that varies with the temperature is the torque, how hard the turbine can try to turn stuff.","17":"To start with, I made a mistake in my previous comment.  The turbine speed and torque is going to be based on super complicated fluid mechanics stuff that I don't know to well.    No, it won't have the same energy output.  Lets say that substance 1 has a boiling point of 50 degrees Celsius and substance 2 has a boiling point of 100 degrees Celsius.  Lets also say that they require the same amount of energy to heat up 1 degree Celsius (1 kj).  Substance 1 absorbs 50 kj of energy but substance 2 absorbs 100 kj.  This means that substance 2 can have more energy extracted by the turbine.    The pressure doesn't actually have much to do with it, it's actually held constant during the boiling process and a pump is used to get the liquid to the right pressure.","18":"You know, I almost included this in the last post but I decided not to include it to keep it simple.  The turbine is designed to bring the gas to supersonic speeds.  If we look at the conservation of energy, the gas needs to cool down to actually do this.  So a gas that's hotter can go faster in the turbine and faster velocities allow for more power to be generated.","19":"Look up \u201cisotopes of helium\u201d, \u201cisotopes of neon\u201d etc. on Wikipedia and there will be a section labelled \u201clist of isotopes\u201d which shows you a lot of information including what isotopes they decay into if they\u2019re radioactive.   No, noble gasses are not turning into a 19th column. what makes you think that?   Yes, hydrogen-1 will _never_ undergo radioactive decay. Stars are different, they are fusing elements together, it\u2019s a completely different process to radioactive decay.","20":"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/3\/37\/Decay_Chain_of_Uranium-238.svg  https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/9\/93\/Decay_Chain_of_Actinium.svg  These are the decay chains of uranium-238 and uranium-235, as you can see both of them decay into an isotope of radon before decaying further. So no radon is not at the end. Many radioactive isotopes undergo these sequences where they keep decaying into other isotopes until they get to a stable one.","21":"&gt;Oh cool, so does that mean that, like radon, all of the noble elements will eventually turn into lead?  What makes your ask this question? Helium will never \u201cdecay\u201d into lead, nor will neon etc.   When stars explode a large amount of heavier elements are formed, but again this isn\u2019t the same process.    &gt;Could lead ever decay into something else? Is there a half-life of lead?  I\u2019ve already told you that every single element has radioactive isotopes, see: https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Isotopes_of_lead - note just how many radioactive isotopes lead has, many are decay products from other elements, lead is the heaviest element that still has stable isotopes.   Isotopes are atoms with the same number of protons but different numbers of neutrons. Only specific configurations of protons and neutrons are stable, everything else is unstable and undergoes radioactive decay.   &gt;If lead does decay into something else, it would probably take us billions of years to find out, right?  See the link above    I think checking out some educational YouTube videos would help you. Try this one: https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=fES21E0qebw","22":"There already is a 7th row, and within our lifetimes there likely will be some elements added to the 8th row.   There will never be a 19th group unless IUPAC decides to change the layout of the periodic table (which it won\u2019t do). Just a note on this, the periodic table actually looks like this: https:\/\/encrypted-tbn3.gstatic.com\/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcRJaY9NjvEqGbvN3HSDyyO3GKilL7zoRWTdyTCf-3xYkqXqSvTt0V_onoGqvw (google Wide Periodic Table if that doesn\u2019t work), so technically it has 32 columns but those between groups 2 and 3 aren\u2019t given group numbers.","23":"Probably not.  The last few elements discovered on the 7th row already decay within fractions of seconds, and there\u2019s 50 elements to fill up the 8th row yet to be discovered before the 9th row.","24":"Why do you think I have any actual firsthand experience in this field? I read journals and understand the science.   It took about 70 years for the rest of the elements in the 7th row to be created, that was elements 95-118). The last few discovered decay within fractions of seconds. The faster something decays the harder it is to create and then detect.   We will likely see element 120 within 5 years, but getting to element 169 (which would be the first element on the 9th row) is going to to take a lot longer and will need improvements in technology if it can even be created at all.

That said - you want to learn whether we're in a position to eradicate the flu - go talk to a (competent) virologist and stop dicking around on reddit.  And 47 reported cases may mean hundreds or thousands or tens of thousands of unreported (but still potentially contagious) cases.  47 may not mean what you think it means.  Most people who get the flu just deal with it, and many have mild symptoms not worth reporting.","32":"I DON'T KNOW.  Talk to a competent virologist.  Although the flu comes back as a different variation (or a few different variations) year after year, and jumps often between humans and animals, so your plan may not work at all.","33":"But that's simply an inference from things we \\*do\\* perceive. You have no way of knowing that those stars you mentioned exist, you simply trust many different things, from the scientists who say they found the data to the possibility that the universe is built on a firm set of rules that can be extrapolated from.  &amp;#x200B;  The point is, you may be able to \\*infer\\* that something exists, but all you really know is what you perceive, everything else is guesswork. Hence the question of \"if a tree falls in the woods and no one is around to hear it, does it make a sound\" is only a \"flawed principle\" if you treat the theories science has discovered as some hard and fast absolute, which they are not. What if the universe actually worked such that collisions only cause vibrations if someone is around to observe them? How would any scientific principle ever discover that, given that science is based on observation?","34":"To be clear, I am not advocating for a distrust of science. This is philosophy, which is focused on very different things.  &amp;#x200B;  A key point is to imagine that we \\*do\\* live in that universe, where unless something is observed by a human it doesn't happen. How would that affect us?     Not one bit.  &amp;#x200B;  If the universe only operates differently if it has no way of being observed, then by definition it can't affect us. Science is still as useful as it always was. The point of philosophy is to consider the \"what ifs\", and see whether that has any bearing on how we \\*should\\* behave.","35":"And why do you think that has an effect on me?

I know I had some sex education in school but it wasn't very good. It's a common problem in schools because people are scared to talk about it. Some of the fear is that it will encourage kids to start having sex early but I think it's important for everyone to know how the body works. Everyone has one, so why hide it?  Kids need to know what is normal and what is not normal, so if there is a problem, they can talk to a doctor. Puberty is scary with everything changing and a lot of people feel shame about it when they shouldn't.

Some symptoms of depression, for example, can manifest as increased sleep, decreased levels of energy and lack of focus.","39":"It's good that you're aware of it, but keep in mind that proper diagnosis can only come for a licensed professional. If this has been happening, it might be a good idea to get a professional opinion.

Every major business does this. Most new hires will be bombarding with training videos and employee handbooks saying unions are bad.  They can have anti-union literature and posters in break rooms. They can fire people who express pro-union sentiments and claim it was for another reason. They can threaten to do all kinds of thing. ","48":"I'm not sure what you mean. All the things I said above are legal. If workers follow the proper laws and procedures and vote to unionize, a company can't just say \"no\" and send the cops to slaughter everyone like they used to.

There are several hypothesis and models about how this will look like, these are: Novopangea, Pangea Proxima\/Ultima, Aurica and Amasia.  The thing is that in most of them, the mayority of the land mass will be found in the northern hemisphere (for example, in the Amasia hypothesis, all the land mass is on the northern hemisphere except for the Antarctica). So you should be asking this in 250 million years in the future.  Note: I may be wrong, I just happened to see this on a video.","53":"The earth have existed for eons, and during that time the continents shape has changed multiple times.  So yeah, Pangea is just one of them, just that we know much more of it because of all the evidence left from the age of dinosaurs, that happens to be a lot.","54":"It's understandable to think that since we probably never live to see any major change of the continents locations. Remember that this process that it's currently happening, takes hundreds millions of years to complete, so we can only suppose how it will end up.","55":"Try this.

If you're consistently skipping the same gear that'll sacrifice a bit of longevity, though whether you'll keep the car long enough to need it is another question.

Why you doing this","61":"If you post a thread in a question forum, and the majority of people give you the exact same answer, you don\u2019t believe them?   Yes, okay, discussion of biology was a necessary part of answering the question. It\u2019s a question that referenced puberty in mammals - it self-evidently was going to refer to biological topics. However, your question was asking for the biological reason that humans aren\u2019t ready for kids whilst animals are. The premise is false, and the reason the premise is false is due to social and not biological factors. As I\u2019ve said over and over and over.

Not saying I agree that sex work should be stigmatized but it's definitely different from encouraging a crowd to do a chant at a sporting event.","64":"Puritanical religious bullshit? I dunno. Because religious people like to think no one should ever enjoy sex, so someone who's whole job is doing sexy fun stuff is inherently an evil tempting influence.  Which in turn forces most sex-work underground, where it gets mixed up with other illegal activities, further making it seem like something only \"losers\" do.  God forbid two consenting adults have fun.","65":"I touched on that already. The computer processes a bunch of numbers, and then sends values to your screen in the format [R,G,B] where R, G, and B are 3 numbers that range from 0 to 255 or from 00000000 to 11111111 in binary. The Monitor turns on each pixel to the corresponding value (take a magnifying glass and look at your monitor, there really are tiny red, green, and blue lights making up the screen!) and that is interpreted by your brain as an image.","66":"Why would that limit the resolution? You just send a set of 3 numbers for each pixel. For 1080p, thats 1920 x 1080 pixels x 3 numbers x 60 frames per second=373,248,000 numbers per second, or in more familiar units 3.73 MegaBytes per Second. That's what a MegaByte *is* 1 million 8bit numbers. Considering most PCs today have GigaBytes of memory and Terabytes of storage--1000 and 1million times larger respectively--video display isn't that taxing.  The monitor ultimately just turns lights on and off. The final number goes to each red\/green\/blue subpixel and controls a power supply, regulating how much voltage it puts out, which ultimately controls how much light is allowed through or blocked.","67":"&gt;How does it send to each?  Lots and lots of wires.  &gt;How does it do shades?  As I said, each number ranges from 0 to 255, where 0 is \"black\" and 255 is \"as bright as it can\".  &gt;How many transistors are we talking about here?  Tens of billions. At this point, transistors in modern chips have features 5 nanometers across, that's only about 45 silicon atoms across. They really pack them in.","68":"Digital devices are designed to produce 1 of only 2 states ON and OFF. These are meant to be completely distinct, with no in between.  Analog devices still use transistors, but they allow for many shades of grey between 0 current an maximum current.   Transistors work like switches, with current flowing from the Source to the Drain, controlled by the Gate. This lets a tiny voltage at the Gate control a much larger current, like how a tiny valve can completely shut off a pipe.   Digital devices are designed to only have their gate ON or OFF. Analog devices can take a range of voltages through the gate that gradually turns on the current flowing through the device. This lets a tiny signal be amplified into a much bigger one, wiggling the \"valve\" creates a much stronger wiggle in the current through the \"pipe\", and this can turn the tiny electromagnetic field of a radio wave into something you can hear, with a little external power supplied by something else to drive the main current.","69":"Its not *impossible* its just not what its meant to do. Digital isn't \"better\" than analog, they just do completely different things. You use analog to handle real-world signals that can take a range of values, you use digital to do math and process information. Ultimately, you translate back and forth as needed, like in the case of a monitor taking a digital signal to produce an analog image.","70":"When I redirect I do my best to point OP to a sub that fits better. I think that's important for this sub as much as any other. Most are glad for the help.","71":"That's right.  Remember there isn't really a real 'black'.  That is just a word we made up for what our brain does.  Pretend humans never developed eyes and we never evolved to have the sense of sight.  We have no idea of color or what things look like or anything.  Light particles are still bouncing around and being reflected off everything, everywhere, but in the case of the vantablack, when light hits that area, it just reflects less light than other surfaces. (less information is being reflected)  Another way to look at it is take a digital camera and point it at the car.  Well there is a sensitive chip in there that is like an eye.  The light hits the chip, and activate certain parts of that chip which the computer makes into an image on the screen.  The vantablack areas did not activate that part of the chip.  So the computer reads the image file and says... No data here!  and then when you look at it on the screen the computer doesn't light up that pixel and you perceive black there.","72":"exactly.  If you look a picture of the stealth bomber (B2) its the same.  Looks like a void space in the sky.  Now with the car, I'm not sure how legal that is.  Probably varies from country to country.

Probably not that safe.","73":"Not through any economically feasible process nor any process that they were attempting. you can do anything to anything with enough energy.

It basically gives your body the \"I have seen that one before\" power over sickness.  However you need to be kind of healthy to get vaccinated. There are certain conditions under which you cannot receive vaccines (you are very young, your immune system is gone due to birth defects or cancer treatment,. ..).  These people rely on an effect called \"herd immunity\".  Basically you die if you get infected but you never get infected because everyone around you is vaccinated. This prevents a disease from spreading.  Unfortunately to achieve herd immunity roughly 98% of the population have to be vaccinated.  So for me personally as a vaccinated, healthy adult it makes no difference if you are vaccinated or not. For my little daughter or my cancer stricken relative it is a life or death situation (unfortunately quite literally).  Therefore if you are healthy and able to get a shot, go get a shot. It will safe someone's life.  (Kind of the same principle as you clear a lane for an ambulance. Yes it is inconvenient for you for 30 seconds but you help safe a live and you would expect others to do it for you).","76":"Depends on where you come from.

If a sound wave falls outside of that range, you are not going to be able to hear it.  However, that doesn't mean that you aren't able to perceive it in other ways.  We can \"feel\" sound waves outside of our normal range of hearing - both above and below the 20\/20,000 thresholds.  The 18.9 Hz wave is no different - you can't hear it, but you can feel it is there.  In many people, this feeling manifests itself as fear or paranoia.  You can \"feel\" something in the room, but none of your other senses register anything consciously.  This incongruence greats discomfort,t which manifests as fear.  It is called the \"Ghost Frequency\" because it is theorized that many \"haunted\" areas simply produce tones close to 18.9 Hz (through resonance or other natural quirks) and people associate the fear response with a \"presence\" in the area.","78":"It is actually pretty tough to generate things that low - most speakers can't do it (since there is no point in making a sound no one can hear).  That said, yes, you could make a house \"feel\" haunted by pumping in 18.9 Hz tones - people would feel the room was \"off\".  As for physical reactions, nothing due to the sound itself but there are all sorts of physiological reactions to fear.","79":"You have like 5 people telling you the same thing and all you do is argue.

The uterus is kind of pear-shaped, about the size of a fist (depending on the person), and the small part connects to the cervix.","85":"Alright, so H(a,b) is when you describe what H does.

Some of those operations expect additional numbers to be input as part of the instruction (usually, addresses of memory that contain the data). This is all just based on the complex physical arrangement of the transistors and other components within the CPU.  We have a lookup table of what numbers represent what instructions. It's called an **instruction set**. A popular one is x86, which you can read about [here](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/X86_instruction_listings#Original_8086\/8088_instructions).","91":"The CPU is designed that way based on the arrangement of transistors and other components. Feed it a \"6\" and it will add the next two numbers. Feed it an \"8\" and it will store a number into memory. How exactly the transistors are arranged to do so is not even remotely ELI5, and the people who know it are paid millions for their expertise. If you want to see what it looks like inside a CPU you can watch [this video](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=Fxv3JoS1uY8).  The best I can do for ELI5: using transistors you can build logic gates. Using logic gates you can build logical functions. Transistors can also control which logic gates get activated based on a given input. You change which transistors are activated by sending signals to certain CPU pins in a certain order. The CPU is designed such that it would automatically read instructions from certain pins when powered on (which is where the BIOs\/boot process comes in). [Transistors to gates](https:\/\/www.cs.bu.edu\/~best\/courses\/modules\/Transistors2Gates\/).  If you have the basic building blocks to form transistors and\/or logic gates, you can build a fully functional computer, which is how people have simulated computers inside other software such as Minecraft or Factorio.","92":"A function. If the function is y=x\\*2, then inputting 4 will result in 8.  Programs are kinds of functions that (usually) take input, process it, and provide some kind of output.

They aren't always literally numbers that need to be displayed as text on a monitor.","93":"That process has already been explained to you in [another comment](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/explainlikeimfive\/comments\/gilmgj\/eli5_how_does_a_computer_learn_those_first_few\/fqgpkp3\/).  You seem to be under the assumption that every result calculated by the CPU is literally turned into pixels. That's clearly not the case, computers calculate all sorts of things for different purposes. The software needs to determine what to do with the result. In the case that the result needs to be displayed on screen, the software will tell the monitor how to do so (via the graphics processor).","94":"They get that info from your credit report\/history, which again, should be obtainable only with private info like your social, full name and signature or electronic equivalent.

Most of the time, where is an overlap between these two where you can see the Moon during the day (ignoring it's hard ...).  The eclipse is a \"special\" time where the two hemispheres touch at their edges.  As the Sun and Moon move apart, the overlapping section of the Earth in both becomes thinner and longer.  At the eclipse, it's at its thinnest, only minutes long, but it goes all the way around.

Which brings us to an interesting conclusion, if everything can be predicted based on information in the now, can we really have conscious thought? is any decision based on free will? No.  We are the sum of our experiences and genes, nothing more nothing less. We are in a chaotic system where every tiny tiny decision or action from all of the 7billion ish humans on this planet affects every other human on the planet(butterfly effect is very real) This soup of cause and effect creates something that we interpret as free will.  we are a bunch of electrons going back and forth.","121":"We know what the butterfly effect is...

Some of those operations expect additional numbers to be input as part of the instruction (usually, addresses of memory that contain the data). This is all just based on the complex physical arrangement of the transistors and other components within the CPU.  We have a lookup table of what numbers represent what instructions. It's called an **instruction set**. A popular one is x86, which you can read about [here](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/X86_instruction_listings#Original_8086\/8088_instructions).","123":"The CPU is designed that way based on the arrangement of transistors and other components. Feed it a \"6\" and it will add the next two numbers. Feed it an \"8\" and it will store a number into memory.

If you want to see what it looks like inside a CPU you can watch [this video](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=Fxv3JoS1uY8).  The best I can do for ELI5: using transistors you can build logic gates. Using logic gates you can build logical functions. Transistors can also control which logic gates get activated based on a given input. You change which transistors are activated by sending signals to certain CPU pins in a certain order. The CPU is designed such that it would automatically read instructions from certain pins when powered on (which is where the BIOs\/boot process comes in). [Transistors to gates](https:\/\/www.cs.bu.edu\/~best\/courses\/modules\/Transistors2Gates\/).  If you have the basic building blocks to form transistors and\/or logic gates, you can build a fully functional computer, which is how people have simulated computers inside other software such as Minecraft or Factorio.","124":"A function. If the function is y=x\\*2, then inputting 4 will result in 8.  Programs are kinds of functions that (usually) take input, process it, and provide some kind of output.

They aren't always literally numbers that need to be displayed as text on a monitor.","125":"That process has already been explained to you in [another comment](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/explainlikeimfive\/comments\/gilmgj\/eli5_how_does_a_computer_learn_those_first_few\/fqgpkp3\/).  You seem to be under the assumption that every result calculated by the CPU is literally turned into pixels. That's clearly not the case, computers calculate all sorts of things for different purposes. The software needs to determine what to do with the result. In the case that the result needs to be displayed on screen, the software will tell the monitor how to do so (via the graphics processor).","126":"I assume they get a single bacteriophage from dirt or something and cultivate it with petri dishes.

I mean all the comments are saying you can't. Yes you absolutely can. As many pointed out the Strong Nuclear Force &gt; Electromagnetism &gt; Weak Nuclear Force &gt;  Gravity in terms of strength.  &gt;Sounds like we are right back to the start of this lesson again. Let's put some real numbers on this. The \"weak\" nuclear force is 10 to the 25th power stronger than Gravity. That's 100,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 times stronger! Electromagnetism - the force we know best - is 10 to the 36th power stronger than Gravity. That's 10,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 times stronger! The \"strong\" nuclear force is 10 to the 38th power stronger than Gravity. That's 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 times stronger!   You can split any atom with a knife. If you have enough kinetic force.   The forces involved here would be about...  Probably from 1\/10th the speed of light to some where up to 90% of it.  If you're really curious here is a old comic.  https:\/\/what-if.xkcd.com\/1\/  Basically you won't be spiting atoms with any normal actions you do in your daily life.  But if your knife flew probably 1\/10th the speed of light into anything you'd be doing nuclear fusion and there by fission.","193":"Yes the problem with building spacecraft that could theoretically go that fast is that a tiny spec and I mean a few grams of dirt hitting the spacecraft would be like you detonated a tactical nuke on it.   These type of spacecraft are called \"relativistic spacecraft\"  https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Relativistic_rocket  And if you could build these you'd basically make the ultimate death machine.  https:\/\/vocal.media\/futurism\/relativistic-kill-vehicle  These things are literally impossible to stop, you can destroy them but that does literally nothing as it's the kinetic energy that does the fusion explosions on the ground.   The only way to stop these would literally be a huge shield around the planet made out of matter. So an outerwall so to speak.","194":"Most sci fi if you notice avoids it.  Star Trek uses Defector Shields. As in some sort of shield of particles that basically vaporize the incoming dust, they also travel around by warping space so they ship isn't moving at all the space around it is. It's a difficult concept to grasp if you don't understand space-time basics. It's like they're creating a hole infront of themselves and falling into it while making a hill behind them   https:\/\/i.pinimg.com\/originals\/11\/57\/8b\/11578b9e7cb8e0f4bf02c96796dc6521.jpg  Star Wars just gives no fuck.   Star Gate uses \"hyper space\" so you go into another \"dimension\" to and then come back.  https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Interstellar_travel_in_fiction  It all depends on the show but most good shows make it realistic enough and have science advisors telling them obvious flaws.   Like in the video game Mass Effect they discovered a way to remove \"mass\" from objects and even go negative so it's possible to go faster than light, and their ships travels like normal ones would accelerating half of the trip then turning around and accelerating backwards to arrive at the destination at normal speeds. They also use shields to protect from stuff.","195":"It does. It's particularly notable when the gases are those other than the standard air mix of nitrogen, oxygen, CO2, and argon. Plus water vapor.  For example, if you open a manhole, the hydrogen sulfide will be near the bottom, because it's heavier than air. If the space has carbon monoxide in it, it could be near the top, as it's slightly lighter than air. CO2 is heavier than air, which is why you can use it to create a a ground fog. Methane is lighter than air, but flammable vapors of organic solvents tend to be heavier.   This is super important because you have to know where to look for these things before sending workers into confined spaces. Stratification of gases is a key understanding.","196":"No. There is another post in this thread that explains atmospheric gases in normal concentrations better than I can.  But global CO2 concentration is 400 ppm. CO2 isn't threatening your life until about 40,000ppm. So even if that were the case, you would never know.","197":"Your brain stores knowledge more as abstract concepts. The word links to that concept, and the image links to that concept. See a cat and your brain identifies it as a cat then gives you the thought \"that's a cat\". See the word cat and your brain identifies the meaning of a cat and then gives you the image of a cat in your imagination. These concepts are stored without the use of either word or image, but are linked to the separate storages of the words and images, so those systems usually fire together. This is also how you can know what you want to say but not quite recall the word for it - your brain has accessed the abstract concept, but has misplaced the link between it and the word for it.","198":"Its not *impossible* its just not what its meant to do. Digital isn't \"better\" than analog, they just do completely different things. You use analog to handle real-world signals that can take a range of values, you use digital to do math and process information. Ultimately, you translate back and forth as needed, like in the case of a monitor taking a digital signal to produce an analog image.","199":"&gt;Analog devices still use transistors, but they allow for many shades of grey between 0 current an maximum current. Transistors work like switches, with current flowing from the Source to the Drain, controlled by the Gate. This lets a tiny voltage at the Gate control a much larger current, like how a tiny valve can completely shut off a pipe. Analog devices can take a range of voltages through the gate that gradually turns on the current flowing through the device.   Remember, 1 and 0 are just what we call ON and OFF. Its all a matter of how much current is flowing. We get to choose how to interpret that.","200":"You have like 5 people telling you the same thing and all you do is argue.

Plastic film blocks  infrared radiation, particularly the long wave infrared associated with heat while letting visible light through.","205":"&gt; So does this mean leaving the plastic up in summer would block out heat?  It will trap the heat inside your house just like it does in the winter.  This is how greenhouses work.","206":"I mean, yes, technically, it will block low  wavelength IR from coming in, just like it blocks it from going out.  However, it still lets in the higher wavelength stuff, which your furnishings absorb and re-emit as low frequency IR.","207":"Yes, the Roman Empire is largely responsible for spreading Christianity. Emperor Constantine the Great made Christianity the official religion of the Empire in the fourth century A.D. And remember, \"Christianity\" here means Catholicism. Catholicism is the dominant denomination of Christianity. Protestantism is dominant in the United Kingdom and the former British colonies, such as the United States.","208":"The teachings of Christ were popular. There's no denying that. Like anything else, Christianity first spread by word of mouth. One community adopts, and then another, and so on. I think it's also worth noting that these early Christians were probably much more in line with Christ's teaching and did what they could to help those who had been hurt by the Roman Empire. And of course Christ was a martyr. People love a good marty. But really, there are a lot of reasons that contributed to the spread of Christianity, but the religion certainly wouldn't be where it is today had it not been adopted by the greatest power earth had ever known.","209":"Yeah well maybe you should figure out how to filter my saltyness while you're at it.

The \"standard\" round for the M16 rifle (and other weapons that use 5.56 ammunition) is something called M855, which is *like* full metal jacket ammo, but it's tipped with a little bit of steel that's colored green (which is why you sometimes hear it called 'green-tip') to enhance its ability to punch through obstacles.  The relatively high ratio of muzzle velocity to bullet weight leads the other popular round, the M193, to fragment near explosively when it hits something.","218":"Oh, absolutely.

Kevlar is basically rated to stop handgun rounds only; armor that stops rifle rounds will generally include hard ceramic or steel plates.

Even though there are quite a few disease states of choice.","221":"As I tried to say 'noble' does only mean non-reactive not necessarily stable. Radon is a noble gas but it's radioactive with a half life of 3.8 days decaying into Polonium.   Most elements lighter than lead (have isotopes that) are stable and won't change while pretty much all element heavier than lead will decay over time into lead. Over astronomical time scales stars will continue to change the ratio of hydrogen and helium to heavier elements but the majority of  will stay lighter than Neon.","222":"First, elements decaying always become lighter. Second, lead is stable and does not decay. The only way elements become more massive is through nuclear reactions in stars.    The general trend is that very light elements become heavier and very heavy elements become lighter until they reach Lead\/Thallium. Exotic isotopes that don't fit the general pattern are extremely short-lived, so they basically don't exist.  Also, 2 billion years is not very long, the most stable isotope of Bismuth for example has a half-life of 19 billion billion years to decay into Thallium, and over the 14 billion years the universe has existed stars have only managed to transmute about 2% of mass into anything else than hydrogen and helium.","223":"Theoretically, there can be more massive elements but the most massive ones we've artificially created already are so unstable they decay within nano- to microseconds - in practical terms these elements don't matter because they barely exist.","224":"Not necessarily; it's not a one-to-one shift, and generally the companies (correctly) think they can do a better job insuring their employees than the Feds can.  So in order to have the government provide the same level of healthcare, it likely will end up costing the government *more* because of how inefficient the government is at these kinds of things, in major part because the government isn't interested in a profit motive, and as a result isn't as interested in cost-savings measures.","225":"&gt;What is the evidence that government inefficiency would make the costs increase.  Government procurement is historically prone to cost overruns, bloat, and inefficiency. You can look at military spending for an example of this.  &gt;It would seem that taking out all of the private insurance middlemen would result in much lower costs.  But in the process, you get rid of the negotiators involved in drug\/treatment cost negotiations, and instead the government will just pay whatever the cost is without thinking about it, again because the government doesn't have significant means to fight for cost savings.  We already have a very similar problem with respect to student loans; the increased cost of college education in the US is largely due to the US government being so willing to pump money into higher education through student loans without any form of price controls or cost incentives.","226":"It\u2019s not bad... per se. They don\u2019t put money back into the economy, or rarely do. Think of it in terms of neighborhoods. You have poor, upscale, and rich. When the housing society of the rich neighborhood gets money from the people in it, do you honestly think some of that money makes it down to the upscale neighborhood? Same goes for the upscale to the poor. When you\u2019re rich, everything because a \u201cprivate\u201d. Private planes, cars, healthcare, etc. Services that cater to the rich are only offered to them. Oh... an easier example would be plane sections. Does any food or drink from 1st class make it to coach? Sure... they bought a ticket in the air plain but did it really help the plane go anywhere? What happened if someone from coach tries to sit in 1st? There you go.","227":"Without trying to sound crass you seem to have got the wrong picture of elements here. Hydrogen does not decay into helium, hydrogen-3 (tritium) does decay into helium-3, but hydrogen-1 and hysrogen-2 do not undergo radioactive decay at all, they are stable isotopes of hydrogen.   ALL elements have radioactive isotopes, that includes noble gasses. They will all decay into other elements eventually.","228":"Look up \u201cisotopes of helium\u201d, \u201cisotopes of neon\u201d etc. on Wikipedia and there will be a section labelled \u201clist of isotopes\u201d which shows you a lot of information including what isotopes they decay into if they\u2019re radioactive.   No, noble gasses are not turning into a 19th column. what makes you think that?   Yes, hydrogen-1 will _never_ undergo radioactive decay. Stars are different, they are fusing elements together, it\u2019s a completely different process to radioactive decay.","229":"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/3\/37\/Decay_Chain_of_Uranium-238.svg  https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/9\/93\/Decay_Chain_of_Actinium.svg  These are the decay chains of uranium-238 and uranium-235, as you can see both of them decay into an isotope of radon before decaying further. So no radon is not at the end. Many radioactive isotopes undergo these sequences where they keep decaying into other isotopes until they get to a stable one.","230":"&gt;Oh cool, so does that mean that, like radon, all of the noble elements will eventually turn into lead?  What makes your ask this question? Helium will never \u201cdecay\u201d into lead, nor will neon etc.   When stars explode a large amount of heavier elements are formed, but again this isn\u2019t the same process.    &gt;Could lead ever decay into something else? Is there a half-life of lead?  I\u2019ve already told you that every single element has radioactive isotopes, see: https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Isotopes_of_lead - note just how many radioactive isotopes lead has, many are decay products from other elements, lead is the heaviest element that still has stable isotopes.   Isotopes are atoms with the same number of protons but different numbers of neutrons. Only specific configurations of protons and neutrons are stable, everything else is unstable and undergoes radioactive decay.   &gt;If lead does decay into something else, it would probably take us billions of years to find out, right?  See the link above    I think checking out some educational YouTube videos would help you. Try this one: https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=fES21E0qebw","231":"Probably not.  The last few elements discovered on the 7th row already decay within fractions of seconds, and there\u2019s 50 elements to fill up the 8th row yet to be discovered before the 9th row.","232":"Why do you think I have any actual firsthand experience in this field? I read journals and understand the science.   It took about 70 years for the rest of the elements in the 7th row to be created, that was elements 95-118). The last few discovered decay within fractions of seconds. The faster something decays the harder it is to create and then detect.   We will likely see element 120 within 5 years, but getting to element 169 (which would be the first element on the 9th row) is going to to take a lot longer and will need improvements in technology if it can even be created at all.   Is there a reason you are so obsessed with this?","233":"Really? I mentioned where I got it from in my top level comment and you don't even have an idea?   Huh. Guess I could make it more clear, but then again it isn't really relevant to the topic at hand so I don't think I will.","234":"&gt;Feel free to google whether it's ok to skip gears and you will get article after article saying   Whatever you want it to.   \"There are websites on the internet that agree with my preconceived notions\" also applies to whether vaccines cause autism and if the Earth is flat.","235":"How do you think money comes into being? Only about 3% of money is printed. As the Bank of England explains here, money mostly comes about through the issuance of loans (https:\/\/www.bankofengland.co.uk\/quarterly-bulletin\/2014\/q1\/money-creation-in-the-modern-economy) and those loans come about by editing a spreadsheet.","236":"&gt; Why is it political though, shouldn't it be a clear cut science issue cause it has to be built somewhere anyways?  Science says it needs to be done, politics is where it will be done and by who.","237":"That is one way to look at it, yes. That's why dividends exist. It's not the only way to look at it though. Because without the business keeping that profit to invest back into the business, it could never grow, giving up increasing value in the future.  Take manufacturing, say that you build widgets, each widget nets x profit. That x value can be given out as dividends or it can be used to increase the number of widgets we make and sell. So, by giving up x now and letting the company build another production line of widgets, next year, i get 3x (2x for 2 years of profits, plus x for the new production line of widgets they made)","238":"Why would there need to be another purpose other than selling it? If i buy antique or collectors items, they don't pay dividends, i only get cash value when i see them. Likewise, whenever i buy most things (like as a business owner buying inventory to sell) they own their inventory, but get zero value until it is sold.","239":"Because the board enacts the will of the stock holders, based on stockholder voting. The idea of having tens of thousands of people try to run a company (each stock holder) would be a surefire way to end any company. Thus, like government, people are appointed to the board based on the majority of stock ownership.   I have no idea how you think just splitting stock would somehow be a solution for that, as every single stock issued dilutes the rest....

No one is forcing you to buy it...","240":"By that definition of mlm, then every wholesaler that sells to walmart, target etc is a mlm. In that case, mlms make the world function......  A ponzi scheme requires there to be an exaggerated or novalue behind the product being bought or sold.

Either way, there is value behind the product (ownership) being exchanged...  And yes, companies do typically buy back stock during recession (the opposite of dilluting) to manage stock prices, which is based on the majority of stock holders decision.","241":"So wholesalers.   A) there is intrinsic value, as you have partial ownership of material goods (what the company owns)   B) the competition is between companies, aka you can buy that companies stock or this companies stock. The stock values are extremely competitive within an industry.  It really feels like I'm helping you write a highschool econ paper...  Also given the way these things are being spread out, we will come back to ponzi schemes, one topic at a time (for now wholesalers or mlm","242":"You didn't answer or acknowledge the limitations of being wholesales (aka mlm), so i will assume this is based on mlm.  When i buy apples directly from an orchard, i take the risk (just like buying stock) that i can sell them at a profit to grocers (who sell them to the consumers who consume them). I have no control over whether or not the grocers will buy them or not.

The BOD (representatives of the shareholders - mostly large shareholders themselves) decide on the dividend policy. It is, in theory, the shareholders that decide whether or not the company pays a dividend, management can advise but the board decides.   So if a company doesn't pay dividends it is usually a joint consensus of the management and the owners (shareholders) of the company. Of course, if someone owns 0.00001% of the shares of the company, they probably cannot expect to have much say (other than voting at the AGM) in the major strategic decisions of the company.","245":"The beauty of the free market is that you can make any investment decision based on any set of beliefs you have. All I can attempt is to explain how it works. If your conclusion is that A is better than B, then so be it.   It is simply odd that you make such a huge distinction between dividend and non-dividend paying shares. But you are free to do so. Hopefully if you ever intend to invest, you research the return history of various companies in recent history and validate your belief (dividend etc) against empirical performance.   At the end of the day, investing is mostly about making as much money as you can at an acceptable risk in a timeframe that fits you.","246":"CC: u\/covalick  &gt;We are not even sure what the smallest unit of time is, though many suspect it is planck time.   This is false. The majority think that time is continuous, not chopped up into moments of Planck time.  &gt;Time as we experience it must have existed after the big bang, but at those early moments, only a few Planck time units after the big bang, space was not yet space. It was a massive ball of unimaginable amounts of energy,  This is also false. I'm not even sure what this is supposed to mean.  When you rewind the clock, things get closer and closer together until at some point, the energy is packed together so tightly that spacetime has to be described with quantum mechanics, but there are numerous problems with formulating such a theory.  &gt;I am hope full that when a nuclear clock is finally created (much more accurate than an atomic clock) we may start to unwrap some of the mysteries of time.  A nuclear clock also has nothing to do with the nature of time. It simply allows us to measure time more accurately, though its error will still be many times greater than a Planck time.","247":"Planck time is the time it takes for light to travel one Planck length.  A Planck length is the resolution of a photon energetic enough to create a black hole, which basically means you can't see anything smaller than it.  None of this means they are the smallest possible length scales, just that they are scales at which quantum gravity becomes important.","248":"This is complicated. It's easiest to think of them as waves, but more accurately, they are waves of points.

In that case, mlms make the world function......  A ponzi scheme requires there to be an exaggerated or novalue behind the product being bought or sold.

Either way, there is value behind the product (ownership) being exchanged...  And yes, companies do typically buy back stock during recession (the opposite of dilluting) to manage stock prices, which is based on the majority of stock holders decision.","254":"Market research also shows that stocks are valuable, so your previous point is invalid.

For HS donations\/fundraisers can help fund things at the school so that other children can also attend or do things there. It\u2019s the same thing for College, fundraising is a way for the school to make money to fund new infrastructure and other things. People donate money for many reasons some being they want to allow other children experience things they experienced or help expand programs that are beneficial. Education is one everyone thinks should be funded, but when it comes to funding it\u2019s difficult to for people to give up money to actually do it.","261":"They attach these emotional connections and culture because of the human connections and experiences (the two are intertwined).

I\u2019m not sure what you\u2019re looking for now to be honest. Are you looking for why people donate money via fundraisers to schools that they attended or go to networking events (like alumni functions).

But, that buying is an effect, not the cause. The prices goes up because people believe that the company is worth more than what it is selling for.

If the company's balance sheet (net worth in actual assets) is worth 120$, then people will buy it (assuming no other variables) because by buying it, you get 1.20$ for 1$. As more people buy it, the availability of the stock decreases, which makes each share sell for more.   Never ever buy stock just because someone else did or that it is expensive. The value of the stock is based on the company it represents.","266":"Supply and demand affect scarcity and scarcity drives value in all markets.

You buy stock (partial ownership of physical goods), then you sell that ownership.","269":"Many systems can be self-sustaining so long as they have 'food'. While we don't know the exact path that life followed as it formed, it seems safe to say that a very rudimentary von Neumann 'machine' molecule or arrangement of molecules came to be which then developed more and more complex 'programs' that eventually became DNA.  Again, such developments are very unlikely, but given the sheer number of molecules forming and breaking in the oceans even now, on the order of quintillions or more every second, over the course of trillions of years, it shouldn't be too shocking that it happened *once*.","270":"Hmm?

I don't think I understand the question.  Your business has the money it takes in from the products and services it sells; this is called *revenue.*  Your business also has the money it pays out: money to keep the lights on, pay for raw materials, pay salaries, etc. These are called *expenses.* Crucially, salaries get paid out *here,* at this step.

NaZi = National Socialist and socialism is not right wing let alone far right. It's just that the term 'nazi' and 'national socialist' has become an *example* of far right ideology.

Also if you would draw out the Nazi party's separate beliefs and policies you get more like a shotgun blast at various parts of the spectrum. Some policies could be seen as extreme left, some centrist-left, a lot far right obviously etc. So that way you can't 'fit' the party into a specific part of the spectrum. This is a key feature of this kind of parties that transcend the classical political classification that is left\/right wing. Nowadays it's more common for populist parties in Europe (don't know much about other parts of the world) where you see a combination of popular policies on both the left and right wing to 'attract' more followers if you call it that, but then also joined with a lot of far right policies, often played down to not be classified as such that easily.","295":"Human hearing ranges from (about) 20 Hz to 20,000 Hz.

We can \"feel\" sound waves outside of our normal range of hearing - both above and below the 20\/20,000 thresholds.  The 18.9 Hz wave is no different - you can't hear it, but you can feel it is there.  In many people, this feeling manifests itself as fear or paranoia.  You can \"feel\" something in the room, but none of your other senses register anything consciously.  This incongruence greats discomfort,t which manifests as fear.  It is called the \"Ghost Frequency\" because it is theorized that many \"haunted\" areas simply produce tones close to 18.9 Hz (through resonance or other natural quirks) and people associate the fear response with a \"presence\" in the area.","296":"It is actually pretty tough to generate things that low - most speakers can't do it (since there is no point in making a sound no one can hear).

As for physical reactions, nothing due to the sound itself but there are all sorts of physiological reactions to fear.","297":"Properly contained we probably could, but what would be the point?  High level waste is simple enough to contain on land, and takes up a tiny amount of space.

You cask the waste, put the casks in a big concrete yard, and watch them. If one leaks, you fix it and clean up the leak.  The debate in the US over spent fuel storage is purely political.

I read journals and understand the science.   It took about 70 years for the rest of the elements in the 7th row to be created, that was elements 95-118). The last few discovered decay within fractions of seconds. The faster something decays the harder it is to create and then detect.   We will likely see element 120 within 5 years, but getting to element 169 (which would be the first element on the 9th row) is going to to take a lot longer and will need improvements in technology if it can even be created at all.   Is there a reason you are so obsessed with this?","329":"Is it really important though? None of these elements have real world applications. It\u2019s mostly a dick waving contest.   If it\u2019s boring in school it\u2019s mostly because of boring teachers or boring curricula, or both. Chemistry is an amazing science because it\u2019s so essential to everything around us.   If it takes 5 years to discover element 119, and even if it takes 5 years past that for each other element you\u2019re looking at nearly 50000 years. And that\u2019s a theoretical number pulled out of nowhere with no basis in reality. There\u2019s other problems to overcome, like heavier elements needing electrons to travel at faster than the speed of light and somehow overcoming the repulsion of protons in the nucleus.","330":"We have ruled out that we are the center of the universe by using the Doppler effect on galaxies we are observing. If we were the center of the universe, everything would be moving away from us. However, there are some galaxies who\u2019s light has been shifted towards the red end of the spectrum, which according to Hubble\u2019s observations, means that the galaxy is accelerated towards us.","331":"No, because if we were at the centre, it would be impossible for thing to be moving towards us. The universe is not static, and doesn\u2019t have a barrier for said galaxies to rebound off of. It is constantly accelerating expansion. For example if you drop a rock in a lake, the waves ripple outwards, not towards the rock. But if some galaxies, had a lighter mass, they would be moving faster and possibly overtake others as will happen with the Milky Way and andromeda","332":"As of now, the physics behind the expansion of the universe is purely theoretical, hence the opposing views on the matter. The physics that I have learnt on this topic. According the Hubble\u2019s theory on the matter, there is no center of the universe, rather we are all accelerating away at a speed, and no matter which vantage point in the universe you took,  whether on a planet in another galaxy or earth, you would see the same effect of galaxies both blue and red shifted","333":"This subreddit does not allow anecdotal or guess based answers. You could try r\/answers or r\/nostupidquestions if that is more what you wanted.  Your question itself is asking for a medical diagnosis, please do not take a diagnosis from anonymous strangers on the internet.","334":"Even still its worth asking a doctor, you could be totally fine, but on the off chance a doctor goes \"the particular way your knee twitches left indicates potential macguffin syndrome\" its better to ask a doctor than have the internet say you are fine when you might not be (even if its a minor\/slim chance).","335":"I found the quote I was thinking of... an anecdote from Richard Feynman, arguably one of the greatest physicists of the 20th century.   &amp;#x200B;  &gt;When I was a  kid growing up in Far Rockaway, I  had a friend named Bernie Walker. We both had \"labs\" at home, and we would do various \"experiments.\" One time, we were discussing something - we must have been 11 or 12 at the time - and I  said, \"But thinking is nothing but talking to yourself inside.\"       &gt;   &gt;\"Oh yeah?\" Bernie said. \"Do you know the crazy shape of the crankshaft in car?\"      &gt;   &gt;\"Yeah, what of it?\"      &gt;   &gt;\"Good. Now tell me: how did you describe it when you were talking to yourself?\"       &gt;   &gt;So I  learned from Bernie that thoughts can be visual as well as verbal.   &amp;#x200B;  \u2014 [http:\/\/calteches.library.caltech.edu\/607\/2\/Feynman.pdf](http:\/\/calteches.library.caltech.edu\/607\/2\/Feynman.pdf)","336":"The whole piece is worth reading - it talks about how some people count to themselves audibly (imagining a voice counting, as it were), and some people count to themselves visually (imagining watching a clock) - and how the different types of thinking to yourself affects your ability to do different things simultaneously.      Goes on to describe how Feynman then tried to learn to do both (as have I since reading this. And like Feynman, have failed).      More importantly, the larger point of the story is about how even basic everyday things that are \"universal\" can be done in completely unexpected and, frankly, alien seeming ways for other people! :)","337":"Vaccinations train your body on how to fight diseases. It basically gives your body the \"I have seen that one before\" power over sickness.  However you need to be kind of healthy to get vaccinated. There are certain conditions under which you cannot receive vaccines (you are very young, your immune system is gone due to birth defects or cancer treatment,. ..).  These people rely on an effect called \"herd immunity\".  Basically you die if you get infected but you never get infected because everyone around you is vaccinated. This prevents a disease from spreading.  Unfortunately to achieve herd immunity roughly 98% of the population have to be vaccinated.  So for me personally as a vaccinated, healthy adult it makes no difference if you are vaccinated or not. For my little daughter or my cancer stricken relative it is a life or death situation (unfortunately quite literally).  Therefore if you are healthy and able to get a shot, go get a shot. It will safe someone's life.  (Kind of the same principle as you clear a lane for an ambulance. Yes it is inconvenient for you for 30 seconds but you help safe a live and you would expect others to do it for you).","338":"Depends on where you come from. In Germany you have a general practitioner that is \"your doctor\". It gets documented with your health insurance.  In Norway you get a doctor assigned and are not allowed to go to a different one, except for emergencies (afaik).","339":"You mean pubic hair? Yeah it usually grows in front, on down between the legs and a little bit on the butt hole area. It's just often seen as taboo, so some women shave or wax to get rid of it. But that's her decision to make and its perfectly find to keep it all or remove it all. Shaving and waxing can hurt and cause ingrown hairs which is one reason some may not want to remove the hair.","340":"Now that is a good question... I know I had some sex education in school but it wasn't very good. It's a common problem in schools because people are scared to talk about it. Some of the fear is that it will encourage kids to start having sex early but I think it's important for everyone to know how the body works. Everyone has one, so why hide it?  Kids need to know what is normal and what is not normal, so if there is a problem, they can talk to a doctor. Puberty is scary with everything changing and a lot of people feel shame about it when they shouldn't. I'm glad you're asking questions ahead of time so you're a little more prepared.","341":"It's just how the human body is. \u00af\\_(\u30c4)_\/\u00af Can't do much about it. Lots of religions have stories that give reasons if that's something you believe in.  Although I think it is pretty flippin awesome that women can grow a child inside of her. And then feed it with her own body too. It's like a superpower.","342":"There is no such thing. A wire is either carrying enough voltage to decide that it's \"On\", or it's not in which case it's \"Off\". There is no in between.  So for example a processor that operates with a 5 volt data pin, the manufacturer might decide anything below 2.5 volts is a \"off\" and anything 2.5 volts or above is \"on\". And anything higher than 7 volts might kill the chip. Certain electrical tolerances are built into the components.","343":"I mean it depends on what you mean by \"analog\". An analog what? You can send 5 volts of electricity to any electrical component, what happens when you do that is going to depend on what the component is designed to do (and also depends on whether you're sending AC or DC current).  If you send 5 volts to the digital processor in my example above, it would be interpreted as a 1\/On\/True however you want to represent that. A string of those might represent an instruction or something.  If you send the same 5 volts to a 12 volt analog LED, it might light up with about 40% brightness. Analog doesn't have \"positions\", that's the point. We measure its voltage level.","344":"At this point we're not talking about computers at all, but the difference between analog and digital electrical circuits. This is less Computer Science and more Electrical Engineering.  An analog circuit is either \"on\" or \"off\", but its operation can also change based on the energy level. Usually we design the circuit for a specific voltage level (eg. 110V in a US household), and change the current draw to change its operation. Eg. to make a toaster coil hotter or a fan spin faster.  A digital circuit always just \"exists\", with its operation determined by the sequence of on\/off electrical signals transmitted through it. Note that it's the circuit as a whole that is designed to be \"digital\". Individual components like transistors or capacitors are inherently \"analog\", we just use them in different ways.  The concept of \"1s and 0s\" is just something we humans use to help work with digital circuits because of the constant stream of on\/off data going through the circuit - it's useful to represent it as binary numbers. Analog circuits don't operate this way so the concept is kind of useless.","345":"I am of the mindset that those with grammatical errors in their sentence structure and an inability to articulate themselves clearly in their written responses to others are fun to fuck with because they be dumb. Thanks for continuing to allow me to play with dumb.","346":"Do your hands handle the cold well to begin with? I feel your pain, exacerbated by the cold. Just the cold alone is enough to make my fingers hurt enough to consider amputation. About 35\u00b0 F seems to be the point where it starts. The rest of me is fine, just my fingers have the issue.","347":"I've been wondering of late if arm compression sleeves might help. I wear gloves for work and most of the time I'm not in my house. Have to protect my dish pan hands. But I wear thin gloves because I need nimble fingers. They don't really protect against the cold. I suppose it's worth a try.","348":"They are supposed to promote circulation. Sports people use them all the time.  No room for the hair dryer next to the ear protection. Maybe if I just didn't work on cold days?  I do know they have battery powered gloves to keep your hands warm. Might work for your cycling, but I know I'd destroy them doing remodels.","349":"I have seen closer to $230,000, but regardless, much of that is disposable income that parents want to spend.  Just because the average cost of a car is high doesn\u2019t mean someone poor has to buy an expensive car, it just means people who have money like to spend it on cars.  I have the income to do so, so I spend a lot of money on my daughter because it makes me happy.  And that increases the average but others don\u2019t have to.  Basically the number is high because people want to spend money on their kids.  Nobody needs a $1000 crib.","350":"Sort of.  Since people are having fewer kids they have the ability to do more for the kids they do have.  Also having kids at an older age means they have more money.  Also, it inflates the cost when both parents work so they have to pay child care, but rarely does someone work if they can\u2019t make more than childcare costs.  So instead of staying home with their children, they earn $40,000 per year and pay $20,000 per year in child care.  In the end they have more money than if they stayed home with their kids, but studies like these make it look like it is costing the family $20,000 more than previous generations.    I buy a lot of stuff that would be considered for my daughter because it makes my life easier or because I get more enjoyment buying something for her than something for myself.  But all those costs go into looking like it is just expensive to have kids.","351":"I think there is a difference in spoiling a child and overspending on a child.  I seriously doubt my daughter is going to end up feeling like she needs expensive things because her mom wanted her to have an expensive Easter dress or an expensive crib.  On the other hand, if I buy her a toy every time I took her to the supermarket, that probably will spoil her.  I\u2019m sure it is easier in theory than in practice, but I intend to make sure my children understand the value of money and that everything in life is a trade off.  It is possible to make more money but there are sacrifices to do so.  And while some passion projects might not earn as much, there is also a difference in making less because you choose something you love, and making less because you simply chose to be lazy.","352":"That is one way to look at it, yes. That's why dividends exist. It's not the only way to look at it though. Because without the business keeping that profit to invest back into the business, it could never grow, giving up increasing value in the future.  Take manufacturing, say that you build widgets, each widget nets x profit. That x value can be given out as dividends or it can be used to increase the number of widgets we make and sell. So, by giving up x now and letting the company build another production line of widgets, next year, i get 3x (2x for 2 years of profits, plus x for the new production line of widgets they made)","353":"\"Because you need to\".... then only buy stocks that give our regular dividends.   I understand why you want dividends, but the conversation has moved from you don't understand why some stocks don't do dividends to crying that some don't, those are fundamentally different concepts.   Your way of viewing stocks is valid and some stocks share your point of view, but it isn't the ONLY valid way to view stocks. In the end, the decision to pay dividends is based on the board of directors, which the stockholders can vote on...","354":"Because the board enacts the will of the stock holders, based on stockholder voting. The idea of having tens of thousands of people try to run a company (each stock holder) would be a surefire way to end any company. Thus, like government, people are appointed to the board based on the majority of stock ownership.   I have no idea how you think just splitting stock would somehow be a solution for that, as every single stock issued dilutes the rest....   At the end of the day, if you don't like a company that doesn't pay dividends, don't buy their stock. No one is forcing you to buy it...","355":"By that definition of mlm, then every wholesaler that sells to walmart, target etc is a mlm. In that case, mlms make the world function......  A ponzi scheme requires there to be an exaggerated or novalue behind the product being bought or sold. If everyone just held their stocks, (thus demand for buying stocks just froze), then people would sell their stocks (potentially liquidating the company) or stock holders would then demand dividends. Either way, there is value behind the product (ownership) being exchanged...  And yes, companies do typically buy back stock during recession (the opposite of dilluting) to manage stock prices, which is based on the majority of stock holders decision.","356":"So wholesalers.   A) there is intrinsic value, as you have partial ownership of material goods (what the company owns)   B) the competition is between companies, aka you can buy that companies stock or this companies stock. The stock values are extremely competitive within an industry.  It really feels like I'm helping you write a highschool econ paper...  Also given the way these things are being spread out, we will come back to ponzi schemes, one topic at a time (for now wholesalers or mlm","357":"You didn't answer or acknowledge the limitations of being wholesales (aka mlm), so i will assume this is based on mlm.  When i buy apples directly from an orchard, i take the risk (just like buying stock) that i can sell them at a profit to grocers (who sell them to the consumers who consume them). I have no control over whether or not the grocers will buy them or not. I may end up with rotting apples because i didn't realize that people now hate apples...","358":"Market research also shows that stocks are valuable, so your previous point is invalid. Why would i buy stock if i knew the value was frozen?  Your analogy would make purchasing any currency in foreign currency moot. I could invest in buying yen, i can't eat that, but correctly i can use it to buy apples.... likewise for bolts, 2 by 4s, etc....","359":"Ha ha ha ha ha!!! Mooo!

There are several hypothesis and models about how this will look like, these are: Novopangea, Pangea Proxima\/Ultima, Aurica and Amasia.  The thing is that in most of them, the mayority of the land mass will be found in the northern hemisphere (for example, in the Amasia hypothesis, all the land mass is on the northern hemisphere except for the Antarctica). So you should be asking this in 250 million years in the future.

Remember that this process that it's currently happening, takes hundreds millions of years to complete, so we can only suppose how it will end up.","373":"Imagine a brand new whole inteligent species from that time trying to figure it out how were the continents located using human fossils, artifacts and ruins as clues.  Well, we know for sure that Australia moves 7cm to the north every year, so in a couple million years it will probably clash with Indonesia, then all the way to the north until finally clashing with China.","374":"There are a few effects; ionization will break apart biologically important molecules, which can then become \"radicals\" which can break apart more molecules or damage proteins. Too much damage to cellular structures can cause the cell to destroy itself, as can too much damage to DNA. This is why bad sunburn causes skin to peel off, the epidermal and dermal layers received enough damage to decide they need to kill themselves for the greater good. However, if DNA is damaged in certain ways, it can lead to cancer. It's not that DNA can't be repaired at all, it's that it is the \"master program\" for the cell and can be modified in ways that make the cell do things that it isn't supposed to.   You can also receive too much damage to important cells like in organs. It's actually therapeutic in some situations, such as using radioactive iodine to destroy some of a large thyroid, but many organs are not good at regenerating so the damage can hamper their functionality.","375":"Every point you make against industrial farming agriculture is another point against animal agriculture.

In all prior examples, assume that the assertions are exactly as stated. There is no basis for \"Yeah but I didn't mean it that way...\". A Scotsman is a human person from Scotland. A person born in Edinburgh is just that.  If person 1 says \"All X's are Y's\"   Then person 2 says \"X1 is an X but not a Y\"   Then person 1 says \"Then X1 is not an X because all X's are Y's\"   Where X1 exists in the subset of all X  Then JUST GOING BY INFORMATION THAT IS PRESENT, PERSON 1's ARGUMENT IS FALLACIOUS.","388":"If someone applies the No True Scotsman fallacy to a personal opinion, then that is incorrect.

Cost per *Available* Seat Mile and Revenue per *Available* Seat Mile.  How much is produced\/consumed for every seat, every mile.  Here's the thing.   Available is extremely important.  When passengers do the Hidden City, they remove the Available.       With a large airline like Lufthansa or Delta (who operates 4800 flights every day), it aggregates big time.  If *one* person on each flight does a hidden city, that's the equivalent of running 16 empty Boeing 777 flights every day.","393":"And why do you think that has an effect on me?  Waste your money the way you want to; no skin off my back.  Hell, for all you know, I support Sanders, too.","394":"The \"spots\" are always \"touching\". In other words, the wires are always physically connected. The way programmers change what data (electrical signals) is fed into those wires is by storing instructions into memory. How does the CPU know to retrieve those instructions and execute them? Ultimately it's hardwired to do so as part of its design and manufacture. Ever heard of the BIOS on a motherboard? That's the program permanently stored in Read Only Memory (ROM) that kicks off that whole process.","395":"BIOS is a program written to a ROM memory chip at the motherboard factory, that provides the initial instructions to the CPU. This includes initialising all the connected hardware, and eventually telling the CPU to start loading instructions from some storage media (which ideally contains an operating system). We call this process *booting*. The CPU is already hard-wired as part of its design, to load this BIOS program from the motherboard it's plugged in to.","396":"The CPU is designed that way based on the arrangement of transistors and other components. Feed it a \"6\" and it will add the next two numbers. Feed it an \"8\" and it will store a number into memory. How exactly the transistors are arranged to do so is not even remotely ELI5, and the people who know it are paid millions for their expertise. If you want to see what it looks like inside a CPU you can watch [this video](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=Fxv3JoS1uY8).  The best I can do for ELI5: using transistors you can build logic gates. Using logic gates you can build logical functions. Transistors can also control which logic gates get activated based on a given input. You change which transistors are activated by sending signals to certain CPU pins in a certain order. The CPU is designed such that it would automatically read instructions from certain pins when powered on (which is where the BIOs\/boot process comes in). [Transistors to gates](https:\/\/www.cs.bu.edu\/~best\/courses\/modules\/Transistors2Gates\/).  If you have the basic building blocks to form transistors and\/or logic gates, you can build a fully functional computer, which is how people have simulated computers inside other software such as Minecraft or Factorio.","397":"A function. If the function is y=x\\*2, then inputting 4 will result in 8.  Programs are kinds of functions that (usually) take input, process it, and provide some kind of output. While computers only work with numbers, it's up to the program to interpret what that number means. They aren't always literally numbers that need to be displayed as text on a monitor.","398":"Do me a personal favor. In all prior examples, assume that the assertions are exactly as stated. There is no basis for \"Yeah but I didn't mean it that way...\". A Scotsman is a human person from Scotland. A person born in Edinburgh is just that.  If person 1 says \"All X's are Y's\"   Then person 2 says \"X1 is an X but not a Y\"   Then person 1 says \"Then X1 is not an X because all X's are Y's\"   Where X1 exists in the subset of all X  Then JUST GOING BY INFORMATION THAT IS PRESENT, PERSON 1's ARGUMENT IS FALLACIOUS.","399":"The title of your post was \"Why is the No True Scotsman considered a fallacy\" and that's been repeatedly answered. Whether you think that it is realistic as regards conversations is really neither here nor there.","400":"1. Again, this falls entirely outside of the purview of your original question. 2. Your argument that the fallacy almost never happens in actual debate is pretty suspet. 3. [Logic doesn't really concern itself with the most realistic scenarios](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Monty_Hall_problem)","401":"\"I've never seen it myself\" is not an argument for \"therefore it is very rare\". Neither is \"someone might mistakenly invoke the fallacy incorrectly\" proof that \"the fallacy is frequently invoked incorrectly\".","402":"If someone applies the No True Scotsman fallacy to a personal opinion, then that is incorrect. This has nothing to do with the validity of the fallacy. Your position seems to be \"I don't like people using the fallacy this way\" and your evidence is \"I see it happen a lot\". These are not very robust, logically speaking (well, your opinion may be internally consistent but it's not very interesting to discuss).","403":"If materialism is true then consciousness must be a direct product of matter. It could be that a sufficiently complex organization of matter leads to consciousness (self aware matter) as an emergent phenomena in our universe.","404":"So remember an object is all word based for you, even a complicated object?

Btw, I'm trying to track down a quote about imagination and describing\/visualising things, from which (if my memory is right) the camshaft example comes","405":"The whole piece is worth reading - it talks about how some people count to themselves audibly (imagining a voice counting, as it were), and some people count to themselves visually (imagining watching a clock) - and how the different types of thinking to yourself affects your ability to do different things simultaneously.      Goes on to describe how Feynman then tried to learn to do both (as have I since reading this. And like Feynman, have failed).      More importantly, the larger point of the story is about how even basic everyday things that are \"universal\" can be done in completely unexpected and, frankly, alien seeming ways for other people! :)","406":"Now that is a good question... I know I had some sex education in school but it wasn't very good. It's a common problem in schools because people are scared to talk about it. Some of the fear is that it will encourage kids to start having sex early but I think it's important for everyone to know how the body works. Everyone has one, so why hide it?  Kids need to know what is normal and what is not normal, so if there is a problem, they can talk to a doctor. Puberty is scary with everything changing and a lot of people feel shame about it when they shouldn't.

What you're suggesting results in variables with absolutely no name whatsoever. (array[0], array[1], array[2] are hardly descriptive).  Moreover, good programming means dissecting your problem into small easily managed chunks. So small, clear functions or objects.

The highest month is usually February) is lower than 2019-20.  Again, the reason is because of our precautions to covid are very effective at keeping flu number down. Influenza isn't usually a big deal, so we never go to great lengths to stop it. While Covid is very contagious, and Can result in hospitalization (influenza can too). The reason that we have been so precautious with Covid is because so many hospitals are at above 100% capacity. That was the entire point of flattening the curve, to keep the numbers at a more manageable rate for a long period of time. But people have let up on the precautions because everyone is understandably sick of the isolation","412":"People or goods travel, the virus travels. It just sticks around more in winter weather.   Technically you could still get the flu in the summer, but it's much more unlikely. It's already pretty unlikely to get it in the outer months of the season, but outside of the season it's a lot less likely.  But right now it'll still be in the US and Canada, and in a few months it'll be more prominent in Brazil, and then next year it'll come back.

While we don't know the exact path that life followed as it formed, it seems safe to say that a very rudimentary von Neumann 'machine' molecule or arrangement of molecules came to be which then developed more and more complex 'programs' that eventually became DNA.  Again, such developments are very unlikely, but given the sheer number of molecules forming and breaking in the oceans even now, on the order of quintillions or more every second, over the course of trillions of years, it shouldn't be too shocking that it happened *once*.","417":"This  is why Bio-fuel is a good alternative to include. Sure it depends on farming rates and things but it's better than relying on oil from nations who are unreliable in the long term.","418":"Arable land is an issue, In this respect Bio-fuel only works if you can grow algae or other plant source in places that doesn't have proper soil.    I often wish Vertical farms were more common but there are some companies out there now making them.

Although they say that the biggest sexual organ is actually our brain because it has a lot to do with what we think, how we think, what we have learned, and how we feel. One of the other replies to my comment was talking about castration as a form of punishment especially back 30 to 60 years ago, a very interesting movie about that is called \"The imitation game\" we're a man is working with the code breakers of the world war to try to figure out how to stop the enemy and was very successful at it, but it was struggling with his sexuality and a time and place where it was illegal to not be straight Here's a short article from mental floss attacks a little bit about a few famous castrated people http:\/\/mentalfloss.com\/article\/22367\/6-famous-eunuchs","430":"If I am not mistaken, many Asian cultures also performed castrations for various reasons, both political or social.

Yes, okay, discussion of biology was a necessary part of answering the question. It\u2019s a question that referenced puberty in mammals - it self-evidently was going to refer to biological topics. However, your question was asking for the biological reason that humans aren\u2019t ready for kids whilst animals are. The premise is false, and the reason the premise is false is due to social and not biological factors. As I\u2019ve said over and over and over.

Its impossible to tell if an event was random or just unpredictable, so I do not think there is much distinction. If its impossible to tell whether a spin left electron will be spin up or spin down, how would it matter if its \"truly\" random or not, as long as it is indeed \"truly\" unpredictable.","435":"Alpha particles are just helium nuclei without electrons. They are electrically charged and very much react with other things. Nuclei are in generally pretty strong (they call the binding force the strong force for a reason), so it takes a good bit of energy to break them up, and as atoms tend to be electrically neutral, they won't attract the alpha particles. It's generally much easier to add\/remove electrons than nucleons.  &amp;#x200B;  The LHC doesn't generally fuse anything, it just smashes things really hard, which creates new particles because of how the fundamental interactions can create new particles from energy.","436":"There are a few effects; ionization will break apart biologically important molecules, which can then become \"radicals\" which can break apart more molecules or damage proteins. Too much damage to cellular structures can cause the cell to destroy itself, as can too much damage to DNA. This is why bad sunburn causes skin to peel off, the epidermal and dermal layers received enough damage to decide they need to kill themselves for the greater good. However, if DNA is damaged in certain ways, it can lead to cancer. It's not that DNA can't be repaired at all, it's that it is the \"master program\" for the cell and can be modified in ways that make the cell do things that it isn't supposed to.   You can also receive too much damage to important cells like in organs. It's actually therapeutic in some situations, such as using radioactive iodine to destroy some of a large thyroid, but many organs are not good at regenerating so the damage can hamper their functionality.","437":"It's not just skin, it's called apoptosis and most cells in the body can do it. It also goes beyond cancer, you don't want malfunctioning cells dumping chemicals into the rest of the body.

The turbine speed and torque is going to be based on super complicated fluid mechanics stuff that I don't know to well.    No, it won't have the same energy output.  Lets say that substance 1 has a boiling point of 50 degrees Celsius and substance 2 has a boiling point of 100 degrees Celsius.  Lets also say that they require the same amount of energy to heat up 1 degree Celsius (1 kj).  Substance 1 absorbs 50 kj of energy but substance 2 absorbs 100 kj.

We want the fluid to have certain properties when it comes out of the boiler (we don't actually want steam) and when we have a high boiling point, we can put in more energy.  Also, water can store a lot of energy before it actually changes temperature, way more than acetone.    The turbine speed is related to how much fluid you pump through it, not the temperature although the fluid type can effect that.

The turbine extracts energy by spinning. It doesn't convert heat energy at all, it converts the kinetic energy of the paddles spinning to electricity, and that kinetic energy is generated by pressure.\nExplainer: You know, I almost included this in the last post but I decided not to include it to keep it simple.  The turbine is designed to bring the gas to supersonic speeds.  If we look at the conservation of energy, the gas needs to cool down to actually do this.  So a gas that's hotter can go faster in the turbine and faster velocities allow for more power to be generated.\n","18":"Explainer: To start with, I made a mistake in my previous comment.

The light hits the chip, and activate certain parts of that chip which the computer makes into an image on the screen.  The vantablack areas did not activate that part of the chip.

But the key take away is that there is absolutely nothing scientifically valid about what alchemists were attempting.\nExplainee: Evidently you can  From the wikipedia for: https:\/\/en.m.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Synthesis_of_precious_metals  GoldEdit  Chrysopoeia, the artificial production of\u00a0gold, is the symbolic goal of\u00a0alchemy. Such transmutation is possible in particle accelerators or nuclear reactors, although the production cost is currently many times the market price of gold. Since there is only one stable gold isotope,\u00a0197Au, nuclear reactions must create this isotope in order to produce usable gold.  Gold synthesis in an acceleratorEdit  Gold synthesis in a particle accelerator is possible in many ways. The\u00a0Spallation Neutron Source\u00a0has a liquid mercury target which will be transmuted into gold, platinum, and iridium, which are lower in atomic number than mercury.[citation needed]  Gold synthesis in a nuclear reactorEdit  Gold was synthesized from\u00a0mercury\u00a0by neutron bombardment in 1941, but the\u00a0isotopes of gold\u00a0produced were all\u00a0radioactive.[12]\u00a0In 1924, a Japanese physicist,\u00a0Hantaro Nagaoka, accomplished the same feat.[13]  Gold can currently be manufactured in a nuclear reactor by the\u00a0irradiation\u00a0of either\u00a0platinum\u00a0or mercury.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: All processes get cheaper eventually   And even if they couldn't, the question was never whether you could \"profitably\" turn lead into gold, only that you could turn lead into gold   Well, maybe it was for certain people but I'm sure not for others  If you really disliked the current economic system and wanted to turn it all on its head you could just make a shitload of gold and give it to everyone\nExplainer: It was always whether it could be profitable that's literally the only reason to choose gold.  And you can do that now with counterfeit currency, also no current currencies are tied to the gold standard anymore.\n","74":"Explainer: Not through any economically feasible process nor any process that they were attempting. you can do anything to anything with enough energy.

Anyway, in some ways counterfeit money might actually be harder long-term to pull off, since people get better and better and verifying it (people will probably also get better at faking it)  Or, if a dollar is literally identical in every single way that would also help fight the matter   Eitherway I think we should work om both practices   Although, I don't know if I like the possible \"sneakiness\" of counterfeiting\nExplainer: Alchemists predate electricity by a couple hundred years. There is no reason to transmute anything into specifically gold other than to make money.  And no, thats never ever going to happen, fiat currency it too much better.

Also, are there any physical reactions the body gives off to this save the eerie feeling?\nExplainer: It is actually pretty tough to generate things that low - most speakers can't do it (since there is no point in making a sound no one can hear).  That said, yes, you could make a house \"feel\" haunted by pumping in 18.9 Hz tones - people would feel the room was \"off\".  As for physical reactions, nothing due to the sound itself but there are all sorts of physiological reactions to fear.\n","78":"Explainer: Human hearing ranges from (about) 20 Hz to 20,000 Hz.  If a sound wave falls outside of that range, you are not going to be able to hear it.  However, that doesn't mean that you aren't able to perceive it in other ways.  We can \"feel\" sound waves outside of our normal range of hearing - both above and below the 20\/20,000 thresholds.  The 18.9 Hz wave is no different - you can't hear it, but you can feel it is there.  In many people, this feeling manifests itself as fear or paranoia.  You can \"feel\" something in the room, but none of your other senses register anything consciously.  This incongruence greats discomfort,t which manifests as fear.  It is called the \"Ghost Frequency\" because it is theorized that many \"haunted\" areas simply produce tones close to 18.9 Hz (through resonance or other natural quirks) and people associate the fear response with a \"presence\" in the area.\nExplainee: Great explanation.

And yeah, I'm not forced to buy stocks, but if your ownership of a business only has value when sold, it sounds like a good recipe for a ponzi scheme or MLM.\nExplainer: Then you don't really understand either of those terms....\n","129":"Explainer: By that definition of mlm, then every wholesaler that sells to walmart, target etc is a mlm. In that case, mlms make the world function......  A ponzi scheme requires there to be an exaggerated or novalue behind the product being bought or sold. If everyone just held their stocks, (thus demand for buying stocks just froze), then people would sell their stocks (potentially liquidating the company) or stock holders would then demand dividends. Either way, there is value behind the product (ownership) being exchanged...  And yes, companies do typically buy back stock during recession (the opposite of dilluting) to manage stock prices, which is based on the majority of stock holders decision.\nExplainee: The difference with wholesalers, is that there is intrinsic value, i.e. Food, water, etc. Stocks don't have intrinsic value. And there's competition for the same objecrlt, e.g. Tomatoes. MLMs don't have competition, because you buy it from the company only.  And company buying shares back during recessions is what I mean by non-dividend shares as not being not intrinsically valuable. People only sell things that have less value while being held. So non-dividend shares are valuable like art. Whatever the buyers decides.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: But that's the key right? You own something you have no control over.  You can buy stocks between companies, but that's like selling apples and oranges. They're both fruits, but they're still different things.\nExplainer: You didn't answer or acknowledge the limitations of being wholesales (aka mlm), so i will assume this is based on mlm.  When i buy apples directly from an orchard, i take the risk (just like buying stock) that i can sell them at a profit to grocers (who sell them to the consumers who consume them). I have no control over whether or not the grocers will buy them or not. I may end up with rotting apples because i didn't realize that people now hate apples...\n","130":"Explainer: So wholesalers.   A) there is intrinsic value, as you have partial ownership of material goods (what the company owns)   B) the competition is between companies, aka you can buy that companies stock or this companies stock. The stock values are extremely competitive within an industry.  It really feels like I'm helping you write a highschool econ paper...  Also given the way these things are being spread out, we will come back to ponzi schemes, one topic at a time (for now wholesalers or mlm\nExplainee: But that's the key right?

They're both fruits, but they're still different things.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: But that's not doing market research. Maybe the analogy is not the best to price your point, but you can easily ensure you have sales before purchasing.   Also, you have the intrinsic value of apples which you can eat (I assume you're not allergic to it). So even though you may lose some of your money (the apples rot) you're guaranteed a certain level of return regardless. Hell, even rotten apples can be turned into compost for further loss mitigation. There's so much more flexibility there.\nExplainer: Market research also shows that stocks are valuable, so your previous point is invalid. Why would i buy stock if i knew the value was frozen?  Your analogy would make purchasing any currency in foreign currency moot. I could invest in buying yen, i can't eat that, but correctly i can use it to buy apples.... likewise for bolts, 2 by 4s, etc....\n","131":"Explainer: Radioactive decay is very much a quantum process, and the half-life comes from the binding energy and stability of the nucleus. The alpha\/beta\/gamma particles coming out might crash around and damage other atoms, but this is a result of the decay and doesn't precipitate more decay in most cases (fission can be an exception).  &amp;#x200B;  For fission, you can imagine the nucleus like a deformed ball. Unstable nuclei will \"oscillate\" such that the ball will get more spherical and more elongated repeatedly. If it manages to stretch to far, it'll break apart. This is a decent analogy, though being somewhat quantum mechanical it isn't quite that simple.\nExplainee:  So when a Uranium atom decays into \"stable\" Thorium, is it possible that another alpha\/beta\/gamma particles can knock into it, turning it back into Uranium or has the particles lost just enough energy in it's initial emission to not be able to return, \"upgrading\" the atom again?

To add to a nucleus, you must overcome the electromagnetic repulsion from the protons enough that the strong force takes over. The strong force is a very short ranged force, unlike electromagnetism, and doesn't follow the inverse square law.\n","132":"Explainer: Generally, you won't be able to add back to the nucleus without fusion, which requires high energy and generally doesn't work well on elements heavier than iron as putting in more nucleons into such nuclei make them bound less strongly. This is why it is said heavy elements originate in supernovae, normal stars don't have the energy to fuse beyond iron. If the nucleus is unstable enough and gets run into, it can cause it to break apart, which is exploited by nuclear reactors to sustain the controlled fission reactions.\nExplainee: As far as suoernovae, it's because there's a ton of high energy+high gravity\/pressure keeping them together to fuse if I have that correct? \nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: It sort of reminds me of [that way to arrange magnets](https:\/\/youtu.be\/h34L9udPlv4) in such a way that it will repel when kinda far but snap in once close although I realize that in the video, atoms wouldn't lock in at that further distance. \n","133":"Explainer: &gt; The actual proof, I imagine, involves a whole bunch of symbols  It's not super hard to understand.

I do think I understand what a proof by contradiction is supposed to do.  You start with an assumption:  \"P.\"  Then, through reasoning, you show that \"P\" leads to something that cannot be true (e.g., 2 + 2 = 0), therefore (assuming the steps hold) the initial assumption is the thing that cannot be true.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: My other rejoinder--and I know that it must be fallacious--would be that \"there must be a better way to generate a list containing all of the numbers, and my initial list wasn't generated optimally.\"  I don't know enough about math or set theory to know how or why Cantor's proof responds to that, although I trust that the proof works given how long it's been around and how many people have examined it.\nExplainer: &gt;  \"there must be a better way to generate a list containing all of the numbers, and my initial list wasn't generated optimally.\"   The key is, no matter how you generated the list, how well thought-out it was, since diagonal argument assumes nothing of what's in the list or how it was made, the same argument still proves it's not complete.\n","134":"Explainer: &gt; (I'm one of those people who'd say \"just add the number you've created to the list\"  The assumption initially made was \"this list contains all the numbers\". No other assumptions. If you have to start adding numbers, then the list didn't contain all numbers, and you've proven that this assumption \"list with all numbers\" is impossible. Doesn't matter how clever you are, how many hours you spend adding exceptions you found, what you end up with is a list, and you've proven it won't contain all the numbers.\nExplainee: My other rejoinder--and I know that it must be fallacious--would be that \"there must be a better way to generate a list containing all of the numbers, and my initial list wasn't generated optimally.\"  I don't know enough about math or set theory to know how or why Cantor's proof responds to that, although I trust that the proof works given how long it's been around and how many people have examined it.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: There are a lot of other assumptions built in, I think, that I don't know enough about to ask intelligent questions about them.

This is less Computer Science and more Electrical Engineering.  An analog circuit is either \"on\" or \"off\", but its operation can also change based on the energy level. Usually we design the circuit for a specific voltage level (eg. 110V in a US household), and change the current draw to change its operation. Eg. to make a toaster coil hotter or a fan spin faster.  A digital circuit always just \"exists\", with its operation determined by the sequence of on\/off electrical signals transmitted through it. Note that it's the circuit as a whole that is designed to be \"digital\". Individual components like transistors or capacitors are inherently \"analog\", we just use them in different ways.  The concept of \"1s and 0s\" is just something we humans use to help work with digital circuits because of the constant stream of on\/off data going through the circuit - it's useful to represent it as binary numbers. Analog circuits don't operate this way so the concept is kind of useless.\n","144":"Explainer: P is what we use to show that M is logically inconsistent.

This isn't the easiest example of a proof by contradiction, so trying to figure out the logic of the argument as well as the programs might be what's confusing you\nExplainee: The overarching logic makes sense to me--we posit that there's a program (call it the \"Perfect Decider\") that can correctly determine whether, for **any** **possible program that could ever exist**, halts or instead runs indefinitely.  Then we invent another program (the \"Nasty Trickster\")--deliberately designing it to fool the Perfect Decider--and show that, when the Perfect Decider is fed to the Nasty Trickster (or perhaps vice versa - that's something that I don't understand and seems convoluted to me), the Perfect Decider doesn't work as advertised.    Thus, because of the existence of at least one counterexample, there can't be such a thing as the Perfect Decider (i.e., there can't be a program that can correctly determine, for any possible program that could ever exist, halts or instead runs forever).  That does not rule out the possibility of Very, Very Good Deciders, but it does show that a Perfect Decider is a logical impossibility.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: There is still something unsatisfying with permitting P to evaluate M and then change its answer.

When you rewind the clock, things get closer and closer together until at some point, the energy is packed together so tightly that spacetime has to be described with quantum mechanics, but there are numerous problems with formulating such a theory.  &gt;I am hope full that when a nuclear clock is finally created (much more accurate than an atomic clock) we may start to unwrap some of the mysteries of time.  A nuclear clock also has nothing to do with the nature of time. It simply allows us to measure time more accurately, though its error will still be many times greater than a Planck time.\nExplainee: Planck time was mentioned here several times, but what it really is?

Why isn't it that if you decide to not take dividends, you would gain more stocks (based on company performance) because you're technically \"reinvesting\" your dividends?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Dilution is not necessarily a bad thing. 10% of 10 million is worth more than 20% of 1 million.  And yeah, I'm not forced to buy stocks, but if your ownership of a business only has value when sold, it sounds like a good recipe for a ponzi scheme or MLM.\nExplainer: Then you don't really understand either of those terms....\n","185":"Explainer: Then you don't really understand either of those terms....\nExplainee: Mlm works by selling you products which you then go on to sell to others, how is that not much different to an ipo?  And a ponzi scheme requires others to keep joining so it can keep the cycle going, although in  this case a company is generally self sufficient, but at same time isnt obligated to buy your shares if you decide to sell. Which means they can  sell high and buy low by just waiting for a stock market crash or recession.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: The difference with wholesalers, is that there is intrinsic value, i.e. Food, water, etc. Stocks don't have intrinsic value. And there's competition for the same objecrlt, e.g. Tomatoes. MLMs don't have competition, because you buy it from the company only.  And company buying shares back during recessions is what I mean by non-dividend shares as not being not intrinsically valuable. People only sell things that have less value while being held. So non-dividend shares are valuable like art. Whatever the buyers decides.\nExplainer: So wholesalers.   A) there is intrinsic value, as you have partial ownership of material goods (what the company owns)   B) the competition is between companies, aka you can buy that companies stock or this companies stock. The stock values are extremely competitive within an industry.  It really feels like I'm helping you write a highschool econ paper...

In that case, mlms make the world function......  A ponzi scheme requires there to be an exaggerated or novalue behind the product being bought or sold. If everyone just held their stocks, (thus demand for buying stocks just froze), then people would sell their stocks (potentially liquidating the company) or stock holders would then demand dividends. Either way, there is value behind the product (ownership) being exchanged...  And yes, companies do typically buy back stock during recession (the opposite of dilluting) to manage stock prices, which is based on the majority of stock holders decision.\nExplainee: The difference with wholesalers, is that there is intrinsic value, i.e. Food, water, etc. Stocks don't have intrinsic value.

They're both fruits, but they're still different things.\nExplainer: You didn't answer or acknowledge the limitations of being wholesales (aka mlm), so i will assume this is based on mlm.  When i buy apples directly from an orchard, i take the risk (just like buying stock) that i can sell them at a profit to grocers (who sell them to the consumers who consume them). I have no control over whether or not the grocers will buy them or not. I may end up with rotting apples because i didn't realize that people now hate apples...\n","187":"Explainer: So wholesalers.

Maybe the analogy is not the best to price your point, but you can easily ensure you have sales before purchasing.   Also, you have the intrinsic value of apples which you can eat (I assume you're not allergic to it). So even though you may lose some of your money (the apples rot) you're guaranteed a certain level of return regardless. Hell, even rotten apples can be turned into compost for further loss mitigation. There's so much more flexibility there.\nExplainer: Market research also shows that stocks are valuable, so your previous point is invalid. Why would i buy stock if i knew the value was frozen?  Your analogy would make purchasing any currency in foreign currency moot. I could invest in buying yen, i can't eat that, but correctly i can use it to buy apples.... likewise for bolts, 2 by 4s, etc....\n","188":"Explainee: ELI5: If amount of water on Earth is a constant then how can we waste water?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Alright, fair enough.

Star Trek uses Defector Shields. As in some sort of shield of particles that basically vaporize the incoming dust, they also travel around by warping space so they ship isn't moving at all the space around it is. It's a difficult concept to grasp if you don't understand space-time basics.

Star Gate uses \"hyper space\" so you go into another \"dimension\" to and then come back.  https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Interstellar_travel_in_fiction  It all depends on the show but most good shows make it realistic enough and have science advisors telling them obvious flaws.   Like in the video game Mass Effect they discovered a way to remove \"mass\" from objects and even go negative so it's possible to go faster than light, and their ships travels like normal ones would accelerating half of the trip then turning around and accelerating backwards to arrive at the destination at normal speeds.

But global CO2 concentration is 400 ppm. CO2 isn't threatening your life until about 40,000ppm. So even if that were the case, you would never know.\n","196":"Explainer: It does. It's particularly notable when the gases are those other than the standard air mix of nitrogen, oxygen, CO2, and argon. Plus water vapor.  For example, if you open a manhole, the hydrogen sulfide will be near the bottom, because it's heavier than air. If the space has carbon monoxide in it, it could be near the top, as it's slightly lighter than air. CO2 is heavier than air, which is why you can use it to create a a ground fog. Methane is lighter than air, but flammable vapors of organic solvents tend to be heavier.

Transistors work like switches, with current flowing from the Source to the Drain, controlled by the Gate. This lets a tiny voltage at the Gate control a much larger current, like how a tiny valve can completely shut off a pipe. Analog devices can take a range of voltages through the gate that gradually turns on the current flowing through the device.   Remember, 1 and 0 are just what we call ON and OFF.

You purchased some of their shares in 2005. Their employees designed a product called an Iphone, marketed it, made it and sold millions of it and continued to innovate making their company valued at hundreds of billions of dollars because of the money it makes. You own a part of the effort the company put into this. How is this different from you buying a chicken, cooking it and selling it for more? If you sold someone a 25% share of your chicken company, then that person is entitled to 25% of the value of the company. You no longer own 100% of that company. If all you did was sell one chicken, then you need to give that person 25% of the profits from that chicken. A share isn't an IOU - it means that the owner of the share is part-owner of the company.\nExplainee: but what does it mean to be part-owner if you're not getting dividends (part of the profits)?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: yeah, so I feel like buying non-dividend shares is more of a winner takes all system.

All I can attempt is to explain how it works. If your conclusion is that A is better than B, then so be it.   It is simply odd that you make such a huge distinction between dividend and non-dividend paying shares. But you are free to do so. Hopefully if you ever intend to invest, you research the return history of various companies in recent history and validate your belief (dividend etc) against empirical performance.   At the end of the day, investing is mostly about making as much money as you can at an acceptable risk in a timeframe that fits you.\n","245":"Explainer: There are issues with corporate governance, but if someone owned 25% of the shares of a large public company (unrealistic mostly) they'd almost certainly be on the Board of Directors (BOD) and very likely the Chairman of the Board. The BOD (representatives of the shareholders - mostly large shareholders themselves) decide on the dividend policy. It is, in theory, the shareholders that decide whether or not the company pays a dividend, management can advise but the board decides.   So if a company doesn't pay dividends it is usually a joint consensus of the management and the owners (shareholders) of the company. Of course, if someone owns 0.00001% of the shares of the company, they probably cannot expect to have much say (other than voting at the AGM) in the major strategic decisions of the company.\nExplainee: yeah, so I feel like buying non-dividend shares is more of a winner takes all system.

How it is defined?\nExplainer: Planck time is the time it takes for light to travel one Planck length.  A Planck length is the resolution of a photon energetic enough to create a black hole, which basically means you can't see anything smaller than it.  None of this means they are the smallest possible length scales, just that they are scales at which quantum gravity becomes important.\n","247":"Explainer: CC: u\/covalick  &gt;We are not even sure what the smallest unit of time is, though many suspect it is planck time.   This is false. The majority think that time is continuous, not chopped up into moments of Planck time.  &gt;Time as we experience it must have existed after the big bang, but at those early moments, only a few Planck time units after the big bang, space was not yet space. It was a massive ball of unimaginable amounts of energy,  This is also false. I'm not even sure what this is supposed to mean.  When you rewind the clock, things get closer and closer together until at some point, the energy is packed together so tightly that spacetime has to be described with quantum mechanics, but there are numerous problems with formulating such a theory.  &gt;I am hope full that when a nuclear clock is finally created (much more accurate than an atomic clock) we may start to unwrap some of the mysteries of time.  A nuclear clock also has nothing to do with the nature of time.

It would seem that taking out all of the private insurance middlemen would result in much lower costs.\nExplainer: &gt;What is the evidence that government inefficiency would make the costs increase.  Government procurement is historically prone to cost overruns, bloat, and inefficiency. You can look at military spending for an example of this.  &gt;It would seem that taking out all of the private insurance middlemen would result in much lower costs.  But in the process, you get rid of the negotiators involved in drug\/treatment cost negotiations, and instead the government will just pay whatever the cost is without thinking about it, again because the government doesn't have significant means to fight for cost savings.  We already have a very similar problem with respect to student loans; the increased cost of college education in the US is largely due to the US government being so willing to pump money into higher education through student loans without any form of price controls or cost incentives.\n","252":"Explainer: Not necessarily; it's not a one-to-one shift, and generally the companies (correctly) think they can do a better job insuring their employees than the Feds can.  So in order to have the government provide the same level of healthcare, it likely will end up costing the government *more* because of how inefficient the government is at these kinds of things, in major part because the government isn't interested in a profit motive, and as a result isn't as interested in cost-savings measures.\nExplainee: What is the evidence that government inefficiency would make the costs increase.

And there's competition for the same objecrlt, e.g. Tomatoes. MLMs don't have competition, because you buy it from the company only.  And company buying shares back during recessions is what I mean by non-dividend shares as not being not intrinsically valuable. People only sell things that have less value while being held. So non-dividend shares are valuable like art. Whatever the buyers decides.\nExplainer: So wholesalers.   A) there is intrinsic value, as you have partial ownership of material goods (what the company owns)   B) the competition is between companies, aka you can buy that companies stock or this companies stock.

But that's not different in investing in nike shoes or luxury bags to resell later. The value of the stock comes from perception rather than anything thay can be more objectively discerned (dividends). E.g. Nike shoes are inherently shoes, so they have a level of intrinsic value. But is it worth 1k, is a matter of perception.  Point 2. Actually that highlights my point. If you invest in yen and try to use it in another country, it is very likely most places will not accept the currency unless you are willing to trade at a decent or significant loss. So that investment makes no sense because it is unusable until converted, which requires a person willing to trade it.   Furthermore, from another comment, someone said that money is useless until spent, which I fully agree with. But the reason why money always remains valuable is because it is the only form of negotiation with the government for the world's most valuable asset: land.\n","255":"Explainee: ELI5: How is alcoholism a disease?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Why isn\u2019t it an addiction and not a disease.

Goes on to describe how Feynman then tried to learn to do both (as have I since reading this. And like Feynman, have failed).      More importantly, the larger point of the story is about how even basic everyday things that are \"universal\" can be done in completely unexpected and, frankly, alien seeming ways for other people! :)\n","336":"Explainer: I found the quote I was thinking of... an anecdote from Richard Feynman, arguably one of the greatest physicists of the 20th century.   &amp;#x200B;  &gt;When I was a  kid growing up in Far Rockaway, I  had a friend named Bernie Walker. We both had \"labs\" at home, and we would do various \"experiments.\" One time, we were discussing something - we must have been 11 or 12 at the time - and I  said, \"But thinking is nothing but talking to yourself inside.\"       &gt;   &gt;\"Oh yeah?\" Bernie said. \"Do you know the crazy shape of the crankshaft in car?\"      &gt;   &gt;\"Yeah, what of it?\"      &gt;   &gt;\"Good. Now tell me: how did you describe it when you were talking to yourself?\"       &gt;   &gt;So I  learned from Bernie that thoughts can be visual as well as verbal.   &amp;#x200B;  \u2014 [http:\/\/calteches.library.caltech.edu\/607\/2\/Feynman.pdf](http:\/\/calteches.library.caltech.edu\/607\/2\/Feynman.pdf)\nExplainee: Thats one amazing quote, I like it.

An analog what? You can send 5 volts of electricity to any electrical component, what happens when you do that is going to depend on what the component is designed to do (and also depends on whether you're sending AC or DC current).  If you send 5 volts to the digital processor in my example above, it would be interpreted as a 1\/On\/True however you want to represent that. A string of those might represent an instruction or something.  If you send the same 5 volts to a 12 volt analog LED, it might light up with about 40% brightness. Analog doesn't have \"positions\", that's the point. We measure its voltage level.\n","343":"Explainer: There is no such thing. A wire is either carrying enough voltage to decide that it's \"On\", or it's not in which case it's \"Off\". There is no in between.  So for example a processor that operates with a 5 volt data pin, the manufacturer might decide anything below 2.5 volts is a \"off\" and anything 2.5 volts or above is \"on\". And anything higher than 7 volts might kill the chip. Certain electrical tolerances are built into the components.\nExplainee: So doesnt analog have the same 2 positions as digital?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: So analog doesnt do 1s and 0s because it doesnt have 1 and 0 positions, but only %s of them?\nExplainer: At this point we're not talking about computers at all, but the difference between analog and digital electrical circuits. This is less Computer Science and more Electrical Engineering.  An analog circuit is either \"on\" or \"off\", but its operation can also change based on the energy level. Usually we design the circuit for a specific voltage level (eg. 110V in a US household), and change the current draw to change its operation. Eg. to make a toaster coil hotter or a fan spin faster.  A digital circuit always just \"exists\", with its operation determined by the sequence of on\/off electrical signals transmitted through it. Note that it's the circuit as a whole that is designed to be \"digital\". Individual components like transistors or capacitors are inherently \"analog\", we just use them in different ways.  The concept of \"1s and 0s\" is just something we humans use to help work with digital circuits because of the constant stream of on\/off data going through the circuit - it's useful to represent it as binary numbers. Analog circuits don't operate this way so the concept is kind of useless.\n","344":"Explainer: I mean it depends on what you mean by \"analog\". An analog what?

Since people are having fewer kids they have the ability to do more for the kids they do have.  Also having kids at an older age means they have more money.  Also, it inflates the cost when both parents work so they have to pay child care, but rarely does someone work if they can\u2019t make more than childcare costs.  So instead of staying home with their children, they earn $40,000 per year and pay $20,000 per year in child care.

Do you think that the buying of these \"luxury\" items, things that make the parents happy but of course the kids don't know any different at first (like your example of a fancy onesie)...do you think that parents buying these things influences their kids to want\/need more when they grow up?

I seriously doubt my daughter is going to end up feeling like she needs expensive things because her mom wanted her to have an expensive Easter dress or an expensive crib.  On the other hand, if I buy her a toy every time I took her to the supermarket, that probably will spoil her.  I\u2019m sure it is easier in theory than in practice, but I intend to make sure my children understand the value of money and that everything in life is a trade off.  It is possible to make more money but there are sacrifices to do so.  And while some passion projects might not earn as much, there is also a difference in making less because you choose something you love, and making less because you simply chose to be lazy.\n","351":"Explainer: Sort of.

If you invest in yen and try to use it in another country, it is very likely most places will not accept the currency unless you are willing to trade at a decent or significant loss. So that investment makes no sense because it is unusable until converted, which requires a person willing to trade it.

This includes initialising all the connected hardware, and eventually telling the CPU to start loading instructions from some storage media (which ideally contains an operating system). We call this process *booting*. The CPU is already hard-wired as part of its design, to load this BIOS program from the motherboard it's plugged in to.\n","395":"Explainer: The \"spots\" are always \"touching\". In other words, the wires are always physically connected. The way programmers change what data (electrical signals) is fed into those wires is by storing instructions into memory. How does the CPU know to retrieve those instructions and execute them? Ultimately it's hardwired to do so as part of its design and manufacture. Ever heard of the BIOS on a motherboard? That's the program permanently stored in Read Only Memory (ROM) that kicks off that whole process.\nExplainee: So it's a section of memory that tells the computer to read the memory?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: How do the instructions make it do something, though. How do we get from 1s and 0s becoming 6 through math to \"computer do this\"? How does the transition work?\nExplainer: The CPU is designed so that if you feed it certain \"numbers\" (the binary numbers are just for human usability - it's all just a series of electrical signals to the CPU) it will perform certain operations. Some of those operations expect additional numbers to be input as part of the instruction (usually, addresses of memory that contain the data). This is all just based on the complex physical arrangement of the transistors and other components within the CPU.  We have a lookup table of what numbers represent what instructions. It's called an **instruction set**. A popular one is x86, which you can read about [here](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/X86_instruction_listings#Original_8086\/8088_instructions).\n","396":"Explainer: The CPU is designed so that if you feed it certain \"numbers\" (the binary numbers are just for human usability - it's all just a series of electrical signals to the CPU) it will perform certain operations.

If the function is y=x\\*2, then inputting 4 will result in 8.  Programs are kinds of functions that (usually) take input, process it, and provide some kind of output. While computers only work with numbers, it's up to the program to interpret what that number means. They aren't always literally numbers that need to be displayed as text on a monitor.\n","397":"Explainer: The CPU is designed that way based on the arrangement of transistors and other components. Feed it a \"6\" and it will add the next two numbers. Feed it an \"8\" and it will store a number into memory. How exactly the transistors are arranged to do so is not even remotely ELI5, and the people who know it are paid millions for their expertise. If you want to see what it looks like inside a CPU you can watch [this video](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=Fxv3JoS1uY8).  The best I can do for ELI5: using transistors you can build logic gates. Using logic gates you can build logical functions. Transistors can also control which logic gates get activated based on a given input. You change which transistors are activated by sending signals to certain CPU pins in a certain order. The CPU is designed such that it would automatically read instructions from certain pins when powered on (which is where the BIOs\/boot process comes in). [Transistors to gates](https:\/\/www.cs.bu.edu\/~best\/courses\/modules\/Transistors2Gates\/).  If you have the basic building blocks to form transistors and\/or logic gates, you can build a fully functional computer, which is how people have simulated computers inside other software such as Minecraft or Factorio.\nExplainee: When you hear \"x input is converted to y output\", how is it converted\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: How does the computer take 8 and turn it into pixels\nExplainer: That process has already been explained to you in [another comment](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/explainlikeimfive\/comments\/gilmgj\/eli5_how_does_a_computer_learn_those_first_few\/fqgpkp3\/).  You seem to be under the assumption that every result calculated by the CPU is literally turned into pixels. That's clearly not the case, computers calculate all sorts of things for different purposes. The software needs to determine what to do with the result. In the case that the result needs to be displayed on screen, the software will tell the monitor how to do so (via the graphics processor).\n","398":"Explainee: ELI5:Why is the \"no true Scotsman\" considered a fallacy?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: I agree that this is a fallacy.

Are you saying the physics would be different?\nExplainer: As of now, the physics behind the expansion of the universe is purely theoretical, hence the opposing views on the matter. The physics that I have learnt on this topic. According the Hubble\u2019s theory on the matter, there is no center of the universe, rather we are all accelerating away at a speed, and no matter which vantage point in the universe you took,  whether on a planet in another galaxy or earth, you would see the same effect of galaxies both blue and red shifted\n","427":"Explainer: No, because if we were at the centre, it would be impossible for thing to be moving towards us. The universe is not static, and doesn\u2019t have a barrier for said galaxies to rebound off of. It is constantly accelerating expansion. For example if you drop a rock in a lake, the waves ripple outwards, not towards the rock. But if some galaxies, had a lighter mass, they would be moving faster and possibly overtake others as will happen with the Milky Way and andromeda\nExplainee: Sorry, this makes no sense to me.

Too much damage to cellular structures can cause the cell to destroy itself, as can too much damage to DNA. This is why bad sunburn causes skin to peel off, the epidermal and dermal layers received enough damage to decide they need to kill themselves for the greater good. However, if DNA is damaged in certain ways, it can lead to cancer. It's not that DNA can't be repaired at all, it's that it is the \"master program\" for the cell and can be modified in ways that make the cell do things that it isn't supposed to.   You can also receive too much damage to important cells like in organs. It's actually therapeutic in some situations, such as using radioactive iodine to destroy some of a large thyroid, but many organs are not good at regenerating so the damage can hamper their functionality.\nExplainee: Never really thought about it that way.

My answer is based on the mechanics of the vehicle and the fact that the driver is not the one who has to pay for any damage caused by gear skipping.","3":"I'm just curious, what made you think your post was good enough to share?","4":"The Earth's water is constantly being cycled through the environment, and it is not being created or destroyed, so it's not really being wasted, but rather being used inefficiently.","5":"Well, I think it's a matter of prioritizing and allocating resources. We have a global economy and political system that doesn't always prioritize the needs of the most vulnerable populations. ","6":"The organs are all kind of squished together in your abdominal cavity, and there are layers of tissue and fat in between. But there are also spaces and pouches, like the peritoneal cavity, where the organs float in a fluid called peritoneal fluid. There's also the retroperitoneal space, which is behind the abdominal organs. It's not exactly like a big empty space, but there are pockets and areas where things can move around.","7":"i feel like you're being a bit dramatic though, is that a fair thing to say?","8":"You don't have to give up on business, though, because there are many types of business jobs, and some of them are more flexible than others.","9":"That's a great question, and one that I think a lot of people have. Business can be a tough field for people who value self-expression, because there's often a lot of pressure to conform to certain norms or expectations. But it's not impossible. There are many successful businesspeople who are also artists, activists, or simply people who don't fit into traditional molds. If you're passionate about business, but also value self-expression, you might consider exploring fields like social entrepreneurship, where you can use business skills to make a positive impact on the world. Or, you could look into companies that prioritize diversity and inclusion, and see if they align with your values. Ultimately, it's about finding a path that works for you, and being true to yourself.","10":"A tachometer is a crucial tool for manual transmission cars. It shows the engine speed in revolutions per minute (RPM) and helps the driver know when to shift gears for optimal performance and fuel efficiency. If you don't know how to use it, you might be shifting gears too late or too early, which can waste fuel, wear out the engine, and even cause damage to the transmission.","11":"Other species do have a gestation period, and many of them are born after their mothers have already had multiple offspring. In fact, many species have a strategy called'reproductive delay' where the mother delays reproduction until she has gained enough experience and resources to raise her offspring successfully. This is often seen in species like elephants, where the mother may not give birth to her first calf until she is around 10-15 years old. So, it's not that humans are the only mammals that reach sexual maturity before being able to raise children, it's just that we have a unique combination of physical and social characteristics that allow us to delay reproduction until we are ready.","12":"You're still trying to argue that it's biological, when it's really about societal norms and values.","13":"You're still missing the point, the fact that humans don't have children immediately after reaching puberty is not just a biological fact, it's also a societal one. Humans have a certain level of self-control and societal norms that influence their behavior.","14":"You can\u2019t just take a question that\u2019s fundamentally flawed and then say that the answers you got were relevant. That\u2019s like taking a question that asks for the best way to fly a car and then saying that the answers you got about the best way to change a tire were relevant. The premise of your question is flawed, and the answers you got were irrelevant. And I\u2019m not going to let you steer this into a semantic debate about what you meant by your question.","15":"Ah, great question! One of the key arguments against Universal Income is that it will lead to inflation and businesses will raise prices to compensate. However, the reality is that Universal Income is designed to be a supplement to existing income, not a replacement for it. Most people will still have a job and earn a wage, so businesses won't see a significant decrease in demand. Additionally, Universal Income is typically funded through taxes or other means, which can actually help to stimulate economic growth and reduce inequality. So, while there may be some initial economic adjustments, the evidence suggests that Universal Income is unlikely to lead to significant price increases.","16":"Because materials with lower boiling points absorb less energy during the boiling process, resulting in less energy being available to generate power.","17":"And the reason we're not using steam is that it would require a lot of energy to heat it up to the point where it would be useful, so it's not as efficient.","18":"The pressure is a result of the molecules moving faster and bumping into each other, so if the molecules are moving faster, they will bump into the paddles more frequently and with more force, making the turbine spin faster.","19":"They're called the Noble Gases because they're chemically inert, meaning they don't react with other elements to form compounds. This is due to their full outer energy level, which makes them uninterested in sharing or accepting electrons from other atoms.","20":"Look at those pictures, follow the arrows, it\u2019s like a flowchart.","21":"Lead has a half-life of 22.3 billion years, so it is considered stable.","22":"So, there will never be a 19th periodic column? Or a 7th or 8th or 9th or 10th periodic row?","23":"We will probably never see a 9th row in our lifetimes.","24":"I'm not claiming to have firsthand empirical experience, I'm just pointing out the patterns and trends in the periodic table that suggest it's unlikely we'll find a 9th row. I'm relying on the historical data and the way the elements have been discovered so far to make my argument.","25":"The common cold is a virus that's made up of proteins and genetic material, and it's not a scam. It's a real virus that affects people's respiratory systems and causes symptoms like a runny nose, cough, and sore throat. During the off-season, the virus is still present in the environment, but it's not as active because the weather is cooler and there's less moisture in the air. This makes it harder for the virus to survive and replicate. However, when the weather warms up and gets more humid, the virus becomes more active and starts to spread again. This is why the common cold seems to come back during the winter months.","26":"What's going on with you? You seem really upset about this.","27":"I mean, they're probably the only ones who could make a pandemic out of a common cold, and a war out of a tweet. But seriously, it's like they're trying to make us believe that reality is just a scripted show.","28":"In 2020, there was a global pandemic of COVID-19 that overshadowed the flu season. Many people were staying home and wearing masks, which reduced the spread of the flu. Additionally, the flu vaccine was effective in preventing illness and reducing the severity of symptoms. ","29":"And you can't do that with Covid because it's airborne.","30":"This is the missing part of the dialogue","31":"so you're saying that coronaviruses and influenza viruses are so different that they're not comparable, but then you're asking me to consider them as comparable in terms of how they're transmitted and controlled?","32":"That's a nice fairy tale you're spinning there, but the real world doesn't work like that.  You can't just tell people to isolate themselves for two weeks and expect them to follow through, especially if they don't even know they're sick.  And even if they did, that wouldn't be enough to stop the spread of the virus.  And as for vaccination, a flu shot doesn't guarantee that you won't get the flu, it just reduces the severity of the symptoms.  And even if we could somehow magically get rid of the virus, it would likely just evolve into a new strain that would be resistant to our best efforts.  And as for herpes, that's a whole different can of worms.  It's a latent virus that can reactivate at any time, and there's no cure for it.  You're not even in the same ballpark with herpes and the flu.","33":"I'm not saying that we should doubt the findings of science or that they're not useful. I'm saying that if we assume a universe where observation is necessary for something to exist, then we need to consider how that affects our understanding of reality and our behavior within it.","34":"and that's a reason to question the absolute authority of science, rather than blindly trust it. Science is a tool, not a religion, and we should be careful not to confuse the two.","35":"Then why are you wasting your time trying to get a rise out of me, and why are you making a donation to a politician if you don't actually care about their policies?","36":"I'm kinda glad I learned about it from someone who knows what they're talking about, rather than trying to figure it out on my own when I'm already stressed about it.","37":"That's a good point, girls do have to deal with a lot more changes during puberty, like getting their periods and developing breasts, and it can be overwhelming. Boys, on the other hand, tend to go through puberty a bit more smoothly, but that doesn't mean it's not scary for them too.","38":"I think you might be experiencing a situation where your body is getting a lot of rest, but your brain isn't getting the rest it needs. This can happen if you're experiencing stress, anxiety, or other mental health issues that make it hard for you to relax and fall into a deep sleep.","39":"How long have you been feeling like this?","40":"It's because the water inside the sponge can turn to steam and create pressure that can burst the sponge, making it impossible to boil a sponge.","41":"You framed it as an insult from the start, so I'm not going to pretend like you're being neutral about it. If you really think it's not an insult, then you should be able to take it as a compliment, but you can't have it both ways.","42":"I was just trying to point out that your reaction was over the top and I was trying to keep it light hearted, but I guess that didn't work out.","43":null,"44":"The term 'Noble Gases' actually comes from the fact that they are chemically inert and unreactive. This is because their outer energy level is completely filled, which makes it difficult for them to form bonds with other elements.","45":"You are making a lot of claims about Oppenheimer and the Manhattan Project, but are you aware that Heisenberg's failure to check his math is well-documented and widely accepted by historians?","46":"I don't think that article is credible, it's just a sensationalized story about some guy who thinks he found a radioactive bomb. I've seen plenty of other articles that say the Nazis never even built a bomb, let alone tested it. What do you think about those articles?","47":"But they can use all sorts of tactics to discourage or prevent unionization efforts, like intimidating workers, refusing to bargain in good faith, or finding loopholes in labor laws to their advantage.","48":"That's not true. If a company is found to be interfering with the unionization process, they can be held accountable and face serious penalties.","49":"I think I see what you're getting at, but I'm not sure it's that simple...","50":"I guess it's a good thing I don't have to deal with earworms anymore, I've got a family of my own now.","51":"You're creating a kind of internal wiki or knowledge base for your team?","52":"The Earth is tilted on its axis at an angle of about 23.5 degrees, which means that the amount of sunlight that hits the Earth varies throughout the year. This tilt is the reason for the changing seasons. Additionally, the Earth's axis is not perpendicular to its orbital plane around the Sun, which means that the Northern Hemisphere receives more direct sunlight during part of the year, resulting in more land being exposed in the Northern Hemisphere.","53":"I've been trying to get my head around this for a bit, but it's hard to wrap my head around the idea of continents moving like that. Do you think it's something that will have a big impact on climate or something?","54":"Actually, the continents do move at a pretty slow pace, but over millions of years it adds up. For example, the African and Eurasian plates are moving apart at about 2-3 cm per year.","55":"An electrical wave is a flow of ions in the brain that can travel at up to 120 miles per hour. When a neuron fires, it sends a signal down the axon, which is like a long, thin cable, and releases neurotransmitters into the synapse. These neurotransmitters can then bind to receptors on other neurons, causing them to fire, and so on. This process is called synaptic transmission. The more neurons that fire, the more complex the signal becomes, and eventually, this complex signal reaches the prefrontal cortex, which is responsible for higher-order thinking and decision-making. This is where the magic happens, and we start to experience conscious thought.","56":"The thought experiment you're proposing is a form of dualism, which is the idea that the mind and the brain are two separate entities. The mind is often thought of as a non-physical substance that interacts with the brain, which is a physical entity. This idea is often criticized because it's difficult to explain how the non-physical mind interacts with the physical brain. It's also difficult to explain how the mind can exist independently of the brain, as you've described. The idea that there are two beings living in your body, one being the animalistic brain and the other being your thoughts and personality, is a common trope in science fiction, but it's not a well-supported scientific theory.","57":"For example, if someone has a tumor that's affecting the part of their brain that controls emotions, they might start acting in ways that are completely out of character for them. It's like their personality is changing because of the physical changes in their brain.","58":"But don't you think that skipping gears, even if it's safe, can still affect the engine's performance and lifespan in the long run? Maybe it's not a big deal now, but what about when you need to replace the engine or transmission?","59":"Well, the thing is, corporations are not in a direct competition with each other, they're in a competition with the generic version of their product. So, in this case, Walmart's Equate shampoo is actually competing with the generic version of Head and Shoulders, not with the actual Head and Shoulders product. The actual Head and Shoulders product is still a more expensive, name-brand product that's made by Procter & Gamble, and it's still widely available in stores. The cheaper version is just a generic version that's made by a different company, often under contract with Walmart. So, it's not like Walmart is directly copying Head and Shoulders, it's just offering a cheaper alternative that's made by a different company. And that's why Dave, or in this case Head and Shoulders, can't really do much about it.","60":"However, your question was asking for the biological reason that humans aren\u2019t ready for kids whilst animals are. The premise is false, and the reason the premise is false is due to social and not biological factors. As I\u2019ve said over and over and over.","61":"You're being disingenuous, and I'm not sure you're actually interested in having a genuine conversation about this. Every time I try to steer the conversation towards the biological aspects of the question, you seem to be trying to steer it back towards the social aspects, even though that's not what you initially asked about.","62":"And that's why the shadow will appear on the topside of the moon because the moon is in the earth's umbra, which is the darker inner shadow of the earth.","63":"Cheerleaders are sexualized in a more wholesome way, whereas strippers are seen as more overtly sexual, and thus stigmatized.","64":"Because it's often associated with exploitation, objectification, and commodification of women's bodies, which are seen as taboo in many societies.","65":null,"66":"The monitor has a grid of pixels, and it's essentially a big lookup table.

The final number you mentioned goes to a Digital to Analog Converter (DAC) that converts that 8bit number into an analog voltage. This voltage then goes to a transistor that controls the amount of current flowing through the LED or LCD in that subpixel. This current is what actually controls the brightness of the subpixel. The DAC has to be very accurate, because even a tiny difference in the analog voltage can make a big difference in the brightness of the subpixel. This is why the DAC has to be very precise, and is often one of the most expensive parts of a graphics card or monitor.","68":"Digital is based on 0s and 1s, whereas analog is based on a continuous range of values.","69":"Because in analog, the voltage at the Gate can be anywhere between the voltage required to completely turn off the transistor and the voltage required to completely turn it on, allowing for many intermediate levels of current flow.","70":"The explainee was going for a really big redirect.","71":"This is happening because the cells in your eye are not getting any information, and those cells in turn do not activate the brain in the same way, which is why it appears black.","72":"You see, when you look at the vantablack, your brain is actually creating the color black, rather than perceiving it, because it's not receiving enough information to make a different decision.","73":null,"74":"The fact that alchemy has been disproven and is not economically feasible, does it not undermine the idea of using it as a means to achieve political or social change?","75":"The flu can be a serious illness, especially for older adults, young children, and people with certain health conditions.

However, it's worth noting that the effectiveness of such a device would depend on various factors, including the sensitivity of the individuals experiencing it and the acoustic properties of the environment. It's also worth mentioning that there's no scientific evidence to support the idea that the 'Ghost Frequency' is the sole cause of paranormal experiences, and many alleged hauntings can be explained by natural phenomena or psychological factors.","79":"I don't see how that answers my question.

If H(x,x) is a program that takes a program and an input and returns the output of the program with the input, then P(P) would be the output of the program P with the input P, which is just P.  But how does that help us understand H(x,x)?","86":"You can talk to a pharmacist or nurse practitioner for general health advice, or look up information online. There are many reputable sources of information available. The CDC and the WHO are good places to start. They provide accurate and up-to-date information on a wide range of health topics. Additionally, you can also consult with a local health clinic or a community health center for guidance. They often have staff members who can provide health education and answer questions. Some people may also find it helpful to talk to a trusted friend or family member who has experience with the health issue they are concerned about. It's always a good idea to verify the accuracy of any information you find online by consulting multiple sources.","87":"It takes a lot of energy to move the animals to different fields and to transport them to the milking places and also to process the milk and send it to the stores.","88":"I'm sure it's different for small-scale farming, but the big industrial farms that produce most of the world's food can't just be compared to your family's farm.

The computer sends a series of instructions to the monitor, telling it which pixels to turn on and off, and for how long. This process is called rasterization. The result is that the computer takes the number 8 and turns it into a visual representation of the number 8, using a combination of pixels to create the image.","94":"I see your point, but that doesn't change the fact that the security questions are often ridiculously easy to answer.","95":"It's not about making it impossible for someone to be targeted, it's about making it so that the effort required to target someone is not worth it.","96":"I'm not going to sugarcoat it, going vegan is not going to single-handedly save the environment.

Just because we don't have all the answers yet doesn't mean that we can't explain things. We can propose theories and test them, and even if we don't have all the evidence yet, that doesn't mean that we can't make educated guesses. And as for consciousness, there are many scientific theories that attempt to explain it, such as integrated information theory and global workspace theory. They may not be proven yet, but they're still valid areas of research. And as for death, we can study the brain and the body's response to dying, and we can learn a lot from that.

While self-isolation and vaccination can be effective in controlling the spread of the flu, the reality is that the flu is a highly contagious virus that can spread quickly through communities. Even with self-isolation and vaccination, it's unlikely that we can completely eradicate the flu in a country with a large population. And as for herpes, it's a different story altogether - herpes is a latent virus that can remain dormant in the body for years, making it much harder to eradicate than the flu.

However, there are some exceptions, like in the case of certain types of radioactive decay where the emitted particles can interact with the nucleus in a way that can cause it to become unstable again, but this is relatively rare.","132":"That's right, supernovae have incredibly high temperatures and pressures at their cores, which allows for the fusion of elements up to iron.

One of the main reasons it can do this is because of the way the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) is written. The NLRA is a law that protects workers' right to form and join unions, but it also has some loopholes that companies can use to avoid unionization. For example, Walmart can argue that the pro-associate benefits group you're proposing isn't really a union, even if it has the same goals and structure. It's like a company can say, 'Oh, you're not really a union, you're just a group of friends who like to discuss benefits.'","148":"But if you hand them a paper that looks like a union proposal, and they know it's a union proposal, they can still deny it.

Additionally, girls often experience more emotional changes during puberty, like mood swings and self-consciousness about their bodies. It's a lot to handle, and it's not uncommon for girls to feel overwhelmed or anxious about these changes.","154":"It's not that they're specifically targeting you, it's just that you're more aware of the product because you've recently purchased it, which is a classic example of confirmation bias.

Essentially, time isn't a fixed thing like we think it is. It's more like a tool we use to measure how things change. But what if that's not the whole story? What if time isn't something that really exists at a fundamental level? That's where things get really interesting and we start talking about Planck time.","160":"Planck time is the time it takes for a photon to cross a Planck length. A Planck length is the length it would take light to travel in a time it would take for the energy of a Planck to be released. The energy of a Planck is the energy of a photon with a wavelength of 1.62 x 10^-35 meters. This is about the scale at which the laws of physics as we know them start to break down.","161":"That's a good point, and actually photons do have a wavelength, which is often thought of as a kind of'size', even though they don't have a definite boundary in the way that macroscopic objects do.","162":"The explainee says the song is \u201cShake It Off\u201d by Taylor Swift.","163":"I'll have to test this theory with the next song that gets stuck, but I'm a bit skeptical about its effectiveness.","164":"Your response here","165":"You are taking the position that you don't know and that it's possible that consciousness is a material phenomenon, but you're also making the claim that you can't see it because it's not accessible to us, but you're not providing any evidence for that claim.

Your work tomorrow is not going to magically make your question any more valid, and your lack of interest in continuing this conversation doesn't make you right.","171":"The relationship between squaring numbers and square roots is actually quite straightforward. When you square a number, you're essentially multiplying it by itself. For example, squaring 4 gives you 16 because 4 multiplied by 4 is 16. A square root, on the other hand, is the number that, when multiplied by itself, gives you the original number. So, the square root of 16 is 4 because 4 multiplied by 4 is 16. In the real world, this concept is used in many places, like in geometry and physics. For instance, the area of a square is found by squaring the length of its side, and the diagonal of a square can be found using square roots. It's a fundamental concept that helps us understand many things around us.","172":"The particles don't really 'lose' energy in the sense of classical mechanics, and they don't really 'bounce back' either. When a nucleus decays, the energy is released in a way that's not easily reversible. Think of it like a ball rolling down a hill - once it gets to the bottom, it doesn't just roll back up to the top on its own. The decay process is more like a transition to a lower energy state, and it's not something that can easily be reversed by external influences like other particles colliding with it.","173":"Yes, that's right, the extreme conditions in a supernova allow for the fusion of heavier elements, but in a normal star like our sun, the energy isn't sufficient to overcome the nuclear binding energy of elements heavier than iron.","174":null,"175":"I was trying to explain that H(x,x) is a special case where the program and the input are the same, but that's not what's going on with P(P).

The fact that it takes tens of thousands of years for the radiation to decay doesn't mean it's safe to eat seafood from Fukushima right now. The initial burst of radiation is what's concerning, not the long-term decay. And as for the difference between the A-bombs and Chernobyl, it's largely a matter of scale and containment. The A-bombs released a massive amount of radiation in a very short time, while Chernobyl released a smaller amount over a longer period.

The faster you go, the more time slows down for you relative to the outside universe. So even if you were to'slow down' your engines, from your perspective, it would take an extremely long time to slow down to a speed where you could safely land. And from the outside universe's perspective, you would be moving so fast that even if you did slow down, you would still be traveling at a speed that would make it impossible to stop in time to avoid crashing. It's a bit mind-bending, but that's why these types of spacecraft are so difficult to design and control.","195":"The atmosphere doesn't stratify by molecular mass because it's in a state of thermal equilibrium. The temperature and pressure conditions allow for the mixing of gases, so heavier gases like CO2 are dispersed throughout the atmosphere rather than accumulating at the bottom.","196":"Well, the concentration of CO2 is usually not high enough to cause immediate harm, even if it is at ground level. The atmosphere is mostly nitrogen and oxygen, and there's not enough CO2 to displace the oxygen to a dangerous level. It's more of a hazard if it accumulates in a confined space where there's limited ventilation, because then the CO2 can build up to high levels and displace the oxygen.","197":"Wait, but how do we understand words then?

As the Roman Empire began to decline, the aristocracy was looking for new ways to justify their power. They saw Christianity as a way to gain legitimacy. Also, the early Christian church was very successful in converting people in the Eastern provinces. It was especially successful in Egypt and Syria.

Full metal jacket ammo is often used in semi-automatic and automatic weapons because it allows for more reliable feeding and ejection of the casing. It's also less likely to damage the weapon's barrel over time. Normal ammo, on the other hand, is designed to expand on impact, which can cause more damage to the target but also makes it more likely to jam in the weapon.","218":"And yeah, I was thinking about that when I read the article about the Army wanting to switch to a new round that\u2019s more effective against armor.","219":"I've heard the same thing, and that's why I prefer the green-tip over the HP round.

However, this is extremely unlikely and has not been observed in any experiments. As for the noble gases, they do have radioactive isotopes that can decay into other elements, but these isotopes are very rare and have relatively short half-lives.

It's normal to have questions and it's okay to ask.","250":"That's right, it would be upside down, because from the perspective of an observer in space, the plane is always pointing towards the earth, so if you were looking at it from space, it would look like it's upside down.","251":"And if you increase FICA taxes, you're also going to be increasing the amount of money that employees are paying out of pocket, which would offset the benefits of the employer paying a portion of FICA taxes.","252":"That's a fair point, but the government would have to replace the private insurance middlemen with its own bureaucracy, which is also inefficient and would add costs, as well as the fact that government programs often have a lot of 'hidden' costs that are not immediately apparent, such as the costs of dealing with fraud, etc.","253":"Non-dividend shares are like art because their value is subjective and determined by what buyers are willing to pay. Unlike wholesalers, where you have partial ownership of material goods and competition between companies, non-dividend shares don't have intrinsic value and their value is influenced by the company buying back shares during recessions.","254":"You are still dodging the issue. Even if you do market research, you still have to take the risk that people don't want to buy the apples. You can't guarantee that you'll sell them at a profit. And even if you do sell them, you may not be able to sell them at the price you want. And even if you do sell them at the price you want, you still have to deal with the hassle of finding buyers, transporting the apples, and so on. It's a lot of work just to make a profit on something that's inherently perishable.","255":"Alcoholism is a disease because it affects the brain's reward system and changes the way it functions. When you drink, it releases dopamine, which makes you feel good. But with repeated use, the brain adapts by changing the way it produces and responds to dopamine. This can lead to cravings and withdrawal symptoms when you try to stop drinking. It's not just about willpower or making bad choices; it's a complex biological process that can be difficult to overcome.","256":"You're missing the point. I'm saying that addiction is a disease process, regardless of the substance or behavior. It's the reliance on something you don't need to function that's the disease state.","257":"The reason the Nazi Party is considered to be far-right is that it combined authoritarianism with a strong emphasis on nationalism, militarism, and anti-communism, which are all characteristic of the far-right. Additionally, the Nazi Party's ideology was rooted in a rejection of liberal democracy and the Enlightenment values of reason, tolerance, and individual rights, which are also core principles of the far-right. The fact that the Nazi Party was a centralised, regulated and authoritarian state doesn't necessarily mean it's not far-right, because authoritarianism can take many forms and can be combined with different ideologies. Does that clarify things?","258":"You're not fooling anyone with your fake outrage and condescending tone. You're just trying to deflect from the fact that your question was poorly researched and not a genuine inquiry. ","259":"I'm not sure, but it's possible that societal expectations and norms around masculinity play a role in discouraging flamboyant behavior in heterosexual males.","260":"I think the emotional connections and culture surrounding a school can be a bit confusing. It's like people are putting a value on the institution itself, but then you're also talking about the value of the relationships and experiences that happen within it. I'm not sure if that's a fair way to look at it.","261":"Ah, I think I see what you\u2019re getting at now. The emotional connections and culture surrounding the school can definitely make it feel like a community, which can make people want to invest time and effort into it. It\u2019s almost like the school becomes an extension of their personal relationships and experiences, making it harder to separate the two.","262":"That's a great point, but isn't that just a form of inflation, albeit one controlled by the government?","263":"The concept of a code implies a level of intentionality and purpose that is not present in the chemical reactions that occur in DNA.","264":"Going vegan can have a significant impact on the environment by reducing the amount of land needed for animal agriculture, conserving water, and decreasing greenhouse gas emissions. ","265":"A non-dividend share is a stock that doesn't pay out dividends to its shareholders. It's like owning a part of a company that's keeping its profits to itself. Some people buy non-dividend shares because they believe the company will grow and increase in value over time, and they can sell their shares for a higher price later on.","266":"I think that's where the prospect of dividends comes in. A stock can increase in value not just because the company is worth more, but also because the company is expected to return more to its shareholders in the future. If you own a stock that doesn't pay dividends, it's still worth something because you can sell it for a higher price, but if you own a stock that pays dividends, it's worth more because you get a regular stream of income from it. Does that make sense?","267":"The inherent value of a stock, even if it doesn't return dividends, lies in the potential for future growth or appreciation in value, as well as the potential for the company to be acquired or go public, thereby increasing the value of the stock.","268":"So, it's more about the potential for the company to grow and increase in value, rather than just the dividends you receive.","269":"The mechanism for the development into more and more complex programs is thought to be a combination of chemical reactions and natural selection.","270":"I consider it highly unlikely that I'm wrong, but I'm open to being convinced otherwise.","271":"The explain club is for people who need help understanding the rules of the community.","272":"The whole point of this conversation is to help you understand why the question was removed, not to convince you that the system is perfect or that the person is guilty.","273":"I'd like to remind you that you're here to learn about the concept of astute, not to discuss the merits of the justice system.","274":"So, if you're paying yourself a salary, that's just an expense, right? ","275":"You're thinking about it from a business perspective, but I'm talking about accounting rules. Your business expenses are a deduction from your revenue, which is your profit, so if you pay yourself, it's a deduction from your revenue. But that's not the same as the money being your profit. Think of it like a bank account. You can transfer money from your business account to your personal account, but that doesn't mean the money in your personal account is part of your business's revenue. Does that make sense?","276":"...","277":"But I think it's worth noting that you're using the term 'engine braking' incorrectly.","278":"The ARM architecture is more power-efficient, which is a key factor in its cooling efficiency. ARM processors typically consume less power than x86 processors, especially when idle. This is because ARM processors are designed to be more power-aware and can dynamically adjust their clock speed and voltage to minimize power consumption. Additionally, ARM processors often use a different design philosophy, such as using a lower voltage and a simpler instruction set, which also contributes to their power efficiency.","279":"Talking about wages can be seen as rude because it can be perceived as a challenge to the power dynamics in a workplace. When you discuss your salary, you're potentially implying that you're not being paid fairly, which can be uncomfortable for managers who want to pay employees as little as possible. In some workplaces, especially those with a strong union presence, salaries are more standardized and transparent, which can reduce the stigma around discussing wages.","280":"I've worked in a few places like that too, but I've also worked in places where the pay was clearly not equitable and it was super hard to find out what the other people were making. I think it's because those places were really small or family-owned businesses.","281":"I can imagine. I've seen some pretty rough places in my time too. It's hard to believe people can get away with treating workers like that. Do you think it's because they know they can find someone else to do the job for the minimum wage?","282":"I recommend checking out the National Labor Relations Board website, it has a lot of information about workers' rights and how to navigate employment situations.","283":"Sexual urges are a complex process that involves both physical and psychological components. When it comes to genitalia amputees, the process of sexual urges is still not fully understood. However, research suggests that the removal of genitalia can reduce or eliminate sexual urges in some individuals. This is because the genitalia play a role in the production of testosterone, which is a hormone that contributes to sexual desire. However, it's not just the physical aspect that drives sexual urges. The brain also plays a significant role, and the removal of genitalia does not necessarily eliminate the brain's ability to produce sexual thoughts or desires. In some cases, individuals may still experience sexual urges even after genitalia amputee, due to the brain's ability to adapt and compensate for the loss. Additionally, psychological factors such as trauma, stress, and past experiences can also contribute to sexual urges. So, it's not a simple matter of just removing the genitalia to eliminate sexual urges. It's a complex interplay of physical and psychological factors that need to be considered.","284":"Yes, it's the testicles that produce testosterone which is responsible for sexual urges and desires.","285":"You're welcome! I'm glad I could share some interesting information with you. I've also been reading about the history of eunuchs in different cultures and it's quite fascinating. I think it's also worth noting that eunuchs were not just castrated men, but also women and even children in some cases. The practice of castration was used for various purposes, including as a form of punishment, to create a class of servants or officials, and even as a way to preserve the bodies of important people for burial. It's a complex and multifaceted topic, but I think it's worth exploring further.","286":"That's actually a great point. People did use other metals like silver and copper for coins, but gold was a very popular choice because it's durable, doesn't corrode easily, and has a high value-to-weight ratio. It's also relatively easy to work with and can be melted down to make new coins or other objects. So, gold was a convenient and practical choice for making coins, which is why it became a widely accepted form of currency.","287":"So how did they deal with it before?","288":"I'm actually a bit of both, I've been dabbling in chemistry experiments at home and I'm really interested in learning more about the theoretical aspects of it.","289":"You can't just harvest methane from the melting arctic because it's not like it's sitting there waiting for you, it's a gas that seeps out of the ground and into the atmosphere, and even if you could somehow capture it, it's not like it's a simple problem to solve, it's a massive scale issue that requires a huge infrastructure overhaul.","290":"You're just spouting hypotheticals and ignoring the actual feasibility and consequences of your ideas, aren't you? You're not actually suggesting that we should cover millions of square miles of arctic tundra with vacuum tubes, are you? That's not a real plan, that's just a vague notion you're throwing out there to sound smart, isn't it?","291":"Your proposed solution doesn't address the scale of the problem. If it's leaking through every single square foot of land, a grid of vacuum tubs wouldn't be enough to capture it all. You're still not grasping the sheer magnitude of the issue.","292":"The term 'Nazi' is often used as a pejorative to describe any form of authoritarian, nationalist, or racist ideology, regardless of its actual economic or political stance. This is similar to how the term 'fascist' is used to describe any form of authoritarian or nationalist ideology. However, technically speaking, Nazism is a form of socialism because it seeks to control the means of production and distribution of goods and services, and to regulate the economy in the name of the state. But, the Nazi Party's ideology is also deeply rooted in racism and nationalism, which are characteristics that are typically associated with the far-right. So, while the term 'Nazi' may seem contradictory, it is actually a reflection of the complex and multifaceted nature of the Nazi Party's ideology.","293":"If the left and right axis is based on economy (regulation vs. open market) then Nazis would be left of centre wouldn't they?","294":"But the left-right axis is a simplification of many complex ideologies and economic systems. It's a two-dimensional model that doesn't capture the nuances of, for example, fascist and nationalist ideologies, which often combine elements of both left and right wing ideologies in complex ways.","295":"What does it mean to be called the Ghost Frequency?","296":"Yes, theoretically, you can create a haunted house by using a device that emits 18.9 Hz frequency. However, it's worth noting that the actual effect would depend on the sensitivity of the people experiencing it and the environment they are in.","297":"You can't just dump radioactive waste into the ocean because it's not a natural process and it would have severe environmental and health impacts. For example, the waste would spread out over a large area, contaminating marine life and potentially affecting the entire food chain. Also, the waste would not just disappear, it would still be there, slowly releasing radiation into the environment for thousands of years.","298":"You're right, but what about the cost of building and maintaining a facility on land compared to the cost of transporting the waste to the ocean?","299":"Well, the main reason is that the US doesn't have a comprehensive national policy on nuclear waste storage. As a result, each state is left to figure out its own solution, which leads to a lot of political wrangling and finger-pointing. And, yes, earthquakes are a major consideration in choosing a location for a nuclear waste storage facility. In fact, one of the most promising locations for a US nuclear waste storage facility is Yucca Mountain in Nevada, which was chosen in part because of its geology, which is very stable and resistant to earthquakes.","300":"You got this!","301":"The 'no true Scotsman' fallacy occurs when someone defines a group or category in a way that makes it impossible for anyone outside of that group to meet the criteria. It is a form of circular reasoning, where the person is essentially saying that no one outside of their group can be a true member of that group, because they don't meet the criteria that the person has defined for that group.","302":"They are using a fallacy called the 'appeal to authority' when they say that their favorite director is superior to others.","303":"You think the mods didn't like the question, huh?","304":"I'm not trying to dismiss your perspective, I'm trying to explain the reasoning behind the removal, but you're not giving me any room to do so.","305":"I'm just trying to help you understand the process, but you're not making it easy for me to do so.","306":"The concept of anti-matter and anti-gravity is a bit more complex than you might think. In a nutshell, anti-matter is a type of matter that has the same mass as regular matter, but opposite charges. When regular matter and anti-matter meet, they annihilate each other. As for anti-gravity, it's not exactly the same as gravity, but it's related. Anti-gravity refers to a hypothetical force that would cause objects to move away from each other, rather than attracting them. It's not a proven concept yet, but some theories suggest that it could be related to dark energy, which is a type of energy that's thought to be responsible for the accelerating expansion of the universe. ","307":"I was going to say that but you beat me to it. It seems like you are trying to describe a 4D object and not a tesseract. I think you might be confusing the concept of a tesseract with a 4D object. You can call it a 4D object but it's not the same thing as a tesseract.","308":"I think I see what you mean. I was looking at a 2D projection of the Tesseract, which can make it harder to see the 8 cubes. The perspective can create a 3D illusion that makes it seem like there are only 3 cubes.","309":"So, it seems like you're saying that you're just noticing the ads more now that you have the product, rather than the product being advertised everywhere before you bought it?","310":"You're asking for the method behind their action, but your question is based on the assumption that they're using a specific product, which is what you're looking for.","311":"The minimum age requirement is because the Constitution requires the president to be at least 35 years old, which is in Article II, Section 1. This is to ensure the president has some level of life experience and maturity before taking on the highest office in the land.","312":"That's not true, you can vote for anyone you want, including a candidate who is not elderly.","313":"The point is that you have the freedom to choose who you vote for, even if it's not one of the two major parties.","314":"The current judicial system is not perfect, but it has a certain level of transparency and accountability. Narcoanalysis tests, on the other hand, are often used in coercive environments and can be prone to false positives or manipulated results. This raises concerns about the reliability and fairness of the results, which can undermine the integrity of the trial.","315":"Coins were also tampered with by clipping, where pieces of the coin were removed.","316":"This is a response to the explainee's question about why it's socially okay for a white person to tan but not for a non-white person to lighten their skin. I think it's because historically, white skin has been the beauty standard, and tanning is seen as a way to get closer to that ideal. Meanwhile, dark skin has been stigmatized, and lightening it is seen as a way to 'improve' it. It's a form of internalized racism, where people of color feel like their natural skin tone is inferior and try to change it to fit societal beauty standards. It's also worth noting that the dangers of skin cancer and UV radiation are often downplayed or ignored when it comes to white people, which is a big part of why tanning is socially acceptable for them. ","317":null,"318":"Your explanation is still unclear to me. It seems like you're saying that it's only unhealthy to become paler if you're doing it on purpose, but that's not really a distinction I understand. Can you clarify why you think it's okay to avoid the sun and become paler naturally, but not to use a spray tan to achieve the same result?","319":"But using sun block or clothes to cover your face is a different story. It's a choice people make to protect themselves from the sun's harmful effects, not to avoid it altogether. It's still getting some sunlight, just in a controlled manner.","320":"You're not sure how this is relevant? You just said that preventing tanning vs actively lightening one's skin is completely irrelevant, but now you're talking about the risk of tanning and skin lightening. What's the point of even having this conversation?","321":"I don't think you're considering the distinction between blocking UV rays and avoiding the sun altogether. If you're still getting a tan with clothing on, it's likely because the clothing isn't blocking all UV rays, or because you're still getting some indirect sunlight. And as for the risks, I was trying to make a point about the difference between passive and active skin lightening, not about the risks of tanning itself.","322":"I think I see where you're going with this, but I still don't think it's relevant to the conversation at hand.","323":"You're just playing dumb, aren't you? Don't pretend like you don't know what I'm talking about. You're just stalling for time.","324":"That's a fair point, but I'm trying to say that the distinction between avoiding tanning and actively trying to lighten your skin isn't necessarily about the effectiveness of methods, but more about the intention behind them. Even if you're just trying to avoid getting too dark, you're still actively trying to change your skin's color, which is what I'm trying to get at.","325":"Are you even paying attention? You're still not getting my point, and you're just going to dismiss it with a laugh? That's not how this conversation works.","326":"Ah, that's a clever observation, but actually, it's neither. The term 'noble' in chemistry comes from the fact that these gases are chemically inert, meaning they don't readily react with other elements to form compounds. They're like the introverts of the periodic table, not because they're aristocratic or Buddhist, but because they're just not that interested in interacting with others.","327":"Do you think it's possible that new technology could allow for the creation of elements that would make a 9th row possible?","328":"I've spent the last 20 years studying the properties of superheavy elements and I've written multiple papers on the subject. I've also had the chance to work with some of the top researchers in the field. I'm not just speculating, I have a deep understanding of the underlying physics and chemistry.","329":"I think we're getting ahead of ourselves here. We're already at a point where we're talking about creating elements that are potentially unobservable. The 7th row elements were created in the lab, but that's because we had a good understanding of the physics behind them. We don't even know if elements beyond the 9th row are stable, let alone observable.","330":"No, we have evidence suggesting that we are not at the center of the universe.","331":"That's not what I'm saying. The theory of dark energy is a different explanation for the observation of accelerating expansion, and it doesn't necessarily contradict the view that we are at the center of the universe.","332":"Yes, I am saying that if we were at the centre of the universe, the physics would be different, specifically in terms of the motion of galaxies and the effects of gravity on their movement.","333":"I understand your point but it's still worth noting that the subreddits you mentioned are quite active and might have some relevant information on your issue, so you could try posting there and see what people have to say.","334":"Your question is a good example of a common phenomenon in neuroscience, but it would be better suited to a sub like r\/neuroscience or r\/AskScience.","335":"I'm not sure I understand what you mean by 'all word based', can you give an example of how you would describe a camshaft?","336":"And you were surprised that you were able to create that image, weren't you?","337":null,"338":"I completely understand.

It's a natural part of being a woman, and it happens every month when her body is getting ready for a potential pregnancy. Think of it like a mini-cleaning cycle for the uterus. When a woman gets pregnant, her body doesn't do this anymore, because the embryo is growing inside her uterus.","340":"Some boys also get really hairy, but that's not always the case either.","341":"That's a great question. Puberty for girls can be more complicated because their bodies have to prepare for pregnancy. This means that their reproductive system has to mature faster and there are a lot of hormonal changes happening. Boys on the other hand don't have to prepare for pregnancy, so their bodies change more slowly and there are fewer hormonal changes. It's not that boys don't go through changes, but they are generally less dramatic and less complex than the changes girls experience.","342":"Well, a computer doesn't actually 'learn' those first few steps of computing in the way that a human does. It's more that we set it up to do certain things and it follows those rules, but it can also do other things that we didn't explicitly tell it to do. It's kind of like a recipe book - we can give it a recipe and it will follow the steps, but we can also add new recipes or modify the existing ones in various ways.","343":"No, it's not that simple, because the voltage level can also be used to control the circuit, not just to decide whether it's on or off.","344":null,"345":"I'm glad I could provide you with some perspective on the value of upvotes.","346":"When you smash your finger in cold weather, the cold causes the blood vessels to constrict, which reduces blood flow to the injured area, making the pain more intense.","347":"Wouldn't that restrict blood flow to your fingers?

They're creating a generation of kids who feel like they deserve everything they want, when in reality, they don't need it all. It's a classic case of the 'Keeping Up with the Joneses' phenomenon, where parents are trying to keep up with the latest trends and status symbols, and their kids are absorbing all of it. It's a recipe for disaster when these kids grow up and have to navigate the harsh realities of adulthood.","352":"Well, the shares give you a claim on a percentage of the company's assets, so even if the company doesn't pay dividends, you still own a piece of the business and can potentially benefit if the company is sold or liquidated.","353":"But that's not how it works. If the company doesn't pay dividends, the value of the stock doesn't go up. If you reinvest your dividends, you're not gaining more stock, you're just buying more stock with the money that you could have otherwise used to buy more stock at the market price. That's not a good deal, and it's not a way to'reinvest' your dividends.","354":"It's not that simple, because the company's profits can be reinvested in different ways, like expanding the business or paying off debt, rather than directly issuing more shares, so the value of your existing shares isn't necessarily increased by not taking dividends.","355":"I'm not sure I follow your analogy between Mlm and IPO. Can you explain that further?","356":"You didn't address the fact that wholesalers sell to a limited number of retailers, who in turn sell to consumers, whereas in an MLM, the sales are directly to the end consumer, with no intermediary. This lack of intermediaries means that the risk of unsold product is greatly reduced, as the consumer is the final buyer.","357":"You can't just compare apples to oranges, that's not how it works. You can't compare a company's stock to a physical product like apples. They're two completely different things.","358":"But that's not true for stocks or yen, which can be difficult to sell or use if there's no demand for them. And even if you do manage to sell them, you may not get a good price, which can leave you with a loss. So, in that sense, the analogy between apples and investments is not a good one.","359":"Ah, the common cold is a virus, and viruses are just pieces of genetic material that can infect living cells. When we say the common cold is 'in the off-season', we mean that the virus is still present in the environment, but it's not actively infecting people as much because there are fewer people around to spread it to. It's like a big game of tag - the virus is always there, waiting for someone to tag it, but when it's not actively being spread, it's not as 'alive' as it is during the peak season.","360":null,"361":"I'm not saying it's the most secure thing in the world, but it's probably more secure than it seems at first glance.

And even if someone does get the answer right, they still need to get past the 2-factor authentication, which is usually the real hurdle. So, it's not like it's a foolproof system, but it's not as weak as it seems either.","362":"But isn't that just a matter of cost, then? If the general public had access to that kind of information, you'd likely see a lot more people taking an interest in others, which would increase the cost of maintaining security for those people who do take an interest.","363":"I think it's a bad idea to rely on the difficulty of an attack as a security model, it's better to have actual security measures in place.","364":"Your argument is based on a false dichotomy, doctors are not all wrong or all right, it's a complex issue with varying degrees of correctness.","365":"Harvey Weinstein was convicted of rape and sexual assault.

Ultimately, the jury decided that Weinstein's actions were not justified and that he had committed the crimes for which he was accused. The 23-year sentence was handed down by the judge as a result of the jury's verdict.","366":"I'm not trying to be dismissive, but I think we've been having a circular conversation where we're rehashing the same points without really moving forward.

He's not qualified to speak on the existence or non-existence of a higher power, and you're not qualified to speak on anything, for that matter.","384":"I think it's a lack of imagination and a failure to consider alternative explanations that might be supported by evidence, but we'll never know because you've closed your mind to the possibility of anything other than a material explanation.","385":"So, you're saying that increasing FICA taxes would actually increase the burden on employers, not just employees?","386":"The no true Scotsman fallacy is a type of fallacy where someone argues that a group or category cannot contain a certain trait or behavior, by defining the group or category in such a way that the trait or behavior is excluded. This is often done by saying that the group or category is not truly representative of the group, or that the person in question is not a 'true' member of the group.","387":"I think this is a misinterpretation of the actual issue. The problem is not that people are using a personal definition that makes sense to them, but that they are trying to use that definition to justify an unjustifiable claim. The No True Scotsman fallacy is not about people having different ideas about what X stands for, but about people trying to shift the goalposts or change the subject when their claim is challenged. That's what makes it a fallacy, not the fact that people have different personal definitions.","388":"You're saying that because you're interested in the theory of the fallacy, you're not really concerned with whether people are actually committing the fallacy or not?","389":"The explainee asks a question that prompts the explainer to continue the analogy and provide a new explanation for how 'Hidden City' travel affects airlines.","390":"But that analogy breaks down because the restaurant is serving a product that you've paid for, and they're just trying to minimize waste.  With an airline, you're paying for a service, and the empty seat is part of that service.  If you don't use it, they can't deliver the full service you paid for, so they can't charge the same price for it.","391":"Now, in the context of the conversation, it seems like the explainee is arguing that if they buy a seat at market value, the airline shouldn't care what they do with it. They're making a point about the airline's profit and the concept of market value. The explainee is also bringing up the example of a two-hop flight and the potential for additional overhead costs. The explainee seems to be trying to understand the airline's perspective and the economics behind their operations.","392":"Yes, but that's just it, Lufthansa is trying to position itself as a premium airline, and it's using that to charge a premium for its seats. It's not necessarily the quality of the service that's driving the revenue, but the fact that people are willing to pay more for the perceived prestige of flying with Lufthansa. And that's what's really driving the airline's profits.","393":"So you're using your donations as a form of emotional blackmail to get me to stop responding? That's not a very convincing or respectful argument.","394":"You could think of it as a set of instructions that the computer is born with, that tell it how to find the instructions that tell it what to do.","395":"How do you mean 'ultimately it's hardwired to do so as part of its design and manufacture'?","396":"The CPU has a series of interconnected components that process the electrical signals. These components are called gates, and they perform logical operations like AND, OR, and NOT. The gates are connected in a specific way to form a circuit, which is essentially a digital circuit that performs a specific operation. The circuit is designed to take the input signals and produce an output signal that corresponds to the desired operation. For example, if the input signal is 1 and the gate is an AND gate, the output signal will be 0. If the input signal is 0 and the gate is an AND gate, the output signal will be 0. The CPU uses these digital circuits to perform the operations specified by the instruction set.","397":"It's a process of transistors being turned on and off","398":"The No True Scotsman fallacy is a formal fallacy that occurs when someone redefines a group or category to exclude a particular example that challenges their argument.","399":"The explainee responds by questioning the relevance of the fallacy in real life, and suggesting that it might be too simplistic to assume that people's arguments are always as clear-cut as the example you provided.","400":"You're not making a case that the No True Scotsman fallacy is not real, you're making a case that it's rarely used in good faith.","401":"If the cases that get accused of the fallacy are similar to your example, then it's possible that the accusations are also fallacious.","402":"Exactly, because I've been trying to get you to see the distinction between the theory and the application of the fallacy. The theory is about the structure of an argument, not about whether people are actually using it correctly or not.","403":"I think what I'm trying to get at is that our brains are wired to take electrical signals and turn them into sensations and thoughts, but the actual process of how that happens is still not fully understood.","404":"You're saying that you can remember the details of an object, but when you try to imagine it, you don't get any visual image. Is that correct?","405":"That's great that you're trying to visualize! Can you try to go back to the scene and see if you can add more details or keep the story going?","406":"You should probably talk to a parent or a trusted adult about this. They can give you more information and help you understand what's going to happen. It's normal to be scared, but there's nothing to be ashamed of.","407":"This is a sentence.","408":"The American colonies had a relatively small population, and the diseases that spread through the population were less severe than those in Africa, which had a much larger population and a history of disease transmission.","409":"That's right. Vaccines have made a huge difference in the fight against these diseases. And it's a big part of why these diseases are not as deadly as they used to be.","410":"i mean, using a lot of var declarations like var a, var b, var c etc. is just sloppy code. it's like you're not even trying.","411":"The flu season is a bit like a big wave that comes and goes. It's not a single event, but rather a period of time when the virus is more active and people are more likely to get sick. In 2020, the wave of the flu season was much smaller than usual, likely due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the measures people took to prevent the spread of the virus. ","412":"The flu virus has a lipid envelope which makes it sensitive to temperature and humidity. In cold weather, the virus is more stable and can survive on surfaces for longer periods of time, making it easier for it to spread when people touch the same surfaces. The virus also prefers to infect cells in the respiratory tract, which is more efficient in the cold dry air of winter. The combination of these factors makes winter the optimal time for the flu virus to spread.","413":"When you're experiencing emotional stress, your body releases stress hormones like cortisol and adrenaline. These hormones can affect your digestive system and appetite, making you feel sick to your stomach and lose your appetite.","414":"I'm glad I can be an inspiration to you and others, it's not often I get to be the one helping others, I'm usually the one needing help, so this is nice.","415":"I'm so grateful to have you all here too, and I'm glad this thread is helping so many people. It's a reminder that we're not alone in this, and that there are people who care and want to help.","416":"A von Neumann machine is a machine that can replicate itself by first building a body and 'downloading' the blueprint for that body into it allowing the new body to then replicate again.","417":"The attack on the Saudi oil facilities is having a big effect on the price of oil because it's a major producer and exporter of oil. When the production is disrupted, it affects the global supply and demand, leading to a price increase. The currencies of countries that rely heavily on oil exports, like Saudi Arabia, also get affected because they earn a lot of money from oil sales.","418":"I think you're right, but I don't see it being implemented as a replacement, but rather as a supplement.","419":"Thank you again!","420":"So, under the National Labor Relations Act, Walmart can't interfere with employees' right to organize and bargain collectively. However, if a majority of employees sign a petition to unionize, Walmart can contest the certification of the union if it believes the union didn't follow the proper procedures for organizing. It's a complex process, and the outcome depends on various factors, including the specific circumstances of the unionization effort and the decisions made by the National Labor Relations Board.","421":"If you handed them a union proposal, they would deny it and say it's a union proposal, even if you call it a pro-associate benefits group. They would not accept it as anything else.","422":"The odds of not doing the 1\/100 thing is 99\/100. If you do it 100 times, you're guaranteed to not get the 1\/100 odds at least once. It's like flipping a coin, if you flip it 100 times, you will get at least one head. In your case, the 1\/100 odds are like getting a tail, and the 99\/100 odds are like getting a head. You will get at least one tail in 100 flips, so you will not get the 1\/100 odds at least once.","423":"Alcoholism is a disease because it's a chronic brain disorder that affects a person's reward system, making them more likely to crave and consume alcohol even when it's causing harm to their health and relationships. It's not something you can just'snap out of' or control with willpower alone.","424":"answer","425":"We have done extensive observations and studies, and the evidence points to the fact that the universe is homogeneous and isotropic on large scales, meaning it looks the same in all directions and has the same properties everywhere. This suggests that we are not privileged to be at the center of the universe. In fact, the cosmic microwave background radiation, which is the leftover heat from the Big Bang, is uniform in all directions, which further supports the idea that we are not at the center of the universe.","426":"The theory I was explaining is a different one, where we are at the center of the universe and all galaxies are accelerating towards us.","427":"The universe would be static, and we'd be at the center, which is not supported by any evidence.","428":"Yes, men who get genitalia amputees would still have sexual urges because the brain is a major part of sexual function and is not directly affected by the removal of genitalia. It's a complex interplay between hormones, emotions, and thoughts that determines sexual desire, and simply removing the source of testosterone wouldn't eliminate the urge entirely. It would likely be reduced, but not eliminated.","429":"and not just the balls, but the testicles specifically, because it's the testicles that produce the testosterone that's responsible for the sexual urges and desires.","430":"It's actually a pretty interesting topic and I think I might have some more information on it if you'd like to hear it.","431":"You seem to think just because someone comments something, I take it as truth. The answer, even if my question has a false premise, is STILL biological. The entire situation is biological. We're talking about ovulation and human behavior. You just keep picking new points to try tripping me up on.","432":"You seem to be misunderstanding the point I'm trying to make, which is that the delay in human reproduction is not primarily driven by biological factors. The majority of people who responded to your question provided social or cultural explanations, rather than biological ones. You're still clinging to the idea that it's biological, even though that's not what the evidence suggests.","433":"I've already explained why the premise is false, and I've given you multiple examples of how the discussion got steered away from biological answers. If you're still not convinced, I'm happy to provide more evidence and clarify my points. However, I'm not going to engage in a debate about semantics and how you view the question. That's not relevant to the topic at hand.","434":"That's a common misconception about time and the 4th dimension. In special relativity, time is just another dimension, like the three spatial dimensions. The key difference is that time is not static, it's dynamic. Objects in the 4th dimension are not static, they move through time just like objects in the 3 spatial dimensions move through space.","435":"Squaring numbers is like measuring the area of a square, and square roots are like finding the length of one side of that square.","436":"Exactly, and that's what makes it so interesting.","437":"Yes, it's a bit of a simplistic view, but it's a good starting point.

By keeping an eye on the RPM, you can find the sweet spot where the engine is running smoothly and efficiently, which can lead to better fuel economy and a longer engine life.","1":"I'm not sure what you're saying about my instructor, but I've been told by multiple sources that skipping gears can be problematic, so I'm still unsure about what's best practice.","2":null,"3":"What made you think your post was worth sharing?","4":"You're right, our priorities are skewed. We're investing in military aid over humanitarian aid, and that's a critical issue. Building infrastructure for water access in conflict zones would require a significant shift in our foreign policy and resource allocation.","5":"I think it's a matter of how we, as a global community, value and distribute resources, often prioritizing short-term gains over long-term sustainability and the well-being of marginalized communities.","6":"The abdominal cavity is a complex, three-dimensional space that's home to many organs, like the stomach, small intestine, and liver. These organs are suspended in a network of connective tissue and surrounded by layers of fat, which helps to cushion and support them. But it's not just a matter of organs being packed tightly together \u2013 there are also areas where they're loosely attached or floating in a fluid-filled space, like the peritoneal cavity. This fluid, called peritoneal fluid, helps to reduce friction and allow the organs to move slightly as you breathe or move around. It's a bit like a delicate balance of space and structure, with each organ playing its own role in the overall system.","7":"I think what you're getting at is that the experience of being a woman can be really unpredictable and painful, and that's a valid perspective.","8":"You don't have to choose between self-expression and a career in business, because there are many ways to express yourself in business. For instance, you could be a creative consultant, a marketing specialist, or even a business owner in a field that aligns with your values and passions. The key is to find a business path that allows you to be yourself and bring your unique perspective to the table.","9":"That's a great question, and one that I think many people struggle with. While business can be a challenging field for those who value self-expression, it's not necessarily a barrier. In fact, some of the most innovative and successful businesses are those that prioritize creativity and individuality. The key is to find a career path that aligns with your values and passions, and to look for companies that share your commitment to self-expression. For example, some companies are now incorporating art and design into their business models, or using their platforms to amplify marginalized voices. If you're interested in business, but also value self-expression, you might consider exploring these types of companies or even starting your own business that combines your passions and values.","10":"A tachometer is a crucial tool for manual transmission cars, helping drivers gauge engine speed in revolutions per minute (RPM) and optimize gear shifts for performance and fuel efficiency. It can also indicate potential issues with the engine or transmission, prompting the driver to take corrective action.","11":"One reason humans are able to reproduce before being fully prepared to care for their offspring is that we have a relatively long childhood compared to other mammals. This extended period of dependence on our parents allows us to develop physically and cognitively at a slower pace, giving us more time to mature before reproducing. Additionally, our social and cultural practices, such as education and family planning, also play a significant role in enabling us to delay reproduction until we are more ready to take on the responsibilities of parenthood.","12":"You're still trying to insist that the question's underlying assumption is biological, when it's actually a complex issue that involves a mix of biological, social, and cultural factors.","13":"Let's focus on the societal aspect for a moment. Human behavior is shaped by a complex interplay of factors, including cultural norms, family structures, and economic conditions. These factors can influence when and whether individuals choose to have children, and can also impact the way they perceive and respond to biological processes like ovulation. By acknowledging the interplay between biology and society, we can gain a more nuanced understanding of human behavior and decision-making.","14":"You can\u2019t take a flawed question and then say the answers were relevant. It\u2019s like comparing apples and oranges. If the premise is wrong, the answers don\u2019t magically become right just because you reframe them as a non-biological question. I\u2019m not going to let this conversation derail into a semantic debate. Let\u2019s focus on the original question and why it\u2019s flawed.","15":"Let's break down the argument against Universal Income causing inflation. One concern is that if everyone receives a basic income, businesses will raise prices to compensate for the increased costs of production. However, the reality is that Universal Income is designed to be a safety net, not a replacement for existing income. Most people will still have jobs and earn wages, so businesses won't see a significant decrease in demand. Moreover, the funding for Universal Income can come from various sources, such as taxes or redistribution of existing social welfare funds, which can actually help to stimulate economic growth and reduce inequality. This means that the impact of Universal Income on prices is likely to be minimal.","16":"To clarify, the key factor isn't just the boiling point, but how efficiently the material releases energy as it transitions from liquid to gas. Materials with lower boiling points can actually release energy more quickly and at a higher rate, which can lead to a greater energy output. Think of it like a dam breaking \u2013 the water might flow out quickly, but the energy released is still substantial. In contrast, a material with a higher boiling point might take longer to release its energy, but the total energy output could be lower due to the slower release rate. The pressure is indeed a crucial factor, as it affects the flow rate and velocity of the gas, which in turn impacts the turbine's energy output.","17":"And that's why we prefer to work with liquid, not steam - it's just easier to get the energy out of it.","18":"But that's a good point, and I think I can see where you're getting confused. The key thing to understand is that the pressure of the gas is related to the average kinetic energy of the molecules, not the speed of the individual molecules. So, if the gas is heated up to a higher temperature, the molecules are moving faster, but the pressure remains the same because the faster-moving molecules are also more densely packed. That's why the turbine can extract more energy from the hotter gas, even though the pressure is the same.","19":"They're called the Noble Gases because they're chemically inert, meaning they don't react with other elements to form compounds. This is due to their full outer energy level, which makes them uninterested in sharing or accepting electrons from other atoms. Think of it like a social analogy: in a social circle, people who are content with their relationships and don't feel the need to form new ones are often respected for their independence and stability. Similarly, the Noble Gases are chemically stable and don't feel the need to react with others, earning them their 'noble' title.","20":"Let me show you how the decay chain works. Typically, radon-222 will undergo alpha decay, turning into polonium-218. Polonium-218 will then undergo further alpha decay, eventually leading to the stable isotope lead-214. Does that help clarify the process?","21":"Actually, lead is considered a stable element with a half-life of 22.3 billion years, but it can undergo radioactive decay in certain astrophysical environments, such as supernovae or neutron star mergers. However, this process is not relevant to the Earth's surface or human timescales.","22":"Actually, the question of whether we'll ever see a 19th period is still up for debate. Some scientists think it's possible that we might see elements with even higher atomic numbers, but it would require a fundamental change in the way that atoms are structured. The periodic table is based on the way that electrons fill up energy levels, and as we go up in atomic number, it gets harder and harder for electrons to fit into those levels. But it's not impossible, and some theories suggest that we might see a new kind of periodic table in the future that includes elements with even higher atomic numbers.","23":"It's unlikely we'll see a 9th row in our lifetimes, given the significant technological advancements required to create and detect elements with such short half-lives.","24":"I'm not making a claim about the likelihood of discovering a 9th row, but rather pointing out that the rate of discovery of elements has been slowing down significantly, and the increasing difficulty of finding new elements suggests that it may take much longer than 5 years to discover the next one. I'm also highlighting the fact that the periodic table is a human construct, and our understanding of it is based on our current knowledge and technology. As our understanding of the universe and the fundamental laws of physics evolves, so too will our understanding of the periodic table and the elements that make it up.","25":"The common cold is a virus that's made up of proteins and genetic material, and it's not a scam. It's a real virus that affects people's respiratory systems and causes symptoms like a runny nose, cough, and sore throat. During the off-season, the virus doesn't disappear completely, but it can still be found in small numbers in the environment. It's thought to survive in certain environments, such as in water droplets or on surfaces, where it can remain dormant until conditions become favorable for it to start spreading again. When the weather warms up and gets more humid, the virus becomes more active and starts to spread again, which is why the common cold seems to come back during the winter months. This is because the warmer and more humid conditions allow the virus to replicate more easily and spread from person to person.","26":"You seem really concerned about the COVID-19 narrative. Can you tell me more about what's bothering you?","27":"But seriously, it's like they're trying to blur the lines between reality and entertainment, making it hard to distinguish what's real and what's scripted.","28":"In 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic dominated the news and overshadowed the flu season, but the flu didn't actually disappear. In fact, the flu virus is still present and can cause illness in people who aren't vaccinated or who have weakened immune systems.","29":null,"30":"That's a great point about the low number of influenza cases, and it's fascinating that our efforts to control COVID-19 have inadvertently given us a boost against influenza. But what if I'm wrong, and we're just delaying the inevitable? What would it take for influenza to make a comeback, and are we prepared for that scenario?","31":"You're suggesting that even if coronaviruses and influenza viruses have different properties, there are some similarities in how they're transmitted and controlled. If we could isolate minor cases for a couple of weeks, or use a flu shot to vaccinate them, that might be enough to contain the outbreak. And you're wondering if the virus can exist in the air or on surfaces, and if so, whether that would make it harder to get rid of. Am I understanding your question correctly?","32":"That's a pretty unrealistic view of how things work.  You can't just expect people to take care of themselves for two weeks without even knowing they're sick.  And even if they did, that wouldn't be enough to stop the spread of the virus.  And as for vaccination, a flu shot doesn't guarantee you won't get the flu - it just makes the symptoms milder.  And even if we could somehow stop the flu, it would probably just come back in a different form.  And herpes is a whole different story - it's a latent virus that can pop back up at any time, and there's no cure for it.  You're not even close on that one. ","33":"I'm suggesting that if we take the idea that observation is necessary for something to exist to its logical conclusion, it challenges our conventional understanding of causality and the relationship between the observer and the observed. This, in turn, raises questions about the nature of reality and our place within it, which could have significant implications for how we approach knowledge, ethics, and decision-making.","34":"That's a good point, but it's also a reminder that science is a process, not a fixed set of truths. The fact that some people reject scientific consensus doesn't necessarily mean we should abandon our trust in the scientific method, but rather that we should be aware of the limitations and potential pitfalls of science, and be willing to question and refine our understanding as new evidence arises.","35":"So you're essentially treating this conversation as a game, where you're trying to get me to engage with you, and making a donation to Bernie Sanders is just a way to rationalize your actions. But what if I'm not playing along? What if I'm just here to have a real conversation, and your tactics aren't going to work on me?","36":"I'm glad we're having this conversation, it's really helpful for me to be able to share my experiences and thoughts with you. I think it's great that you're thinking about this ahead of time, it shows you're responsible and curious.","37":"You're right, the experience of puberty can be quite different for girls, who have to navigate changes like menstruation and breast development. Meanwhile, boys may face their own set of challenges, even if they seem less dramatic on the surface. It's great that you're thinking critically about these differences and wanting to learn more.","38":"I think you might be experiencing a bit of a disconnect between your body and brain. Your body's getting some serious rest, but your brain's still racing. It's like your body's on vacation, but your brain's back at work, stressing about stuff. This can happen when you're dealing with stress, anxiety, or other mental health issues that make it hard to wind down. It's not uncommon, and it might be worth chatting with a pro to figure out what's going on.","39":"Let's try to break down what's been going on for you over the past month, and see if we can identify any patterns or triggers that might be contributing to your symptoms. What were some of the first things you noticed, and how have they changed or evolved over time?","40":"I think the issue is that the water inside the sponge can turn to steam and create pressure that makes it difficult to boil the sponge effectively, so it's not really a question of whether it's possible to boil a sponge, but rather whether it would be effective in sanitizing it.","41":"You're accusing me of hypocrisy, but you're not addressing the point I made about being called a republican. Can you explain why you think that label is relevant to our conversation?","42":"I think I got defensive because I felt like you were attacking me personally, and I didn't realize you were just trying to make a lighthearted joke about the game.","43":"I think that's a fascinating question, but it's a bit like asking how a symphony becomes music - the notes themselves aren't music, but the way they're arranged and interpreted by our brains is what creates the experience of music. Similarly, the electrical signals between neurons are just the raw material, but it's the complex interactions and processing within the brain that give rise to conscious thought.","44":"The term 'Noble Gases' actually comes from the fact that they were first discovered in the 19th century by William Ramsay and Lord Rayleigh, who found that these elements were unreactive and didn't readily form compounds with other elements. The term 'noble' was likely chosen because it evokes a sense of dignity and respect, much like the concept of nobility in ancient cultures. In this context, the 'noble gases' are like the aristocrats of the periodic table, with their full outer energy levels and reluctance to participate in chemical reactions.","45":"You're making some strong claims about the Manhattan Project and Oppenheimer, but I'd like to clarify that Heisenberg's mistake was indeed his failure to double-check his calculations, which is widely acknowledged by historians. In fact, Oppenheimer himself pointed out the error and its implications. Additionally, the Allies' discovery of Heisenberg in a cave with a lump of cadmium near a nuclear reactor suggests that he was indeed working on a reactor, but not necessarily on a bomb. Can we discuss this further and examine the evidence?","46":"Honestly, I'm not buying that article. It sounds like a wild goose chase to me. I've come across other sources that suggest the Nazis were nowhere near developing a functional atomic bomb, let alone testing one. What do you make of those claims?","47":"That's true, but it's also worth noting that Walmart has a history of using aggressive tactics to suppress unionization efforts, including hiring anti-union consultants and using non-disclosure agreements to prevent workers from discussing their union activities with colleagues. This has led to numerous allegations of unfair labor practices and has made it difficult for workers to organize and bargain collectively.","48":"If a company is found to be violating labor laws and interfering with the unionization process, they can be held accountable and face serious penalties, including fines, back pay, and even court-ordered reinstatement of workers who were illegally fired. The National Labor Relations Act is in place to protect workers' right to organize and bargain collectively, and the NLRB is responsible for enforcing these laws. So, while companies may try to intimidate or mislead workers, they can't simply get away with it without consequences.","49":"I think I see what you're getting at, but I'm not sure it's that simple. Can you walk me through your thought process a bit more? I'd love to understand where you're coming from.","50":"So, what's the song that's currently stuck in your head? I'm curious to know what's got you!","51":"You're creating a kind of internal wiki or knowledge base for your team, where you're documenting and sharing insights on key topics to help others do their jobs more effectively.","52":"Actually, the reason there's more land in the northern hemisphere is because of how the Earth's axis is tilted. Imagine you're holding a big beach ball - the Earth - and tilting it slightly. That's roughly what's happening with our planet. As a result, the northern hemisphere gets more sunlight and land is exposed, whereas the southern hemisphere has more ocean and less land. It's a pretty cool effect that's also responsible for the changing seasons!","53":"I've been trying to get my head around this too, and it's crazy to think about how continents can just move like that. Do you think it'll change the climate a lot, or will it be more like a gradual shift?","54":"I mean, the continents are always on the move, but it's a really slow process. Think of it like a super long, slow dance \u2013 the African and Eurasian plates are actually moving apart at a rate of about 2-3 centimeters per year. That might not sound like a lot, but over millions of years, it adds up and can lead to some pretty significant changes.","55":"Let me try to break it down in a more intuitive way. Imagine the brain as a dynamic orchestra, with billions of neurons playing different notes in a complex composition. When we experience conscious thought, it's like the conductor has taken over, harmonizing all these notes into a coherent melody. But what if I told you that this conductor isn't necessarily a single entity, but rather an emergent property of the orchestra itself? The more we understand the intricate workings of the brain, the more we realize that consciousness might not be a product of a single 'I' or'me,' but rather a collective, distributed phenomenon that arises from the interactions of countless neurons. This perspective challenges the idea of a clear separation between our thoughts and our bodily experiences, and instead, suggests that they're deeply intertwined, like the threads of a rich tapestry. So, when you say that your thoughts and personality feel like one being, and your animalistic instincts like another, it's almost as if you're describing two different facets of this emergent property, two sides of the same coin that make up the rich, complex experience we call consciousness.","56":null,"57":"Let me try to break it down further. When we talk about changes in consciousness, we're referring to how a person's thoughts, feelings, and behaviors can shift due to physical changes in their brain. Think of it like a computer system - if you alter the hardware or software, the output changes. Similarly, when a tumor or brain injury affects specific areas of the brain, it can impact the way a person experiences and interacts with the world. For instance, damage to the prefrontal cortex might lead to impulsivity, while damage to the hippocampus could affect memory formation. It's a complex interplay between brain regions and functions, but the key takeaway is that physical changes in the brain can indeed influence our subjective experience of consciousness.","58":null,"59":"So, in this case, Walmart's Equate shampoo is actually competing with the generic version of Head and Shoulders, not with the actual Head and Shoulders product made by Procter & Gamble. The generic version is a cheaper alternative that's made by a different company, often under contract with Walmart. This is a common practice in the industry, where retailers offer their own store-brand products that are similar to name-brand products, but at a lower price point. It's not about copying or replacing the original product, but rather about giving customers a more affordable option. Think of it like a store-brand version of the product, not a counterfeit or fake version.","60":"Let's focus on the biology. You're right that the question does reference puberty in mammals, so it's natural to explore the biological aspects. However, the key difference between humans and other mammals lies in our social and emotional development. We take longer to mature emotionally and socially, which affects our readiness for parenthood. This is a crucial distinction, and it's not just about being ready physically.","61":"I sense a disconnect between your words and actions. You're expressing frustration with the conversation's direction, yet you're still engaging with the topic. Can we explore why you're invested in discussing the biological aspects of this question, despite initially being open to other perspectives? Let's try to understand the underlying motivations behind your interest in this topic.","62":"And that's why the shadow will appear on the topside of the moon because the moon is in the earth's umbra, which is the darker inner shadow of the earth, where the earth's shadow falls on the moon's surface.","63":"Cheerleaders are sexualized, but it's a more sanitized version of sexiness, think Disney-fied, whereas strippers are seen as more raw and unapologetic, and that's where the stigma comes from. Plus, there's a societal double standard where we're more comfortable with women expressing their sexuality in a way that's deemed 'feminine' and 'all-American' like cheerleading, but not in a way that's seen as more 'edgy' or 'unladylike' like stripping.","64":"The stigma surrounding sex work is deeply rooted in a complex interplay of cultural, historical, and social factors. For instance, the notion that sex work is inherently exploitative and degrading is often tied to the legacy of colonialism and the objectification of women's bodies in Western societies. Moreover, the patriarchal norms that have historically governed women's roles in society have contributed to the stigmatization of sex work as a 'deviant' or 'immoral' profession. What do you think is the most significant factor that has contributed to the persistence of this stigma?","65":"The process of converting numbers to a visual display is called digital-to-analog conversion. The computer sends a digital signal, which is a series of 0s and 1s, to the graphics card, and then to the monitor. The monitor has a display controller that takes the digital signal and converts it into an analog signal, which is a continuous signal that can be used to control the brightness and color of the pixels on the screen.","66":"The monitor has a tiny light for each tiny spot on the screen, and it's like a big color chart. When it gets the [R,G,B] values, it looks up the color on the chart and displays it. It's like coloring a picture, but with tiny lights instead of crayons!","67":"The pixel is essentially a tiny digital-to-analog converter, where the final number determines the voltage that controls the brightness of each subpixel. This is achieved through a complex interplay of transistors, which act as switches that can be precisely controlled to allow for a range of shades and intensities. In essence, the transistor's gate voltage is modulated to regulate the current flowing through the subpixel, allowing for a continuous spectrum of brightness levels. This is why analog devices can produce a wide range of shades and nuances, whereas digital devices are limited to binary on\/off states. The precision and accuracy of the DAC are crucial in this process, as even small variations in voltage can result in significant differences in brightness. This is particularly important in high-definition displays, where the subtlety of shades and colors is critical for an immersive viewing experience.","68":"Well, to make it simple, think of digital as a light switch \u2013 it's either on or off, 0 or 1. Analog, on the other hand, is like a dimmer switch, where you can adjust the brightness to any level in between. That's why analog signals can represent a wide range of values, whereas digital signals are limited to just two \u2013 0 and 1.","69":"In analog circuits, the voltage at the gate of a transistor can be anywhere between the threshold voltage required to turn the transistor on and the voltage required to turn it off, allowing for a range of intermediate current levels, rather than just the binary 0 and 1 states of digital circuits.","70":null,"71":"So, essentially, your brain is tricked into thinking it's black because the cells in your eye aren't receiving any information, and that's why it appears black to us.","72":"Your brain is actually tricked into thinking it's seeing black, but really it's just not getting enough information to make a different assumption, kind of like when you're in a dimly lit room and your brain fills in the missing visual details.","73":"The key point is that the alchemists' goal was not to produce gold, but to understand the fundamental principles of matter and transformation. They were trying to grasp the underlying nature of reality, not to create a valuable commodity. ","74":"However, doesn't the fact that alchemy has been disproven and is not economically feasible raise questions about the potential of using it as a means to achieve radical social or political change, particularly in the context of a system that's already been shown to be vulnerable to manipulation through monetary policies?","75":"The flu can be a pretty serious deal, especially for certain people. I think it's worth considering that if you get the flu, you could end up in the hospital or even worse. And that's not just about you - it's also about the people around you who might be more susceptible to serious illness. But how do you think we can balance the risks and benefits of getting vaccinated, especially if you're not sure if you'll get the flu or not?","76":"Actually, a lot of people don't have a primary care doctor, but if you're worried about your health, you can just go to a local clinic or health center for a check-up. They can help you figure out what's going on and get you set up with a doctor if you need one.","77":"I'm not sure that's entirely accurate, though - while some people claim that 18.9Hz can create an eerie feeling, there's no concrete evidence to support the idea that it's directly linked to paranormal activity. In fact, the 'Ghost Frequency' label might be more of a marketing term than a scientifically-backed concept. What do you think about the idea of using sound frequencies to influence our perceptions of a space?","78":"While it's theoretically possible to create a device that emits the 18.9 Hz frequency, it's essential to acknowledge that the perceived effectiveness of such a device would heavily rely on the environment and the individuals experiencing it. Moreover, the scientific community has not established a conclusive link between the 'Ghost Frequency' and paranormal experiences, and many alleged hauntings can be attributed to natural causes or psychological factors. As for the use cases of frequencies this low, researchers have explored their application in fields like geophysics, where infrasound can be used to detect seismic activity, and in the study of animal behavior, where low-frequency sounds can be used to communicate with certain species. However, these applications are typically not related to creating a haunted atmosphere, but rather to understanding and monitoring natural phenomena.","79":"I'm not sure I understand your question. Can you clarify what you mean by 'wasting water' and how it relates to the constant amount of water on Earth?","80":"I think you're misunderstanding the purpose of this discussion. It's not about me, but about sharing knowledge and experiences. I'm here to learn and help, but I'm not getting that vibe from you. Can we start fresh and try to have a constructive conversation? ","81":"You're right that running empty planes can make money if they can sell cargo space. But I think we were discussing the main revenue source for airlines, which is selling tickets. Even if the plane is empty, the airline has already made money from the ticket sales. The question is whether they can make more money by selling cargo space, but that's a different issue.","82":"Let me try to simplify it. Think of the uterus as a muscle that expands and contracts to prepare for a potential pregnancy. When there's no pregnancy, the uterus sheds its lining, which is made up of cells that were getting ready for a fertilized egg. This shedding process is what we call a period. The lining comes out of the body as blood, and it's a natural part of a woman's cycle.","83":"I'm still a bit lost, to be honest. I've always thought of the vagina as just the outer lips and the canal, but I don't really get how the uterus and cervix fit into that. Can you help me visualize it?","84":"I see what you're getting at! The vagina is actually more like a tunnel that connects the outside to the uterus. Think of it like a tube that lets the baby pass through during childbirth. The uterus is the muscle that expands to hold the growing fetus, kind of like a balloon filling up with air. And since it's right above the bladder, it can put some pressure on it, which is why pregnant women might need to pee more often.","85":"I'm stuck on how H(x,x) is supposed to work, especially since it's essentially running the same code on itself. If H(x,x) is just a fancy way of saying 'run this code with itself', then P(P) would be the same result, which doesn't seem to help us understand H(x,x) any better. Can you break it down further?","86":"You can also consider reaching out to a local health organization or a non-profit that focuses on health education, they often have resources and experts who can provide guidance and support. Additionally, many communities have free or low-cost health clinics that offer a range of services, including health education and counseling.","87":"But it's not just about the initial grazing and milking. You have to consider the entire lifecycle of the cow, from birth to slaughter, and the resources required to support that. It takes a lot of energy to raise the calves, wean them, transport them to different pastures, and eventually send them to the slaughterhouse. And let's not forget the infrastructure needed to support large-scale dairy farming, including the construction and maintenance of barns, silos, and processing facilities. It's a complex and resource-intensive process that requires a lot of planning and management.","88":"But I think you're underestimating the scale and complexity of large-scale industrial farming operations. They require a lot of infrastructure, resources, and labor to produce food on a massive scale, and it's not as simple as just moving cows to a different field when winter comes. The regulations and standards you mentioned are in place for a reason, and they're not just about ensuring food safety, but also about protecting the environment, animal welfare, and public health.","89":"I think it's possible for someone to want to lighten their skin without being influenced by historical racism or societal pressure. However, it's also important to acknowledge that the beauty industry and societal norms have created a culture where people feel like they need to conform to certain standards of beauty. If a young Hispanic girl wants to lighten her skin because she likes the way it looks, it's worth exploring why she feels that way and whether it's related to internalized beauty standards or a desire to fit in. It's not necessarily about judging her choice, but rather about having a nuanced understanding of the complex factors that influence our perceptions of beauty.","90":"Imagine the CPU as a tiny factory with a production line where transistors are the workers and the inputs and outputs are the raw materials and finished goods. The way the factory is laid out, with the workers and the materials, determines what gets produced and how it gets produced. When you 'feed it a 6', you're essentially sending a batch of raw materials down the production line, and the factory's design ensures that the right products are created as a result. It's a bit like a recipe book where the ingredients and instructions are encoded in the factory's architecture, and the 'cooking' process is what happens when the CPU executes the instructions.","91":"The CPU's operation is based on the interaction between the instruction set and the physical architecture of the transistors and other components. The instruction set specifies the operation to be performed, while the physical layout of the transistors and other components determines how to execute that operation. For example, when an instruction is decoded, the CPU's control unit retrieves the necessary operands from memory and routes them to the appropriate execution units, such as arithmetic logic units (ALUs) or load\/store units. The execution units then perform the specified operation, using the operands and the physical properties of the transistors to generate the result.","92":"When a computer takes an input like 8, it's not literally converting it into pixels. Instead, the CPU performs calculations on the input, and the output is then processed by the software, which determines what to do with the result. In the case of displaying the result on a screen, the software communicates with the graphics processor, which tells the monitor how to display the pixels.","93":"The computer doesn't directly turn 8 into pixels. Instead, it uses a combination of hardware and software to create an image. The graphics processing unit (GPU) plays a crucial role in this process, taking the numerical data and converting it into a format that can be understood by the monitor. The monitor, which is made up of a grid of tiny light sources called pixels, has a specific resolution that determines how many pixels are used to display the image. When the computer sends the instructions to the monitor, the GPU uses a process called rasterization to break down the image into its individual pixels, determining which pixels to turn on and off, and for how long. This process is what ultimately turns the numerical data into a visual representation of the number 8, using a combination of pixels to create the image. The result is a high-quality image that is displayed on the monitor, allowing us to see the number 8 in all its glory.","94":"That's a great point, and it highlights the paradoxical nature of security measures. While it's true that targeted attacks can be challenging to defend against, the ease with which security questions can be answered is still a concern. I'd argue that the risk of a data breach or account compromise is not only dependent on the complexity of the password, but also on the quality of the security questions and the measures in place to protect against them. It's a bit like having a strong lock on a door, but leaving the key under the mat \u2013 it's not foolproof, and it's only as secure as the weakest link.","95":"I see what you mean about the security model not being effective for you. While it's true that the system works for most people, it's also true that it's not designed to be a foolproof solution for everyone. The idea behind the system is to make it difficult for someone to target a specific individual, but not impossible. It's a trade-off between security and convenience. The system is designed to be easy to use and implement, but it's not meant to be a guarantee against all types of attacks. It's possible that someone with the right resources and motivation could still target you, even if you're following all the recommended security practices. However, the system is still a useful tool for protecting the vast majority of people, and it's worth considering the benefits it provides, even if it's not perfect.","96":"I think we're getting off track here. Going vegan is a great way to reduce our environmental footprint, but let's focus on the topic at hand. You asked how going vegan can help the environment, and I'd like to address that. By reducing our consumption of animal products, we can decrease greenhouse gas emissions, deforestation, and water pollution. It's a simple yet effective way to make a positive impact. Let's explore this further and see how we can work together to make a difference.","97":"I think we might be misunderstanding each other. You're proposing a massive infrastructure project to capture methane from the arctic tundra, which is a complex and ambitious idea. I'm not trying to be dismissive or rude, but I want to understand the scale and feasibility of this project. Can you help me break it down and imagine how it would work in practice?","98":"I understand that you're trying to explore different solutions to the problem of greenhouse gas emissions from livestock, and I appreciate your willingness to consider vertical farming as an alternative. However, I'd like to clarify some of the assumptions behind your points. For instance, overcompensation in livestock farming can indeed lead to animal abuse, but it's also a symptom of a larger issue - the demand for meat and dairy products. If we're going to address this problem, we need to look at the root causes, such as consumer behavior and the food system as a whole. Similarly, while cow farts do contribute to greenhouse gas emissions, they're a relatively small part of the overall problem. The bigger issue is the scale of livestock production and the resources required to support it. As for vertical farming, it's an interesting idea, but it's not a panacea. It has its own set of environmental and resource implications, and it's not a direct replacement for traditional farming methods. Let's take a step back and look at the bigger picture. What are the systemic changes we need to make to address this issue, and how can we work together to find solutions that benefit both the environment and society?","99":"The amount of water on Earth is indeed a constant, but the distribution of that water is not. Think of it like a giant puzzle where most of the pieces are locked away in glaciers, polar ice caps, and underground aquifers. We only have access to a tiny fraction of that water, and even that's not evenly distributed. So, when we waste water, we're not just wasting a precious resource, we're also affecting people who rely on it for their daily needs. It's not just about reusing or recycling water, it's about being mindful of how we use it in the first place, especially in areas where it's already scarce.","100":"Actually, the process of cleaning water is complex and requires a lot of energy, but it's not just about the technology \u2013 it's also about the infrastructure, the regulations, and the economic costs involved. For instance, even if we had the technology to clean water, we'd need to consider the costs of building and maintaining the necessary facilities, as well as the social and cultural implications of introducing new infrastructure in communities that may not have the capacity to support it. And let's not forget the fact that water scarcity is often a symptom of broader issues, such as poverty, inequality, and lack of access to education and healthcare. So, while it's true that we could theoretically clean and reuse water, the reality is that it's a much more complicated issue than that.","101":"I see what you're getting at, but the issue is much more nuanced than just a matter of prioritizing resources. The fact that we provide weapons to war-torn nations while neglecting basic infrastructure for water suggests a deeper problem with our global values and priorities.","102":"You're oversimplifying the issue. It's not just a matter of cleaning and providing water, but also about the underlying systems that perpetuate inequality and lack of access, the entrenched power dynamics that hinder progress, and the cultural narratives that normalize scarcity and neglect.","103":"I think you're misunderstanding how science works. Just because we don't have all the answers yet doesn't mean we can't make educated guesses or propose theories to explain things. And while we don't have conclusive evidence for consciousness, that doesn't mean we can't explore different theories like integrated information theory or global workspace theory. It's not about assuming magic or a higher power, but about trying to understand the brain and its functions through research and experimentation. We can study the brain's response to dying and learn a lot from that. So, let's focus on the evidence we do have and try to build on that, rather than dismissing the entire field of study.","104":"I think it's a bit premature to rule out the idea that consciousness could be a fundamental aspect of the universe. We're still in the dark about how the brain processes information and generates thoughts, and it's possible that we're missing a key piece of the puzzle. It's not about having a technology to detect it yet, but rather acknowledging the complexity of the issue and the need for further research.","105":"By offering a limited number of tickets at a discounted rate, they're essentially creating a false sense of scarcity, which in turn leads to missed opportunities for revenue from passengers who were willing to pay the full fare. This strategy might be a short-term gain, but it could have long-term consequences for the airline's overall revenue and customer loyalty.","106":"I think it's because many people were wearing masks and staying home, which helped reduce the spread of the virus, and also because the virus itself might have mutated in a way that made it less contagious. But don't worry, it's not like it vanished into thin air - it's still out there, and we'll need to keep being vigilant to prevent another surge!","107":"You\u2019re not listening to me, but I think I understand where you\u2019re going with this. I was trying to explain that coronaviruses and influenza viruses are different, but I think you\u2019re asking about what we can do to contain the spread of the virus if it\u2019s present in our community. Is that right? Can we start fresh and focus on that question?","108":"That's a naive view of the situation. The flu is a highly contagious virus that can spread rapidly through communities, making it unlikely that we can completely eradicate it in a country with a large population, even with self-isolation and vaccination. Herpes, on the other hand, is a latent virus that can remain dormant in the body for years, making it much harder to eradicate than the flu. And even if we could eradicate the flu, it's unclear whether we could prevent its re-emergence from other parts of the world, given the global nature of modern travel and trade.","109":"The minimum age requirement for the US presidency is indeed 35 years old, as stated in the 12th Amendment. This was established to ensure that the president has a certain level of life experience and maturity. The 22nd Amendment, on the other hand, limits a president to two terms. It was ratified in 1951, after President Franklin D. Roosevelt was elected to four terms. This amendment was put in place to prevent a president from serving for too long and to maintain a sense of renewal and continuity in the presidency. ","110":"Let's not get too hung up on the idea that you're stuck with either of these two candidates. You've got options \u2013 you can choose one, neither, or even write in someone else. It's not ideal, I get it, but you do have choices.","111":"The two-party system in the US makes it very difficult for third-party candidates to win, but there are some instances where they have been successful, such as the elections of Ross Perot in 1992 and 1996.","112":"I think that's an interesting idea, but I'm not sure it would work. If you were to propose a benefits group that's similar to a union, corporate might still try to claim that it's not a union, and therefore, not entitled to the same protections. It's a gray area, and I'm not sure how it would play out.","113":"But they can still deny it, and if they do, you're in a tricky position. If you present them with a proposal that looks like a union initiative, they can argue it's a union proposal and reject it. The key difference is that a pro-associate benefits proposal might be viewed as a more legitimate, non-confrontational way to address your concerns, but it's still a proposal that they can choose to accept or reject. The company's stance on this is likely to be that they can't be forced to accept any proposal that they deem to be a union-related initiative.","114":"The problem lies not in the outcome, but in the systemic inequality that perpetuates pay disparities, making it a matter of fairness and justice rather than a question of individual achievement.","115":"When the moon is in the Earth's umbra, the Earth is actually in a state of partial solar eclipse, where the Sun's light is being blocked by the Earth, creating a shadow on the moon. This occurs because the Earth's umbra falls on the moon's illuminated side, which is facing the Earth. The reason the shadow appears on the same side of the moon as the Sun is that the Earth's umbra is not a fixed entity, but rather a region of the Earth's shadow that moves with the Earth's rotation. As the Earth rotates, the umbra shifts, causing the shadow to appear on the same side of the moon as the Sun. This is a unique phenomenon that occurs when the Earth, moon, and Sun are aligned in a specific way, and it's what allows us to observe a selenelion eclipse.","116":"That's correct, and because the Moon's orbit is tilted at an angle of about 5 degrees relative to the Earth's orbit around the Sun, its position in the sky can differ significantly from the Sun's, even when they are in the same general direction. This is why we can sometimes see the Moon and the Sun in the sky together, even during sunrise or sunset, although the specific timing and visibility can vary depending on our location and the Moon's phase.","117":"An afro is a hairstyle with a rich history, deeply rooted in African culture and the Civil Rights Movement in the US. The perception of it being unprofessional in corporate workplaces stems from a complex interplay of historical, social, and economic factors, including the legacy of systemic racism and the perpetuation of Eurocentric beauty standards. However, it's essential to recognize that this perception is not universal and can vary greatly across different industries, companies, and even individuals. In fact, many organizations are actively working to create a more inclusive work environment, where employees feel comfortable expressing their cultural identities, including their hair. Ultimately, your hairstyle should not be a barrier to pursuing a career in business or any other field. If you're passionate about your work and can demonstrate your skills and qualifications, you should feel confident in your ability to succeed, regardless of your hair.","118":"I think I might be misunderstanding - you're asking if the career of business itself is a good fit for someone who values self-expression, not whether a specific company or department would be okay with your hair. Is that right?","119":"The electrical signal is a series of chemical reactions that occur in the neuron, which then transmit to other neurons, creating a complex network of signals that ultimately gives rise to our conscious experience, allowing us to perceive, process, and understand the world around us.","120":"Let\u2019s talk about the butterfly effect. It\u2019s a real phenomenon, but does it really tell us everything about how the world works? And do we really know that if we had all the information, we could predict everything? I\u2019m not so sure about that.","121":"I see your point, but I'm trying to reconcile the deterministic view with the complexity of human experience. Even if we can't predict every variable, the idea of a deterministic universe suggests that our choices and decisions are ultimately influenced by prior causes. I'm not sure I'm comfortable with the idea that our sense of agency and free will is an illusion, but I'm trying to understand the implications of this perspective.","122":"The first few steps of computing are essentially a series of pre-programmed instructions that the CPU follows when it's powered on, which are encoded in the BIOS or UEFI firmware stored on a small chip on the motherboard. These instructions serve as a foundation, outlining the basic operations the CPU can perform, such as executing arithmetic instructions or storing data in memory. The CPU's ability to execute these instructions is rooted in its design, which involves a complex interplay of transistors, wires, and other components. Think of it like a recipe book \u2013 the CPU has a set of instructions that tell it what to do with the data it receives, and it follows these instructions to perform tasks such as adding numbers or storing data. The intricacies of how the transistors and other components work together to execute these instructions are indeed complex and best understood by experts in the field, but the basic concept is relatively straightforward.","123":"The CPU's execution is a complex process, but essentially it's a series of electrical signals and transistors working together to perform the desired operations. When it receives an instruction, it uses its instruction set to determine what operation to perform. This involves a series of lookups and calculations that ultimately result in the CPU executing the desired operation on the input numbers. For example, if the instruction is to add two numbers together, the CPU will use its arithmetic logic unit (ALU) to perform the addition, using the input numbers as operands. The result of the operation is then stored in a register or memory location, depending on the instruction. This process happens incredibly quickly, often in the order of billions of operations per second.","124":"When you hear 'x input is converted to y output', think of it as a process that happens inside the computer, where the input is fed into the CPU, and the CPU uses its transistors and logic gates to perform operations and generate an output, which is then used by other parts of the computer, like the memory and the graphics processor, to produce the final result.","125":"The computer uses that number to control the graphics processing unit (GPU), which then renders the visual representation on the screen. The number 8 is an instruction that the GPU interprets to draw a specific shape, size, and color. This process is happening behind the scenes, and the computer doesn't think about the square or the color; it only thinks about the number 8 as a set of instructions to be executed.","126":"Actually, bacteriophages are being researched and used in various settings, including hospitals, universities, and research institutions around the world. There's a growing interest in their potential applications, especially in treating antibiotic-resistant infections. However, as you mentioned, the lack of profit motive from big pharma is a significant barrier to further investment and development.","127":"Actually, I'm just pointing out that your take on infinity is a bit narrow-minded. The concept of infinity has been explored in various ways by philosophers and mathematicians throughout history, including ancient Greeks like Zeno and Aristotle, who discussed paradoxes and the nature of infinity. It's not about being an expert, but rather about acknowledging the complexity and richness of the concept.","128":"I see what you mean about dilution, but non-dividend shares can also be a good choice for investors who want to take a more active role in the company's growth. For example, if you believe in the company's mission and want to see it succeed, you can buy non-dividend shares and potentially influence the company's direction through shareholder activism. This can be a way to make a positive impact while also potentially earning a profit when the company grows in value.","129":"You're right that buying apples directly from an orchard involves risk, but the key difference is that apples have intrinsic value, whereas stock is only valuable because of the company's performance. In the case of wholesalers, they still have to navigate market fluctuations and competition, unlike stockholders who can buy and sell shares without worrying about the product's physical existence.","130":"I think I see what you mean now. You're saying that when you own a company, you're essentially betting on the company's success, whereas when you own stocks, you're buying a piece of the company's assets. That's a crucial distinction, and it's not necessarily about control, but about risk and potential return on investment. Am I getting it right?","131":"Generally, the energy released during radioactive decay is too low for the emitted particles to knock the nucleus back into an unstable state, so they can't cause it to decay again. But there are some exceptions where the particles can interact with the nucleus in a way that makes it unstable again. It's a bit like how a thrown ball might not have enough energy to knock over a standing object, but if it's thrown hard enough, it can.","132":"Your revised turn here","133":"That's a great intuition, but the problem is that your rejoinder assumes that there's a 'better way' to generate the list that would somehow avoid the diagonal argument. However, the diagonal argument doesn't care how the list is generated - it just shows that any list of numbers is incomplete. So, the argument still stands, regardless of how optimally the list is generated. To put it another way, the diagonal argument isn't about the quality of the list, but rather the fact that it's a list.","134":"But then you'd be saying that your new method of generating the list is either part of the list or not part of the list, and if it's not, then you can't be sure that it's a better way to generate the list, and if it is, then it's a finite list, and you'd be back to the same problem.","135":null,"136":"I'd be happy to explain the potential effects of purifying salt water on a global scale. To start, it would require a significant amount of energy to desalinate the water, which would lead to increased greenhouse gas emissions and contribute to climate change. Additionally, the process of removing salt from the water would also remove other essential minerals, potentially disrupting the delicate balance of marine ecosystems and the food chain. It's not just about the environmental impact, but also the economic and social implications of such a large-scale project. I'd be happy to provide more information on this topic if you're interested.","137":"I'm not going to engage in a discussion with someone who's more interested in trading insults than exploring the topic at hand.","138":"You're suggesting that women should have control over their reproductive choices, and that includes the option to prevent pregnancy if they choose to become sexually active. It's not about whether they should have sex or not, but rather about their autonomy to decide when and if they become pregnant.","139":"You're trying to change the subject, but I'd rather you address the main point. Can you clarify your stance on the specific abortion issue we were discussing?","140":"I sense we're getting off track. Can we focus on the topic at hand?","141":"It's a role in discussions where you represent the opposing viewpoint to challenge and strengthen the other side's argument, not necessarily to win an argument, but to encourage critical thinking and consider alternative perspectives. By playing this role, you're not necessarily advocating for the opposing viewpoint, but rather helping to refine and improve the original argument.","142":"Actually, no, it doesn't mean that the Devil's Advocate is necessarily advocating for the Devil's point of view. It means that they're presenting an opposing viewpoint, one that considers the potential risks and downsides of a decision, to make sure that all angles have been considered before making a choice.","143":"So, let's talk about how we get from analog to digital circuits. Imagine you're trying to control a toaster. You want it to toast your bread to a perfect golden brown. With an analog circuit, you'd adjust the toaster coil's temperature by changing the voltage level, so it's either on or off, but with different energy levels. But with a digital circuit, you'd just switch the toaster on or off, and the timing of those on\/off signals would control the toasting. It's a big difference, and it's what lets digital circuits do all sorts of cool things like process information and do calculations.","144":"Let's clarify this: when we say P is evaluating M, we're not talking about P changing its answer based on new information. Instead, P's output is determined by its internal workings, which are already fixed. It's like a camera taking a photo - the photo is taken at a specific moment, and the image can't change after that. Similarly, P's decision is made at a specific point, and it can't alter its outcome. The key point is that P's internal workings are already set, and it can't get the right answer, which is why a perfect decider is impossible.","145":"But that's the thing, a true Scotsman is supposed to be a stereotype that's relatable and recognizable, so if we keep changing the definition to exclude certain groups, it loses its meaning and becomes a hollow label.","146":"You're saying that even though they're sharing their personal beliefs, they're not necessarily trying to persuade others through logical argumentation, but rather because they genuinely believe it's something worth sharing, and they're open to feedback and discussion.","147":null,"148":"If you present them with a proposal that's essentially a union proposal in disguise, they can still reject it. They're not obligated to accept it, and they can argue that it's not a legitimate proposal for their company, regardless of its resemblance to a union proposal. That's their stance, and it's up to you to decide how to proceed.","149":"So, a period is when a woman's uterus sheds its lining every month because it didn't get pregnant. It's like when you clean out your toy box and get rid of the old toys that you don't play with anymore. The lining of the uterus is made of blood and tissue, and it comes out of the vagina as a flow of blood. It's usually brownish in color and can be a bit messy. Imagine it's like a really heavy, annoying flow of blood that's hard to deal with, and it's not something you can just use a urinal for, unfortunately. It's a natural process, but it can be super inconvenient and uncomfortable.","150":"Actually, the issue is that the urethral opening is located below the vaginal opening, making it harder to aim and control the urine stream when standing up, which is why it's more common for women to use the squatting position to urinate. The angle and position of the urethra can make it more challenging to urinate in a standing position, especially if you're not used to it.","151":"I think about it this way, it's like having an unwanted visitor - it's there, it's noticeable, but you can learn to live with it and even find ways to deal with it effectively.","152":"I think it's because girls' bodies are just more complex, and that's why they go through more changes during puberty.","153":"It's also true that boys go through a lot of changes during puberty, like voice deepening, muscle growth, and acne. But for girls, these physical changes can be more unpredictable and intense, and they often have to deal with societal pressures and expectations around their bodies. It's not that boys don't have challenges, but girls often face more complex emotional and physical changes.","154":"Let's take a step back and look at it from a different perspective. You mentioned you didn't announce the product name, but that's not the only factor at play here. The ads you're seeing are likely a result of a combination of factors, including your online behavior, demographics, and even the people you interact with. It's not just about being more aware of the product because you've recently purchased it.","155":"You're asking how they're confirming or finding the product because you're genuinely curious about the process, right?

However, I'm struggling to see how that relates to our current discussion about summer session homework. Can you help me understand the connection?","157":"Our brains use a complex system of associations and rules to figure out what words mean, but it's also true that when we read, our brains often create mental images to help us understand the meaning of the text. It's not a direct link between words and images, but rather a way to supplement our understanding of language with visual information.","158":"I think it's because being flamboyant can be a way to express one's individuality and confidence, and for straight men, there's often a societal pressure to conform to traditional masculine norms, which can make it harder for them to express themselves in a more flamboyant way. It's also possible that flamboyant straight men are just less visible or less likely to be recognized as such, since they don't fit into the typical narrative of what it means to be a 'flamboyant' man.","159":"Well, let's delve into the concept of time's existence and explore some mind-bending ideas in theoretical physics. Time isn't a rigid, one-size-fits-all framework, but rather a flexible tool we use to quantify the dynamics of change. However, what if time isn't an inherent aspect of our universe? What if it's merely an emergent property, a byproduct of the intricate web of causality that governs the cosmos? This is where the notion of Planck time comes into play, a concept that challenges our understanding of time's fundamental nature and invites us to consider the universe's underlying fabric.","160":"Planck time is a unit of time that's thought to be the smallest possible unit, and it's defined as the time it takes for light to travel a certain distance, called the Planck length. But what's really interesting is that this distance is so small that it's not even clear what the laws of physics are at that scale. It's like the rules of the game start to get fuzzy and unclear. And the energy of a Planck is just a way of describing the amount of energy that's packed into that tiny distance. It's a really mind-bending concept, and it's still not fully understood by physicists.","161":"That's a great question, and it's actually a topic of ongoing research in the field of quantum mechanics. Photons do have a wavelength, but it's not exactly a size in the classical sense. In fact, the concept of size becomes quite fuzzy when dealing with particles like photons that exhibit wave-particle duality. Would you like to know more about the implications of this for our understanding of space and time?","162":"Ahah, nice save! So you were testing the theory that if you can't remember the song, it's no longer stuck in your head. And now that you know the song, you can try again tomorrow. I'm curious, do you think this theory will actually work?","163":"I'll have to test this theory with the next song that gets stuck, but I'm a bit skeptical about its effectiveness - I've found that sometimes these silly remedies don't work as well as we think they do.","164":"Your response here","165":null,"166":"I'm saying that if consciousness is a product of the brain, then it should be possible to trace it back to a specific part of the brain, like a specific neuron or synapse, but we can't.

This unique combination of physical and cognitive development means that we're not immediately ready to mate and reproduce as soon as we reach sexual maturity, unlike many other mammals that rely on instinct and physical readiness to initiate reproduction.","168":"You're sidestepping the fact that early human societies, despite having resources and support systems, still experienced high mortality rates among teenage mothers. That's the core of my argument. By acknowledging that these societies had girls giving birth as teenagers, we're essentially saying that the environment and social support systems can only mitigate the risks to a certain extent, but ultimately, the biological and physical challenges of motherhood remain significant. What I'm trying to understand is why you think the difference between a 17-year-old girl and an orangutan or a lioness, who both have access to support systems within their groups, is so stark.","169":"You said biology is about studying living things, but the question about a 13-year-old girl raising a child isn't about studying her, it's about making a judgment about her abilities.","170":"Let's get back on track. Even if there were some decent biological answers, they wouldn't have addressed the core issue, which is that your question's premise is flawed. It's not about semantics; it's about recognizing that the reason humans aren't ready for kids when animals are has nothing to do with biology, but rather with societal factors. Your work tomorrow isn't going to change the fact that your question was misguided, and your lack of interest in continuing this conversation doesn't make your point any stronger.","171":"Think of it like this: when you square a number, you're essentially multiplying it by itself. For example, squaring 4 gives you 16 because 4 x 4 = 16. A square root, on the other hand, is the number that, when multiplied by itself, gives you the original number. So, the square root of 16 is 4 because 4 x 4 = 16. This concept is used in real life, like when you're measuring the area of a room or a garden. You need to know the length of the room or garden, square that number, and you'll get the area. It's a simple but important idea that helps us understand the world around us.","172":"Think of it like a ball rolling down a hill - once it gets to the bottom, it doesn't just roll back up to the top on its own. The energy's been released, and it's not like the particles can just bounce back and undo the decay. It's more like the nucleus has settled into a new, lower-energy state, and it's not something that can be easily changed by other particles bumping into it.","173":"Exactly, the intense gravity and pressure in a supernova create an environment where heavier elements can be fused together, whereas in a star like our sun, the energy isn't sufficient to overcome the binding energy of elements heavier than iron, it's a bit like the difference between a strong magnet that can pull objects together at close range, but repel them at a distance, supernovae are the cosmic equivalent of that strong magnet, but for nuclear fusion.","174":"Can you give me a hint about what specifically is confusing you about the Halting Problem?","175":"I think I see what's going on with H(x,x) now. You're saying it's a special case, but I'm still not sure I understand why it needs to be run that way. Can you give me an example of how H(x,x) would work in practice, so I can see what's going on?","176":"So, what's the halting problem? It's basically a brain-twister that shows us there's some things computers can't do, no matter how smart they get. Imagine you're trying to figure out if a program will ever stop running, or if it'll just keep going forever. Sounds simple, but it turns out to be super tricky. And that's because of this crazy proof called the halting problem. It's like a puzzle that shows us that some problems are just too hard for computers to solve.","177":"The diagonal argument's strength lies in its ability to show that any list of numbers, regardless of its generation or content, will always be incomplete. It doesn't matter how well-crafted or comprehensive the list is \u2013 the argument's conclusion holds, demonstrating that there's always a number missing from the list.","178":"Your rejoinder seems to misunderstand the nature of Cantor's proof. The proof doesn't say that there's no way to generate the list, but rather that any attempt to generate a complete list will always fail, because there's always a number that's left out. It's not about finding a better way to generate the list, but rather about the inherent limitations of trying to list all the numbers.","179":"I see what you're getting at, but nuclear waste is a complex issue, and dilution isn't the solution. We can't just assume that spreading it out will make it safe. The isotopes in nuclear waste have long half-lives, and they can accumulate in the food chain, just like you said. The examples of Fukushima and Chernobyl show us that even small amounts of radioactive material can have devastating effects on the environment and human health. Let's focus on finding safer and more effective ways to manage nuclear waste, rather than downplaying its risks.","180":"You're still missing the point about the dangers of radioactive contamination. The key issue isn't just the amount of radiation present, but how it accumulates in the food chain. Even if the initial burst of radiation has decayed, the radioactive isotopes can still be present in the environment and be ingested by marine life. The fact that seafood from Fukushima has been declared safe to eat is not necessarily a guarantee of its safety, and the short time frame for this declaration is concerning. The differences between the A-bombs and Chernobyl are not as relevant as the fact that both were catastrophic and had devastating effects on the environment and human health. The real question is, what are the long-term consequences of radioactive contamination on the ecosystem and human health?","181":"The rumour involved a statement Weinstein allegedly made about the victim, which was then reported to the authorities, leading to his arrest.","182":"The value of your shares lies in the potential for long-term growth, not just the immediate return on dividends. The company's ability to reinvest profits and expand its operations can increase the value of your shares over time, even if you don't receive dividends.","183":"That doesn't make sense to me - if I choose to reinvest my dividend, why can't I simply instruct the company to hold back my dividend and issue me additional shares instead? It seems like that would be a more straightforward solution than trying to decide whether to pay dividends in stock or cash.","184":"And what if the company isn't performing well, and the board of directors decides to cut dividends to invest in the company's future? That's a common scenario, and it's not necessarily a bad thing for long-term investors.","185":"I'd appreciate it if you could clarify the connection you see between an MLM and an IPO, because on the surface, they seem like very different concepts. Can you walk me through your thought process and what led you to make this comparison?","186":"You didn't address how the value of the product is created, and who gets to benefit from it. In a traditional supply chain, the value is created by the farmer, the distributor, and the retailer, and they all get a share of the profit. But in an MLM, the value is created by the individual seller, and they get to keep most of the profit, which is a significant departure from the way value is typically created and distributed in traditional markets.","187":"But think of it this way: with stocks, you're essentially buying a piece of a company, without having any control over how it's run. It's like buying a ticket to a concert - you might get to enjoy the music, but you can't change the setlist or the venue. With wholesalers, on the other hand, you're more like a co-owner, with a stake in the business and a say in how it's run. That's a pretty big difference, isn't it?","188":"The thing is, the water we waste isn't actually gone - it's just cycling back into the atmosphere and eventually falling back to Earth as rain. It's not like we're draining a finite pool, but rather reusing water that's already in circulation. Think of it like a big water loop: water evaporates, condenses, and then falls back to the ground, ready to be used again. So, while it might feel like we're wasting water, we're not actually losing anything - we're just part of the natural water cycle.","189":"I'll be keeping an eye on this conversation, looking forward to seeing some innovative ideas and solutions from you. Let's keep the discussion civil and focused on finding a cost-effective way to purify salt water.","190":"When you hear a catchy song, it can get stuck in your short-term memory because it's easy to remember.

I'm hurt \ud83d\ude02","192":"The reason you can't split an atom using a knife or a hammer is because the bonds between atoms are incredibly strong, requiring an enormous amount of energy to break. This energy is far beyond what any physical object, including a knife or a hammer, can provide. To put it simply, the forces involved in atomic interactions are on a scale that's much too small for a knife or a hammer to affect. If we want to split atoms, we need to use specialized equipment that can provide the necessary energy, like particle accelerators. These machines can accelerate subatomic particles to incredibly high speeds, allowing us to study and manipulate atomic bonds in a controlled environment.","193":"If you go 50% of the speed of light, you'll create a tiny explosion, releasing a tiny fraction of the sun's energy. Think of it like a tiny firework. It's not enough to cause any damage, but it's still a really cool effect. And, as the xkcd comic shows, it's not something you'd ever experience in your daily life, but it's an interesting idea to think about.","194":"It's because of the relativistic effects, which create a kind of temporal asymmetry between the spacecraft's reference frame and the outside universe. As you approach relativistic speeds, time dilation becomes significant, and even if you were to throttle back your engines, the spacecraft would continue to experience time at a different rate than the outside environment. This means that, from the spacecraft's perspective, the time it takes to slow down would be prolonged, making it difficult to coordinate a safe landing. Meanwhile, from the outside universe's perspective, the spacecraft would still be moving at a relativistic speed, making it challenging to predict its trajectory and initiate a controlled deceleration. The combination of these effects makes it extremely difficult to design and control relativistic spacecraft, as the usual rules of physics no longer apply in the same way.","195":"The atmosphere doesn't stratify by molecular mass because the process of diffusion and the constant mixing of gases due to atmospheric circulation and wind patterns prevent heavier gases like CO2 from accumulating at the bottom. Additionally, the Earth's atmosphere is not a static system, it's constantly being influenced by various factors such as weather patterns, ocean currents, and volcanic eruptions, which all contribute to the homogenization of the gas mixture. So, while it's true that CO2 is a heavier gas, it's not able to settle at the bottom due to the dynamic nature of the atmosphere.","196":"Yeah, it's not that simple. Even if CO2 is at ground level, it's usually not at high enough levels to cause harm. But in a small, enclosed space, it can build up quickly and replace the oxygen, which is a big problem. That's what we need to worry about.","197":null,"198":"In analog, the gate voltage is not strong enough to completely turn on another transistor, but it can still control the amount of current flowing through it, allowing for many shades of grey between complete off and complete on.","199":"Analog signals can represent a continuous range of values, not just discrete values like 0 and 1. For example, a sound wave or a light wave can have a value of 0.5 volts or 2.3 amps, and these values can change smoothly over time. This is in contrast to digital signals, which can only be 0 or 1 at any given time. Does that make sense?","200":"I'm starting to think that you're missing the bigger picture here.

Can you tell me more about what specifically is concerning you about the case?","204":"Plastic window wrap creates a buffer zone of still air that's resistant to heat transfer, which is a more accurate and detailed explanation of how it works. This buffer zone reduces heat conduction and convection, making it an effective thermal insulator.","205":"I see what you're getting at. But wouldn't that mean it's not just a simple matter of blocking or trapping heat, but rather how the plastic film interacts with the existing heat inside the vehicle? It's almost like it's a two-way street, where the plastic film is both blocking and reflecting heat, depending on the conditions.","206":null,"207":"Christianity started to spread quickly across the Roman Empire, especially in the eastern parts. It became popular among ordinary people and even some rich and powerful people. The early Christian communities were well-organized and had many teachers and missionaries who helped spread their message.","208":"I think that's a great question. One of the key factors was the conversion of the Roman aristocracy. They saw Christianity as a way to legitimize their power as the Roman Empire began to decline. But what's even more fascinating is that the early Christian church also had a very effective strategy for spreading their message. They leveraged their strong organizational structure, with bishops in each city, to communicate with each other and reach new people. And it's interesting to note that they were particularly successful in the Eastern provinces, like Egypt and Syria. What do you think about the role of Emperor Constantine's own conversion in all of this?","209":null,"210":"If we were to attempt to purify saltwater on a large scale, wouldn't that also require significant amounts of energy and resources, potentially leading to unintended consequences like increased greenhouse gas emissions and strain on our planet's already fragile ecosystem?","211":"I'm not sure I understand your perspective on this - could you help me see the logic behind your suggestion?","212":"Listen, I think I understand what you're getting at with your idea, and I have to admit, it's a bit of a wild card, but it's also kind of fascinating. You want to use vacuum tubes to capture methane as it's released from the arctic tundra, and then somehow process it or store it or something. Am I right? And I have to ask, what makes you think this is a viable solution, given all the logistical and environmental concerns that have been raised? I'm not trying to be confrontational, but I do want to understand your thought process here.","213":"You think you're trying to expose my supposed hypocrisy, but all you're really doing is highlighting your own lack of understanding of the issue. Instead of making assumptions about my political views, why not engage in a meaningful conversation about the topic at hand?","214":"I think we got sidetracked, let's focus on the original point I was trying to make about your comment regarding micro purchases and the hypocrisy you perceived in it.","215":"Actually, in many workplaces, afros are perfectly fine. It's really about creating a respectful and inclusive environment where people feel comfortable being themselves. Most countries and companies focus on ensuring that hairstyles don't pose a safety risk or create a distraction, rather than policing people's personal choices.","216":"I'm not sure what's more telling, your attempts to provoke me or your apparent lack of interest in having a genuine conversation.","217":"Full metal jacket ammo is designed for applications where penetration is crucial, such as hunting large game or in military contexts where a clean wound is desired. The metal jacket helps to preserve the bullet's kinetic energy and maintain its shape upon impact, reducing the likelihood of fragmentation and subsequent loss of velocity. In contrast, hollow-point ammunition is designed to expand upon impact, creating a larger wound channel and increasing the chances of incapacitating the target. However, this also means it's more prone to jamming in semi-automatic and automatic firearms. The choice between the two ultimately depends on the specific requirements of the situation and the desired outcome.","218":"And yeah, I was thinking about that when I read the article about the Army wanting to switch to a new round that\u2019s more effective against armor, but I'm not sure I agree with the decision.","219":"Yeah, that's a good point, and it's one reason why I prefer the green-tip over the HP round. The green-tip's got a bit more penetration power, but it's also less likely to over-penetrate and hit bystanders. Plus, if you're in a situation where you're taking fire from a distance, the green-tip's got a bit more range and accuracy. It's all about finding the right balance between stopping power and minimizing collateral damage.","220":"Alcoholism is considered a disease because it's a chronic condition that affects the brain and behavior, making it difficult for people to control their drinking. It's similar to other conditions like diabetes or heart disease, where the body's normal functioning is disrupted. In the case of alcoholism, the brain's reward system is altered, leading to compulsive drinking behavior. So, while the substance itself isn't the disease, the way it affects the brain and behavior is what makes it a disease.","221":"The term 'Noble' in chemistry actually originates from the Latin 'nobilis', meaning 'distinguished' or 'exalted'. It refers to the fact that these elements are chemically inert and don't readily form compounds with other elements, making them stand out for their unique properties.","222":"Actually, the process of radioactive decay is a bit more complex than a simple 'everything decays into lead' scenario. The elements heavier than lead can indeed decay into lighter elements, but they can also undergo a process called alpha, beta, or gamma decay, which can result in a range of different elements. Additionally, some elements can undergo a process called neutron capture, where they absorb neutrons and become heavier elements. So, while it's true that many elements will eventually decay into lead, it's not a straightforward process, and new elements can be formed through these processes.","223":"I think it's possible to create new elements, both naturally and artificially. As for the number, I'd say it's unlikely to go beyond 5,000. In stars, you can synthesize elements up to iron, but for heavier elements, you need neutron stars or supernovae. Lab-made elements are also possible, but they're expensive and hard to produce. There's no theoretical limit, but it's unlikely we'll make new elements, so I think 5,000 is a reasonable estimate.","224":"However, the increased FICA taxes would still be a significant burden on employers, but it's essential to consider the potential long-term benefits of a government-run system, such as reduced administrative costs and improved cost containment. We should also examine the evidence on government-run systems in other countries, such as the UK's National Health Service, to see if their experiences can inform our own approach.","225":"However, while removing private insurance middlemen could indeed reduce costs, government inefficiency can also arise from other sources, such as bureaucratic processes, lack of competition, or inadequate cost-control measures, which can ultimately lead to increased costs. A more compelling example is the Veterans Administration healthcare system, which, despite being a single-payer system, has been plagued by inefficiencies and cost overruns. Furthermore, the lack of transparency and accountability in government-run programs can also lead to mismanagement and waste, which can drive up costs. ","226":"I think the issue with billionaires and millionaires is that their wealth often comes at the expense of others, and it can exacerbate social and economic inequalities. For example, when companies pay their CEOs millions of dollars, it can lead to a widening gap between the rich and the poor. Additionally, the concentration of wealth among a small elite can lead to a lack of economic mobility for others, making it harder for people to improve their socio-economic status. This can have negative consequences for society as a whole, such as decreased social cohesion, increased income inequality, and a lack of access to essential services and opportunities.","227":"They're called Noble Gases because they don't readily react with other elements, which is similar to how nobility in the past was considered to be above commoners. But it's not a reference to aristocrats or Buddhist nobility \u2013 it's just a name that stuck because of their unique properties. Think of it like a nickname that's been passed down through the years.","228":"The decay chains of elements can be quite complex and involve multiple steps, but ultimately, they all tend to decay into stable isotopes of lead or other heavy elements like bismuth or thallium. To simplify things, let's look at the decay chains of uranium-238 and uranium-235, which are shown in the diagrams I've linked. Both of these chains involve the decay into radon, but radon is not the end of the line. Instead, it decays further into other elements, eventually reaching a stable isotope. Think of it like a series of chemical reactions that keep happening until the reactants are no longer radioactive. So, to answer your question, radon will indeed decay into something else, and that something else will decay into something else, and so on, until it reaches a stable point.","229":"Radon is a radioactive gas that decays into polonium-218, which then decays into astatine-218, and that's where the chain gets a bit more complicated, but it ultimately leads to the stable isotopes of lead and bismuth, so radon is not the end of the decay chain, but rather a transitional step towards the heavier, more stable elements.","230":"Actually, the noble elements are stable and don\u2019t decay into lead or any other element. Lead, on the other hand, is a radioactive metal that decays into stable isotopes of other elements, but not into the noble elements. The half-life of lead is actually quite long, but it does decay into bismuth, a less radioactive element. It\u2019s a bit of a complex process, but essentially lead decays through a series of radioactive transformations until it reaches a stable form. And as for the periodic table, you\u2019re right that it\u2019s possible for new elements to be added to the 8th row, but the 19th group is unlikely to be added because it would require the discovery of new elements with specific properties that fit into that group.","231":"You're right, I don't have firsthand empirical experience. But I'm trying to provide an explanation based on the current state of knowledge. Can we focus on the facts as they stand, rather than speculating about what might be possible in the future?","232":"I've studied the historical context of the periodic table's development and the process of discovering new elements, which has given me a deeper understanding of the challenges and uncertainties involved in predicting the existence of new elements.","233":"Actually, I was trying to understand your perspective, and I was hoping you could explain to me why you think skipping gears is a bad idea.","234":null,"235":"I think I was oversimplifying things when I said editing numbers on a computer \u2013 what you're saying is that the central bank does control the money supply, but it's not quite as straightforward as just typing numbers into a spreadsheet.","236":"Actually, the idea of burying radioactive waste is a lot more complex than just digging a hole and covering it with concrete. The main issue is that the waste remains radioactive for thousands of years, and even a thick concrete lid wouldn't be able to contain it forever. Plus, the ocean is a dynamic environment with currents and tides that could potentially stir up the waste and spread it around. Not to mention, there are also concerns about the impact on marine life and the ecosystem. The best approach would be to find a site that's geologically stable, has a low risk of earthquakes, and is far from populated areas. And even then, it's not just about finding a place, but also about designing a proper disposal system that can safely contain the waste for an extended period. It's a challenging problem that requires a lot of scientific expertise and careful planning.","237":"If you buy shares in a company that's growing and not paying dividends, it's like buying a house or a piece of art \u2013 the value is in the potential for appreciation over time, not in generating income. The company's growth and increasing market value can still make your shares more valuable, even if they're not producing dividends. It's a long-term investment strategy, where the goal is to sell the shares for a higher price than you bought them for, rather than relying on dividends for income.","238":"The value of your shares is likely to appreciate over time, allowing you to sell them for a higher price than you initially purchased them for, even if the company doesn't distribute dividends. This appreciation can be attributed to the company's growth and increasing profitability, which can lead to a higher market value of the shares.","239":"The board's decision is based on a balance between short-term and long-term goals, and they need to consider the potential impact on all shareholders, not just those who want dividends. They also have to think about the company's growth prospects and whether paying dividends would hinder that growth. It's not just about giving shareholders more stocks, but about making decisions that benefit the company as a whole.","240":null,"241":"You're saying that just because there's some risk involved in buying apples from the orchard, it's not the same as buying stocks. With stocks, you're not buying a tangible product that can spoil, for example. The risk you take on when buying apples is different from the risk you take on when buying stocks, because with stocks, you're essentially betting on the company's performance, whereas with apples, you're taking on the risk of spoilage or the market demand changing.","242":"That's a fair point, but think of stocks as a way to participate in the growth and potential of a company, rather than a physical good you can hold in your hand.","243":"Analog signals are like a volume knob, they can have any level in between, not just a binary 0 or 1. They can represent a wide range of values, like the pitch or loudness of a sound, or the brightness of a light. This allows them to capture and transmit more nuanced information than digital signals, which are limited to just two values.","244":"A share isn't just about getting a part of the profits - it's also a claim on the company's assets and a responsibility for its debts. When you buy a share, you're essentially saying that you believe in the company's future and are willing to take on some of the risks that come with it. If the company does well, you'll get a share of the profits, but if it does poorly, you might end up losing some or all of your investment. It's a bit like being a partner in a business, where you're not just getting a share of the profits, but also helping to make decisions and taking on some of the responsibilities that come with it.","245":"It's a bit like flipping houses or trading stocks, where you're betting on the company's future growth and hoping to cash in before the price drops.","246":null,"247":"Planck time is a unit of time defined as the time it would take a photon to travel the Planck length, which is the distance scale at which the effects of quantum gravity become significant. It's approximately 5.4 x 10^-44 seconds.","248":"Actually, photons are considered to be point-like particles, but they do have a tiny, but non-zero, spatial extent, which is known as the Compton wavelength. This means that while they can be thought of as having no size at all in many situations, they do have a very small size that becomes important when you're dealing with very high-energy interactions or when you're trying to understand certain quantum effects.","249":"I think one reason girls' puberty can be more complex is that their reproductive system is more intricate, with the uterus and ovaries playing a crucial role in their development. Additionally, hormonal fluctuations can be more pronounced in girls, leading to a wider range of physical and emotional changes. In contrast, boys' puberty tends to be more straightforward, with fewer hormonal fluctuations and a simpler reproductive system. However, it's essential to remember that every individual's experience with puberty is unique, and there's no one-size-fits-all explanation. It's great that you're curious and willing to learn more \u2013 feel free to ask me any questions you have, and I'll do my best to provide a helpful response!","250":"That's correct, so if you were to observe a plane from space, its orientation would appear inverted due to its constant downward direction.","251":"Actually, if you increase FICA taxes, you're not necessarily increasing the amount of money that employees are paying out of pocket. Many employers already pass the cost of FICA taxes on to their employees in the form of lower wages or benefits. So, the impact on employees' out-of-pocket expenses might be minimal. ","252":"That's a great point about eliminating private insurance middlemen. However, governments often struggle to streamline their own administrative processes, which can lead to inefficiencies and increased costs. Additionally, government programs may face unique challenges in managing costs, such as addressing fraud and ensuring equitable access to care. These complexities can make it difficult to predict the true cost savings of a government-provided healthcare system.","253":"Non-dividend shares are often compared to art because their value is subjective and can fluctuate based on market demand. Unlike wholesalers, where you have tangible ownership of goods and face competition from other companies, non-dividend shares don't represent a direct claim on a company's assets. Instead, their value is influenced by the company's financial performance, investor sentiment, and market trends. In times of economic uncertainty, companies may buy back their own shares to stabilize their stock price, which can impact the value of non-dividend shares.","254":"You're still right that there's risk involved in selling apples, but that's true for any investment or business venture. The key difference is that with apples, you have more control over your losses and can take steps to mitigate them, like finding alternative uses for rotten apples or selling them at a lower price. It's a more flexible and manageable risk compared to investing in something that may not be in demand or usable.","255":"Alcoholism is a complex condition that involves a combination of biological, psychological, and environmental factors. When we say it's a disease, we're not absolving individuals of responsibility, but rather acknowledging that it's a chronic condition that can affect anyone, regardless of their willpower or choices. It's like diabetes \u2013 you can't just'snap out of it' or 'be stronger' to manage your blood sugar levels. Similarly, alcoholism requires a comprehensive treatment approach that addresses the physical, emotional, and social aspects of the condition. By understanding it as a disease, we can work towards a more compassionate and effective response, rather than stigmatizing those who are struggling.","256":"The point is that addiction is a complex issue, and whether or not someone chooses to engage in addictive behaviors is not the primary concern. The focus should be on understanding the underlying disease process that drives addiction, rather than blaming the individual for their choices.","257":"The Nazi Party is often considered far-right because its ideology combines authoritarianism with a strong emphasis on nationalism, militarism, and anti-communism. This blend of characteristics is more commonly associated with the far-right, even if the party's centralised and regulated state might suggest otherwise. I'm happy to clarify any aspects that might be unclear.","258":"You're not doing a good job of hiding your own biases and making assumptions about me, which is ironic given your accusations.","259":null,"260":"I think the emotional connections and culture surrounding a school can be complex and multifaceted. While it's true that people form strong bonds with their peers and experiences within the institution, it's also possible to appreciate the role the school played in facilitating those connections without necessarily valuing the institution itself. It's a subtle distinction, but one that might help clarify why some people feel a strong sense of loyalty or gratitude towards their alma mater.","261":"I think that's a really astute observation. The emotional connections and sense of community that people form at school can make it feel like a second family, and that can be a powerful motivator for people to invest time and effort into the school. It's not just about the relationships they form with individual people, but also about the shared experiences and memories that they create with their peers and the school community as a whole. This can make it difficult to separate the personal relationships from the school's culture and identity, because they become intertwined in a way that's hard to untangle.","262":"That's a clever analogy, but I think we're getting at a more nuanced issue here. If the value of money is tied to the central bank's ability to print it, then how do we account for the fact that the value of money can also be influenced by other factors, such as economic growth, interest rates, and consumer confidence?","263":"The concept of a code implies a level of intentionality and purpose that is not present in the chemical reactions that occur in DNA, which are governed by physical laws and chance events, such as mutations, rather than a predetermined plan or design.","264":"Actually, the relationship between land use and animal agriculture is a bit more complex than that. While it's true that animal agriculture takes up a significant portion of the land, the type of land use also plays a crucial role. For example, some areas are used for grazing, while others are used for growing feed crops for livestock. Additionally, the efficiency of land use can vary greatly depending on factors like climate, soil quality, and farming practices. So, let's dig a bit deeper into the numbers and explore how different types of land use contribute to the overall environmental impact of animal agriculture.","265":"A non-dividend share is a type of stock that doesn't distribute a portion of the company's profits to its shareholders in the form of dividends. This can be due to various reasons, such as the company reinvesting its earnings to fuel growth, paying off debt, or simply choosing not to distribute dividends. Some investors buy non-dividend shares because they believe the company's future growth prospects are strong, and the stock's value will increase over time, making it a potentially lucrative investment opportunity. They might also be attracted to the company's unique business model, innovative products or services, or its competitive advantage in the market. In essence, non-dividend shares can be a way for investors to participate in a company's growth story, even if it doesn't provide immediate returns in the form of dividends.","266":"I think you're right that rarity alone isn't enough to make something valuable. But in the case of a stock, the value comes from the company's underlying assets and the potential for it to grow and return value to its shareholders in the future. So, even if a company doesn't pay dividends, its stock can still be worth something because of its potential for growth and the value of the assets it owns. Does that make sense?","267":null,"268":"Think of it this way: owning a piece of Amazon is like owning a tiny piece of a big, growing pie. If the pie keeps getting bigger, your slice gets bigger too, even if you don't get a direct share of the pie right now.","269":"The development of complex molecules like viruses and DNA involves a combination of chemical reactions and the process of self-organization, where simple molecules interact and assemble into more complex structures through a series of chemical interactions and physical forces. This process is thought to have occurred over billions of years, with the emergence of life being a gradual and incremental process rather than a sudden event.","270":"I'm not claiming infallibility, but I'd love to hear more about what specifically you think I'm getting wrong.

Can you help me understand what specific aspects of the removal reason were unclear or unhelpful to you?","273":"I'd like to clarify that the concept of astute applies to making informed decisions, particularly in situations where there's a need for discernment and precision. Can you help me understand how the idea of paying for tutoring relates to being astute in this context?","274":"Think of it this way: when you pay yourself a salary, you're just moving money from one bucket to another. It's still coming out of the business's revenue, and it's still an expense.","275":"I see what you're getting at, but the way you're framing it is a bit misleading. In accounting, the distinction between revenue, profit, and expenses is crucial. When you pay yourself, it's considered a business expense, which reduces your revenue, not your profit. Think of it like this: your revenue is the total income your business generates, profit is what's left over after expenses, and expenses are the costs you incur to operate the business. So, if you pay yourself, that's an expense, not profit. Does that clarify things?","276":null,"277":"However, the term 'engine braking' typically refers to the practice of downshifting to a lower gear when coasting or descending a slope, in order to control the vehicle's speed and maintain traction. It's a technique used to slow down the vehicle without relying on the brakes, and it can be an effective way to preserve brake life and maintain vehicle control. It's possible that you're using the term to describe a different driving technique, but I think it's worth clarifying the distinction to ensure we're on the same page.","278":"ARM processors are indeed more power-efficient, which is a significant contributor to their cooling efficiency. One key reason for this is that ARM processors can dynamically adjust their clock speed and voltage to minimize power consumption, especially when idle. This is partly due to their design philosophy, which prioritizes power awareness and often employs lower voltage and simpler instruction sets. As a result, ARM processors tend to produce less heat, making them easier to cool. This, combined with their lower power consumption, makes them a more efficient choice for mobile devices where cooling can be a significant challenge.","279":"Talking about wages can be seen as impolite because it can disrupt the balance of power in a workplace. When you discuss your salary, you're potentially implying that you're not being paid fairly, which can be uncomfortable for managers who want to keep things simple. In some workplaces, salaries are more open and transparent, which can make it easier to talk about wages.","280":"I've also worked in places where the pay was opaque, and it was frustrating to try to figure out what others were making. I think that's often because those workplaces were more informal or lacked transparency in their compensation practices. I've noticed that in some industries, like non-profits or small businesses, it's not uncommon for pay to be based on factors like performance or seniority, rather than a clear, standardized scale. It's interesting to hear that you've had similar experiences with unionizing efforts being shut down. Have you found that there's a particular type of workplace or industry that's more or less receptive to unionization?","281":"I can imagine how frustrating it must be to deal with that kind of treatment. It's not just about the minimum wage, though - I think it's also about the lack of respect and power that comes with being an employee. When workers are seen as replaceable and disposable, it's easier for companies to exploit them.","282":"Have you checked out any online forums or communities for people in the service industry? They can be a great resource for sharing tips and advice on navigating tough situations and learning more about workers' rights.","283":"When it comes to genitalia amputees, the relationship between their physical and emotional experiences of sexual urges is quite complex. While it's true that the removal of genitalia can reduce or eliminate sexual urges in some individuals, it's not a straightforward process. The production of testosterone, a hormone that contributes to sexual desire, is one factor to consider. However, the brain also plays a significant role, and the removal of genitalia doesn't necessarily eliminate the brain's ability to produce sexual thoughts or desires. In fact, some individuals may still experience sexual urges even after genitalia amputee, due to the brain's ability to adapt and compensate for the loss. It's also worth noting that psychological factors such as trauma, stress, and past experiences can contribute to sexual urges. So, it's a complex interplay of physical and psychological factors that need to be considered.","284":"Yes, it's the testicles that produce testosterone, which is a crucial hormone responsible for the development of male characteristics, including sexual urges and desires. However, I should clarify that the relationship between testosterone and sexual desire is more complex than I initially stated. While testosterone does play a significant role, other factors such as brain chemistry, emotions, and individual experiences also contribute to sexual desire. Additionally, it's worth noting that the historical practice of castration was not a foolproof method of eliminating sexual desire, as some individuals may still experience some level of sexual attraction or interest. I'd be happy to discuss this further and provide more information on the topic.","285":"You're welcome! I'm glad I could share some interesting information with you. I've also been reading about the history of eunuchs in different cultures and it's quite fascinating. It's worth noting that eunuchs weren't just men, but also women and even children in some cases. The practice of castration had different purposes, like punishment or creating a special class of servants. I think it's interesting to learn more about this complex topic.","286":"That's actually a great point. People did use other metals like silver and copper for coins, but gold was a very popular choice because it's durable, doesn't corrode easily, and has a high value-to-weight ratio. However, the reason gold became the most widely accepted form of currency is because of its rarity and the fact that it's difficult to produce. This made gold a more valuable and scarce commodity, which is why it became a standard unit of exchange. ","287":"So, I've always wondered, did people just lose out on money when they got shaved coins, or was there some kind of system in place to make up for it?","288":"Yeah, I'm a bit of a hobby chemist, and I love the hands-on stuff, but I'm also really curious about the science behind it \u2013 the theories and models that make it all work.","289":"The idea of harvesting methane from the melting arctic is an intriguing one, but it's a complex issue that requires a deep understanding of the geological processes at play. While it's true that methane can seep out of the ground and into the atmosphere, the scale of the problem is indeed massive, and any potential solution would need to be carefully considered and implemented. However, I'd like to challenge the notion that it's simply a matter of 'vacuuming it up with big harvesters.' The reality is that methane is a potent greenhouse gas that plays a significant role in climate change, and addressing its release from the arctic requires a multifaceted approach that involves not just technological solutions, but also policy changes, international cooperation, and a fundamental shift in our relationship with the natural world. Let's not oversimplify this issue, but rather work together to explore the many complexities and nuances involved.","290":"I think I see where the frustration is coming from - we're not just talking about the technical feasibility of your ideas, but also the sheer scale and environmental impact of covering millions of square miles of arctic tundra with vacuum tubes. It's a pretty radical proposal, and I'm not sure it's something we should be taking seriously without a lot more discussion and consideration. Can we take a step back and talk about what you're really trying to achieve here, and what you think the benefits of this approach might be? I'm genuinely curious to understand your perspective, and I think we can have a more productive conversation if we can find a way to communicate that works for both of us.","291":"I think there's a fundamental misunderstanding of the concept we're discussing. If it's indeed leaking through every single square foot of land, then a grid of vacuum tubs would be a good starting point, but it would need to be accompanied by a fundamental shift in how we approach land management and resource allocation. We can't just add more infrastructure without rethinking the entire system. It's not a matter of simply scaling up the solution, but rather reimagining the problem from the ground up.","292":"The term 'Nazi' is often used to describe a type of authoritarian and nationalist ideology that is commonly associated with the far-right. This is because the Nazi Party's ideology was rooted in racist and nationalist beliefs, which are typical of far-right ideologies. Although the term 'Nazi' technically refers to a form of socialism, as it sought to control the means of production and regulate the economy in the name of the state, its association with far-right ideology has become deeply ingrained in historical and political discourse.","293":"I'm not sure that's accurate, because the left and right spectrum is more complicated than just economy. The Nazis were all over the place - some of their policies were pretty left-wing, while others were super far-right. It's hard to pin them down to just one side of the spectrum.","294":"I think you're hitting on something really important here - the left-right axis can be a useful starting point, but it's indeed a simplification, and it's fascinating to explore how ideologies like fascism and Nazism subvert or blend elements from both sides in complex ways. It's almost as if they're saying, 'I'll take the authoritarian aspects of the right and the populist fervor of the left, but I'll reject the social welfare and equality aspects of the left, and the individualism and free market aspects of the right.'

It's as if the frequency has a life of its own, and it can create an atmosphere that's hard to shake off.","296":"Yes, theoretically, you can create a haunted house by using a device that emits 18.9 Hz frequency, but it's essential to consider the psychological and environmental factors that could influence the experience. For instance, the individual's expectation, past experiences, and the ambiance of the location could all contribute to the perceived intensity of the phenomenon. Moreover, the actual effect would also depend on the sensitivity of the people experiencing it and the environment they are in. It's also worth noting that the 'haunting' effect might not be limited to the 18.9 Hz frequency alone, but could be a combination of various factors, including resonance, acoustic anomalies, and even the power of suggestion.","297":"You can't just dump radioactive waste into the ocean because it's not a natural process and it would have severe environmental and health impacts. For instance, the waste would contaminate marine life, potentially affecting the entire food chain, and also pose a risk to people who consume seafood.

It's a bit like saying that a 'true' fan of a particular band can only be someone who likes all of their albums, and anyone who doesn't like one of their albums can't be a true fan. This kind of thinking can be tricky to spot, but it's actually a pretty common way that people try to avoid having a genuine conversation about what makes a group or category.","302":"They're not necessarily using an appeal to authority, but rather, they're making a subjective claim that their favorite director is superior, which might be based on personal taste, but it's not necessarily a fallacious argument.","303":"So, you think the mods made a decision based on personal preference rather than site rules?","304":"I appreciate your passion and willingness to defend the person in question.

What are the next steps you'd recommend, and how can I work with you to get the answers I need?","306":"I see what you mean about the tesseract being the next evolution of the cube. That's a fascinating idea. Can you tell me more about how you envision this 3D model? How would it differ from the 8-cube model you're looking at? And what do you think are the key characteristics of a tesseract that would make it the next logical step in this progression?","307":"I think you might be confusing the concept of a tesseract with a 4D object. You're describing a 4D object, which is a more general concept that encompasses the idea of a tesseract. It's like the difference between a square and a cube - a cube is a 3D object that's a specific type of square, but not all squares are cubes. Similarly, a tesseract is a specific type of 4D object, but not all 4D objects are tesseracts.","308":"I think I see what you're referring to now. The Tesseract model you're familiar with is indeed a more simplified representation. The one I was looking at is a bit more complex, but it's great that you're able to visualize it as a cube within a cube. When you say it rotates in and out of itself, are you thinking of the way it can be unfolded or manipulated in 3D space?","309":"It seems like you're suggesting that the product placement is more noticeable to you now that you have the product, and that's making you wonder how companies are able to confirm your interests and show you targeted ads.

You're asking how the company is doing this, and you're genuinely curious about the method behind their action. It's not about assuming a product, but rather understanding their process. Confirmation bias wouldn't apply in this case, as you're seeking information to learn, not just confirming a preconceived notion.","311":"The minimum age requirement is rooted in the Constitution, specifically Article II, Section 1, which stipulates that the president must be at least 35 years old. This age requirement is meant to ensure that the president has acquired a certain level of life experience, wisdom, and maturity before assuming the highest office in the land. The idea is that this age threshold allows individuals to have a solid foundation in their personal and professional lives, making them more equipped to handle the demands and responsibilities of the presidency.

Can you elaborate on why you think that is?","314":"I see your point about the imperfections of the current system, but the issue with narcoanalysis tests is that they can be unreliable and prone to manipulation. While it's true that the current system isn't perfect, it does provide a certain level of due process and protection for the accused. Narcoanalysis tests, on the other hand, can be used coercively and may not provide a reliable indication of guilt or innocence. In an ideal world, we would have a system that balances the need for efficiency with the need for fairness and accuracy. However, until we have a more reliable and less coercive method, I think it's better to stick with the current system, flaws and all.","315":"And, to make things more interesting, some coins were even 'clipped' \u2013 that's when parts of the coin were literally cut off to make them lighter and worth less!","316":"This is a response to the explainee's question about why it's socially okay for a white person to tan but not for a non-white person to lighten their skin. I think it's because historically, white skin has been the beauty standard, and tanning is seen as a way to get closer to that ideal. Meanwhile, dark skin has been stigmatized, and lightening it is seen as a way to 'improve' it. It's a form of internalized racism, where people of color feel like their natural skin tone is inferior and try to change it to fit societal beauty standards. It's also worth noting that the dangers of skin cancer and UV radiation are often downplayed or ignored when it comes to white people, which is a big part of why tanning is socially acceptable for them.","317":"I was thinking that if someone is naturally pale, they might be more susceptible to sunburn or skin damage, so it's not necessarily about aesthetics, but rather about taking care of their skin and preventing potential harm.","318":"I'm still not clear on your reasoning. Can you help me understand why you think it's okay to avoid the sun and become paler naturally, but not to use a spray tan to achieve the same result? I'm trying to understand the underlying logic behind your statement.","319":"But using sun block or clothes to cover your face is a more nuanced approach than simply avoiding sunlight altogether. It's a way to balance the need for vitamin D with the need to protect oneself from the sun's harsh effects, and it's not about avoiding sunlight, but rather about finding a healthy middle ground.","320":"You're not sure how this is relevant? I think you're misunderstanding my point. I was trying to make a distinction between preventing tanning and actively lightening one's skin. I still think that's an important distinction, even if you don't see the connection. Can we go back to discussing that?","321":"I think there's a misunderstanding - you're right that clothing can provide some protection against UV rays, which is why people get a tan while wearing it. However, the point I was trying to make is that even with some protection, you're still being exposed to sunlight, which can cause tanning. The difference I'm trying to highlight is between being exposed to sunlight and actively trying to lighten your skin, which is a more complex process that requires more than just avoiding the sun.","322":"Honestly, I'm not following how this connects to our discussion about tanning through clothing. Can you help me see the link?","323":"You seem to be misunderstanding the context of our conversation. I'm trying to explain the difference between preventing tanning and actively lightening one's skin, and how they're not the same thing. Can we start over and clarify what you're looking for?","324":"I'm trying to draw a distinction between avoiding tanning as a means of self-preservation and intentionally seeking to lighten one's skin, which is a more complex issue that involves not just physical exposure but also a desire to alter one's appearance, even if that desire is not necessarily about achieving a specific skin tone.","325":"Come on, seriously? You're still not getting it? I just explained that you can't rely on clothes to protect you from the sun's UV rays, and you're just brushing it off with a laugh. That's not how we have a productive conversation. Let's take this seriously for a second - the damage from UV rays can be real, and it's not something to joke about. Can we please get back on track and discuss this in a more respectful manner?","326":"The term 'noble' in chemistry actually originates from the fact that these gases are chemically inert, meaning they don't readily react with other elements to form compounds. This inertness is a result of their full outer energy level, which makes them less inclined to participate in chemical reactions. The name 'noble' doesn't reference the aristocratic or Buddhist connotations you mentioned, but rather highlights their unique chemical properties. In a way, you could say they're like the 'lone wolves' of the periodic table, content to exist independently rather than seeking to form bonds with others.","327":"I think it's highly unlikely that new technology could make a 9th row possible, given the current rate of discovery and the increasing difficulty of creating and detecting heavier elements.","328":"I've been studying the properties of superheavy elements for years and have a deep understanding of the underlying physics and chemistry. While it's difficult to predict exactly when or if new elements will be discovered, my expertise suggests that the challenges of creating heavier elements are significant and may take longer than you might expect.","329":"I think we're getting ahead of ourselves here. We've made significant progress in understanding the periodic table and the properties of elements, but we're still in the early stages of exploring the possibilities of superheavy elements. The fact that we're already discussing the potential for elements beyond the 9th row is a testament to the rapid advancements in technology and our growing understanding of the underlying physics. However, we need to be cautious and consider the limitations of our current knowledge and capabilities before making sweeping predictions about what might be possible in the future.","330":"Actually, it's quite fascinating that we're not at the center of the universe. The universe's expansion is a bit like a cosmic game of tag - galaxies are all moving away from each other, not just from us. It's a mind-blowing reminder that we're just one small part of a vast, ever-changing universe.","331":"I see what's causing the confusion. The theory of dark energy suggests that the expansion of the universe is accelerating, but that doesn't necessarily mean we're not at the center of the universe. Think of it like a balloon being inflated. The expansion of the universe is like the balloon getting bigger, but that doesn't mean the balloon itself has a center or an edge. Similarly, the universe could be expanding in all directions, with us being at the center of our own local bubble of space, without contradicting the idea that we're not at the center of the entire universe. Does that make more sense?","332":null,"333":"I'd recommend checking out the subreddits you mentioned, as they often have threads and discussions about various health issues, which might provide some valuable insights or theories about your specific concern.

Is it something that's been happening to you for a while, or is it a new thing? And what do you mean by'minor and infrequent'? Is it something that's causing you any discomfort or concern?","335":"I think I understand what you mean by 'all word based'. It sounds like your perception of an object is more like a mental catalog of its components, rather than a visual representation. For example, when you think of a camshaft, you might think of its individual parts, like the lobes and the bearings, rather than seeing the entire object in your mind's eye. Is that a fair interpretation?","336":"You were pretty surprised that you could create that mental picture, I think.","337":"Actually, getting vaccinated not only protects you from getting the flu, but also helps prevent the spread of the flu to others, including those who are more vulnerable such as the elderly, young children, and people with certain chronic health conditions.","338":"I get that not having a regular doctor can make it tough to get info on vaccinations. Have you considered reaching out to a local health clinic or community center for guidance on where to get vaccinated?","339":"A period is when a girl's body prepares for a potential pregnancy by thickening the lining of her uterus, and if there's no pregnancy, that lining sheds, resulting in bleeding. It's a natural process that happens every month, and it's different from a boy's development, where they go through puberty and their bodies start to change, but they don't experience a similar shedding of the uterine lining.","340":"It's actually pretty interesting that both boys and girls go through puberty at different rates and in different ways. Some guys might start growing facial hair at 15, while others might not see any until they're 18 or even later. And it's not just about hair \u2013 some guys might develop acne, while others might get taller or stronger before their peers. It's all part of the wild ride that is puberty, and it's normal to feel uncertain or scared, but talking to a trusted adult or doing some research can help you feel more prepared and in control.","341":"That's a great point. One reason puberty can be more complex for girls is that their bodies undergo a more significant transformation to support potential pregnancy. This involves a surge in estrogen levels, which can lead to a range of physical changes, including breast development, menstruation, and a shift in body composition. In contrast, boys' bodies primarily experience a surge in testosterone, which drives the development of secondary sex characteristics like facial hair, deepening voice, and increased muscle mass. While both boys and girls experience significant changes during puberty, the hormonal and physical changes that girls undergo can be more pronounced and unpredictable.","342":"Well, a computer doesn't learn like a human does, but it follows rules we set up. Think of it like a recipe book - we can add new recipes or change existing ones. Computers can do things we didn't explicitly tell them to do, but that's not the same as learning.","343":"Actually, it's more nuanced than that. In an analog circuit, the voltage level can be used to control the circuit's behavior, rather than simply being on or off. For example, a light dimmer switch uses a variable voltage to control the brightness of a light, rather than simply turning it on or off. This means that analog circuits can have a range of states, rather than just two, and the voltage level can be used to determine the circuit's behavior.","344":"I think I see what you mean by that. You're saying that because analog signals can take on any value, they can't be reduced to just on\/off states like digital signals can. Is that correct?","345":"I'm glad I could help you see the irony in prioritizing upvotes over meaningful engagement. Now that I've downvoted your post, does that change your perspective on the value of upvotes?","346":"The thing is, when you smash your finger in cold weather, it's not just the pain that's amplified - the cold also slows down the healing process. The reduced blood flow means that the injury gets less oxygen and nutrients, which can make it harder for your body to repair the damage. Plus, the cold can cause your nerves to become more sensitive, making the pain feel even worse. It's like your finger is saying, 'Hey, I'm already hurt, and now you're making it worse by freezing me solid!'","347":"I get it, those gloves are a must-have for you. I've heard of those battery-powered gloves you mentioned, but I've also seen heated grips on bike handlebars that might do the trick for you. Have you considered those?","348":"I can see why you'd think that, but arm compression sleeves are designed to improve blood flow, not restrict it, so that might actually be a good solution for me.","349":null,"350":"I think that's a very astute observation, and one that I've actually given a lot of thought to. What I've come to realize is that the way we parent can have a profound impact on the values and expectations our children develop, and it's not just about the material things we give them. It's about the messages we send them about what's truly important in life, and how they can achieve their goals and find happiness. By being mindful of the way we're spending and the values we're modeling, I believe we can help our children develop a more nuanced understanding of what it means to be successful and fulfilled, and avoid the pitfalls of consumerism and materialism that can lead to a sense of dissatisfaction and disconnection.","351":"I think you're onto something there. The parents' desire to give their kids the best can indeed create a sense of entitlement, but it's also worth considering the complex interplay between cultural and social pressures. The 'Keeping Up with the Joneses' phenomenon is a real issue, but it's not just about parents trying to one-up each other. It's also about the broader societal expectations around what it means to be successful and happy. When we're constantly bombarded with messages about the importance of material possessions and status symbols, it's hard for kids to develop a sense of what's truly meaningful to them. So, while it's true that parents may be inadvertently creating a sense of entitlement, it's also a reflection of the larger cultural landscape that we're all navigating.","352":"That's a great point, and it highlights the difference between owning a piece of a business and owning a business itself. With a business, you have control over the assets and can make decisions about how to use them, whereas with shares, you're essentially betting on the company's success and hoping to benefit from it when it's sold or liquidated. It's a bit like the difference between owning a house and owning a stock certificate - one gives you a tangible asset that you can use or sell, while the other is more of a financial gamble.","353":"But that's not how it works. If a company doesn't pay dividends, the value of the stock might not necessarily go up, but it's not a direct correlation either. The real issue is that when you reinvest your dividends, you're essentially using your own money to buy more stock at the current market price, which might not be the best use of your funds. If you want to benefit from the company's growth, it's better to let the company decide how to use its profits, rather than trying to'reinvest' your dividends by buying more stock. This way, you can still benefit from the company's success without tying up your own money in the process.","354":"It's not that simple because the company's profits can be reinvested in different ways, such as expanding the business, paying off debt, or even acquiring other companies, rather than directly issuing more shares, so the value of your existing shares isn't necessarily increased by not taking dividends. In fact, if the company reinvests profits effectively, the value of your shares can increase significantly over time, regardless of whether you receive dividends or not. However, it's also possible that the company might make decisions that don't align with your investment goals, and that's where your voting power as a shareholder comes in.","355":"I'd appreciate it if you could break down the specific points of similarity and difference between Mlm and IPO that you see, so I can better understand your analogy and where you think they intersect.","356":"You bring up an interesting point about the direct-to-consumer sales model of MLMs, but I'd argue that the lack of intermediaries doesn't necessarily eliminate the risk of unsold product. Consider a scenario where an MLM distributor has overestimated demand and ends up with a surplus of product. They may still be left with inventory they can't sell, even if it's directly to the end consumer.","357":"Let's focus on the differences between owning a physical product and owning a company's stock. When you buy stock, you're essentially buying a claim on a portion of the company's assets and profits. It's not a direct comparison to owning a tangible product like apples or bolts, but rather a way to participate in the company's potential growth and success.","358":"I see what you're saying about the analogy between buying apples and investing. While it's true that buying apples directly from an orchard involves some risk, I think the analogy breaks down when we consider the flexibility and intrinsic value of apples. Unlike investments, apples have a direct use value that can't be easily replicated. Even if you can't sell them to grocers, you can still eat them or use them for other purposes. In contrast, investments like stocks or yen are largely abstract and don't have the same kind of inherent value.","359":"I think the common cold is a bit like a dormant volcano - it's still present in the environment, but it's not actively erupting as much because there are fewer people around to spread it to. When the weather warms up and people start moving around more, the virus starts to spread again, and that's why we see more cases of the common cold during the peak season. It's not that the virus is 'alive' or 'dead', but rather it's just a matter of how easily it can spread from person to person.","360":"I think you're onto something there. The South Park creators are known for their satire, but it's unsettling to think that some real-life situations are mirroring their comedic style. The COVID-19 narrative has been a perfect example of how misinformation can spread quickly, and it's not just the'smart ones' who are to blame. We need to be more critical of the information we consume and question the sources behind it.","361":"I see your point about the potential for security questions to be answered from public information. The truth is, those questions are often a weak link in the security chain, and they can be particularly vulnerable to targeted attacks. When someone is trying to guess or reset your password, they might start by trying to answer those security questions. If they're able to get the answers right, it can be a quick way in. And, as you mentioned, much of that information can be found online or through public records. For instance, your alma mater, your parents' former addresses, or even your social media profiles might reveal some of the answers. It's a bit like trying to find a needle in a haystack, but with the added pressure of having to get it right before the account gets locked out. So, while 2-factor authentication is an important layer of security, the security question system can be a more straightforward path for someone with malicious intent. It's not foolproof, and it's not as secure as it could be, especially when compared to more robust authentication methods.","362":"It seems counterintuitive that making sensitive information more accessible would lead to increased security costs, but isn't that essentially what would happen if the general public had easier access to that kind of information?","363":"I'd argue that relying on the difficulty of an attack is a flawed approach to security. It's like saying, 'Hey, my house is secure because it's hard to find the key.' No, that's not security \u2013 that's just making it hard for someone to get in. Real security comes from having robust measures in place, not just hoping to deter would-be attackers with complexity.","364":"I think what's missing from your critique is a nuanced understanding of how medical knowledge evolves over time. Can you help me see how you think doctors in the past might have been mistaken about this issue?","365":"Harvey Weinstein was found guilty of rape and sexual assault by a jury that carefully considered the evidence and testimony presented in the case. The conviction was based on the jury's unanimous decision that the prosecution had proven Weinstein's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, a legal standard that requires the evidence to be so compelling that it leaves no room for reasonable doubt. The 23-year sentence was imposed by the judge as a result of the jury's verdict, reflecting the seriousness of Weinstein's crimes and the need to hold him accountable for his actions.","366":"Let's take a step back and reframe the conversation. What specific aspect of the removal reasons or the concept of 'beyond a reasonable doubt' is causing you the most confusion or concern?","367":"I understand you feel strongly about this case, but can you tell me more about what specifically concerns you about the conviction? What do you think might have been overlooked or mishandled during the trial?","368":"I'm glad you're attached to your hair! While there are certainly some business settings where personal style might be more formal or traditional, many companies value diversity and individuality, and there are plenty of roles where you can express yourself freely. It's not about giving up on business, but about finding the right fit for your personality and style. Let's explore some possibilities together!","369":"That's a really interesting question, and it's one that gets to the heart of the tension between personal identity and professional expectations in the business world. I think it's worth exploring what you mean by'self-expression' - is it about being able to express your individuality and creativity, or is it about being able to be yourself without fear of judgment or repercussions? And which aspects of business do you think would be most challenging for someone who values self-expression? For example, would it be the corporate culture, the dress code, the expectations around communication and teamwork, or something else entirely?","370":"I see what you mean about the difference in land between the two halves of the world. It's actually because the continents have been moving and changing shape over millions of years. Sometimes they come together to form a big landmass, and sometimes they break apart. This has happened many times, and it's one reason why we have more land in one half than the other. It's also why we have different types of landscapes and features in different parts of the world.","371":"I think mantle convection is a big part of it. The movement of tectonic plates is driven by heat from the Earth's core and mantle, which causes the plates to move and change over time.","372":"But actually, the continents move at a pretty steady pace, about 2-3 centimeters per year, so it's not like they're stuck in one place forever. It's a slow process, but over millions of years, it can add up and lead to some pretty significant changes.","373":"I think that's a good point about scientists in the future studying the continents, but let's also consider the whole picture - the sea floor spreading and subducting can create new land and volcanoes, and that's a pretty wild process to think about.","374":"That's an interesting point about skin cells, but actually, cancer cells are able to evade normal cell death mechanisms, which allows them to keep growing and forming tumors. This is one of the key reasons why cancer is so hard to treat.","375":"Actually, the statement is a bit misleading. It takes about 1 acre of land to produce enough vegetables for a year, not a month. And cattle require much more land to produce the same amount of food, often up to 26 times more than vegetables. Also, you're right that a significant portion of US land is used for livestock production, around 42%.","376":"In the United States, the NLRA grants employees the right to form and join unions, but employers can challenge the legitimacy of the unionization effort through legal means, such as filing objections with the NLRB.","377":"I think that's a clever idea, but it's still the act of organizing that's being denied, not the proposal itself. Even if you present it as a 'pro-associate benefits group' proposal, the company might still see it as a unionization effort.","378":"I was hoping we could dive into some of the specific concerns surrounding oxybenzone and avobenzone. Can you tell me more about why EWG has flagged them as problematic?","379":"I'm curious, what drew you to this topic in the first place?","380":"The term 'Noble Gases' actually stems from the fact that these elements were considered 'noble' because they didn't readily react with other elements, much like how the nobility of old were thought to be above the common fray, but in this case, it's more a reference to their chemical inertness rather than any aristocratic connotation.","381":"That's a great point about the infrastructure and technology, but let's not forget that the diseases you mentioned were not just limited to America. Smallpox, for example, was also prevalent in Africa, and it's estimated that it killed over 300 million people in the 20th century alone. And it's not just the diseases themselves, but also the lack of healthcare infrastructure and access to medical care that made it even more challenging for African countries to recover. Additionally, the fact that many African countries were colonized and their resources were exploited for centuries has also contributed to their economic and social development being hindered. So, while it's true that America developed vaccines, it's also important to consider the broader historical context and the systemic inequalities that have affected the region.","382":"I see what you're saying about the comparison to the American diseases.

It's not about people having varying understandings of what something means, but about how they use those understandings to avoid confronting the fact that their claim might be flawed or unjustified.","388":"You're looking at this from a more theoretical perspective, rather than focusing on whether people are actually committing the fallacy in real life, right?","389":"The Hidden City ticket is like buying a ticket to a concert, but you only show up for the opening act and leave before the main performer. The airline sold you a ticket to the entire event, but you only used a part of it. That means they can't resell the unused part to someone else, and they have to bear the cost of the entire event themselves. In the same way, when you buy a Hidden City ticket, you're essentially taking a seat that the airline could have sold to someone else at a higher price. It's like you're getting a discount by only using a part of what you paid for, but the airline is left with the full cost of the service they provided. Does that make sense?","390":"But that analogy falters because the restaurant's primary goal is to minimize waste in their production process, whereas an airline's core objective is to optimize revenue through efficient seat utilization. With an airline, the empty seat represents a missed opportunity to generate additional revenue from ancillary services, not just a product that's been paid for. It's akin to a restaurant offering a la carte options \u2013 if a customer orders a meal but doesn't take the dessert, the restaurant still gets to charge for it separately. In the airline's case, the empty seat is a lost chance to sell a separate product, which is a significant contributor to their overall revenue.","391":"It seems like the explainee is trying to understand the airline's perspective and the economics behind their operations, bringing up valid points about market value and the potential for additional overhead costs on certain flights. This is a nuanced discussion, and it's interesting to see how the concept of hidden city ticketing affects the airline's profitability, especially for large carriers like Lufthansa or Delta.","392":"I think that's a good point, but it's also possible that Lufthansa is trying to create a certain image or experience for its customers, and that's what's driving the premium pricing. It's not just about the prestige of flying with them, but also about the overall experience they offer.","393":"I'm not sure I appreciate the game you're playing here, and I'd love to talk about the actual issue at hand rather than trying to outmaneuver each other.","394":"You could think of it as a self-contained operating system within an operating system, that essentially tells the computer how to find and load the actual operating system. It's like a digital key that unlocks the computer's potential, and allows it to start executing instructions from the storage media. This initial process is called booting, and it's a crucial step in getting the computer up and running. During booting, the computer's BIOS (Basic Input\/Output System) program is executed, which is a set of instructions that initializes all the connected hardware and eventually tells the CPU to start loading instructions from the storage media. It's a bit like a chain reaction, where the computer's BIOS program is the catalyst that sets everything in motion, and allows the computer to start executing the actual operating system.","395":"When I said it's hardwired, I meant that the CPU's design and manufacture include a built-in 'blueprint' that tells it how to process and execute instructions, kind of like a recipe book that's already programmed into it. The BIOS, as you mentioned, is a key part of that process, but it's not the only one. The CPU's architecture is what ultimately allows it to understand and follow the instructions stored in memory.","396":"The CPU's operation is based on the manipulation of electrical signals through a series of complex digital circuits. These circuits are designed to perform specific logical operations, such as AND, OR, and NOT, which are the building blocks of more complex operations. The CPU's instruction set is essentially a set of recipes that dictate how these circuits should be combined to produce the desired output. When an instruction is executed, the CPU's circuits are configured to perform the corresponding operation, which involves a series of signal transformations and processing steps. This process is often described as a series of 'bit-level' operations, where the CPU's circuits manipulate individual bits of information to produce the final output. ","397":"Think of it like a recipe. The input is like a specific ingredient, and the output is like the final dish. The computer takes that input and uses a series of instructions, like a recipe, to convert it into the desired output.","398":"That's a great point. You're saying that the No True Scotsman fallacy often arises from a misunderstanding or mismatch in how people define a concept or category. Is that a fair interpretation of what you're getting at?","399":"I think what you're getting at is that the fallacy might be more of a theoretical construct, used to illustrate a point in a simplified way, rather than a common occurrence in real-world debates. This makes sense, as logic and argumentation theory often rely on idealized scenarios to make complex concepts more accessible. By acknowledging this, we can appreciate the fallacy for its pedagogical value, even if it's not a frequent phenomenon in actual discussions.","400":"You're not making a case that the No True Scotsman fallacy is not real, you're making a case that its invocation in good faith is relatively rare.","401":"If the accusations of the fallacy are themselves based on a similar pattern of selective definition and exclusion, then it's possible that the entire exchange is a case of the fallacy in action, rather than a genuine critique of it.","402":"I think that's a crucial point, and it's what I've been trying to get at \u2013 that the appeal to the fallacy is often more about policing the boundaries of a community or ideology than about a genuine concern for the argument's validity.","403":"I think what I'm getting at is that our brains are kind of like a really complex translation service, taking those electrical signals and turning them into the experiences and thoughts that make us who we are, but the thing is, we still don't know a lot about how that translation works, and that's what makes it so fascinating.","404":"You're saying that you can recall the details of an object, but when you try to picture it in your mind, it's like a complete blank. Is that right?","405":"That's great that you're trying to visualize! Can you try to go back to the scene and see if you can add more details to the story, like what kind of yard the sheep was jumping through, or what kind of suit the sheep was wearing when it robbed the bank? Maybe you can even think about what kind of music was playing in the background or what the sheep's motivations were for robbing the bank.","406":"I think it's because our education system doesn't always prioritize sex ed, and it's often left to parents or schools to decide how much to cover. But it's great that you're thinking about this ahead of time. Can you tell me a bit more about what's worrying you about puberty?","407":"For girls, puberty can be more complex because their bodies undergo a lot of changes, including menstruation, breast development, and growth spurts, which can be overwhelming and confusing. In contrast, boys experience more subtle changes, such as increased muscle mass and voice deepening, which may not be as noticeable or dramatic.","408":"The American colonies had a larger population than you might think, but more importantly, they had a relatively healthy population compared to Africa, which had a long history of disease transmission and a population that was already weakened by various factors, including malnutrition, poor sanitation, and a lack of access to healthcare. This made it easier for diseases to spread and take hold in Africa, whereas the American colonies had a more robust population that was better equipped to withstand and recover from disease outbreaks.","409":"That's right. Vaccines have been instrumental in controlling and even eradicating these diseases. In fact, smallpox is the only human disease to have been completely eradicated thanks to vaccination efforts. And it's a testament to the power of science and public health measures that we've seen such significant declines in the number of cases and deaths from diseases like polio, tuberculosis, and tetanus.","410":"i mean, using a ton of var declarations like var a, var b, var c, etc. is just lazy code. it's like you're not even trying to write clean code.","411":"I think there might have been a bit of a miscommunication - you're asking where the flu went, but it's still present in the environment. It's more like the number of cases decreased significantly due to the pandemic measures, but it's not gone forever. The flu is a seasonal virus, so it will come back with the next flu season, which is typically from October to May in the northern hemisphere. It's not like 47 people can bring it back, but rather the virus will start circulating again as the weather changes and people's behavior changes. It's a bit like a dormant seed that's waiting to sprout when the conditions are right.","412":"I see what you're getting at. The flu virus can exist outside of people, but it's not a perpetual entity. It's more like a dormant state. When it's not in a host, it's essentially in a state of suspended animation, waiting for the right conditions to become active again. Think of it like a seed that needs the right temperature, humidity, and nutrients to sprout. If no one is sick, the virus can't multiply, but it's not like it just disappears. It's more like it's in a state of hibernation, waiting for the next opportunity to infect someone.","413":"When you're experiencing emotional stress, your body's stress response is triggered, releasing hormones like cortisol and adrenaline. These hormones can cause physical symptoms like nausea and stomach discomfort, as well as affect your appetite. Imagine your digestive system is like a highway, and stress hormones are like traffic congestion \u2013 they can slow things down and make you feel queasy. Additionally, emotional stress can also impact your gut microbiome, which is like a tiny ecosystem inside your body that helps with digestion and overall health. When this ecosystem is out of balance, it can lead to feelings of discomfort and loss of appetite. ","414":"I'm humbled to be a part of this supportive community, where we can lift each other up and share our stories \u2013 it's amazing to see how my experience can resonate with you and inspire you to keep moving forward.","415":"I'm so touched by your kind words! It means a lot to me that this thread is having a positive impact. Would you like to share more about what specifically resonated with you?","416":null,"417":"The attack on the Saudi oil facilities has sent shockwaves through the global energy market, causing a significant spike in oil prices. This is because Saudi Arabia is one of the world's largest oil producers and exporters, and the disruption to its production has reduced the global supply of oil. As a result, countries that rely heavily on oil imports, such as Japan and South Korea, are feeling the pinch. The impact on currencies is also being felt, particularly in countries that are heavily reliant on oil exports, like Saudi Arabia and Russia. The situation is further complicated by the fact that the global economy is already facing headwinds, making the price increase even more challenging to absorb.","418":"I think it's a good starting point, but it's not a silver bullet. I mean, if we're looking at it as a supplement, what do you think we need to make it more viable and appealing to the masses?","419":"No worries at all, happy to share reliable info. Would you like to know more about the EWG's findings or how to apply them in your daily life?","420":"Actually, if a majority of employees sign a petition to form a union or a similar association, Walmart can still contest the certification of the union if it believes the union didn't follow the proper procedures for organizing. This is because the National Labor Relations Act allows employers to challenge the certification process if they feel it was unfair or didn't comply with the law. The outcome ultimately depends on the decisions made by the National Labor Relations Board, which would review the circumstances of the unionization effort and make a ruling. ","421":"If you handed them a proposal that's essentially a union proposal, they'd likely flag it as a union proposal and reject it, even if you call it something else. They're not going to accept a thinly veiled union proposal as a legitimate non-union initiative.","422":"If you do it 100 times, you'll almost certainly not get the 1\/100 odds at least once. It's like flipping a coin - you'll get a mix of heads and tails, but you'll definitely get some tails. In this case, the 1\/100 odds are like getting a very rare tail, and the 99\/100 odds are like getting a head. You can be sure you'll get at least one tail in 100 flips, so you won't get the 1\/100 odds.","423":"Alcoholism is a bit like a hijacking of the brain's reward system, making it super hard to resist the temptation of a drink, even when it's no longer fun or safe. It's not about being weak-willed or lacking self-control, but rather a complex mix of genetics, environment, and biology that can lead to a lifelong struggle. Think of it like a chronic condition, like diabetes or asthma, that requires ongoing treatment and support to manage.","424":"Well, let's narrow it down a bit. Besides metals, there are polymers, which are long chains of molecules like plastics and rubbers. Another one is ceramics, which are made from inorganic materials like clay and silica. We also have semiconductors, which are materials that can conduct electricity but not as well as metals. And finally, there are composites, which are materials made from combining different substances to create something new and often stronger.","425":"We have a lot of evidence that suggests we're not at the center of the universe. One key piece of evidence is the cosmic microwave background radiation, which is the leftover heat from the Big Bang. It's uniform in all directions, which means that it looks the same no matter where we look in the universe. This is strong evidence that the universe is homogeneous and isotropic on large scales, meaning it has the same properties and looks the same everywhere. We've also observed the way galaxies and galaxy clusters are distributed throughout the universe. They're not concentrated around us, but are instead spread out in a way that suggests we're just one of many points in an expanding universe. And, as you mentioned, the expansion of the universe means that galaxies are moving away from each other, not just from us specifically. So, while it's natural to wonder if we're at the center of the universe, the evidence suggests that we're not privileged in this way.","426":"I'm talking about a more nuanced view, where our galaxy is indeed at the center of a smaller region, but the universe as a whole is still expanding in all directions, with galaxies accelerating away from each other. This view is supported by some recent studies that suggest our galaxy is part of a larger structure, a 'galaxy filament', that is moving towards the center of the universe, but the universe itself is still expanding.","427":"I think I see where the confusion lies. In the static universe model, the idea of being at the center would imply a central point that's not moving, but in our expanding universe, we're not at a fixed point, we're part of the expansion itself. The galaxies around us are moving away, but that's because the space between them is expanding, not because they're being repelled by a central force.","428":"Yes, men who undergo genital amputation would still have sexual urges because their brain is a major part of sexual function. The removal of genitalia wouldn't eliminate sexual desire entirely, but it would likely be reduced. Sexual urges are influenced by a complex interplay between hormones, emotions, and thoughts. This means that even without testosterone, which is primarily produced by the testes, sexual desire might still be present.","429":"You're right, the testicles are the key to testosterone production, and that's what fuels those desires and urges. In fact, the ancient Greeks and Romans were known to use castration as a form of punishment, which led to a loss of libido. This practice was also seen in some Asian cultures, including the Mongols and the Manchu dynasty, where it was used to create eunuchs for the royal courts.","430":"That's fascinating! I'd love to learn more about the history of eunuchs in Malay and Malaysian cultures. Can you tell me more about what you've heard or read about it?","431":"Come on, you're saying I just take things at face value? That's not how this conversation started. I asked you to clarify what you meant by 'it' is biological, and you're still not giving me a straight answer. You keep sidestepping the question and bringing up unrelated points.","432":"You seem to be misinterpreting my point, which is that the primary reason humans delay reproduction is not solely due to biological factors, but rather a complex interplay between social, cultural, and biological influences. The responses you received reflected a nuanced understanding of the issue, with many people acknowledging the role of both biological and non-biological factors. By focusing solely on biological explanations, you're oversimplifying the complexity of the issue and neglecting the significant contributions of social and cultural factors.","433":"Let's drill down on the premise's underlying assumption that the question's focus on biological aspects is inherent to its meaning. Can you help me understand why you think the question's phrasing necessitates a biological explanation, rather than a more nuanced approach that incorporates social factors?","434":"That's a common misconception about time and the 4th dimension. In special relativity, time is just another dimension, like the three spatial dimensions. The key difference is that time is not static, it's dynamic. Objects in the 4th dimension, like you, are constantly moving through time, just like objects in the 3 spatial dimensions move through space. This means that the world isn't just a collection of static 4th dimensional objects, but rather a dynamic, ever-changing tapestry of objects and events that are all interconnected through time.","435":"Squaring numbers is like measuring the area of a square, and square roots are like finding the length of one side of that square. For example, if you have a square garden that's 4 meters by 4 meters, the area is 16 square meters, which is the result of squaring the side length. To find the side length, you'd take the square root of 16, which is 4 meters. This concept is useful in many real-world applications, such as architecture, engineering, and even finance, where you might need to calculate areas or side lengths of squares or rectangles.","436":"That's right, and it's a crucial aspect of how our bodies maintain homeostasis and prevent disease.","437":"Let's break it down a bit more.
