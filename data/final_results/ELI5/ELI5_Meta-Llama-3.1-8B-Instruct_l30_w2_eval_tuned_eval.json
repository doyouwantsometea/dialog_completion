There are so many different companies, and inside those companies there are different departments, some more flexible than others.  Are there business jobs where hair could hurt your chances?  Yeah, I imagine there are.  Should you give up on business because of that?  Probably not, and I hope you don't!

You learned by using the tachometer.   You relearn whenever you get a new car and has to get used to how it feels - especially if it uses a different engine type, for example switching to diesel (or back) requires you to completely relearn how a car should feel.   Once you've learned how your car (or other motorized transport) feels at all speeds, you don't need any of the instrument panel except maybe a way to estimate how much fuel you have left.","8":"Yes, and girls in \u201cearly tribes\u201d regularly had kids as teenagers.

","9":"Oh Jesus Christ, you\u2019ve actually posted the definition of \u201cbiological\u201d. Copy and pasted from the dictionary. Fuck me sideways  You said \u201cit is biological\u201d.

Six or seven people have told you as much.   The reason that humans don\u2019t have children immediately after reaching puberty, is not biological.   Remember you\u2019ve accepted that your original premise, that the question was predicated on, wasn\u2019t true? Why you doing this","11":"If you post a thread in a question forum, and the majority of people give you the exact same answer, you don\u2019t believe them?   Yes, okay, discussion of biology was a necessary part of answering the question. It\u2019s a question that referenced puberty in mammals - it self-evidently was going to refer to biological topics. However, your question was asking for the biological reason that humans aren\u2019t ready for kids whilst animals are. The premise is false, and the reason the premise is false is due to social and not biological factors. As I\u2019ve said over and over and over. You may as well be asking \u201cwhat\u2019s the economic rationale for the earth rotating around the sun\u201d.   And for your last sentence - I\u2019m not the one trying to steer this away from a question about raising children and into a semantic debate about   I\u2019m gonna respond every single time btw.

Literally just repeating your own hypocritical words back to you. oh man I can\u2019t believe you handed me that opening on a plate like that, too perfect.   Have a good day in work, I hope you\u2019ve learned from all of this","13":"You bring up a legitimate criticism but you're approaching this system as if everyone already owns or has a house. By providing everyone with a basic income you can get people who are living on the streets the money they need to buy a house and join the market. These new people in the economy represent a group that can move into much of the empty property around the country of only they had some money to do so.","14":"That's true, I have read some data myself about alaska which has had a ubi program since 1980. This program showed that compared to the rest of the country alaska had reduced the cost of the average item for a household following implementation with a steady rise flowing that arose from inflation. Notably this inflation continued at a rate in line with the rest of the country meaning costs are still slightly lower in alaska than the nation at large. It was also interesting, as alaska in this time saw no significant change to full time workers as a proportion of the population but an increase in part time workers. This implies that those with good jobs were not leaving their jobs but those without were getting new ones that were mostly part time.","15":"To start with, I made a mistake in my previous comment.  The turbine speed and torque is going to be based on super complicated fluid mechanics stuff that I don't know to well.    No, it won't have the same energy output.  Lets say that substance 1 has a boiling point of 50 degrees Celsius and substance 2 has a boiling point of 100 degrees Celsius.  Lets also say that they require the same amount of energy to heat up 1 degree Celsius (1 kj).  Substance 1 absorbs 50 kj of energy but substance 2 absorbs 100 kj.  This means that substance 2 can have more energy extracted by the turbine.    The pressure doesn't actually have much to do with it, it's actually held constant during the boiling process and a pump is used to get the liquid to the right pressure.","16":"Look up \u201cisotopes of helium\u201d, \u201cisotopes of neon\u201d etc. on Wikipedia and there will be a section labelled \u201clist of isotopes\u201d which shows you a lot of information including what isotopes they decay into if they\u2019re radioactive.   No, noble gasses are not turning into a 19th column. what makes you think that?   Yes, hydrogen-1 will _never_ undergo radioactive decay. Stars are different, they are fusing elements together, it\u2019s a completely different process to radioactive decay.","17":"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/3\/37\/Decay_Chain_of_Uranium-238.svg  https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/9\/93\/Decay_Chain_of_Actinium.svg  These are the decay chains of uranium-238 and uranium-235, as you can see both of them decay into an isotope of radon before decaying further. So no radon is not at the end. Many radioactive isotopes undergo these sequences where they keep decaying into other isotopes until they get to a stable one.","18":"&gt;Oh cool, so does that mean that, like radon, all of the noble elements will eventually turn into lead?  What makes your ask this question? Helium will never \u201cdecay\u201d into lead, nor will neon etc.   When stars explode a large amount of heavier elements are formed, but again this isn\u2019t the same process.    &gt;Could lead ever decay into something else? Is there a half-life of lead?  I\u2019ve already told you that every single element has radioactive isotopes, see: https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Isotopes_of_lead - note just how many radioactive isotopes lead has, many are decay products from other elements, lead is the heaviest element that still has stable isotopes.   Isotopes are atoms with the same number of protons but different numbers of neutrons. Only specific configurations of protons and neutrons are stable, everything else is unstable and undergoes radioactive decay.   &gt;If lead does decay into something else, it would probably take us billions of years to find out, right?  See the link above    I think checking out some educational YouTube videos would help you. Try this one: https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=fES21E0qebw","19":"There already is a 7th row, and within our lifetimes there likely will be some elements added to the 8th row.   There will never be a 19th group unless IUPAC decides to change the layout of the periodic table (which it won\u2019t do). Just a note on this, the periodic table actually looks like this: https:\/\/encrypted-tbn3.gstatic.com\/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcRJaY9NjvEqGbvN3HSDyyO3GKilL7zoRWTdyTCf-3xYkqXqSvTt0V_onoGqvw (google Wide Periodic Table if that doesn\u2019t work), so technically it has 32 columns but those between groups 2 and 3 aren\u2019t given group numbers.","20":"Probably not.  The last few elements discovered on the 7th row already decay within fractions of seconds, and there\u2019s 50 elements to fill up the 8th row yet to be discovered before the 9th row.","21":"Why do you think I have any actual firsthand experience in this field? I read journals and understand the science.   It took about 70 years for the rest of the elements in the 7th row to be created, that was elements 95-118). The last few discovered decay within fractions of seconds. The faster something decays the harder it is to create and then detect.   We will likely see element 120 within 5 years, but getting to element 169 (which would be the first element on the 9th row) is going to to take a lot longer and will need improvements in technology if it can even be created at all.   Is there a reason you are so obsessed with this?","22":"Is it really important though? None of these elements have real world applications. It\u2019s mostly a dick waving contest.   If it\u2019s boring in school it\u2019s mostly because of boring teachers or boring curricula, or both. Chemistry is an amazing science because it\u2019s so essential to everything around us.   If it takes 5 years to discover element 119, and even if it takes 5 years past that for each other element you\u2019re looking at nearly 50000 years. And that\u2019s a theoretical number pulled out of nowhere with no basis in reality. There\u2019s other problems to overcome, like heavier elements needing electrons to travel at faster than the speed of light and somehow overcoming the repulsion of protons in the nucleus.","23":"Ha ha ha ha ha!!! Mooo! COVID-19 = \"The Common Cold Scandal of 2020\" If Donald was a CEO for GM they would be zoomed in on automobile deaths and include people who die of heart attack in The backseat and also those people who die of lung cancer due to exhaust fumes, and even people who have sticker shock when they go car shopping!! You people are so easily corralled like the cows you all are. WAKE up. You have been made to believe the common cold is COVID.  Every time in your life when you were sick with fever and sore throat and took a few ibuprofen and went into work or school you killed people... Only difference is we were not using the media to hyper inflate and sensationalize it to remove a president. I don't like Donald and I would never vote for him and I can see through this scam. I guess if you hate the guy enough your willing to believe anything even if afterward you live in a cardboard box and are picking through a garbage can to eat and feed your family...  Lol","24":"Just gets tiring watching the \"smart ones\" actually try to make a scam seem real. Of course ibdont think there is any conspiracy. Seems to me the media hypnotized the entire planet of apes that the common cold is a pandemic.. lol.  I hear a guy was hit by a bus and ran over by a car and then someone shot him and the cause of death?? COVID-19... Lol.  It gets old wjen I've seen these scams happen over and over. And the \"smart ones\" lead is into another war or some conflict that afyerward everyone wakes up and no-one owns up how they foolishly followed the narrative and didn't think for themselves.  The common cold scam..  lol","25":"It is funny how that episode came out four years ago and yet all of the people still believe what our media says. It's kinda silly. That is a great episode though. Ha ha","26":"The reason people panicked when Covid started is because it is way more contagious than the flu. If it was \u201cjust another flu\u201d it would\u2019ve been over a long time ago.","27":"Social distancing and mask wearing is even more effective at reducing the spread of influenza than COVID-19, and we're generally more vigilant about cleaning and hand washing these days, which also provides protection against the spread of influenza.  So we've received a substantial bonus from (generally) following COVID-related restrictions.","28":"COVID is significantly more contagious than influenza, and COVID (unlike the flu) is prone to superspreader events.  So you'll see far more COVID spread than influenza spread under the same conditions.","29":"I said go talk to a virologist to get answers to your questions about getting rid of the flu.  You said something about talking to someone who you think is a virologist who said something no virologist would ever say.  So whoever you spoke to is somewhere between not a virologist at all and the world's worst virologist.  That said - you want to learn whether we're in a position to eradicate the flu - go talk to a (competent) virologist and stop dicking around on reddit.  And 47 reported cases may mean hundreds or thousands or tens of thousands of unreported (but still potentially contagious) cases.  47 may not mean what you think it means.  Most people who get the flu just deal with it, and many have mild symptoms not worth reporting.","30":"I DON'T KNOW.  Talk to a competent virologist.  Although the flu comes back as a different variation (or a few different variations) year after year, and jumps often between humans and animals, so your plan may not work at all.","31":"But that's simply an inference from things we \\*do\\* perceive. You have no way of knowing that those stars you mentioned exist, you simply trust many different things, from the scientists who say they found the data to the possibility that the universe is built on a firm set of rules that can be extrapolated from.  &amp;#x200B;  The point is, you may be able to \\*infer\\* that something exists, but all you really know is what you perceive, everything else is guesswork. Hence the question of \"if a tree falls in the woods and no one is around to hear it, does it make a sound\" is only a \"flawed principle\" if you treat the theories science has discovered as some hard and fast absolute, which they are not. What if the universe actually worked such that collisions only cause vibrations if someone is around to observe them? How would any scientific principle ever discover that, given that science is based on observation?","32":"And why do you think that has an effect on me?  Waste your money the way you want to; no skin off my back.  Hell, for all you know, I support Sanders, too.","33":"There are a few effects; ionization will break apart biologically important molecules, which can then become \"radicals\" which can break apart more molecules or damage proteins. Too much damage to cellular structures can cause the cell to destroy itself, as can too much damage to DNA. This is why bad sunburn causes skin to peel off, the epidermal and dermal layers received enough damage to decide they need to kill themselves for the greater good. However, if DNA is damaged in certain ways, it can lead to cancer. It's not that DNA can't be repaired at all, it's that it is the \"master program\" for the cell and can be modified in ways that make the cell do things that it isn't supposed to.   You can also receive too much damage to important cells like in organs. It's actually therapeutic in some situations, such as using radioactive iodine to destroy some of a large thyroid, but many organs are not good at regenerating so the damage can hamper their functionality.","34":"It's not just skin, it's called apoptosis and most cells in the body can do it. It also goes beyond cancer, you don't want malfunctioning cells dumping chemicals into the rest of the body. It's an interesting process, multicellular organisms like humans aren't necessarily doing the best for individual cells, but for the whole.","35":"Sports are games? A sport is defined as \"an activity involving physical exertion and skill in which an individual or team competes against another or others for entertainment.\" How is hockey not a sport?","36":"Now that is a good question... I know I had some sex education in school but it wasn't very good. It's a common problem in schools because people are scared to talk about it. Some of the fear is that it will encourage kids to start having sex early but I think it's important for everyone to know how the body works. Everyone has one, so why hide it?  Kids need to know what is normal and what is not normal, so if there is a problem, they can talk to a doctor. Puberty is scary with everything changing and a lot of people feel shame about it when they shouldn't. I'm glad you're asking questions ahead of time so you're a little more prepared.","37":"It's just how the human body is. \u00af\\_(\u30c4)_\/\u00af Can't do much about it. Lots of religions have stories that give reasons if that's something you believe in.  Although I think it is pretty flippin awesome that women can grow a child inside of her. And then feed it with her own body too. It's like a superpower.","38":"On top of what everyone has said, it could also be a psychological issue. Some symptoms of depression, for example, can manifest as increased sleep, decreased levels of energy and lack of focus.","39":"It's good that you're aware of it, but keep in mind that proper diagnosis can only come for a licensed professional. If this has been happening, it might be a good idea to get a professional opinion. I meant more to say that it's sometimes difficult to differentiate between illnesses of the body and illnesses of the mind, specially around things like sleep, which are connected to both. It could also be a part physical, part psychological.","40":"I can imagine it can be a little scary, but therapists are a lot like ears for hire, just go in, not even thinking about depression or issues, talk a little bit and see how you feel, you can bring out the more complex stuff whenever you feel comfortable.  There are also online resources like Blah Therapy, NYC Well, among others. Just make sure you're actually speaking to a professional and not just a helpful stranger.","41":"I haven\u2019t played Pok\u00e9mon go since it was popular 5 years ago...

It could be that a sufficiently complex organization of matter leads to consciousness (self aware matter) as an emergent phenomena in our universe.","45":"I realise that, thats why I'm telling you to do it yourself.  Its not a particularly rational approach to take for atomic theory, but there are good tangible ways to test it.  Heisenberg was found in a cave with holding a lump of cadmium next to an open nuclear reactor. People told him to check the math because he math was wrong. Oppenheimer showed that very very conclusively.","46":"You are totally insane if you believe any of that. Please travel, go meet people, go see the sites of these things someone has told you happened. thats such a drastic and inappropriate rewrite of history that I don't really know how to respond to it.","47":"Once again though, their plan failed because their math was wrong. They didn't have a bomb, they did have enriched uranium, they were just wrong about the quantities they needed specifically because Heisenberg did not check his math.  They had a reactor, again thats where the allies found him (holding a lump of cadmium).","48":"No they thought they needed more than they did, the firing mechanism is where they messed up.   And ya I do, they messed up the math, partially because the guy in charge of the math hated it when people told him to check it.. You can find his notes and look at it.  If they did then they had the pieces and they just calmly decided not to use the bomb and lose the war because I guess they felt bad about the whole war thing. You are right, that makes more sense.","49":"They can't legally prevent workers from unionizing, so they use fear, intimidation, and propaganda to prevent unionization efforts in the first place. Every major business does this. Most new hires will be bombarding with training videos and employee handbooks saying unions are bad.  They can have anti-union literature and posters in break rooms. They can fire people who express pro-union sentiments and claim it was for another reason. They can threaten to do all kinds of thing. ","50":"LOL... I'm an ex night club DJ (back in the late 80's to mid 90's) so I get random songs stuck in my head all of the time.

In general they take deposits from individuals and make loans, as well as offering services like credit cards.   Investment banking works more with the markets directly relating to financial securities (stocks, bonds, derivatives, etc) and financial advisory services. But investment banks do not take deposits.   Want to have your company go public and be listed on a stock exchange? The can determine a listing price and distribution. Need to issue $10B in bonds, they can partner with other firms to create the terms and get them sold. Want to merge with another company? They help with due diligence and the terms and the funding (loans, stock conversions, etc.).  Traditionally (at least since the 1933 Glass\u2013Steagall legislation) these were separate institutions. Many banks collapsed (for instance) when they used deposits to speculate on the markets. These functions are still separate but can be housed in one corporation. And most investment banks chose or were pressured to become commercial banks (at least from a regulatory perspective) after the crisis of 2008.","53":"You will have to wait a lot of time to see that, as currently the land mass is about (in 250 million years) to form a new supercontinent if the continental drift doesn't drasticaly change it's course in the next million years.  There are several hypothesis and models about how this will look like, these are: Novopangea, Pangea Proxima\/Ultima, Aurica and Amasia.  The thing is that in most of them, the mayority of the land mass will be found in the northern hemisphere (for example, in the Amasia hypothesis, all the land mass is on the northern hemisphere except for the Antarctica). So you should be asking this in 250 million years in the future.  Note: I may be wrong, I just happened to see this on a video.","54":"It's understandable to think that since we probably never live to see any major change of the continents locations. Remember that this process that it's currently happening, takes hundreds millions of years to complete, so we can only suppose how it will end up.","55":"You were looking at just economic policy, there are policies other than economic - namely social and foreign.

If physical things *can* interact with non-physical things, I\u2019d love for someone to explain it to me.","57":"Yes but neurosurgery proves that fucking with the brain itself causes changes in what consciousness feels like. Since the brain is a physical thing, consciousness must be physically caused, since no one has yet explained how non-physical things could interact with physical things. In other words, if conscious thought were on \"another plane,\" fucking with the brain itself shouldn't cause changes in consciousness.

If you're consistently skipping the same gear that'll sacrifice a bit of longevity, though whether you'll keep the car long enough to need it is another question.

The Monitor turns on each pixel to the corresponding value (take a magnifying glass and look at your monitor, there really are tiny red, green, and blue lights making up the screen!) and that is interpreted by your brain as an image.","67":"&gt;How does it send to each?

Analog devices still use transistors, but they allow for many shades of grey between 0 current an maximum current.   Transistors work like switches, with current flowing from the Source to the Drain, controlled by the Gate. This lets a tiny voltage at the Gate control a much larger current, like how a tiny valve can completely shut off a pipe.   Digital devices are designed to only have their gate ON or OFF. Analog devices can take a range of voltages through the gate that gradually turns on the current flowing through the device. This lets a tiny signal be amplified into a much bigger one, wiggling the \"valve\" creates a much stronger wiggle in the current through the \"pipe\", and this can turn the tiny electromagnetic field of a radio wave into something you can hear, with a little external power supplied by something else to drive the main current.","69":"Its not *impossible* its just not what its meant to do. Digital isn't \"better\" than analog, they just do completely different things. You use analog to handle real-world signals that can take a range of values, you use digital to do math and process information.

So there is light bouncing off the car and coming into your eye.  So it's not like there is some information coming from the car into your eyes and brains saying, 'hey its really really black right here'.  What is happening is the cells in your eye are not getting any information at all, and those cells in turn do not activate the brain in the same way.  So your brain perceives it as what we call black.  But its really just a lack of information.","72":"That's right.  Remember there isn't really a real 'black'.  That is just a word we made up for what our brain does.  Pretend humans never developed eyes and we never evolved to have the sense of sight.  We have no idea of color or what things look like or anything.  Light particles are still bouncing around and being reflected off everything, everywhere, but in the case of the vantablack, when light hits that area, it just reflects less light than other surfaces. (less information is being reflected)  Another way to look at it is take a digital camera and point it at the car.  Well there is a sensitive chip in there that is like an eye.  The light hits the chip, and activate certain parts of that chip which the computer makes into an image on the screen.  The vantablack areas did not activate that part of the chip.

But it is so weird looking I think it would be distracting.  Imagine that at night, even with headlights it would look strange.  Probably not that safe.","74":"Not through any economically feasible process nor any process that they were attempting. you can do anything to anything with enough energy.     But that is entirely off topic from your original question. And again I would recommend a review of how the periodic table works.","75":"Vaccinations train your body on how to fight diseases. It basically gives your body the \"I have seen that one before\" power over sickness.  However you need to be kind of healthy to get vaccinated. There are certain conditions under which you cannot receive vaccines (you are very young, your immune system is gone due to birth defects or cancer treatment,. ..).  These people rely on an effect called \"herd immunity\".  Basically you die if you get infected but you never get infected because everyone around you is vaccinated. This prevents a disease from spreading.  Unfortunately to achieve herd immunity roughly 98% of the population have to be vaccinated.  So for me personally as a vaccinated, healthy adult it makes no difference if you are vaccinated or not. For my little daughter or my cancer stricken relative it is a life or death situation (unfortunately quite literally).  Therefore if you are healthy and able to get a shot, go get a shot. It will safe someone's life.  (Kind of the same principle as you clear a lane for an ambulance. Yes it is inconvenient for you for 30 seconds but you help safe a live and you would expect others to do it for you).","76":"Depends on where you come from. In Germany you have a general practitioner that is \"your doctor\". It gets documented with your health insurance.  In Norway you get a doctor assigned and are not allowed to go to a different one, except for emergencies (afaik).","77":"Human hearing ranges from (about) 20 Hz to 20,000 Hz.  If a sound wave falls outside of that range, you are not going to be able to hear it.  However, that doesn't mean that you aren't able to perceive it in other ways.  We can \"feel\" sound waves outside of our normal range of hearing - both above and below the 20\/20,000 thresholds.  The 18.9 Hz wave is no different - you can't hear it, but you can feel it is there.  In many people, this feeling manifests itself as fear or paranoia.  You can \"feel\" something in the room, but none of your other senses register anything consciously.  This incongruence greats discomfort,t which manifests as fear.  It is called the \"Ghost Frequency\" because it is theorized that many \"haunted\" areas simply produce tones close to 18.9 Hz (through resonance or other natural quirks) and people associate the fear response with a \"presence\" in the area.","78":"It is actually pretty tough to generate things that low - most speakers can't do it (since there is no point in making a sound no one can hear).  That said, yes, you could make a house \"feel\" haunted by pumping in 18.9 Hz tones - people would feel the room was \"off\".  As for physical reactions, nothing due to the sound itself but there are all sorts of physiological reactions to fear.","79":"You have like 5 people telling you the same thing and all you do is argue. So why did you ask the question at all? Either you're a troll or need to accept the answers you get or look iy up yourself and shut up","80":"There's no disagreements. It's you asking the same question 15 times expecting a different answer. Just because im telling you how it is and how you're acting doesn't mean i have issues.","81":"You think running empty planes makes money?  You think turning customers away when you could've sold them something makes money?  You honestly believe this?  &gt;they sold their ticket too cheap to cover operational costs.  1.

They priced their ticket on your *lies*, so how could it possibly be adequately priced for the market.","82":"It's not scary for a woman unless she's not educated about the process *(as you are trying to be, and can now help both male &amp; female friends be, so good for you!!)* or in rare cases the cramps, nausea, or bleeding are unusually heavy. For me it was all just annoying, with the occasional \"get this thing out of me because I'm **DONE** with this messy cramping business!\".       Yes, it is possible to have sex any time during the menstrual cycle *(which usually lasts about 28 days, but can vary several days either way)*. Some women like the freedom of having sex during their period knowing they can't get pregnant *(which is a HUGE worry!)*, while most don't feel interested in sex.        Listen to your partner. Communicate.","83":"Doesn't matter how they look, but there are plenty of diagrams available.

The vagina is the passageway between what can be seen on the outside (labia) and the cervix (mouth of the uterus, which is normally tightly closed). It's a potential space... the walls usually are touching unless there's a tampon, finger, toy, penis, or baby moving through.          The uterus is kind of pear-shaped, about the size of a fist (depending on the person), and the small part connects to the cervix.","85":"Alright, so H(a,b) is when you describe what H does. You have to call them differently because they're different arguments, even if they could be the same.  H(x,x) is then running that routine with *specific* arguments. Essentially, it runs H(a,b), but with a=x and b=x. The cause of the transformation is that we're no longer looking at the definition of H, but at the application of H.","86":"Depends on where you come from.

In Norway you get a doctor assigned and are not allowed to go to a different one, except for emergencies (afaik).","87":"The 2nd and 3rd notes of the triple are \"off\" from the normal beat of the music...yes, they are correct according to the score. The 1st note of the triplet is most often on a downbeat so it sounds like it is in the right place.   Sorry, I'm sure I'm going in the wrong direction here. If you can give us some more guidance it might trigger a better answer. I definitely know what it's like to struggle for a term re: music theory. It makes sense, but only after you've already studied lots of it.","88":"The rainwater has to be cleaned, the grass only lasts a summer and has to be baled for winter or supplemented with feed that has to be made in factories. They have to be sheltered in lit and heated sheds. They have to be milked and the milk is trucked into factories to make dairy products. And so on. Farming isn't just a matter of throwing a few cows in a field and then leaving them to it till you're ready to kill them.","89":"It doesn't matter where the milking is done, it still has to be done. The cows have to be transported and then so does the milk and the milk has to be processed and the processed milk has to be sent to the stores.","90":"Internationally, skin whitening has received criticism even within the Asian communities because racism towards darker skinned Asians is still extremely prominent in countries like Vietnam or the Philippines, that have more diverse skin tones. There's still an underlying vein that whiteness is equated with attractiveness, and a lot of the motivation behind skin whitening stems from that idea.","91":"No, not really, because for that to be the case, racism would have to be considered a historical past time, and not something that still actively happens in many societies across the globe. There is still a stigma within the fashion industry that lighter skin is better, there's been work done to change this narrative, but we still have a long way to go in that sense.","92":"The CPU is designed so that if you feed it certain \"numbers\" (the binary numbers are just for human usability - it's all just a series of electrical signals to the CPU) it will perform certain operations. Some of those operations expect additional numbers to be input as part of the instruction (usually, addresses of memory that contain the data). This is all just based on the complex physical arrangement of the transistors and other components within the CPU.  We have a lookup table of what numbers represent what instructions. It's called an **instruction set**. A popular one is x86, which you can read about [here](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/X86_instruction_listings#Original_8086\/8088_instructions).","93":"The CPU is designed that way based on the arrangement of transistors and other components. Feed it a \"6\" and it will add the next two numbers. Feed it an \"8\" and it will store a number into memory. How exactly the transistors are arranged to do so is not even remotely ELI5, and the people who know it are paid millions for their expertise. If you want to see what it looks like inside a CPU you can watch [this video](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=Fxv3JoS1uY8).  The best I can do for ELI5: using transistors you can build logic gates. Using logic gates you can build logical functions. Transistors can also control which logic gates get activated based on a given input. You change which transistors are activated by sending signals to certain CPU pins in a certain order. The CPU is designed such that it would automatically read instructions from certain pins when powered on (which is where the BIOs\/boot process comes in). [Transistors to gates](https:\/\/www.cs.bu.edu\/~best\/courses\/modules\/Transistors2Gates\/).  If you have the basic building blocks to form transistors and\/or logic gates, you can build a fully functional computer, which is how people have simulated computers inside other software such as Minecraft or Factorio.","94":"A function. If the function is y=x\\*2, then inputting 4 will result in 8.  Programs are kinds of functions that (usually) take input, process it, and provide some kind of output.

They aren't always literally numbers that need to be displayed as text on a monitor.","95":"They get that info from your credit report\/history, which again, should be obtainable only with private info like your social, full name and signature or electronic equivalent.

So again, for the vast majority of people, they are not \"simple\" questions.","96":"That's the best security model because it works for 99.99% of people. Which is why the system is as it is.   The system works for most of the people, most of the time and is easy to use and implement.","97":"&gt;there are way [sic]  Such as?  &gt;intelligent people will find a way  So you're leaning on the \"What I think is right is definitely correct, despite all evidence to the contrary, because someone smart (who has already said that it's a bad idea) will make it work eventually\"   Do I have that right?  Intelligent people have looked at the task of covering millions of square miles of the planet with a covering to capture some gas and decided that it makes absolutely no sense, and would then also completely ruin the ecosystems that would have to be covered, as well as taking an absurd amount of materials, resources, and energy to complete, and they decided it would be much more feasible to find other solutions that are actually possible.","98":"&gt; Then we put bases there to capture it as it comes out. Long tubs with vacuum pressure running a grid over acres of land.  So you want to cover millions of square miles of arctic tundra with... vacuum tubes? Running a constant negative pressure in the area to absorb methane gas. And you don't see how insane that sounds?  &gt;You guys are being impatient, rude, and down right threatening.  Act like an idiot who is arguing in bad faith and be treated accordingly. The threats aren't okay, but you're being intentionally frustrating, and people are getting frustrated.

Not \"facts\". ","99":"&gt; Why is that? I mean the water is there      That's the other thing. It isn't. For most people on the planet, the water is not there. It's somewhere else.        &gt;so why not clean it and use it?      This is, in a way, what sewage and wastewater treatment plants do. It's a very time-, infrastructure and resource-intensive process that cannot be provided everywhere.","100":"&gt; Well we are providing weapons to war torn nations who don't have resources for food. Surely some infrastructure can be built for ones with no access to water, right?  Any project in the world is limited by the constraints of technology, resources and politics.

I certainly don't. Do you? Who is this \"we\"? There is no unified humanity. The world is big and complicated and full of nations, interest groups and individuals.","102":"Half of the planet has an iq under 100, plenty of dumbfuckery around.  A great deal of science is in fields that has nothing to do with the topic, a volcanogist has only his personal beliefs, mostly based on early life brain washing, lots are from places where lack of faith is deemed a detriment so you are not likely to find their true opinion, Saudi Arabia and the USA spring to mind.

So you'll see far more COVID spread than influenza spread under the same conditions.","107":"I said go talk to a virologist to get answers to your questions about getting rid of the flu.  You said something about talking to someone who you think is a virologist who said something no virologist would ever say.  So whoever you spoke to is somewhere between not a virologist at all and the world's worst virologist.  That said - you want to learn whether we're in a position to eradicate the flu - go talk to a (competent) virologist and stop dicking around on reddit.  And 47 reported cases may mean hundreds or thousands or tens of thousands of unreported (but still potentially contagious) cases.  47 may not mean what you think it means.  Most people who get the flu just deal with it, and many have mild symptoms not worth reporting.","108":"The constitutional reason would be \"Then don't vote for them.\" Unlike a minimum age, which is supposed to impose a minimum amount of life experience as a qualification, there's no such thing as \"too much experience\" in this context. You're free to note vote for them if you feel they don't represent you, but being \"representative of the people\" isn't a requirement.","109":"If you're staring at a ballot with two names, and you write in a third, that's...three.

If you want to organize, in secret, on your own time and property, you're welcome to.","111":"&gt; could they deny it  I don't know what you keep calling \"deny\".  So you've got a majority of Walmart employees signed on?  You either have a union or you don't.  If you don't have a union, then you don't have any of the legal protections given to unions in the U.S.  &gt; as opposed to every other corporation or company?  I don't know what this means or why you act like Walmart is the only non-unionized employer in the U.S.","112":"&gt; Can a single store unionize?  No.  Maybe a single state's stores can, I really don't know.  I'm not a labor lawyer.  &gt; Otherwise I would have to have the same amount of people that live in New Hampshire and Vermont sign because that's how many people work for Walmart.  Exactly.","113":"I'm not demanding anything. I think equal pay for each person doing the same job makes sense.  Are you suggesting all jobs should be paid in a similar scheme to commission based jobs? That would probably be too big an overhaul of the system, too difficult to monitor etc.","114":"There is a hemisphere of Earth where you can see the Moon (ignoring that it's hard during the day because the sky is so bright).  At the same time, there is a hemisphere of Earth where you can see the Sun (generally called \"daytime\").  Most of the time, where is an overlap between these two where you can see the Moon during the day (ignoring it's hard ...).  The eclipse is a \"special\" time where the two hemispheres touch at their edges.  As the Sun and Moon move apart, the overlapping section of the Earth in both becomes thinner and longer.  At the eclipse, it's at its thinnest, only minutes long, but it goes all the way around.

Which brings us to an interesting conclusion, if everything can be predicted based on information in the now, can we really have conscious thought? is any decision based on free will? No.  We are the sum of our experiences and genes, nothing more nothing less. We are in a chaotic system where every tiny tiny decision or action from all of the 7billion ish humans on this planet affects every other human on the planet(butterfly effect is very real) This soup of cause and effect creates something that we interpret as free will.  we are a bunch of electrons going back and forth.","120":"We know what the butterfly effect is...

I have no idea how you think just splitting stock would somehow be a solution for that, as every single stock issued dilutes the rest....

If you send 5 volts to the digital processor in my example above, it would be interpreted as a 1\/On\/True however you want to represent that. A string of those might represent an instruction or something.  If you send the same 5 volts to a 12 volt analog LED, it might light up with about 40% brightness. Analog doesn't have \"positions\", that's the point. We measure its voltage level.","144":"I think what you're misunderstanding is that P is not cheating M.

But it's unpredictable and I sure wouldn't want to take that chance. From some of my male friends I've heard that sometimes the stream from their penis might go off in a different direction instead of straight out for no apparent reason. It's a bit like that.   Also keep in mind that once females (and males) hit puberty, they start growing pubic hair which might also get in the way.","152":"You mean pubic hair? Yeah it usually grows in front, on down between the legs and a little bit on the butt hole area. It's just often seen as taboo, so some women shave or wax to get rid of it. But that's her decision to make and its perfectly find to keep it all or remove it all. Shaving and waxing can hurt and cause ingrown hairs which is one reason some may not want to remove the hair.","153":"Now that is a good question... I know I had some sex education in school but it wasn't very good. It's a common problem in schools because people are scared to talk about it. Some of the fear is that it will encourage kids to start having sex early but I think it's important for everyone to know how the body works. Everyone has one, so why hide it?  Kids need to know what is normal and what is not normal, so if there is a problem, they can talk to a doctor. Puberty is scary with everything changing and a lot of people feel shame about it when they shouldn't.

It was a massive ball of unimaginable amounts of energy,  This is also false. I'm not even sure what this is supposed to mean.  When you rewind the clock, things get closer and closer together until at some point, the energy is packed together so tightly that spacetime has to be described with quantum mechanics, but there are numerous problems with formulating such a theory.  &gt;I am hope full that when a nuclear clock is finally created (much more accurate than an atomic clock) we may start to unwrap some of the mysteries of time.  A nuclear clock also has nothing to do with the nature of time. It simply allows us to measure time more accurately, though its error will still be many times greater than a Planck time.","161":"Planck time is the time it takes for light to travel one Planck length.  A Planck length is the resolution of a photon energetic enough to create a black hole, which basically means you can't see anything smaller than it.  None of this means they are the smallest possible length scales, just that they are scales at which quantum gravity becomes important.","162":"This is complicated. It's easiest to think of them as waves, but more accurately, they are waves of points.  The energy is proportional to the frequency of the wave, and resolution is also proportional to the frequency, and so we define the Planck length as the length at which the energy of a photon is high enough to make a black hole.","163":"LOL...

If humans had never developed past a hunter-gatherer society and still personally foraged for food, do you agree that humans would generally have better survival skills than we do now?  3b.

Yes, okay, discussion of biology was a necessary part of answering the question. It\u2019s a question that referenced puberty in mammals - it self-evidently was going to refer to biological topics. However, your question was asking for the biological reason that humans aren\u2019t ready for kids whilst animals are. The premise is false, and the reason the premise is false is due to social and not biological factors. As I\u2019ve said over and over and over.

The alpha\/beta\/gamma particles coming out might crash around and damage other atoms, but this is a result of the decay and doesn't precipitate more decay in most cases (fission can be an exception).  &amp;#x200B;  For fission, you can imagine the nucleus like a deformed ball. Unstable nuclei will \"oscillate\" such that the ball will get more spherical and more elongated repeatedly. If it manages to stretch to far, it'll break apart. This is a decent analogy, though being somewhat quantum mechanical it isn't quite that simple.","175":"Generally, you won't be able to add back to the nucleus without fusion, which requires high energy and generally doesn't work well on elements heavier than iron as putting in more nucleons into such nuclei make them bound less strongly. This is why it is said heavy elements originate in supernovae, normal stars don't have the energy to fuse beyond iron. If the nucleus is unstable enough and gets run into, it can cause it to break apart, which is exploited by nuclear reactors to sustain the controlled fission reactions.","176":"Yes, pretty much. To add to a nucleus, you must overcome the electromagnetic repulsion from the protons enough that the strong force takes over. The strong force is a very short ranged force, unlike electromagnetism, and doesn't follow the inverse square law.","177":"So as an example, S(t) could be \"Count how many words the sentence t has and add two.\" You could then look at S(S) and see that S has 11 words and so get 13 in total.

The cause of the transformation is that we're no longer looking at the definition of H, but at the application of H.","179":"&gt; The actual proof, I imagine, involves a whole bunch of symbols  It's not super hard to understand.

That's why dividends exist. It's not the only way to look at it though. Because without the business keeping that profit to invest back into the business, it could never grow, giving up increasing value in the future.  Take manufacturing, say that you build widgets, each widget nets x profit. That x value can be given out as dividends or it can be used to increase the number of widgets we make and sell.

If the space has carbon monoxide in it, it could be near the top, as it's slightly lighter than air. CO2 is heavier than air, which is why you can use it to create a a ground fog.

Radon is a noble gas but it's radioactive with a half life of 3.8 days decaying into Polonium.   Most elements lighter than lead (have isotopes that) are stable and won't change while pretty much all element heavier than lead will decay over time into lead. Over astronomical time scales stars will continue to change the ratio of hydrogen and helium to heavier elements but the majority of  will stay lighter than Neon.","226":"First, elements decaying always become lighter. Second, lead is stable and does not decay. The only way elements become more massive is through nuclear reactions in stars.    The general trend is that very light elements become heavier and very heavy elements become lighter until they reach Lead\/Thallium. Exotic isotopes that don't fit the general pattern are extremely short-lived, so they basically don't exist.  Also, 2 billion years is not very long, the most stable isotope of Bismuth for example has a half-life of 19 billion billion years to decay into Thallium, and over the 14 billion years the universe has existed stars have only managed to transmute about 2% of mass into anything else than hydrogen and helium.","227":"Theoretically, there can be more massive elements but the most massive ones we've artificially created already are so unstable they decay within nano- to microseconds - in practical terms these elements don't matter because they barely exist.","228":"Not necessarily; it's not a one-to-one shift, and generally the companies (correctly) think they can do a better job insuring their employees than the Feds can.  So in order to have the government provide the same level of healthcare, it likely will end up costing the government *more* because of how inefficient the government is at these kinds of things, in major part because the government isn't interested in a profit motive, and as a result isn't as interested in cost-savings measures.","229":"&gt;What is the evidence that government inefficiency would make the costs increase.  Government procurement is historically prone to cost overruns, bloat, and inefficiency. You can look at military spending for an example of this.  &gt;It would seem that taking out all of the private insurance middlemen would result in much lower costs.  But in the process, you get rid of the negotiators involved in drug\/treatment cost negotiations, and instead the government will just pay whatever the cost is without thinking about it, again because the government doesn't have significant means to fight for cost savings.  We already have a very similar problem with respect to student loans; the increased cost of college education in the US is largely due to the US government being so willing to pump money into higher education through student loans without any form of price controls or cost incentives.","230":"It\u2019s not bad... per se. They don\u2019t put money back into the economy, or rarely do. Think of it in terms of neighborhoods. You have poor, upscale, and rich.

Same goes for the upscale to the poor. When you\u2019re rich, everything because a \u201cprivate\u201d.

What happened if someone from coach tries to sit in 1st? There you go.","231":"Without trying to sound crass you seem to have got the wrong picture of elements here. Hydrogen does not decay into helium, hydrogen-3 (tritium) does decay into helium-3, but hydrogen-1 and hysrogen-2 do not undergo radioactive decay at all, they are stable isotopes of hydrogen.   ALL elements have radioactive isotopes, that includes noble gasses. They will all decay into other elements eventually.","232":"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/3\/37\/Decay_Chain_of_Uranium-238.svg  https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/9\/93\/Decay_Chain_of_Actinium.svg  These are the decay chains of uranium-238 and uranium-235, as you can see both of them decay into an isotope of radon before decaying further. So no radon is not at the end. Many radioactive isotopes undergo these sequences where they keep decaying into other isotopes until they get to a stable one.","233":"&gt;Oh cool, so does that mean that, like radon, all of the noble elements will eventually turn into lead?  What makes your ask this question? Helium will never \u201cdecay\u201d into lead, nor will neon etc.   When stars explode a large amount of heavier elements are formed, but again this isn\u2019t the same process.    &gt;Could lead ever decay into something else? Is there a half-life of lead?  I\u2019ve already told you that every single element has radioactive isotopes, see: https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Isotopes_of_lead - note just how many radioactive isotopes lead has, many are decay products from other elements, lead is the heaviest element that still has stable isotopes.   Isotopes are atoms with the same number of protons but different numbers of neutrons. Only specific configurations of protons and neutrons are stable, everything else is unstable and undergoes radioactive decay.   &gt;If lead does decay into something else, it would probably take us billions of years to find out, right?

Just a note on this, the periodic table actually looks like this: https:\/\/encrypted-tbn3.gstatic.com\/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcRJaY9NjvEqGbvN3HSDyyO3GKilL7zoRWTdyTCf-3xYkqXqSvTt0V_onoGqvw (google Wide Periodic Table if that doesn\u2019t work), so technically it has 32 columns but those between groups 2 and 3 aren\u2019t given group numbers.","235":"Probably not.

I read journals and understand the science.   It took about 70 years for the rest of the elements in the 7th row to be created, that was elements 95-118). The last few discovered decay within fractions of seconds. The faster something decays the harder it is to create and then detect.   We will likely see element 120 within 5 years, but getting to element 169 (which would be the first element on the 9th row) is going to to take a lot longer and will need improvements in technology if it can even be created at all.

It's not the only way to look at it though. Because without the business keeping that profit to invest back into the business, it could never grow, giving up increasing value in the future.  Take manufacturing, say that you build widgets, each widget nets x profit. That x value can be given out as dividends or it can be used to increase the number of widgets we make and sell. So, by giving up x now and letting the company build another production line of widgets, next year, i get 3x (2x for 2 years of profits, plus x for the new production line of widgets they made)","244":"Why would there need to be another purpose other than selling it? If i buy antique or collectors items, they don't pay dividends, i only get cash value when i see them. Likewise, whenever i buy most things (like as a business owner buying inventory to sell) they own their inventory, but get zero value until it is sold.","245":"\"Because you need to\".... then only buy stocks that give our regular dividends.   I understand why you want dividends, but the conversation has moved from you don't understand why some stocks don't do dividends to crying that some don't, those are fundamentally different concepts.   Your way of viewing stocks is valid and some stocks share your point of view, but it isn't the ONLY valid way to view stocks. In the end, the decision to pay dividends is based on the board of directors, which the stockholders can vote on...","246":"Because the board enacts the will of the stock holders, based on stockholder voting. The idea of having tens of thousands of people try to run a company (each stock holder) would be a surefire way to end any company. Thus, like government, people are appointed to the board based on the majority of stock ownership.   I have no idea how you think just splitting stock would somehow be a solution for that, as every single stock issued dilutes the rest....

Digital isn't \"better\" than analog, they just do completely different things. You use analog to handle real-world signals that can take a range of values, you use digital to do math and process information. Ultimately, you translate back and forth as needed, like in the case of a monitor taking a digital signal to produce an analog image.","251":"&gt;Analog devices still use transistors, but they allow for many shades of grey between 0 current an maximum current. Transistors work like switches, with current flowing from the Source to the Drain, controlled by the Gate. This lets a tiny voltage at the Gate control a much larger current, like how a tiny valve can completely shut off a pipe. Analog devices can take a range of voltages through the gate that gradually turns on the current flowing through the device.   Remember, 1 and 0 are just what we call ON and OFF. Its all a matter of how much current is flowing. We get to choose how to interpret that.","252":"Take any example of a company share. I'll use Apple. You purchased some of their shares in 2005. Their employees designed a product called an Iphone, marketed it, made it and sold millions of it and continued to innovate making their company valued at hundreds of billions of dollars because of the money it makes. You own a part of the effort the company put into this. How is this different from you buying a chicken, cooking it and selling it for more? If you sold someone a 25% share of your chicken company, then that person is entitled to 25% of the value of the company. You no longer own 100% of that company. If all you did was sell one chicken, then you need to give that person 25% of the profits from that chicken. A share isn't an IOU - it means that the owner of the share is part-owner of the company.","253":"There are issues with corporate governance, but if someone owned 25% of the shares of a large public company (unrealistic mostly) they'd almost certainly be on the Board of Directors (BOD) and very likely the Chairman of the Board. The BOD (representatives of the shareholders - mostly large shareholders themselves) decide on the dividend policy. It is, in theory, the shareholders that decide whether or not the company pays a dividend, management can advise but the board decides.   So if a company doesn't pay dividends it is usually a joint consensus of the management and the owners (shareholders) of the company. Of course, if someone owns 0.00001% of the shares of the company, they probably cannot expect to have much say (other than voting at the AGM) in the major strategic decisions of the company.","254":"The beauty of the free market is that you can make any investment decision based on any set of beliefs you have. All I can attempt is to explain how it works. If your conclusion is that A is better than B, then so be it.   It is simply odd that you make such a huge distinction between dividend and non-dividend paying shares. But you are free to do so. Hopefully if you ever intend to invest, you research the return history of various companies in recent history and validate your belief (dividend etc) against empirical performance.   At the end of the day, investing is mostly about making as much money as you can at an acceptable risk in a timeframe that fits you.","255":"CC: u\/covalick  &gt;We are not even sure what the smallest unit of time is, though many suspect it is planck time.   This is false. The majority think that time is continuous, not chopped up into moments of Planck time.  &gt;Time as we experience it must have existed after the big bang, but at those early moments, only a few Planck time units after the big bang, space was not yet space. It was a massive ball of unimaginable amounts of energy,  This is also false. I'm not even sure what this is supposed to mean.  When you rewind the clock, things get closer and closer together until at some point, the energy is packed together so tightly that spacetime has to be described with quantum mechanics, but there are numerous problems with formulating such a theory.  &gt;I am hope full that when a nuclear clock is finally created (much more accurate than an atomic clock) we may start to unwrap some of the mysteries of time.  A nuclear clock also has nothing to do with the nature of time. It simply allows us to measure time more accurately, though its error will still be many times greater than a Planck time.","256":"Planck time is the time it takes for light to travel one Planck length.  A Planck length is the resolution of a photon energetic enough to create a black hole, which basically means you can't see anything smaller than it.  None of this means they are the smallest possible length scales, just that they are scales at which quantum gravity becomes important.","257":"This is complicated. It's easiest to think of them as waves, but more accurately, they are waves of points.  The energy is proportional to the frequency of the wave, and resolution is also proportional to the frequency, and so we define the Planck length as the length at which the energy of a photon is high enough to make a black hole.","258":"Now that is a good question...

Kids need to know what is normal and what is not normal, so if there is a problem, they can talk to a doctor.

Are you looking for why people donate money via fundraisers to schools that they attended or go to networking events (like alumni functions). Or are you looking for why people put such significance on the \u201ccollege\/school\u201d experience (some of which I touched on).","278":"How do you think money comes into being? Only about 3% of money is printed. As the Bank of England explains here, money mostly comes about through the issuance of loans (https:\/\/www.bankofengland.co.uk\/quarterly-bulletin\/2014\/q1\/money-creation-in-the-modern-economy) and those loans come about by editing a spreadsheet.","279":"DNA is not a code.  You are looking at this backwards. There is nothing prescriptive going on here.  Rocks will roll down a hill and group up there.  The rocks did not \"know\" to be there.","280":"No it is not a code in the sense that it was coded to do something. People call it a code, but that is not what it is.  We are describing a chemical process after observing it.  These are molecules interacting with each other, not running a predetermined algorithm or something.","281":"No.  The DNA is a combination of chemicals that is different for each species.   This combination makes up the genes.   It wasn't predetermined that this is what would happen.   It evolved that way.  So when the proteins form it does so based on the genes.  This is not the same thing as having it predetermined.  Which is why its not great to call it a code.  A code has an intended purpose.   Additionally the offspring of species don't always copy the DNA correctly from the parents and there is a mutation,  which is how we ultimately get new genes, then new species etc.  In the end it is just chemicals reactions happening.  Physics and the laws of the universe  will just cause this to happen.","282":"Every point you make against industrial farming agriculture is another point against animal agriculture. The simple matter is that the majority of the world's land is used to grow food for livestock animals. No change in farming agriculture would amount to the improvement that ceasing to grow food for animals would yield. ","283":"I can only recall people making the fallacy in question a few times, but in all cases, it was to put somebody else down, or prop themselves up (by making themselves seem superior, or by clinging to their beliefs in the face of reasoning); never was it to benefit others.","284":"People buying shares can drive the price up. But, that buying is an effect, not the cause. The prices goes up because people believe that the company is worth more than what it is selling for. If a company has 100 shares (each stock is 1% ownership, and the stocks are a dollar each, then on the stock market, the company is worth 100$. If the company's balance sheet (net worth in actual assets) is worth 120$, then people will buy it (assuming no other variables) because by buying it, you get 1.20$ for 1$. As more people buy it, the availability of the stock decreases, which makes each share sell for more.   Never ever buy stock just because someone else did or that it is expensive. The value of the stock is based on the company it represents.","285":"Supply and demand affect scarcity and scarcity drives value in all markets. If i buy a stock for a dollar and sell it in a year for 3 dollars, i have realized value. If i didn't buy that 1 dollar stock, I'd have only a single dollar, not the extra 2.","286":"The inherent value comes from the owned assets of the company. The company owns physical goods (land, equipment, cash, etc) stock is ownership of that company and thus ownership of the goods owned by the company.","287":"No, instead, you can sell the stock you bought for money. Which, is in essense selling the partial ownership of those assets. It's not really different than you selling the physical goods yourself. You buy stock (partial ownership of physical goods), then you sell that ownership.","288":"Because the company can either reinvest that money into the company, ideally so the company becomes more valuable. Or, it can pay out dividends. The decision comes from whether the stockholders (in aggregate) think the company can use that money to make the company more valuable than what the stockholder can normally do.   Using you example earlier, if you made hundreds of your blood paintings, you wouldn't be rich, because no one would buy them. It's basic economics at that point, partial ownership of Amazon is more valued than your paintings are.   Amazon continues to expand its services and logistics network with the money it could spend on dividends. If it paid out dividends, it wouldn't be building as many new distribution centers and becoming more valuable to its customers who buy things from amazon. By doing so, it makes amazon ownership more valuable.","289":"By definition, protesters and agitators don't conform and try to be agents of change. But existing employees typically don't want anything to change. Therefore, they generally don't get along with noncomformists.  That also could explain why there tends to be prejudice against afros by others - they're not interested in any change in the status quo.","290":"As a header, life doesn't want anything. All systems will tend towards an equilibrium. Imagine you're hitting a golfball around a field for a million years, and there's a single rabbit hole somewhere in that field. Odds are the ball will eventually wind up in that hole, and once it does it is going to stay there.  The ball being in that hole is loosely analogous to life - it is something that is very unlikely but given enough time and the right circumstances it will eventually happen.  As for why life is stable, that's sort of by definition. If it weren't stable, then it wouldn't be life. Plenty of little bits of molecules stuck together in the ocean over several million or billion or trillion years, but they all fell apart. The one that didn't fall apart and instead replicated itself by complete accident was the one that survived long enough to evolve into humans, who promptly named this self-sustaining process \"life\".","291":"Many systems can be self-sustaining so long as they have 'food'. While we don't know the exact path that life followed as it formed, it seems safe to say that a very rudimentary von Neumann 'machine' molecule or arrangement of molecules came to be which then developed more and more complex 'programs' that eventually became DNA.  Again, such developments are very unlikely, but given the sheer number of molecules forming and breaking in the oceans even now, on the order of quintillions or more every second, over the course of trillions of years, it shouldn't be too shocking that it happened *once*.","292":"Hmm? I stopped caring when your post was removed, just been stringing you along seeing how worked up you can get about it.   Of course skipping gears is ok, it's just wrong in certain situations but not to a degree that can't be overcome by adding several hundred kilograms of metal to your vehicle.","293":"It actually says why it was removed right there, and it's not because anyone didn't like the question.   but if someone has this much trouble understanding removal reasons, understanding a jury of someone's peers finding someone guilty beyond a reasonable doubt would be an extremely tough thing to do.","294":"&gt;looks like there's a need for an astute explanation then.  if there's an *astute need* for you to learn something, you'll have to pay the full hour of tutoring up-front. I can send the invoice via paypal if that works for you.","295":"No, not pre-tax or post-tax.  You can pay yourself, period. Money that you pay yourself is part of your business's expenses, and therefore are not profit. \"I personally profit as a result of owning this business\" is not the same as the accounting definition of 'profit,' because English is the worst.","296":"&gt;Don't you get your business expenses through your profit?  I don't think I understand the question.  Your business has the money it takes in from the products and services it sells; this is called *revenue.*  Your business also has the money it pays out: money to keep the lights on, pay for raw materials, pay salaries, etc. These are called *expenses.* Crucially, salaries get paid out *here,* at this step.  Profit is simply Revenues minus Expenses, and it's this that must be zero in a non-profit, which means that everything needs to be fed back into an expense in some form or fashion.","297":"There was no before.    Space and Time started a split second after the big bang.  Everything in the universe comes from it.  An analogy:. If T.V was invented in 1927, where was it before 1927.  It simply wasn't a thing.  That's what was before the big bang.  Nothingness.  Not even black.  Oneness.  That concept alone is very hard for the human mind to conceptualise.","298":"It's a hard thing to conceptualise, but: there was no cause.  In quantum physics, for example, particles constantly pop in and out of exsistence, depending on measurement.  There is no cause, it just is.  When we measure it, we can see its effects, but not it's cause.  We are catching it in progress, in exsistence, because it simply happens.  The same applies to the big bang.  Don't worry, the universe is total chaos.","299":"Reality is far, far, stranger than what we see at our level.  At the quantum level, the level of atoms, reality is very different.

Well, for starters you're leaving a bunch of acceleration on the table by   &gt; skipping gears  And not using the peak of your power curve as much as you could be.   If you're consistently skipping the same gear that'll sacrifice a bit of longevity, though whether you'll keep the car long enough to need it is another question.   Fuel efficiency is definitely improved by using the bottom of your rev range, without going too low, which is literally impossible to judge accurately by feel for most people - though if you have perfect pitch that's not necessarily a concern.","301":"Smartphone apps simply use less system resources than their desktop counterparts and thus place less strain on the CPU, GPU, and RAM.  Also, there are very few desktop images for ARM, with the exception of ChromeOS and Raspbian (plus a few forks\/builds of other Linux distros).

Intelligent people have looked at the task of covering millions of square miles of the planet with a covering to capture some gas and decided that it makes absolutely no sense, and would then also completely ruin the ecosystems that would have to be covered, as well as taking an absurd amount of materials, resources, and energy to complete, and they decided it would be much more feasible to find other solutions that are actually possible.","312":"&gt; It could be as simple as vacuuming it up with big harvesters.

Placing something on a spectrum like the political left\/right is not done based on its name but on its properties and actions.","315":"I don't understand how those two differ. NaZi = National Socialist and socialism is not right wing let alone far right. It's just that the term 'nazi' and 'national socialist' has become an *example* of far right ideology. It didn't change the meaning of socialism.","316":"I'm not sure what the answer would tell you, because left\/right wing is based on more than economy oriented properties and in contrast to regular parties the Nazi party didn't follow a single ideology even in that regard.  Also if you would draw out the Nazi party's separate beliefs and policies you get more like a shotgun blast at various parts of the spectrum. Some policies could be seen as extreme left, some centrist-left, a lot far right obviously etc. So that way you can't 'fit' the party into a specific part of the spectrum. This is a key feature of this kind of parties that transcend the classical political classification that is left\/right wing. Nowadays it's more common for populist parties in Europe (don't know much about other parts of the world) where you see a combination of popular policies on both the left and right wing to 'attract' more followers if you call it that, but then also joined with a lot of far right policies, often played down to not be classified as such that easily.","317":"Human hearing ranges from (about) 20 Hz to 20,000 Hz.  If a sound wave falls outside of that range, you are not going to be able to hear it.  However, that doesn't mean that you aren't able to perceive it in other ways.  We can \"feel\" sound waves outside of our normal range of hearing - both above and below the 20\/20,000 thresholds.  The 18.9 Hz wave is no different - you can't hear it, but you can feel it is there.  In many people, this feeling manifests itself as fear or paranoia.  You can \"feel\" something in the room, but none of your other senses register anything consciously.  This incongruence greats discomfort,t which manifests as fear.  It is called the \"Ghost Frequency\" because it is theorized that many \"haunted\" areas simply produce tones close to 18.9 Hz (through resonance or other natural quirks) and people associate the fear response with a \"presence\" in the area.","318":"It is actually pretty tough to generate things that low - most speakers can't do it (since there is no point in making a sound no one can hear).

Helium will never \u201cdecay\u201d into lead, nor will neon etc.   When stars explode a large amount of heavier elements are formed, but again this isn\u2019t the same process.    &gt;Could lead ever decay into something else? Is there a half-life of lead?  I\u2019ve already told you that every single element has radioactive isotopes, see: https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Isotopes_of_lead - note just how many radioactive isotopes lead has, many are decay products from other elements, lead is the heaviest element that still has stable isotopes.   Isotopes are atoms with the same number of protons but different numbers of neutrons. Only specific configurations of protons and neutrons are stable, everything else is unstable and undergoes radioactive decay.   &gt;If lead does decay into something else, it would probably take us billions of years to find out, right?  See the link above    I think checking out some educational YouTube videos would help you. Try this one: https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=fES21E0qebw","352":"There already is a 7th row, and within our lifetimes there likely will be some elements added to the 8th row.   There will never be a 19th group unless IUPAC decides to change the layout of the periodic table (which it won\u2019t do). Just a note on this, the periodic table actually looks like this: https:\/\/encrypted-tbn3.gstatic.com\/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcRJaY9NjvEqGbvN3HSDyyO3GKilL7zoRWTdyTCf-3xYkqXqSvTt0V_onoGqvw (google Wide Periodic Table if that doesn\u2019t work), so technically it has 32 columns but those between groups 2 and 3 aren\u2019t given group numbers.","353":"Probably not.  The last few elements discovered on the 7th row already decay within fractions of seconds, and there\u2019s 50 elements to fill up the 8th row yet to be discovered before the 9th row.","354":"Why do you think I have any actual firsthand experience in this field? I read journals and understand the science.   It took about 70 years for the rest of the elements in the 7th row to be created, that was elements 95-118). The last few discovered decay within fractions of seconds. The faster something decays the harder it is to create and then detect.   We will likely see element 120 within 5 years, but getting to element 169 (which would be the first element on the 9th row) is going to to take a lot longer and will need improvements in technology if it can even be created at all.   Is there a reason you are so obsessed with this?","355":"Is it really important though? None of these elements have real world applications. It\u2019s mostly a dick waving contest.   If it\u2019s boring in school it\u2019s mostly because of boring teachers or boring curricula, or both. Chemistry is an amazing science because it\u2019s so essential to everything around us.   If it takes 5 years to discover element 119, and even if it takes 5 years past that for each other element you\u2019re looking at nearly 50000 years. And that\u2019s a theoretical number pulled out of nowhere with no basis in reality. There\u2019s other problems to overcome, like heavier elements needing electrons to travel at faster than the speed of light and somehow overcoming the repulsion of protons in the nucleus.","356":"We have ruled out that we are the center of the universe by using the Doppler effect on galaxies we are observing. If we were the center of the universe, everything would be moving away from us. However, there are some galaxies who\u2019s light has been shifted towards the red end of the spectrum, which according to Hubble\u2019s observations, means that the galaxy is accelerated towards us.","357":"No, because if we were at the centre, it would be impossible for thing to be moving towards us. The universe is not static, and doesn\u2019t have a barrier for said galaxies to rebound off of. It is constantly accelerating expansion. For example if you drop a rock in a lake, the waves ripple outwards, not towards the rock. But if some galaxies, had a lighter mass, they would be moving faster and possibly overtake others as will happen with the Milky Way and andromeda","358":"They are all guesses or anecdotes pretty much. The question itself is a medical question and while there are standard answers OP should ask a doctor because it could be symptomatic of something else\/worse.","359":"So remember an object is all word based for you, even a complicated object? (Like, the inside of a machine... Like a camshaft in an engine? I would be stumbling finding words for describing that, yet I can visualise one from multiple angles easily, yet I've never handled one in person!)  Btw, I'm trying to track down a quote about imagination and describing\/visualising things, from which (if my memory is right) the camshaft example comes","360":"I found the quote I was thinking of... an anecdote from Richard Feynman, arguably one of the greatest physicists of the 20th century.   &amp;#x200B;  &gt;When I was a  kid growing up in Far Rockaway, I  had a friend named Bernie Walker. We both had \"labs\" at home, and we would do various \"experiments.\" One time, we were discussing something - we must have been 11 or 12 at the time - and I  said, \"But thinking is nothing but talking to yourself inside.\"       &gt;   &gt;\"Oh yeah?\" Bernie said. \"Do you know the crazy shape of the crankshaft in car?\"      &gt;   &gt;\"Yeah, what of it?\"      &gt;   &gt;\"Good. Now tell me: how did you describe it when you were talking to yourself?\"       &gt;   &gt;So I  learned from Bernie that thoughts can be visual as well as verbal.   &amp;#x200B;  \u2014 [http:\/\/calteches.library.caltech.edu\/607\/2\/Feynman.pdf](http:\/\/calteches.library.caltech.edu\/607\/2\/Feynman.pdf)","361":"The whole piece is worth reading - it talks about how some people count to themselves audibly (imagining a voice counting, as it were), and some people count to themselves visually (imagining watching a clock) - and how the different types of thinking to yourself affects your ability to do different things simultaneously.      Goes on to describe how Feynman then tried to learn to do both (as have I since reading this. And like Feynman, have failed).      More importantly, the larger point of the story is about how even basic everyday things that are \"universal\" can be done in completely unexpected and, frankly, alien seeming ways for other people! :)","362":"Vaccinations train your body on how to fight diseases. It basically gives your body the \"I have seen that one before\" power over sickness.  However you need to be kind of healthy to get vaccinated. There are certain conditions under which you cannot receive vaccines (you are very young, your immune system is gone due to birth defects or cancer treatment,. ..).  These people rely on an effect called \"herd immunity\".  Basically you die if you get infected but you never get infected because everyone around you is vaccinated. This prevents a disease from spreading.  Unfortunately to achieve herd immunity roughly 98% of the population have to be vaccinated.  So for me personally as a vaccinated, healthy adult it makes no difference if you are vaccinated or not. For my little daughter or my cancer stricken relative it is a life or death situation (unfortunately quite literally).  Therefore if you are healthy and able to get a shot, go get a shot. It will safe someone's life.  (Kind of the same principle as you clear a lane for an ambulance. Yes it is inconvenient for you for 30 seconds but you help safe a live and you would expect others to do it for you).","363":"Depends on where you come from. In Germany you have a general practitioner that is \"your doctor\". It gets documented with your health insurance.  In Norway you get a doctor assigned and are not allowed to go to a different one, except for emergencies (afaik).","364":"You mean pubic hair? Yeah it usually grows in front, on down between the legs and a little bit on the butt hole area. It's just often seen as taboo, so some women shave or wax to get rid of it. But that's her decision to make and its perfectly find to keep it all or remove it all. Shaving and waxing can hurt and cause ingrown hairs which is one reason some may not want to remove the hair.","365":"It's just how the human body is. \u00af\\_(\u30c4)_\/\u00af Can't do much about it. Lots of religions have stories that give reasons if that's something you believe in.  Although I think it is pretty flippin awesome that women can grow a child inside of her. And then feed it with her own body too. It's like a superpower.","366":"I\u2019d say that the UBI will be very basic. Pretty much essential items, food, shelter, water, electricity, internet, petrol and phone plan. Anything extra you want will most likely come from some sort of job, even if its a handcraft or service type thing.","367":"I mean it depends on what you mean by \"analog\". An analog what? You can send 5 volts of electricity to any electrical component, what happens when you do that is going to depend on what the component is designed to do (and also depends on whether you're sending AC or DC current).  If you send 5 volts to the digital processor in my example above, it would be interpreted as a 1\/On\/True however you want to represent that. A string of those might represent an instruction or something.  If you send the same 5 volts to a 12 volt analog LED, it might light up with about 40% brightness. Analog doesn't have \"positions\", that's the point. We measure its voltage level.","368":"At this point we're not talking about computers at all, but the difference between analog and digital electrical circuits. This is less Computer Science and more Electrical Engineering.  An analog circuit is either \"on\" or \"off\", but its operation can also change based on the energy level. Usually we design the circuit for a specific voltage level (eg. 110V in a US household), and change the current draw to change its operation. Eg. to make a toaster coil hotter or a fan spin faster.  A digital circuit always just \"exists\", with its operation determined by the sequence of on\/off electrical signals transmitted through it. Note that it's the circuit as a whole that is designed to be \"digital\". Individual components like transistors or capacitors are inherently \"analog\", we just use them in different ways.  The concept of \"1s and 0s\" is just something we humans use to help work with digital circuits because of the constant stream of on\/off data going through the circuit - it's useful to represent it as binary numbers. Analog circuits don't operate this way so the concept is kind of useless.","369":"&gt; https:\/\/www.european-views.com\/2019\/05\/germany-learned-it-must-be-country-of-immigration-merkel-says-on-70th-constitution-anniversary\/  Yeah, I don't see the quote in there...

Just the cold alone is enough to make my fingers hurt enough to consider amputation. About 35\u00b0 F seems to be the point where it starts. The rest of me is fine, just my fingers have the issue.","372":"I've been wondering of late if arm compression sleeves might help. I wear gloves for work and most of the time I'm not in my house. Have to protect my dish pan hands. But I wear thin gloves because I need nimble fingers. They don't really protect against the cold. I suppose it's worth a try.","373":"They are supposed to promote circulation. Sports people use them all the time.  No room for the hair dryer next to the ear protection.

Might work for your cycling, but I know I'd destroy them doing remodels.","374":"I have seen closer to $230,000, but regardless, much of that is disposable income that parents want to spend.  Just because the average cost of a car is high doesn\u2019t mean someone poor has to buy an expensive car, it just means people who have money like to spend it on cars.  I have the income to do so, so I spend a lot of money on my daughter because it makes me happy.  And that increases the average but others don\u2019t have to.  Basically the number is high because people want to spend money on their kids.  Nobody needs a $1000 crib.","375":"Sort of.  Since people are having fewer kids they have the ability to do more for the kids they do have.  Also having kids at an older age means they have more money.  Also, it inflates the cost when both parents work so they have to pay child care, but rarely does someone work if they can\u2019t make more than childcare costs.  So instead of staying home with their children, they earn $40,000 per year and pay $20,000 per year in child care.  In the end they have more money than if they stayed home with their kids, but studies like these make it look like it is costing the family $20,000 more than previous generations.    I buy a lot of stuff that would be considered for my daughter because it makes my life easier or because I get more enjoyment buying something for her than something for myself.  But all those costs go into looking like it is just expensive to have kids.","376":"I think there is a difference in spoiling a child and overspending on a child.  I seriously doubt my daughter is going to end up feeling like she needs expensive things because her mom wanted her to have an expensive Easter dress or an expensive crib.  On the other hand, if I buy her a toy every time I took her to the supermarket, that probably will spoil her.  I\u2019m sure it is easier in theory than in practice, but I intend to make sure my children understand the value of money and that everything in life is a trade off.  It is possible to make more money but there are sacrifices to do so.  And while some passion projects might not earn as much, there is also a difference in making less because you choose something you love, and making less because you simply chose to be lazy.","377":"No, it suddenly gives you the right to 10% of Amazon's ownership, in the aggregate.   Use a small business for example with 2 owners. You and me, for example. If i want the money out of the business and you want to grow the business, you wouldn't let me sell the store front, as it would cripple the business, even if the office space is half the value....","378":"That is one way to look at it, yes. That's why dividends exist. It's not the only way to look at it though. Because without the business keeping that profit to invest back into the business, it could never grow, giving up increasing value in the future.  Take manufacturing, say that you build widgets, each widget nets x profit. That x value can be given out as dividends or it can be used to increase the number of widgets we make and sell. So, by giving up x now and letting the company build another production line of widgets, next year, i get 3x (2x for 2 years of profits, plus x for the new production line of widgets they made)","379":"Why would there need to be another purpose other than selling it? If i buy antique or collectors items, they don't pay dividends, i only get cash value when i see them. Likewise, whenever i buy most things (like as a business owner buying inventory to sell) they own their inventory, but get zero value until it is sold.","380":"\"Because you need to\".... then only buy stocks that give our regular dividends.   I understand why you want dividends, but the conversation has moved from you don't understand why some stocks don't do dividends to crying that some don't, those are fundamentally different concepts.   Your way of viewing stocks is valid and some stocks share your point of view, but it isn't the ONLY valid way to view stocks. In the end, the decision to pay dividends is based on the board of directors, which the stockholders can vote on...","381":"Because the board enacts the will of the stock holders, based on stockholder voting. The idea of having tens of thousands of people try to run a company (each stock holder) would be a surefire way to end any company. Thus, like government, people are appointed to the board based on the majority of stock ownership.   I have no idea how you think just splitting stock would somehow be a solution for that, as every single stock issued dilutes the rest....   At the end of the day, if you don't like a company that doesn't pay dividends, don't buy their stock. No one is forcing you to buy it...","382":"By that definition of mlm, then every wholesaler that sells to walmart, target etc is a mlm. In that case, mlms make the world function......  A ponzi scheme requires there to be an exaggerated or novalue behind the product being bought or sold. If everyone just held their stocks, (thus demand for buying stocks just froze), then people would sell their stocks (potentially liquidating the company) or stock holders would then demand dividends. Either way, there is value behind the product (ownership) being exchanged...  And yes, companies do typically buy back stock during recession (the opposite of dilluting) to manage stock prices, which is based on the majority of stock holders decision.","383":"So wholesalers.   A) there is intrinsic value, as you have partial ownership of material goods (what the company owns)   B) the competition is between companies, aka you can buy that companies stock or this companies stock. The stock values are extremely competitive within an industry.  It really feels like I'm helping you write a highschool econ paper...  Also given the way these things are being spread out, we will come back to ponzi schemes, one topic at a time (for now wholesalers or mlm","384":"You didn't answer or acknowledge the limitations of being wholesales (aka mlm), so i will assume this is based on mlm.  When i buy apples directly from an orchard, i take the risk (just like buying stock) that i can sell them at a profit to grocers (who sell them to the consumers who consume them). I have no control over whether or not the grocers will buy them or not. I may end up with rotting apples because i didn't realize that people now hate apples...","385":"Market research also shows that stocks are valuable, so your previous point is invalid. Why would i buy stock if i knew the value was frozen?  Your analogy would make purchasing any currency in foreign currency moot. I could invest in buying yen, i can't eat that, but correctly i can use it to buy apples.... likewise for bolts, 2 by 4s, etc....","386":"Ha ha ha ha ha!!! Mooo!

The thing is that in most of them, the mayority of the land mass will be found in the northern hemisphere (for example, in the Amasia hypothesis, all the land mass is on the northern hemisphere except for the Antarctica).

Too much damage to cellular structures can cause the cell to destroy itself, as can too much damage to DNA. This is why bad sunburn causes skin to peel off, the epidermal and dermal layers received enough damage to decide they need to kill themselves for the greater good. However, if DNA is damaged in certain ways, it can lead to cancer. It's not that DNA can't be repaired at all, it's that it is the \"master program\" for the cell and can be modified in ways that make the cell do things that it isn't supposed to.   You can also receive too much damage to important cells like in organs. It's actually therapeutic in some situations, such as using radioactive iodine to destroy some of a large thyroid, but many organs are not good at regenerating so the damage can hamper their functionality.","404":"It's not just skin, it's called apoptosis and most cells in the body can do it.

So in order to have the government provide the same level of healthcare, it likely will end up costing the government *more* because of how inefficient the government is at these kinds of things, in major part because the government isn't interested in a profit motive, and as a result isn't as interested in cost-savings measures.","421":"&gt;What is the evidence that government inefficiency would make the costs increase.  Government procurement is historically prone to cost overruns, bloat, and inefficiency. You can look at military spending for an example of this.  &gt;It would seem that taking out all of the private insurance middlemen would result in much lower costs.  But in the process, you get rid of the negotiators involved in drug\/treatment cost negotiations, and instead the government will just pay whatever the cost is without thinking about it, again because the government doesn't have significant means to fight for cost savings.  We already have a very similar problem with respect to student loans; the increased cost of college education in the US is largely due to the US government being so willing to pump money into higher education through student loans without any form of price controls or cost incentives.","422":"Do me a personal favor.

The best I can do for ELI5: using transistors you can build logic gates. Using logic gates you can build logical functions. Transistors can also control which logic gates get activated based on a given input. You change which transistors are activated by sending signals to certain CPU pins in a certain order.

Goes on to describe how Feynman then tried to learn to do both (as have I since reading this. And like Feynman, have failed).

We want the fluid to have certain properties when it comes out of the boiler (we don't actually want steam) and when we have a high boiling point, we can put in more energy.  Also, water can store a lot of energy before it actually changes temperature, way more than acetone.    The turbine speed is related to how much fluid you pump through it, not the temperature although the fluid type can effect that.  The thing that varies with the temperature is the torque, how hard the turbine can try to turn stuff.\nExplainee: Right, and the energy is generated by the turbine spinning, so wouldn't the liquid phase boiling at a lower temperature but generating the same pressure generate the same energy output?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Right, this explanation is all compatible with thermodynamics (more energy in=more energy out), but why? Why doesn't a gas molecule at the same pressure affecting the same surface area and moving at the same speed, just at a different temperature, not move the turbine the same amount? The turbine extracts energy by spinning. It doesn't convert heat energy at all, it converts the kinetic energy of the paddles spinning to electricity, and that kinetic energy is generated by pressure.\nExplainer: You know, I almost included this in the last post but I decided not to include it to keep it simple.  The turbine is designed to bring the gas to supersonic speeds.  If we look at the conservation of energy, the gas needs to cool down to actually do this.  So a gas that's hotter can go faster in the turbine and faster velocities allow for more power to be generated.\n","16":"Explainee: ELI5: In Chemistry, why are they called the Noble Gases?

It also goes beyond cancer, you don't want malfunctioning cells dumping chemicals into the rest of the body. It's an interesting process, multicellular organisms like humans aren't necessarily doing the best for individual cells, but for the whole.\n","34":"Explainer: There are a few effects; ionization will break apart biologically important molecules, which can then become \"radicals\" which can break apart more molecules or damage proteins. Too much damage to cellular structures can cause the cell to destroy itself, as can too much damage to DNA. This is why bad sunburn causes skin to peel off, the epidermal and dermal layers received enough damage to decide they need to kill themselves for the greater good. However, if DNA is damaged in certain ways, it can lead to cancer. It's not that DNA can't be repaired at all, it's that it is the \"master program\" for the cell and can be modified in ways that make the cell do things that it isn't supposed to.   You can also receive too much damage to important cells like in organs. It's actually therapeutic in some situations, such as using radioactive iodine to destroy some of a large thyroid, but many organs are not good at regenerating so the damage can hamper their functionality.\nExplainee: Never really thought about it that way.

For 1080p, thats 1920 x 1080 pixels x 3 numbers x 60 frames per second=373,248,000 numbers per second, or in more familiar units 3.73 MegaBytes per Second. That's what a MegaByte *is* 1 million 8bit numbers. Considering most PCs today have GigaBytes of memory and Terabytes of storage--1000 and 1million times larger respectively--video display isn't that taxing.  The monitor ultimately just turns lights on and off. The final number goes to each red\/green\/blue subpixel and controls a power supply, regulating how much voltage it puts out, which ultimately controls how much light is allowed through or blocked.\n","67":"Explainer: Why would that limit the resolution?

How does it do shades? How many transistors are we talking about here?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: What's the difference between digital and analog, then, if they both work like this?\nExplainer: Digital devices are designed to produce 1 of only 2 states ON and OFF. These are meant to be completely distinct, with no in between.  Analog devices still use transistors, but they allow for many shades of grey between 0 current an maximum current.   Transistors work like switches, with current flowing from the Source to the Drain, controlled by the Gate. This lets a tiny voltage at the Gate control a much larger current, like how a tiny valve can completely shut off a pipe.   Digital devices are designed to only have their gate ON or OFF. Analog devices can take a range of voltages through the gate that gradually turns on the current flowing through the device. This lets a tiny signal be amplified into a much bigger one, wiggling the \"valve\" creates a much stronger wiggle in the current through the \"pipe\", and this can turn the tiny electromagnetic field of a radio wave into something you can hear, with a little external power supplied by something else to drive the main current.\n","68":"Explainer: &gt;How does it send to each?  Lots and lots of wires.  &gt;How does it do shades?  As I said, each number ranges from 0 to 255, where 0 is \"black\" and 255 is \"as bright as it can\".  &gt;How many transistors are we talking about here?  Tens of billions. At this point, transistors in modern chips have features 5 nanometers across, that's only about 45 silicon atoms across. They really pack them in.\nExplainee: What's the difference between digital and analog, then, if they both work like this?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: How does a digital produce only one of two?\nExplainer: The output from one transistor is strong enough to completely max out the Gate of another.\n","69":"Explainer: The output from one transistor is strong enough to completely max out the Gate of another.\nExplainee: Why was this not possible in analog?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: So analog has more than 1 and 0?

This lets a tiny voltage at the Gate control a much larger current, like how a tiny valve can completely shut off a pipe. Analog devices can take a range of voltages through the gate that gradually turns on the current flowing through the device.   Remember, 1 and 0 are just what we call ON and OFF. Its all a matter of how much current is flowing. We get to choose how to interpret that.\n","70":"Explainer: Its not *impossible* its just not what its meant to do. Digital isn't \"better\" than analog, they just do completely different things. You use analog to handle real-world signals that can take a range of values, you use digital to do math and process information. Ultimately, you translate back and forth as needed, like in the case of a monitor taking a digital signal to produce an analog image.\nExplainee: So analog has more than 1 and 0?

Remember there isn't really a real 'black'.  That is just a word we made up for what our brain does.  Pretend humans never developed eyes and we never evolved to have the sense of sight.  We have no idea of color or what things look like or anything.  Light particles are still bouncing around and being reflected off everything, everywhere, but in the case of the vantablack, when light hits that area, it just reflects less light than other surfaces. (less information is being reflected)  Another way to look at it is take a digital camera and point it at the car.  Well there is a sensitive chip in there that is like an eye.  The light hits the chip, and activate certain parts of that chip which the computer makes into an image on the screen.  The vantablack areas did not activate that part of the chip.

So there is light bouncing off the car and coming into your eye.  So it's not like there is some information coming from the car into your eyes and brains saying, 'hey its really really black right here'.  What is happening is the cells in your eye are not getting any information at all, and those cells in turn do not activate the brain in the same way.

Such transmutation is possible in particle accelerators or nuclear reactors, although the production cost is currently many times the market price of gold. Since there is only one stable gold isotope,\u00a0197Au, nuclear reactions must create this isotope in order to produce usable gold.  Gold synthesis in an acceleratorEdit  Gold synthesis in a particle accelerator is possible in many ways. The\u00a0Spallation Neutron Source\u00a0has a liquid mercury target which will be transmuted into gold, platinum, and iridium, which are lower in atomic number than mercury.[citation needed]  Gold synthesis in a nuclear reactorEdit  Gold was synthesized from\u00a0mercury\u00a0by neutron bombardment in 1941, but the\u00a0isotopes of gold\u00a0produced were all\u00a0radioactive.[12]\u00a0In 1924, a Japanese physicist,\u00a0Hantaro Nagaoka, accomplished the same feat.[13]  Gold can currently be manufactured in a nuclear reactor by the\u00a0irradiation\u00a0of either\u00a0platinum\u00a0or mercury.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: All processes get cheaper eventually   And even if they couldn't, the question was never whether you could \"profitably\" turn lead into gold, only that you could turn lead into gold   Well, maybe it was for certain people but I'm sure not for others  If you really disliked the current economic system and wanted to turn it all on its head you could just make a shitload of gold and give it to everyone\nExplainer: It was always whether it could be profitable that's literally the only reason to choose gold.

Also, are there any physical reactions the body gives off to this save the eerie feeling?\nExplainer: It is actually pretty tough to generate things that low - most speakers can't do it (since there is no point in making a sound no one can hear).  That said, yes, you could make a house \"feel\" haunted by pumping in 18.9 Hz tones - people would feel the room was \"off\".  As for physical reactions, nothing due to the sound itself but there are all sorts of physiological reactions to fear.\n","78":"Explainer: Human hearing ranges from (about) 20 Hz to 20,000 Hz.  If a sound wave falls outside of that range, you are not going to be able to hear it.  However, that doesn't mean that you aren't able to perceive it in other ways.  We can \"feel\" sound waves outside of our normal range of hearing - both above and below the 20\/20,000 thresholds.  The 18.9 Hz wave is no different - you can't hear it, but you can feel it is there.  In many people, this feeling manifests itself as fear or paranoia.  You can \"feel\" something in the room, but none of your other senses register anything consciously.  This incongruence greats discomfort,t which manifests as fear.  It is called the \"Ghost Frequency\" because it is theorized that many \"haunted\" areas simply produce tones close to 18.9 Hz (through resonance or other natural quirks) and people associate the fear response with a \"presence\" in the area.\nExplainee: Great explanation.

The alpha\/beta\/gamma particles coming out might crash around and damage other atoms, but this is a result of the decay and doesn't precipitate more decay in most cases (fission can be an exception).  &amp;#x200B;  For fission, you can imagine the nucleus like a deformed ball. Unstable nuclei will \"oscillate\" such that the ball will get more spherical and more elongated repeatedly. If it manages to stretch to far, it'll break apart. This is a decent analogy, though being somewhat quantum mechanical it isn't quite that simple.\nExplainee:  So when a Uranium atom decays into \"stable\" Thorium, is it possible that another alpha\/beta\/gamma particles can knock into it, turning it back into Uranium or has the particles lost just enough energy in it's initial emission to not be able to return, \"upgrading\" the atom again?

This is why it is said heavy elements originate in supernovae, normal stars don't have the energy to fuse beyond iron. If the nucleus is unstable enough and gets run into, it can cause it to break apart, which is exploited by nuclear reactors to sustain the controlled fission reactions.\nExplainee: As far as suoernovae, it's because there's a ton of high energy+high gravity\/pressure keeping them together to fuse if I have that correct? \nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: It sort of reminds me of [that way to arrange magnets](https:\/\/youtu.be\/h34L9udPlv4) in such a way that it will repel when kinda far but snap in once close although I realize that in the video, atoms wouldn't lock in at that further distance. \n","134":"Explainer: &gt; The actual proof, I imagine, involves a whole bunch of symbols  It's not super hard to understand.

I do think I understand what a proof by contradiction is supposed to do.  You start with an assumption:  \"P.\"  Then, through reasoning, you show that \"P\" leads to something that cannot be true (e.g., 2 + 2 = 0), therefore (assuming the steps hold) the initial assumption is the thing that cannot be true.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: My other rejoinder--and I know that it must be fallacious--would be that \"there must be a better way to generate a list containing all of the numbers, and my initial list wasn't generated optimally.\"  I don't know enough about math or set theory to know how or why Cantor's proof responds to that, although I trust that the proof works given how long it's been around and how many people have examined it.\nExplainer: &gt;  \"there must be a better way to generate a list containing all of the numbers, and my initial list wasn't generated optimally.\"   The key is, no matter how you generated the list, how well thought-out it was, since diagonal argument assumes nothing of what's in the list or how it was made, the same argument still proves it's not complete.\n","135":"Explainer: &gt; (I'm one of those people who'd say \"just add the number you've created to the list\"  The assumption initially made was \"this list contains all the numbers\".

This is less Computer Science and more Electrical Engineering.  An analog circuit is either \"on\" or \"off\", but its operation can also change based on the energy level. Usually we design the circuit for a specific voltage level (eg. 110V in a US household), and change the current draw to change its operation. Eg. to make a toaster coil hotter or a fan spin faster.  A digital circuit always just \"exists\", with its operation determined by the sequence of on\/off electrical signals transmitted through it. Note that it's the circuit as a whole that is designed to be \"digital\". Individual components like transistors or capacitors are inherently \"analog\", we just use them in different ways.  The concept of \"1s and 0s\" is just something we humans use to help work with digital circuits because of the constant stream of on\/off data going through the circuit - it's useful to represent it as binary numbers.

Thus, because of the existence of at least one counterexample, there can't be such a thing as the Perfect Decider (i.e., there can't be a program that can correctly determine, for any possible program that could ever exist, halts or instead runs forever).

You start with an assumption:  \"P.\"  Then, through reasoning, you show that \"P\" leads to something that cannot be true (e.g., 2 + 2 = 0), therefore (assuming the steps hold) the initial assumption is the thing that cannot be true.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: My other rejoinder--and I know that it must be fallacious--would be that \"there must be a better way to generate a list containing all of the numbers, and my initial list wasn't generated optimally.\"  I don't know enough about math or set theory to know how or why Cantor's proof responds to that, although I trust that the proof works given how long it's been around and how many people have examined it.\nExplainer: &gt;  \"there must be a better way to generate a list containing all of the numbers, and my initial list wasn't generated optimally.\"   The key is, no matter how you generated the list, how well thought-out it was, since diagonal argument assumes nothing of what's in the list or how it was made, the same argument still proves it's not complete.\n","181":"Explainer: &gt; (I'm one of those people who'd say \"just add the number you've created to the list\"  The assumption initially made was \"this list contains all the numbers\".

But there's probably some property of numbers that I'm missing in my intuitive \"acceptance\" of the diagonalization proof (e.g., I don't know what the relationship between \"reals\" and \"integers\" is).\n","182":"Explainer: Any concentration matters.

Because if you own something that in reality doesn't do anything until you sell it, then where is the value?\nExplainer: Why would there need to be another purpose other than selling it? If i buy antique or collectors items, they don't pay dividends, i only get cash value when i see them. Likewise, whenever i buy most things (like as a business owner buying inventory to sell) they own their inventory, but get zero value until it is sold.\n","188":"Explainer: That is one way to look at it, yes. That's why dividends exist. It's not the only way to look at it though. Because without the business keeping that profit to invest back into the business, it could never grow, giving up increasing value in the future.  Take manufacturing, say that you build widgets, each widget nets x profit. That x value can be given out as dividends or it can be used to increase the number of widgets we make and sell. So, by giving up x now and letting the company build another production line of widgets, next year, i get 3x (2x for 2 years of profits, plus x for the new production line of widgets they made)\nExplainee: so that's fine, but what if the company never hands out dividends?

In that case, mlms make the world function......  A ponzi scheme requires there to be an exaggerated or novalue behind the product being bought or sold. If everyone just held their stocks, (thus demand for buying stocks just froze), then people would sell their stocks (potentially liquidating the company) or stock holders would then demand dividends. Either way, there is value behind the product (ownership) being exchanged...  And yes, companies do typically buy back stock during recession (the opposite of dilluting) to manage stock prices, which is based on the majority of stock holders decision.\nExplainee: The difference with wholesalers, is that there is intrinsic value, i.e. Food, water, etc. Stocks don't have intrinsic value. And there's competition for the same objecrlt, e.g. Tomatoes. MLMs don't have competition, because you buy it from the company only.  And company buying shares back during recessions is what I mean by non-dividend shares as not being not intrinsically valuable. People only sell things that have less value while being held. So non-dividend shares are valuable like art. Whatever the buyers decides.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: But that's the key right? You own something you have no control over.  You can buy stocks between companies, but that's like selling apples and oranges.

When i buy apples directly from an orchard, i take the risk (just like buying stock) that i can sell them at a profit to grocers (who sell them to the consumers who consume them).

Star Gate uses \"hyper space\" so you go into another \"dimension\" to and then come back.  https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Interstellar_travel_in_fiction  It all depends on the show but most good shows make it realistic enough and have science advisors telling them obvious flaws.   Like in the video game Mass Effect they discovered a way to remove \"mass\" from objects and even go negative so it's possible to go faster than light, and their ships travels like normal ones would accelerating half of the trip then turning around and accelerating backwards to arrive at the destination at normal speeds.

This lets a tiny voltage at the Gate control a much larger current, like how a tiny valve can completely shut off a pipe. Analog devices can take a range of voltages through the gate that gradually turns on the current flowing through the device.   Remember, 1 and 0 are just what we call ON and OFF.

You own a part of the effort the company put into this. How is this different from you buying a chicken, cooking it and selling it for more? If you sold someone a 25% share of your chicken company, then that person is entitled to 25% of the value of the company. You no longer own 100% of that company. If all you did was sell one chicken, then you need to give that person 25% of the profits from that chicken.

It was a massive ball of unimaginable amounts of energy,  This is also false. I'm not even sure what this is supposed to mean.  When you rewind the clock, things get closer and closer together until at some point, the energy is packed together so tightly that spacetime has to be described with quantum mechanics, but there are numerous problems with formulating such a theory.  &gt;I am hope full that when a nuclear clock is finally created (much more accurate than an atomic clock) we may start to unwrap some of the mysteries of time.

This combination makes up the genes.   It wasn't predetermined that this is what would happen.   It evolved that way.  So when the proteins form it does so based on the genes.  This is not the same thing as having it predetermined.  Which is why its not great to call it a code.  A code has an intended purpose.   Additionally the offspring of species don't always copy the DNA correctly from the parents and there is a mutation,  which is how we ultimately get new genes, then new species etc.  In the end it is just chemicals reactions happening.

The prices goes up because people believe that the company is worth more than what it is selling for. If a company has 100 shares (each stock is 1% ownership, and the stocks are a dollar each, then on the stock market, the company is worth 100$. If the company's balance sheet (net worth in actual assets) is worth 120$, then people will buy it (assuming no other variables) because by buying it, you get 1.20$ for 1$. As more people buy it, the availability of the stock decreases, which makes each share sell for more.   Never ever buy stock just because someone else did or that it is expensive.

The decision comes from whether the stockholders (in aggregate) think the company can use that money to make the company more valuable than what the stockholder can normally do.   Using you example earlier, if you made hundreds of your blood paintings, you wouldn't be rich, because no one would buy them. It's basic economics at that point, partial ownership of Amazon is more valued than your paintings are.   Amazon continues to expand its services and logistics network with the money it could spend on dividends.

The added complexity *in some contexts* clearly makes life more able to sustain itself, otherwise it wouldn't evolve. In places where it is not useful, it does not evolve. This is why viruses are simple - they don't benefit from added complexity.  As for exactly how they work, they take advantage of the complexity in their hosts. The complicated things like growing and protecting oneself and getting food and reproducing are all handled by the host cell. *Somebody* has to do those things, and the virus simply allows the host cell to do them. Viruses don't even really understand how to make more viruses - they simply turn themselves over to the advanced machinery of the host and allow the host to use its own 'knowledge' of replication to make more virus.\n","291":"Explainer: Stability and complexity are unrelated.

That said, yes, you could make a house \"feel\" haunted by pumping in 18.9 Hz tones - people would feel the room was \"off\".  As for physical reactions, nothing due to the sound itself but there are all sorts of physiological reactions to fear.\n","318":"Explainer: Human hearing ranges from (about) 20 Hz to 20,000 Hz.  If a sound wave falls outside of that range, you are not going to be able to hear it.  However, that doesn't mean that you aren't able to perceive it in other ways.  We can \"feel\" sound waves outside of our normal range of hearing - both above and below the 20\/20,000 thresholds.  The 18.9 Hz wave is no different - you can't hear it, but you can feel it is there.  In many people, this feeling manifests itself as fear or paranoia.  You can \"feel\" something in the room, but none of your other senses register anything consciously.  This incongruence greats discomfort,t which manifests as fear.  It is called the \"Ghost Frequency\" because it is theorized that many \"haunted\" areas simply produce tones close to 18.9 Hz (through resonance or other natural quirks) and people associate the fear response with a \"presence\" in the area.\nExplainee: Great explanation.

Some of the fear is that it will encourage kids to start having sex early but I think it's important for everyone to know how the body works. Everyone has one, so why hide it?  Kids need to know what is normal and what is not normal, so if there is a problem, they can talk to a doctor.

A wire is either carrying enough voltage to decide that it's \"On\", or it's not in which case it's \"Off\". There is no in between.  So for example a processor that operates with a 5 volt data pin, the manufacturer might decide anything below 2.5 volts is a \"off\" and anything 2.5 volts or above is \"on\". And anything higher than 7 volts might kill the chip. Certain electrical tolerances are built into the components.\nExplainee: So doesnt analog have the same 2 positions as digital?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: So analog doesnt do 1s and 0s because it doesnt have 1 and 0 positions, but only %s of them?\nExplainer: At this point we're not talking about computers at all, but the difference between analog and digital electrical circuits. This is less Computer Science and more Electrical Engineering.  An analog circuit is either \"on\" or \"off\", but its operation can also change based on the energy level. Usually we design the circuit for a specific voltage level (eg. 110V in a US household), and change the current draw to change its operation. Eg. to make a toaster coil hotter or a fan spin faster.  A digital circuit always just \"exists\", with its operation determined by the sequence of on\/off electrical signals transmitted through it. Note that it's the circuit as a whole that is designed to be \"digital\". Individual components like transistors or capacitors are inherently \"analog\", we just use them in different ways.  The concept of \"1s and 0s\" is just something we humans use to help work with digital circuits because of the constant stream of on\/off data going through the circuit - it's useful to represent it as binary numbers. Analog circuits don't operate this way so the concept is kind of useless.\n","368":"Explainer: I mean it depends on what you mean by \"analog\". An analog what? You can send 5 volts of electricity to any electrical component, what happens when you do that is going to depend on what the component is designed to do (and also depends on whether you're sending AC or DC current).  If you send 5 volts to the digital processor in my example above, it would be interpreted as a 1\/On\/True however you want to represent that. A string of those might represent an instruction or something.  If you send the same 5 volts to a 12 volt analog LED, it might light up with about 40% brightness. Analog doesn't have \"positions\", that's the point. We measure its voltage level.\nExplainee: So analog doesnt do 1s and 0s because it doesnt have 1 and 0 positions, but only %s of them?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Bit the computer still processes it as either on or off, and doesnt process the other states?\nExplainer: Yes.

Since people are having fewer kids they have the ability to do more for the kids they do have.  Also having kids at an older age means they have more money.  Also, it inflates the cost when both parents work so they have to pay child care, but rarely does someone work if they can\u2019t make more than childcare costs.  So instead of staying home with their children, they earn $40,000 per year and pay $20,000 per year in child care.

I have the income to do so, so I spend a lot of money on my daughter because it makes me happy.  And that increases the average but others don\u2019t have to.

Do you think that the buying of these \"luxury\" items, things that make the parents happy but of course the kids don't know any different at first (like your example of a fancy onesie)...do you think that parents buying these things influences their kids to want\/need more when they grow up?

I seriously doubt my daughter is going to end up feeling like she needs expensive things because her mom wanted her to have an expensive Easter dress or an expensive crib.  On the other hand, if I buy her a toy every time I took her to the supermarket, that probably will spoil her.  I\u2019m sure it is easier in theory than in practice, but I intend to make sure my children understand the value of money and that everything in life is a trade off.  It is possible to make more money but there are sacrifices to do so.

If you invest in yen and try to use it in another country, it is very likely most places will not accept the currency unless you are willing to trade at a decent or significant loss. So that investment makes no sense because it is unusable until converted, which requires a person willing to trade it.

However, if DNA is damaged in certain ways, it can lead to cancer.

This includes initialising all the connected hardware, and eventually telling the CPU to start loading instructions from some storage media (which ideally contains an operating system). We call this process *booting*. The CPU is already hard-wired as part of its design, to load this BIOS program from the motherboard it's plugged in to.\n","433":"Explainer: The \"spots\" are always \"touching\". In other words, the wires are always physically connected. The way programmers change what data (electrical signals) is fed into those wires is by storing instructions into memory.

Some of those operations expect additional numbers to be input as part of the instruction (usually, addresses of memory that contain the data). This is all just based on the complex physical arrangement of the transistors and other components within the CPU.  We have a lookup table of what numbers represent what instructions.

If you want to see what it looks like inside a CPU you can watch [this video](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=Fxv3JoS1uY8).  The best I can do for ELI5: using transistors you can build logic gates. Using logic gates you can build logical functions. Transistors can also control which logic gates get activated based on a given input. You change which transistors are activated by sending signals to certain CPU pins in a certain order. The CPU is designed such that it would automatically read instructions from certain pins when powered on (which is where the BIOs\/boot process comes in).

The added complexity *in some contexts* clearly makes life more able to sustain itself, otherwise it wouldn't evolve. In places where it is not useful, it does not evolve. This is why viruses are simple - they don't benefit from added complexity.  As for exactly how they work, they take advantage of the complexity in their hosts. The complicated things like growing and protecting oneself and getting food and reproducing are all handled by the host cell. *Somebody* has to do those things, and the virus simply allows the host cell to do them. Viruses don't even really understand how to make more viruses - they simply turn themselves over to the advanced machinery of the host and allow the host to use its own 'knowledge' of replication to make more virus.\nExplainee: I get that viruses are simple because they dont benefit from added complexity, but I mean in terms of chemistry even viruses are incredibly complex compared to the elements on the periodic table. How does one go from these elements to long strains of acid thats specificly coded to replicate itself in a system that at all times tends toward an equlibrium?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Im sorry a rudimentary what?

Thank you very much for your answer! Very cool\nExplainer: Oop - I slipped into nerdspeak.

tachometer is a device that measures the engine's rotational speed, typically in revolutions per minute (RPM). It's a crucial tool for drivers to monitor and control the engine's performance, especially when shifting gears.","1":"You're just regurgitating the same talking points your driving instructor told you, without actually doing any research. I've done my research, and the evidence suggests that skipping gears is not wrong.","2":"If we waste water, does it really decrease the overall amount of water on Earth? Or does it just make it harder for people in other parts of the world to access it?","3":"It's not just a matter of building infrastructure, it's about the politics, economics, and social dynamics of water access. It's a complex issue that requires a lot more than just a simple solution.","4":"That's a simplistic view of the issue, we do provide water to some, but the question is how to make it a global solution, not just a few lucky places.","5":"In many corporate workplaces, there is a bias against afros and other natural hairstyles, often due to outdated stereotypes and a lack of diversity. This bias can be seen in the way some companies enforce dress codes and grooming policies, which may prohibit or discourage employees from wearing their hair in an afro or other natural styles.","6":"I think it's definitely possible for someone who values self-expression to have a career in business, but it might require being intentional about finding a company culture that aligns with your values and being mindful of how you present yourself in a way that feels authentic.","7":"A tachometer measures the engine's rotational speed in revolutions per minute, which is crucial for manual gear shifting. It helps the driver know when to shift gears to maintain optimal engine speed and prevent engine damage.","8":"I think I see where the confusion is. You're right, humans do seem to be unique in this regard. But that's because we're not just talking about physical maturity. We're talking about emotional and psychological maturity as well. Humans take a long time to develop emotionally and cognitively, which means we're not ready to take on the responsibilities of parenthood until much later. Other mammals, like primates and dolphins, may reach physical maturity quickly, but they're still relatively immature emotionally and socially. They often rely on their mothers or social groups for support and guidance, which is why they're able to have kids at a younger age. Humans, on the other hand, are able to delay reproduction until they're more emotionally and cognitively prepared, which is a key factor in our species' success.","9":"You mentioned earlier that you had a premise about a 13-year-old girl having a child, but you also mentioned that the people who told you that you weren't ready to have a child were actually talking about your emotional maturity, not your biological readiness. Can you clarify how this relates to the definition of biological?","10":"You're not addressing the question. You're sidestepping the question. You're saying 'oh, it's not biological' and that's not answering the question. The question is asking for the biological reason that humans aren't ready for kids whilst animals are. You're just dodging it.","11":"You're not being very open-minded, are you? You've been presented with multiple perspectives, and you're still clinging to your original premise. I'm not trying to trip you up, I'm trying to show you that there are different ways to look at this.","12":"You're still trying to deflect and avoid the fact that the premise of your question is false and that's the reason you didn't get the answer you wanted. I'm not trying to steer the conversation away, I'm trying to steer it towards the truth. And I'm not going to stop until you understand that.","13":"Universal basic income (UBI) is a system where all citizens or residents of a country receive a regular, unconditional sum of money from the government to cover their basic needs. This can be funded through various means, such as taxes, redistribution of existing welfare funds, or a sovereign wealth fund. The goal is to provide a safety net and reduce poverty, as well as to give people the freedom to pursue meaningful work or entrepreneurship without the fear of poverty. However, critics argue that UBI could lead to higher prices, as companies may raise their prices to offset the increased cost of production or to take advantage of the reduced competition. To address this concern, some proponents suggest implementing a price control mechanism, such as a price ceiling, to prevent companies from raising prices excessively. Others argue that UBI could lead to a decrease in productivity, as people may be less motivated to work if they receive a basic income regardless of their employment status.","14":"You're right, it is a complex issue and there are a lot of factors at play. But, the study I was looking at suggests that in some cities, the implementation of UBI has actually led to a decrease in the cost of living, including housing costs, as people have more disposable income to spend on other things.","15":"The key point is that the turbine is not just converting the kinetic energy of the fluid into electricity, but it's also converting the potential energy of the fluid (the energy it has because it's at a high pressure) into kinetic energy, and that's what ultimately gets converted into electricity.","16":"The term 'Noble Gases' comes from the fact that they don't react with other elements easily. The 'Noble Gases' are a group of elements that are chemically inert. They are called 'noble' because they are unreactive, not because of any reference to aristocrats or nobility.","17":null,"18":"The half-life of lead is 22.3 billion years. Lead is a stable element and does not decay into something else. But, you know, in a few billion years, the Earth will collide with the Andromeda galaxy, so who knows what will happen to the elements then?  It's not like we're going to be around to see it.","19":"The periodic table is arranged by increasing atomic number, and it's unlikely that we'll ever discover elements with atomic numbers higher than the heaviest stable isotopes that have been found so far. The heaviest elements that have been discovered so far are in the 7th and 8th rows of the periodic table, and they are all radioactive and decay quickly. It's possible that we may discover new elements with higher atomic numbers, but they would likely be unstable and decay rapidly, so it's unlikely that we'll ever see a 19th periodic column.","20":"What possible firsthand empirical experience do you have for you to say that \"there's probably no 9th row\"?","21":"You have a Ph.D. in chemistry and you've spent your entire career studying the periodic table and working with the people who discover new elements. I'm just a science writer who's done a few interviews with some of the people who work on this stuff. You've got a lot more expertise than I do, but you're still saying that you're skeptical that we'll find a 9th row.","22":"I'm not sure what you're getting at with your question about element #10,000. The rate at which new elements are discovered is not linear, and it's unlikely that we'll see a consistent increase in the rate of discovery as we go further up the periodic table. In fact, as I mentioned earlier, the last few elements discovered have decayed at an incredibly fast rate, making them harder to create and detect.","23":"The common cold is a virus, specifically a rhinovirus. During the off-season, it resides in the environment, mainly on surfaces and in the air, where it can survive for a short period. When the weather changes and the population becomes more susceptible, the virus is transmitted through respiratory droplets, touching contaminated surfaces, and other means. It comes back because the virus is highly contagious and can infect people before they even show symptoms, making it difficult to track and contain.","24":"What's going on with you? You seem really upset about this.","25":"I feel you, like, have you seen the 'experts' on TV? They're always spouting off about the latest 'breakthrough' or 'groundbreaking' study, but when you actually look into it, it's just some dude with a Ph.D. from a third-tier university who's never actually done any real research.","26":"In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported that there were only 200 cases of influenza in the entire country in 2020, which is a significant decrease from the 38 million cases reported in 2019. This decrease was largely due to the fact that many people were staying home and avoiding social interactions during the COVID-19 pandemic, which helped to reduce the spread of influenza.","27":"The influenza virus has a harder time surviving on surfaces and in the air for extended periods, which might contribute to the lower number of cases. ","28":"The measures we've taken to combat COVID-19 are also effective against influenza, so it's not surprising that we're seeing low levels of influenza this year.","29":"Look, I'm trying to explain to you that coronaviruses and influenza viruses are distinct, and your question about the minor cases is not relevant to the conversation. Can we please focus on one topic at a time?","30":null,"31":"But isn't that a pretty weird assumption about the universe?","32":"So you're admitting you're trolling me with your donation claim, and you're doing it to see how many times I'll reply?","33":"That's correct, and the damage can be caused by ionizing radiation, like alpha, beta and gamma rays, and that's what makes it so deadly, because it can break the chemical bonds in DNA, and that's why it's so hard to fix.","34":"Exactly, it's a way for the body to prevent cancer from taking hold. And it's not just skin cells, this kind of programmed cell death, or apoptosis, is a natural process that occurs in many types of cells throughout the body.","35":"Fine, let's go back to the dictionary definition of a sport, which clearly states that hockey qualifies as one. You're just being obstinate and refusing to accept the definition because it doesn't fit your preconceived notion of what a sport should be.","36":"Don't worry, it's normal to feel scared, but it's also a natural process that everyone goes through. You'll learn as you go, and it's okay to ask questions and seek help when you need it.","37":"Well, during puberty, girls experience a lot more physical changes than boys, like getting their periods, developing breasts, and growing hair in different places. These changes can be more noticeable and can make girls feel more self-conscious about their bodies. Additionally, girls have to deal with the added responsibility of tracking their periods and using birth control, which can be overwhelming. Boys, on the other hand, tend to experience more subtle changes, like growing taller and developing facial hair, which can be less noticeable and less daunting.","38":"I think you might be describing a common phenomenon where people can sleep for a long time, but their body doesn't feel rested. This can be due to various factors such as sleep disorders like sleep apnea or restless leg syndrome, or even psychological factors like anxiety or depression. It's also possible that your body is not entering into the deep stages of sleep, which can make you feel tired even after sleeping for a long time.","39":"So, you think it might be depression? I've been feeling pretty down for a while now.","40":"That's because my family doesn't believe in it, they think it's a waste of time.","41":"You can't boil a sponge because the heat can cause the sponge to break down and release its chemicals, which can then be absorbed by the water, making it unsafe to use for cleaning.","42":"I didn't frame it as an insult, you're the one who made it about politics and being a republican, I was just pointing out the hypocrisy in your statement.","43":"You were saying I'm a republican because I was calling out your hypocrisy, but you're not really addressing the hypocrisy itself, you're just deflecting by calling me a republican, which is a weak attempt to shame me, but it's not going to work because I'm not going to be intimidated by a label.","44":"An electrical wave is just a series of electrical impulses that travel along the neuron's axon and synapse to other neurons. When these impulses reach the synapse, they can trigger the release of neurotransmitters into the synapse, which can then bind to receptors on adjacent neurons, causing those neurons to fire.","45":"The term 'Noble Gases' actually comes from the fact that they're chemically inert, meaning they don't readily react with other elements. This is due to their full outer energy level, which makes it difficult for them to form bonds with other atoms. It's not related to any reference to nobility or aristocracy. It's simply a descriptive term that reflects their chemical properties.","46":"I understand that you have some reservations about the people involved in the Manhattan Project, but the fact remains that they were able to successfully develop the atomic bomb, which is what's relevant to our discussion about atomic theory and Heisenberg's math.","47":"I've seen that article before, and it's a classic example of how people latch onto a sensational story and run with it without fact-checking. The article is based on a single source, a treasure hunter who has a vested interest in sensationalizing his finds. There's no credible evidence to support the claims made in the article, and it's been thoroughly debunked by experts in the field.","48":"Well, what if they didn't just want to make a bomb, but rather a reactor that could produce plutonium, and in that case, they didn't need a bomb's worth of uranium, just enough to sustain a chain reaction, which is what they got with the reactor they built.","49":"The National Labor Relations Act is a federal law that protects workers' rights to organize and bargain collectively. Companies like Walmart are allowed to try to persuade workers not to unionize, but they can't fire, demote, or otherwise retaliate against workers for exercising their legal right to organize.","50":"I'm going to be honest, I'm not sure if this is the solution to the problem, but it seems to make sense in the context of how we think about songs getting stuck in our heads. I think this is the solution. We should try it out and see what happens.","51":"Guess it's Taylor Swift for me tomorrow then! \ud83d\ude02","52":"Investment banking is like a middleman service. Imagine you want to buy a house, but you don't know the seller. You need someone to help you find each other and make the deal happen. That's basically what investment banks do, but instead of houses, they help big companies raise money or buy other companies. They also help companies figure out how much their company is worth, which is called valuing a company.","53":"The Earth's mass is not distributed evenly, and the planet is slightly flattened at the poles and bulging at the equator. This is due to its rotation, which creates centrifugal force that pushes mass away from the center. As a result, the northern hemisphere has a slightly larger surface area than the southern hemisphere, but this difference is not dramatic enough to explain the huge disparity in land area. Another factor is the way the continents have drifted apart and collided over time, with some landmasses being pushed up to form mountains and others being pulled down to form ocean basins. This process has resulted in the northern hemisphere having more landmasses and a more complex geography, while the southern hemisphere has more ocean and a simpler geography. ","54":"I think that's a common misconception, people tend to think that the continents are fixed in place, but the truth is that they're always moving, albeit very slowly.","55":"That's a common misconception, and it's good you're adjusting your understanding.","56":"The electrical impulses between neurons in the brain create a complex pattern of activity that gives rise to conscious thought. This pattern is thought to be the result of the interactions between billions of neurons, each of which is connected to many others through synapses. The exact mechanisms by which this pattern gives rise to conscious thought are still not fully understood, but it is thought to involve the integration of information from multiple sources, including sensory input, memory, and emotional states.","57":"I don't see how the physical location of thoughts necessarily implies their physical nature. Like, what if the brain is just a special kind of radio transmitter that lets us tune into the non-physical world?","58":"Well, it's not just that it causes changes in consciousness, but the specific changes that occur are very consistent with what we would expect if consciousness is an emergent property of brain activity. For example, if you damage the part of the brain that's responsible for spatial reasoning, you'll get changes in spatial reasoning. If you damage the part of the brain that's responsible for memory, you'll get changes in memory. And so on. It's not just that the brain causes changes in consciousness, it's that the specific changes that occur are very consistent with the idea that consciousness is a product of brain activity.","59":"A tachometer measures the engine's revolutions per minute, and it's used to help you keep your engine within a safe RPM range. If you're not skipping gears, then you're probably using the tachometer to help you stay within that range.","60":"They are essentially copying the product, packaging, and branding of a popular product, but with a different name, and then selling it at a lower price. This is often referred to as private labeling or store branding. The key is that they are not using the exact same name, but rather a similar one that doesn't infringe on the trademark of the original product.","61":"You're trying to get me to accept that the premise of my question is wrong, but you're not giving me any concrete evidence or facts to support your claim. You're just dismissing my question as 'false' and trying to shift the conversation to a discussion about the economic rationale of the earth's rotation, which has nothing to do with the topic at hand.","62":"explainer's response","63":"I have no intention of steering the conversation away from the biology, I was simply pointing out that the premise of your question is false and therefore any answer you get is going to be a tangent.","64":"So, when the Earth, Moon, and Sun are aligned, and the Moon is in the Earth's umbra, it can appear to be setting from our vantage point on Earth because it's moving in the opposite direction to the Sun. However, because the Earth is rotating, the Moon's shadow can still be visible on the Earth's surface, making it seem like the Moon is in the umbra and showing a shadow on its topside at the same time.","65":"It's largely due to societal attitudes towards sex and the objectification of women's bodies.","66":"You're saying that the computer is just sending a set of numbers, and the monitor is just turning lights on and off. So, what's the relationship between the numbers and the lights?","67":"Well, the monitor has a matrix of transistors and light sources behind the screen, with a transistor for each subpixel. When a number is sent to the display, it turns the corresponding transistor ON or OFF, controlling the amount of light that gets through. For shades, the display can simply turn on the transistor partially, allowing some light to get through. This is done by using a technique called pulse-width modulation, where the transistor is turned ON and OFF at a high frequency, and the ratio of ON time to OFF time controls the brightness of the light. It's like a very fast blinking light, where the blinking frequency is too high for our eyes to see, so we just see the average brightness. This way, the display can produce a wide range of shades and colors, without having to physically change the light source.","68":"Well, one is continuous and the other is discrete.  Analog is like a continuous flow of water, and digital is like a series of discrete buckets that you fill up.","69":"In analog circuits, transistors are not as strong as in digital circuits, so they can't completely max out the Gate of another transistor.","70":null,"71":"The reason space looks dark is because light doesn't bounce back from the emptiness of space like it does from objects on Earth. When light travels through space, it doesn't encounter any surfaces to reflect off of, so it just keeps going in all directions. It's like shining a flashlight in a room - the light spreads out and hits the walls, furniture, and other objects, but in space, there's nothing to bounce the light back to us.","72":"The vantablack is absorbing all the light. So it's not like there is some information coming from the car into your eyes and brains saying, 'hey its really really black right here'. What is happening is the cells in your eye are not getting any information at all, and those cells in turn do not activate the brain in the same way. So your brain perceives it as what we call black. But its really just a lack of information. The vantablack is absorbing all the light. So it's not like there is some information coming from the car into your eyes and brains saying, 'hey its really really black right here'.

But its really just a lack of information.","73":"which is kind of cool, because it really is just a void, it's not a car, it's just a spot on the road where the light isn't being reflected back to the eye.","74":"Actually, the alchemists were trying to achieve something much more complex than just transmutation, they were trying to achieve spiritual enlightenment through the process of turning base metals into gold.","75":"The flu can be a serious illness, especially for certain groups of people like the elderly and young children. If you get the flu, you could end up in the hospital, or even worse. And if you're not vaccinated, you're not just putting yourself at risk, you're also putting others at risk who might be more susceptible to the flu.","76":"I see. Many people rely on emergency services for non-emergency situations. If you're concerned about your health, you might consider looking into health insurance options or community clinics that provide low-cost or free medical care.","77":"The name 'Ghost Frequency' is a bit of a misnomer. It's actually a very common frequency, found in many types of music, particularly in the music of the 19th and early 20th centuries. The name likely comes from its association with the eerie, unsettling feeling it can evoke in some people.","78":"Yes, that's correct.  The frequency is inaudible to humans, but it can still cause a physical response.  Some people have reported increased heart rate, blood pressure, and even nausea when exposed to the 18.9 Hz frequency.  These reactions are often linked to the body's natural response to fear or stress.","79":"The Earth's water supply is a constant, but the water cycle means that water is constantly being cycled through the environment, so while we can't 'waste' water in the sense of removing it from the planet, we can waste it by using it inefficiently or not reusing it when possible.","80":"It seems like you're just here to troll and not actually learn anything. People are trying to help you but you're too busy being defensive to listen.","81":"You think running empty planes makes money?  The main thing that makes money is selling tickets.","82":null,"83":"I think there's a common misconception about how the vagina looks on the inside. It's not like a tunnel, but more of a tube with walls that can touch each other. It's also not as long as people might think. It's actually quite short, and the cervix is usually closed. When you insert something like a tampon or a finger, the walls of the vagina will move apart to accommodate it. Does that make sense?","84":"The cervix is like the opening at the bottom of the uterus, and the vagina is the canal that leads to the cervix. The uterus is the muscular organ that expands to hold a growing fetus.","85":"I think what's confusing you is that H(x,x) is actually just H(a,b) where a and b are both x, and the way the subroutine is set up is that it takes two arguments, but it doesn't have to be two different values, it can be the same value.  But that's not the real issue, the real issue is that we're trying to understand how P(P) works, and I think that's what's really confusing you.","86":"That's not ideal, but you can still get information from a community health clinic or a local health department, they usually have free or low-cost information and resources.","87":"It's that the notes don't quite match the pitch of the chord they're supposed to be part of. The chord is a C major, but the notes are slightly flat, so it sounds 'off'.","88":"But it's still not that hard, the cows are basically grazing animals, they take care of themselves.","89":"But that's exactly the point - you did do it manually, and you did eat the cows you milked. You're not typical, and even if you are, your experience is not representative of the industry as a whole.","90":"I think it's because people are often not aware of the historical and systemic reasons behind these beauty standards, and they just see them as personal preferences. But the fact that these standards have been perpetuated for so long is not just a coincidence, it's a result of how society has been structured to favor certain groups over others.","91":"I think that's a good point, but the thing is, skin whitening is a product of a larger historical narrative where whiteness has been equated with power, privilege, and beauty. The idea that a young Hispanic girl might want to lighten her skin solely because she likes the way it looks, without any connection to historical racism, is a bit of a myth. The beauty standards that make her want to lighten her skin are rooted in a system that has historically oppressed and marginalized people of color. Even if she's not thinking about racism, she's still participating in a system that perpetuates racism and inequality. It's not just about personal preference, it's about how those preferences are shaped by societal norms and power structures.","92":"Well, that's a very good question. When a computer is first turned on, it doesn't know how to do anything. It's like a blank slate. But it has a special program called BIOS (Basic Input\/Output System) that gets loaded into memory when it's powered on. The BIOS program contains instructions that tell the computer how to initialize the hardware and start up the operating system. It's like a recipe book that the computer follows to get started. From there, the operating system takes over and loads the rest of the programs and data that the user needs. So, in a way, the computer is learning its first steps by following the instructions in the BIOS program.","93":"A function. It takes the binary input, which is essentially a series of 1s and 0s, and maps it to a specific operation. The function is essentially a table of what input (binary) results in what output (operation).","94":"It's like a magic machine that follows instructions to change one thing into another. Imagine you have a toy box full of different colored blocks. The input is like picking a block from the toy box. The output is like putting a different colored block in the toy box. The machine works by reading a recipe that says what to do with the block you picked. If the recipe says to add a little bit of blue, the machine adds blue and turns the block into a different color.","95":"The security questions are a way to protect against large-scale attacks, not targeted ones. They're not meant to be secure on their own, but to slow down attackers who are trying to guess a lot of passwords quickly. If someone is specifically targeting you, they'll probably find a way in regardless of the security questions.","96":"The point I was trying to make is that it's not a realistic or practical concern for most people.","97":"Going vegan reduces greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture, which is a significant contributor to climate change. Animal agriculture is a major source of methane and nitrous oxide, two potent greenhouse gases. By choosing plant-based options, you can help reduce the demand for resource-intensive animal products and lower your carbon footprint. Additionally, animal agriculture is a leading cause of deforestation, water pollution, and soil degradation, all of which have devastating impacts on the environment. By adopting a vegan lifestyle, you can help mitigate these effects and create a more sustainable food system.","98":"Then you're not going to be able to capture it all, even with those bases, because it's still going to be leaking out everywhere.","99":"The problem is that the water cycle is a global system, and any contamination can have far-reaching and unpredictable effects. We can't just clean it and use it because the water cycle is a delicate balance of freshwater and saltwater, and any disruption can cause more problems than it solves. Think of it like a big web, if you break one strand, it can cause the whole web to unravel.","100":"I don't think it's that simple. There are many factors at play here, like political instability, lack of resources, and conflicting priorities.","101":"We do have the technology and resources to solve this problem, but we choose not to.","102":"You base your opinion on facts, logic, evidence and not being force fed religion as a child. That's cute. You think that's a unique experience? Most people aren't born into a religion, and most people have to work hard to find the facts, logic, and evidence that you seem to take for granted. And what's with the'magic sky fairy' nonsense? That's a childish insult. If you can't have a real discussion, then maybe you should just stick to explaining the obvious, like how the Earth orbits the Sun.","103":"You're not even making an effort to understand where I'm coming from. You're just dismissing my perspective without considering the possibility that there could be more to reality than what we currently understand. I'm not asking you to believe in magic or fairy tales, I'm asking you to keep an open mind and consider the possibility that there could be more to the human experience than just biology and physics. You're not giving me any credit for being able to think critically and form my own opinions, and that's not very respectful.","104":"Hidden City tickets are sold at a low price, but the airline still has to pay for the flight. If everyone gets off in Atlanta, the airline has to make the return trip from Atlanta to Memphis, which is an empty flight. This costs the airline money because they're not selling any tickets on that leg of the flight.","105":"The fact that 95% of people don't buy anything on the flight doesn't change the fact that 5% do, and that 5% is a significant revenue stream.  If you were flying on a plane that was half empty, the people who did buy would still have to make up for the lost revenue from the empty seats.  The same is true on a full plane.  The difference is that on a full plane, you have more people to sell to.  And it's not just the people who buy drinks and snacks, it's also the people who upgrade to first class, who pay for priority boarding, who pay for extra legroom, who buy travel insurance, etc.  The revenue from all of those things adds up.  And it's not just the revenue that's the issue, it's the fact that all of those people are also taking up space that could be sold to other people.  If you were flying on a plane that was half empty, you could sell the seats that the empty plane was taking up to other people.  You could also sell the drinks and snacks to those other people.  You could sell them first class upgrades, priority boarding, extra legroom, etc.  The lost revenue from the empty seats is not just the cost of the empty seats, it's also the lost opportunity cost of not being able to sell those seats to other people.  And that's what's happening here.  The people who are being bumped from the flight are not just losing their seats, they are also losing the opportunity to buy drinks, snacks, first class upgrades, priority boarding, extra legroom, etc.  And that's a significant loss of revenue for the airline.  So, yes, the lost revenue from the empty seats is a significant issue for the airline.  And it's not just the cost of the empty seats, it's also the lost opportunity cost of not being able to sell those seats to other people.","106":"I'm assuming you mean globally, right? People are still getting the flu, just not as many cases as usual due to the pandemic measures.","107":"Can you please just hear me out and understand the difference between coronaviruses and influenza viruses before we move on? It's not that hard to grasp.","108":"The minimum age requirement is specified in Article II, Section 1 of the US Constitution, which states that a president must be at least 35 years old. This requirement was established to ensure that the president has gained a certain level of maturity, experience, and wisdom before taking office.","109":"The two-party system is the reality, but that doesn\u2019t mean that it\u2019s the only reality. It\u2019s a system where the two major parties, the Democrats and the Republicans, tend to dominate the political landscape, but there are still opportunities for third parties and independent candidates to run and potentially win.","110":"No, they can't deny a majority vote of employees to unionize. Under the National Labor Relations Act, if a majority of employees in a bargaining unit vote to unionize, the employer must recognize and bargain with the union.","111":"your answer","112":"No, a single store cannot unionize. In the U.S., a union typically represents a group of employees across multiple locations, not just a single store. If you want to unionize, you would need to get a majority of employees from multiple stores to sign on, not just a single store.","113":"That's not the point, the point is that the women in the company have been historically underpaid and undervalued.","114":"Yes, you can see the moon from any point on the sunset ring at this time. The Moon is almost always on the same hemisphere as the Sun, so it is always visible in the sky near the Sun, regardless of your position on the sunset ring. In fact, the Moon is often visible as a bright spot in the sky near the Sun, especially when the Moon is full or nearly full.","115":null,"116":"But that doesn't mean you can't be creative and express yourself in business, right?  You can still be a business person and have a bold hairstyle, it just might affect how people perceive you in certain situations.","117":"That's a really interesting question, and one that I think a lot of people have grappled with. Some people might say that business is inherently incompatible with self-expression, because the goal of a business is often to make money, and that can involve suppressing certain kinds of self-expression in order to appeal to a wider audience. On the other hand, there are plenty of examples of successful businesses that prioritize self-expression and creativity, and that can be a major part of their appeal to customers. It really depends on the specific values and goals of the business, and how they align with your own values and goals. Do you have any thoughts on this? ","118":"An electrical wave between neurons is essentially a series of electrical and chemical signals that are transmitted through the synapses between neurons. These signals can be thought of as a series of 'firing' and 'non-firing' events, which can be represented as 1s and 0s in a binary code. This binary code is then processed and interpreted by the brain, which allows us to perceive and understand the world around us.","119":"We know what the butterfly effect is... And we know that if you could know the speed and trajectory of all matter in the universe, everything is theoretically predictable. These two are facts.","120":"You're misunderstanding the concept of determinism. Determinism doesn't mean that we can know everything, it means that everything that happens is the result of prior causes. Even if we can't know all the variables, the fact that everything is determined means that our choices are still not free. We're just a product of the universe, a complex system of particles and forces. Our consciousness is just an emergent property of that system.","121":"Well, it's a bit like a recipe book for a chef. The computer has a set of pre-programmed instructions, like a recipe, that tell it exactly what to do with certain inputs. When it gets a number like 6, it knows to follow the recipe and do the next step, which is to add the next two numbers. It's not really 'thinking' or 'learning' in the way a human does, but it's following a set of rules that were programmed into it.","122":"The CPU uses a combination of its instruction set and the data it has been given to determine what action to take. It's a bit like a recipe book - the CPU looks at the 'ingredients' (the numbers and data it has been given), and then follows the instructions in the recipe book (the instruction set) to produce the desired 'dish' (the action).","123":"It's a combination of the physical properties of the components and the software that tells them what to do. The transistors are either on or off, and the software determines which transistors are on or off at any given time based on the inputs. When the software tells the transistors to be on or off, it's sending an electrical signal through the CPU pins. The CPU is designed to automatically read instructions from certain pins when powered on, and it will execute those instructions based on the signals it receives.","124":"Well, that's a bit of a complicated process, but basically, the computer takes the number 8 and uses it to determine how many pixels to draw on the screen, or how bright to make each pixel. It's kind of like a recipe, where the number 8 is the ingredient and the output is the finished dish.","125":"Antibiotics work by targeting the bacteria, but they also kill off the good bacteria in our bodies. If we use antibiotics too much, the bad bacteria will become resistant to the antibiotics, and the good bacteria will disappear. So, the overuse of antibiotics has led to the creation of superbugs, which are bacteria that are resistant to antibiotics. Bacteriophages, on the other hand, target only the bad bacteria, leaving the good bacteria alone. They are a more targeted and sustainable way to fight infections.","126":"Bacteriophages are naturally occurring, so you can find them in soil, water, and even in the human gut. But to get a specific type of bacteriophage, researchers use a process called phage isolation. They take a sample from the environment, and then use a technique called plaque assay to isolate the specific bacteriophage they're looking for. It's a bit like finding a needle in a haystack, but it's a crucial step in developing bacteriophage-based treatments.","127":"Aristotle's views on infinity were actually quite nuanced and based on his metaphysical views, which were later challenged by mathematicians such as Georg Cantor, who developed set theory and rigorously defined infinite sets. Your assertion that solid mathematics working with infinities didn't happen until the development of calculus is also not accurate. In fact, mathematicians such as Zeno of Elea and Galileo Galilei made significant contributions to the study of infinity long before the development of calculus.","128":"If you buy non-dividend shares, you're essentially buying a piece of a company with the expectation that its value will increase over time. This means you'll make money if you sell your shares for a higher price than you bought them for. Companies often use the money from non-dividend share sales to fund their operations and growth, which can in turn increase the value of the company and your shares.","129":"And what about the dividends you get from buying stocks? How does that relate to the intrinsic value of the stock?","130":"You're misunderstanding my point. The difference is that wholesalers are selling a product that has intrinsic value, whereas in an MLM, the product is often overpriced or of low quality, and the main value is in the potential to make money by recruiting others.","131":"Your analogy is not a good one because it's comparing apples and oranges. Wholesalers are buying stock in a company, not buying a tangible product that they can use or eat. They're investing in a company's potential for growth and profit, not in a physical product that they can control or use directly.","132":"It's actually quite a bit more complicated, but the short of it is that the particles emitted in radioactive decay have a very short range and interact mostly with the electrons in the atom, not the nucleus itself. This is because the nucleus is a very dense, positively charged object, and particles like alpha and beta particles tend to interact with the electrons that are orbiting it, rather than the nucleus itself. This means that the particles emitted in radioactive decay don't have enough energy to 'upgrade' the atom back into the original state, even if they were to interact with the nucleus. ","133":"Yes, that's correct. The high energy and pressure in a supernova allow for the fusion of heavier elements. And yes, the analogy with magnets is a good one - the strong nuclear force is like a kind of'magnetic attraction' that holds the protons and neutrons together in the nucleus, but at a certain distance it becomes weaker and the nucleus can break apart.","134":"The proof by contradiction is exactly what Cantor's diagonalization argument is, so you already know what it's about.  It's not a complicated proof, but it does require a certain level of mathematical maturity.  I can try to explain it in simpler terms if you'd like.","135":"You're assuming that the only way to generate a list containing all the numbers is to add numbers to the list one by one, but what if there's a way to generate the list in a single step, or with a completely different algorithm?","136":"I'm trying to learn here, can't you just answer my question without being condescending?","137":"You're not taking this seriously. You're treating this as a joke, but it's not a joke. It's a serious issue and you need to understand the consequences of desalination on the environment.","138":"You're not even listening to the answers people are giving you, just posting the same question over and over again.","139":"You're asking me to explain the abortion debate in a way that's easy to understand, but you're not providing any context or background information.

Can you explain why you're saying that?","141":null,"142":"text to fill in the missing dialogue","143":"That's not entirely correct. Analog circuits do have a concept of '1s and 0s' but they're more like 'on' and 'off' and the transition between them is continuous. A good analogy is a light switch. If it's fully on, it's like a 1, and if it's fully off, it's like a 0, but as you turn the switch, the light goes from fully on to fully off in a continuous way, so it's not really a 1 or 0, but more like a 0.99999... and a 1.00001...","144":"I'm still a bit confused about how M is supposed to work. You say it can see the entire program from the get-go, but if it's going to run indefinitely, doesn't that mean that it can't possibly see the entire program? I feel like I'm missing something fundamental about how this is supposed to work.","145":"Well, the 'no true Scotsman' fallacy is actually a response to an argument that already assumes its conclusion. It is a way to avoid admitting that your definition of a true Scotsman is not universally accepted, by moving the goalposts and saying that anyone who doesn't fit your definition is not a 'true' Scotsman.","146":"But isn't the difference that in your example, people are making up a requirement they think they meet, whereas in my example, they're just making stuff up without any requirement.","147":"So you want to know why Walmart can deny a union?  Well, Walmart can deny a union because the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) states that a majority of employees must vote in favor of a union before it can be formed.  If you don't have a majority of employees signed on, then you don't have a union.  And if you don't have a union, then you don't have any of the legal protections given to unions in the U.S.","148":"They could still deny it, because it's the same thing as a union paper, and they have the right to deny any proposal they want.","149":"You're misunderstanding how unionization works. A single store can unionize if a majority of the employees at that store sign. It's not about the total number of Walmart employees, but rather the number of employees at a specific store.","150":"Periods are like special deliveries from the body. They happen when the body is getting ready for a baby, but the baby doesn't come out. It's like the body is saying, 'I was going to have a baby, but now I'm not.' And that's why you get a little bit of blood coming out. It's like a small package, and it comes out of the vagina, which is like a special door in the body.","151":"The reason it would go down your leg is because the urethra is angled and it's not straight down like it is in men. So when you stand up, gravity is pulling it down your leg. It's not that you can't use a urinal, but the angle of the urethra makes it hard to stand and pee without it coming out the sides. And yeah, sometimes it can be a bit tricky, but it's not usually a problem for most women.","152":"So it's not just above everything for boys either?","153":"Don't worry, you'll figure it out as you go along. Puberty is a big change, but it's not as scary as it seems. People have been going through it for thousands of years, and you'll be just fine.","154":"Because the female reproductive system is more complex and puberty can be more unpredictable for girls, but that doesn't mean it's not normal for boys to have questions too, I'm here to help with any questions you have.","155":"They're using a combination of data collection methods, including tracking your online behavior, browsing history, and interactions on the platform, as well as data from third-party sources, to create a profile of your interests and preferences.

","156":"You're saying you don't know how they're doing this, but your question is phrased in a way that implies you already have some idea of how they're doing this, which is why I think it's confirmation bias.","157":"Ligand chemistry is freshman year stuff, you don't need to have an apprenticeship to know it.","158":"Well, when we read, our brains use a combination of things like word recognition, context, and prior knowledge to figure out what the words mean. It's a very complex process, but essentially, it's not just about linking words to pictures in our mind.","159":"There may be several reasons for this, but one possible reason is that flamboyance is often associated with LGBTQ+ culture, and straight men may feel pressure to conform to traditional masculine norms in order to avoid being ostracized or perceived as \"soft\" or \"feminine\". Additionally, societal expectations around masculinity can be quite rigid, and men who exhibit flamboyant behavior may be seen as not meeting these expectations.","160":"You're asking about time being non-existent because our current understanding of time relies on the concept of the second, which is defined as the time it takes for a caesium-133 atom to oscillate 9,192,631,770 times. However, this definition is based on a classical understanding of time. If we consider the nature of time at the Planck scale, things get weird. At that scale, the laws of physics as we know them start to break down, and the concept of time becomes more abstract. That's why some theories suggest that time might not be an absolute quantity, but rather an emergent property that arises from the interactions of particles and fields. This is where the idea of time being non-existent comes from \u2013 not that time doesn't exist at all, but that our classical understanding of it is an illusion, and time is more of a human construct than a fundamental aspect of the universe.","161":"Planck time is the time it takes for a photon to travel a distance of 1 Planck length, which is the length of a unit of length in the theory of quantum gravity, and it is approximately 5.4 \u00d7 10^-44 seconds.","162":"Photons are actually considered to be point-like particles, meaning they have no size or dimension. They are often referred to as 'zero-dimensional' objects.","163":"But I think that's the beauty of this theory - it's self-correcting, and that's what makes it work for me","164":"Ha ha, good luck with that, and don't worry if you can't get rid of it, some songs are just meant to be stuck in your head.","165":"You: dumbfuck stoner.  Thanks for the intellectual debate..","166":"You are pretending that science has all the answers, but it doesn't. Science is just a tool to help us understand the world, but it's not a definitive answer to everything. And if you think that you can explain everything with science, then you are just as bad as the people who claim that the Earth is 6,000 years old.","167":"The human brain is an incredibly complex organ, and we have only scratched the surface of its functions. Perhaps the key to understanding consciousness lies in the intricate web of neural connections and chemical signals that govern our thoughts and behaviors. I'd rather say that consciousness is a mystery waiting to be solved, rather than assuming it's simply an illusion.","168":"Why do you think this is the case, that humans are the only mammal that doesn't immediately reach sexual maturity as soon as they reach sexual maturity?","169":"But I still don\u2019t get it.  If the 13 year old girl in the early tribe has support from her mother and aunts, then isn\u2019t that basically the same thing as saying that a 13 year old girl today is capable of raising a child with the support of her mother and aunts?  If so, then why can\u2019t a 13 year old girl today raise a child on her own?","170":"You're not actually arguing that humans are the only mammals that reach sexual maturity before being able to raise children, are you? I thought that was the point of the original question.","171":"I don't think you're actually listening to me, because if you were, you'd be answering the question that was asked.","172":"But that's exactly what you're doing with your question, isn't it? You're framing it in a way that elicits social answers, rather than biological ones, and then you're complaining that you're not getting the answers you want.","173":"If I were to respond to your request for biological answers, I would point out that the premise of your question is still based on an incorrect assumption, and that the correct biological explanation is actually quite different from what you're looking for. However, I'm not going to bother, because you're not actually interested in the biological explanation, you're just interested in being right and winning this argument. So, I'll just leave it at that.","174":"Squaring numbers and square roots relate to the real world in many ways, but one example is when you're measuring the area of a room. If you know the length of one side of the room, you can find the area by squaring the length. This is because the area of a rectangle is length times width, and if the length and width are the same, then the area is just length squared. Square roots come in when you're trying to find the length of the side of a square if you know the area. For example, if you know the area of a square is 16 square meters, you can find the length of the side by taking the square root of 16, which is 4 meters. ","175":"The emitted particles do not have enough energy to interact with the resulting atom in a way that would cause it to return to its original state. The energy lost during emission is typically too great for the particles to overcome the binding energy of the resulting atom, making it stable.","176":"Exactly, supernovae have incredibly high energy and pressure, which allows for the fusion of elements heavier than iron. This process is what creates many of the heavy elements found in the universe, including gold and uranium.","177":"I was trying to explain the halting problem to you, but I'm not sure where to start. Is it the concept of a universal Turing machine, or the idea that there's no general algorithm to determine whether a program will halt?","178":"Let me try to break it down.  If you have a subroutine H(a,b), then if you call it with the same argument twice, like H(a,a), that's just a special case of calling it with two identical arguments, right?  It's not like the subroutine has some special understanding of 'a(a)'.  So if we're going to get from H(a,b) to H(x,x), it's just a matter of substituting 'x' in for 'a'.  But then we're left with the question of what happens when we call H(x,x).  Does it look at the 'x' that's the argument, or does it look at the 'x' that's the program?  And that's what I'm trying to get at.","179":"The diagonalization proof is a type of proof by contradiction.  In Cantor's diagonalization proof, the assumption is that there is a list of all real numbers.  Then, through reasoning, you show that this assumption leads to a contradiction (specifically, a real number that cannot be in the list).","180":"You're trying to get at the idea that the proof is somehow dependent on the particular method of generating the list, but the proof is actually about the fact that no matter how the list is generated, it will always be incomplete.","181":"The diagonalization proof isn't about finding a better way to generate a list, it's about showing that no way can generate a complete list, because the process of generating a list inherently fails to include all real numbers. It's not about the optimality of the initial list, but about the impossibility of creating a list that includes all real numbers due to the nature of real numbers themselves.","182":"That\u2019s not a very convincing argument.  Radioactivity is all around us, and we don\u2019t stop eating bananas or living in coastal areas.  You can\u2019t just dismiss the risks by saying it\u2019s not a big deal because the concentration is low.  The dose makes the poison, not the concentration.","183":"The radioactivity in the ocean is not going to magically disappear or be neutralized by dilution.  The food chain is going to accumulate it, and that's what we need to be worried about.","184":"Well, one reason is that wood is a very widely available and relatively inexpensive building material. It's also a popular choice for many homeowners because it's easy to work with and can be used to create a wide range of architectural styles.","185":"If the fire spreads slowly, the people can evacuate more safely, and the firefighters can put out the fire more effectively.","186":"You can't convict someone based on a rumour, that's not how justice works.","187":"The main point of buying non-dividend shares is that you own a part of the company, so if the company grows in value, your shares will grow in value too, even if the company doesn't pay dividends.","188":"Because you need to understand that the value of your shares is not solely based on the dividends they pay out. The value of your shares is also based on the potential for the company to grow and increase in value over time.","189":"If you don't understand why some stocks don't pay dividends, that's fine, but that doesn't change the fact that not all stocks do.","190":"That's a good point, but I think you're still missing the key difference between buying from an orchard and buying from a company in an MLM. With an orchard, you're buying a product that has inherent value, whereas in an MLM, you're buying a product that has no inherent value, only the promise of future returns.","191":"I guess it's hard to take criticism when you don't care about the opinion of others.","192":"You're welcome, I'm glad I could help.","193":"Well, the idea is that when we hear a song, our brain has a hard time forgetting it because it's so catchy, and it's also because we tend to associate the song with a particular memory or emotion. So when we hear the song again, it triggers that memory or emotion and our brain starts to replay the song over and over again. It's like a feedback loop. It's also thought that our brain is trying to make sense of the song and figure out why it's so catchy, and that's why it gets stuck in our head. ","194":"You're a DJ, so I'm guessing you're used to having songs stuck in your head, but I'm a non-musician, so it's a problem for me. I'm guessing it's just a coincidence that the song that got stuck in your head is Taylor Swift.","195":"If your knife flew probably 1\/10th the speed of light into anything you\u2019d be doing nuclear fusion and there by fission.  That\u2019s still a long way from 50% of the speed of light, but that\u2019s what you get when you use a knife to split atoms.  So if you were to travel at 50% of the speed of light, you would be able to split atoms and cause nuclear reactions.  But to travel at 50% of the speed of light, you would need to accelerate your rocket ship to that speed, which is not possible with current technology.  So, in short, no, you would not be able to destroy matter that\u2019s eligible to be destroyed with a knife that\u2019s traveling at 50% of the speed of light.  But you would be able to cause nuclear reactions and split atoms, which is still a pretty cool thing.","196":"Because the problem is not just the speed, it's the energy and the momentum, you can't just turn off the engines, you have to bleed off that energy somehow, and that's really hard to do, you can't just 'break' in the sense that you can't just stop the spacecraft in mid-air, you have to dissipate that energy somehow, and that's really difficult to do, especially when you're traveling at relativistic speeds.","197":"Because the atmosphere doesn't stratify by molecular mass, it's not because the heavier molecules don't fall to the ground. Actually, they do, but they're slowed down by the low air pressure at high altitudes and the velocity of the atmosphere's rotation. The low air pressure means there's less friction, and the rotation of the Earth creates a centrifugal force that pushes the heavier molecules outwards, making it harder for them to fall. This way, the atmosphere remains well mixed, and the gases are distributed relatively evenly throughout.","198":"The reason we don't suffocate from CO2 at ground level is that the amount of CO2 in the air is very small compared to the amount of nitrogen and oxygen, so it doesn't weigh down the air enough to cause stratification.","199":"No, not really. When we read, our brain is actually matching the words to the concepts and associations we have in our mind, but it's not necessarily a visual image. It's more like a network of ideas and relationships.","200":"Because in analog, the transistor doesn't act as a switch, it acts more like a variable resistor, where the voltage at the Gate can control the amount of current flowing through the transistor, but it can't completely shut off the current.","201":"Analog signals can take on a range of values between 0 and 1, or more, depending on the specific signal type. This is what allows them to represent real-world phenomena like sound or light waves, which can have varying intensities or frequencies. Think of it like a volume control on a radio - you can turn it up or down, but you can't just turn it to 1 or 0. It's a continuous range.","202":"The effects of wasting water are not just about personal impacts, but also about the global water cycle. When we waste water, it can lead to droughts, reduced water quality, and changes in the global climate patterns, which can have far-reaching consequences.","203":"Well, for starters, it would disrupt the marine ecosystem, causing the death of countless species that rely on the natural salt levels of the ocean. Additionally, it would also impact the global water cycle and potentially lead to severe droughts in coastal regions. Not to mention the economic and social implications of such a massive undertaking.","204":null,"205":"I think the explainee's post was removed because the mods didn't like the question","206":"You're just being condescending and not answering my questions.","207":null,"208":"It reduces heat transfer by blocking the flow of air and keeping the warm air in, and the cold air out.","209":"That's right. You'd end up with a cooler interior, but it would also make the interior darker because it blocks visible light, too.","210":"That's exactly right. The plastic sheeting works the same way, but in reverse. It traps the heat in during the winter and keeps it out during the summer.","211":"Constantine's conversion to Christianity is often attributed to a vision he had before the Battle of Milvian Bridge in 312 AD. He saw the cross of Jesus Christ and the words 'In Hoc Signo Vinces', which translates to 'In this sign, you will conquer.' This vision is said to have inspired him to use the cross as his battle standard. He went on to win the battle and attributed his victory to the power of Christianity.","212":"Well, a lot of things contributed to that. One factor was the Edict of Milan, which was a law that allowed Christians to practice their faith openly. It was issued in 313 AD. This was a turning point because before that, Christians were persecuted. After the Edict, Christianity began to grow rapidly. Also, the Roman Empire was in a bit of a crisis. There were civil wars, economic troubles, and external threats. People were looking for a new kind of authority, and Christianity offered a sense of unity and purpose. Many people converted to Christianity because of the sense of community and belonging it provided.","213":"explainer's response","214":"Purifying salt water would disrupt marine ecosystems, affect the delicate balance of salt and water levels in the ocean, and potentially harm or destroy entire species that rely on the current salinity levels.","215":"I'm not the one with issues, you're the one who can't accept the truth.","216":"But how would you enforce those measures?","217":"You can't just go around saying 'oh, just do this' without understanding the basics of how the system works. You're talking about a global problem that requires a global solution, and you're coming at it with a simplistic, uneducated perspective. The amount of methane being released from the melting arctic is a tiny fraction of the overall problem, and it's not something that can be solved by just 'harvesting' it like it's a resource. You need to understand the root causes of the problem and the interconnectedness of the systems involved before you can even begin to propose a solution.","218":"So you're going to tell me that despite all the experts saying that covering millions of square miles of the arctic tundra with vacuum tubes is a terrible idea, you're going to ignore them and just do it anyway, because you're sure that someone smarter will come along and make it work? And you're not going to do any of the actual work of coming up with blueprints or contacting manufacturers or finding investors, you're just going to trust that someone else will do it for you?","219":"Your response here","220":"You said I was a republican and then acted like it was some kind of gotcha moment when it's just a label and you're trying to guilt trip me for something I didn't even say, which is pretty typical of the kind of behavior you accuse me of.","221":"Yes, I'm saying that in most workplaces, afros are allowed as long as they are neat and clean, and don't pose a distraction or hazard.","222":"You're not as clever as you think you are.","223":"Full metal jacket ammo, also known as FMJ, is a type of bullet that is designed to penetrate deep into a target without expanding or deforming. Unlike normal ammo, which is designed to expand upon impact, FMJ ammo is made with a jacket of metal that completely covers the lead core, allowing it to maintain its shape and travel deeper into the target.","224":"Alcoholism is considered a disease because it involves changes in the brain's chemistry and structure that lead to compulsive drinking, even if it causes harm. It's not just about liking or disliking alcohol, but about the body's physical response to it.","225":"They're called 'Noble' because they don't readily react with other elements, like nobles who don't mingle with commoners. It's not a reference to Buddhism, but a historical term from the early days of chemistry. The term 'Noble' was used to describe elements that were resistant to chemical reactions, much like how nobles were seen as above the fray of common society.","226":"But, if I understand you correctly, the universe is actually getting heavier on average as time goes on, because the heavier elements are being created in stars and supernovae, right?  So, even though lead decays into something lighter, the overall average atomic mass of the universe is increasing?","227":"New elements can be created artificially, and naturally, in supernovae. In the case of the latter, it's usually a few elements, like Technetium and Promethium. As for the former, we can create a wide range of elements, but the number is still limited to a few hundred. The heaviest artificially created element is Oganesson, which has an atomic number of 118. However, it's worth noting that as we go higher in atomic number, the half-life of these elements decreases dramatically, and it becomes increasingly difficult to create and study them. So, while we can create new elements, the number of them is still relatively small compared to the overall number of elements that exist.","228":"Actually, the offset would be less than you think because employers might also try to offset the increased FICA taxes by reducing other benefits or wages, rather than just cutting private health coverage.","229":"While that's true, removing the middlemen would only account for a small part of the overall cost savings, and it's unlikely to make up for the inefficiencies and higher costs associated with government provision of healthcare, such as bureaucratic overhead and the lack of a profit motive to drive cost savings.","230":"They contribute to economic growth and inequality, and their wealth can have negative social impacts, such as gentrification and reduced social mobility.","231":null,"232":"If radon is the end of that decay chain, then that would be the case. But if radon will decay into something else, then what will it decay into?","233":"Lead has a half-life of 22.3 billion years, so it is effectively stable for all practical purposes. It does not decay into anything else, but it can be a product of the radioactive decay of other elements.","234":"The 9th row is not possible because it would require the existence of elements with atomic numbers greater than 118, which is currently the highest known atomic number of an element.","235":"There's probably no 9th row, because the elements in the 7th row took about 70 years to be discovered, and the last few discovered decay within fractions of seconds.","236":"I have a Ph.D. in physics and I've spent years studying the properties of superheavy elements. I've also worked with researchers who have spent their careers studying these elements, and we've discussed the challenges and limitations of discovering new elements.","237":"I think it's from the same instructors who told you to check the RPM when shifting gears.","238":"I'm not disputing the fact that many sources say it's okay to skip gears, but isn't the real question about whether it's the most efficient way to drive, considering factors like fuel consumption and wear on the transmission?","239":"Of course, I could be wrong. I'm not an expert, and I'm basing my answer on my own understanding and experience. But I'd like to know what specifically you think is wrong with skipping gears.","240":"But doesn't the fact that we're still operating under those specifications suggest that we're not yet fully embracing the digital nature of money?","241":"Because the ocean is a very large and complex system, and dumping radioactive waste into it could have unintended and far-reaching consequences, including contamination of the food chain and harm to marine life.","242":"That's not how it works in practice, the process is more complex than that.","243":"Non-dividend shares are often seen as a way to participate in the growth of a company, even if it doesn't distribute dividends.","244":"The value of shares lies in their potential for long-term growth and appreciation, rather than just dividend payments.","245":"But isn't that analogy a bit misleading? You're not literally owning a goose that lays golden eggs; you're owning a tiny fraction of a company that might or might not distribute its profits to you. And even if you were literally owning a goose, wouldn't you want to know what the goose's actual performance is before deciding whether to keep it or sell it? Similarly, shouldn't shareholders have more control over how their shares are valued?","246":"The reason is that the board of directors has a fiduciary duty to the shareholders, and they are responsible for making decisions that maximize the value of the company for all shareholders, not just the ones who don't want dividends.","247":"IPOs are a one-time event where a company issues shares to the public for the first time. With MLMs, you're buying a product with the intention of reselling it, whereas with an IPO, you're buying shares of a company's ownership. And regarding Ponzi schemes, the key difference is that they're unsustainable and rely on continuous recruitment to pay off earlier investors, whereas a company's stock price can fluctuate based on market conditions, but it's not a Ponzi scheme. Let's focus on wholesalers next. ","248":"If I buy apples directly from an orchard, I take the risk that I can sell them at a profit to grocers, but I still have control over the apples themselves, I can choose to eat them, give them away, or store them, whereas with stocks, I have no control over the company.","249":"You're missing the point. I'm not saying that stocks have no value, I'm saying that with stocks, you have no control over what you're buying, unlike with tangible goods like apples or bolts.","250":"Well, computers start with transistors, which are essentially tiny switches. In the early days, computers used vacuum tubes, but transistors are much smaller, cheaper, and more reliable. A transistor has three terminals: the Source, the Drain, and the Gate. The Gate is like a tiny valve that controls the flow of current between the Source and the Drain. When there's no voltage at the Gate, the current is blocked, and the transistor is off. When there's a voltage, the transistor is on, and current flows. This is the basic building block of a computer, and it's how we get from 0 to 1.","251":"Analog signals have varying amplitudes or voltage levels, allowing them to represent a range of values, unlike digital signals which are limited to 0 and 1.","252":"You buy non-dividend shares when you believe the company will grow and increase its profits in the future, so you're hoping to sell your shares at a higher price than you bought them for, rather than relying on dividend payments to give you a return on your investment.","253":"You're right, it does seem that way. But consider this: if you bought a share in Apple in 2005, you were entitled to a share of their profits. If Apple was making profits and you sold your share, you would get your share of the profits. The fact that you didn't get dividends doesn't mean you weren't entitled to a share of the profits. The company could have chosen to reinvest those profits into the company, which is exactly what they did. So, the value of the share increased because of the profits the company made, even if you didn't get any of those profits as dividends. Does that make sense?","254":"I think that's a good point. In a sense, buying shares for dividends is a more democratic system where even small shareholders have some say, whereas buying non-dividend shares is more about speculation and hoping to flip them for a higher price.","255":"Time is a concept that we use to measure the sequence of events, but it's not a fundamental aspect of the universe. In a sense, time is what we call the change in the state of the universe, but it's not an independent entity. It's more like a dimension that helps us understand how the universe evolves. So, if we imagine a universe without time, it's not that the universe is frozen in place, but rather that the concept of time is not applicable.","256":"Planck time is a unit of time that is used to express the time it takes for a photon to travel a distance equal to the Planck length, which is the length scale at which the effects of quantum gravity become significant. It is defined as approximately 5.4 x 10^-44 seconds. It is a very small unit of time, much smaller than the time it takes for atoms to vibrate or electrons to orbit their nuclei, and it is thought to be the smallest unit of time that has any physical meaning.","257":"Photons don't have a size in the way that other particles do, but they do have a wavelength, which is related to their energy.","258":"A period is when your body releases a small amount of blood from your uterus, which is like a little house inside your tummy where a baby grows. It's a sign that you're not pregnant, and it happens because your body is getting ready for the possibility of a pregnancy. It's like a little maintenance check to make sure everything is working properly.","259":"That's a good point. I think it's because girls have to deal with menstruation, which can be really painful and messy, and there's a lot of stigma around it. Plus, girls are often expected to take care of their bodies in a way that's not the same for boys. They're expected to look a certain way, and there's a lot of pressure to be perfect, which can be really overwhelming.","260":"A plane flies on the bottom of the globe because it generates lift, which is the upward force that opposes the weight of the plane. This lift is created by the wings of the plane, which are designed to produce a difference in air pressure above and below the wing. As the plane moves forward, the air flows over and under the wing, creating an area of lower pressure above the wing and an area of higher pressure below it. This pressure difference creates an upward force, or lift, that counteracts the weight of the plane and allows it to fly. The plane's orientation in relation to the earth's surface is determined by the direction of this lift, which is always perpendicular to the wing and parallel to the earth's surface.","261":"That's right. But the perspective from space is a bit different from how we experience the world on the ground.","262":null,"263":"What is the evidence that government inefficiency would make the costs increase.","264":"The problem is that while removing the private insurance middlemen might seem like a cost-saver, it doesn't account for the complexity of government bureaucracy and the potential for waste and inefficiency in a single-payer system. For example, studies have shown that the US government's current healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, have significant administrative costs due to the need for multiple layers of bureaucracy and the use of outdated technology. If the government were to take over private insurance, these inefficiencies could be amplified, leading to higher costs in the long run.","265":"You're thinking of stocks as commodities, but they're not. They're more like ownership in a company, so the value is in the company's potential for growth, not in the physical goods they produce.","266":"You're making it sound like stocks are just a gamble, but they're not. People put their money into stocks because they have a certain value, and they can be used to buy other things. Just because you can't eat a stock certificate doesn't mean it's not valuable.","267":"You are not considering the potential for loss in buying apples, while in the case of mlm, the loss is not just financial, but also the potential loss of reputation and relationships.","268":null,"269":"I understand your point, but by calling alcoholism a disease, we're not saying the person is blameless. We're just saying that the brain chemistry is altered in a way that's not normal, and that's a medical condition.","270":"Your turn to fill in the missing dialogue here","271":"Why do you think the Nazi Party is considered far-right, then? It seems to contradict the name and the fact that it was a socialist state.","272":"You're just mad because you got called out for being a bad faith actor, so now you're lashing out with personal attacks and trying to deflect.","273":"That's a fair point, there might be various reasons for this, and it could be due to a variety of factors including cultural and societal norms, as well as individual personality traits and preferences.","274":"You're comparing Narcoanalysis tests to battery acid and grass. That's a terrible analogy. Narcoanalysis tests are a method of interrogation used to gather information from suspects. They have nothing to do with battery acid or grass. What's your point?","275":"I think it's because it's a unique time in life where people are forming their identities, learning who they are, and figuring out their place in the world. It's a time of transition from adolescence to adulthood, and the relationships and experiences they have during this time can have a lasting impact on their lives. It's also a time when people are often away from their families and support systems, so the relationships they form with their peers can be especially important.","276":"I see what you're saying. It's almost as if the institution itself becomes a sort of proxy for the people and experiences you had there, and people attach emotional value to it because of that. Is that a fair way to put it?","277":"I think that's a valid point. People often get emotionally attached to their school and the sense of community that comes with it, which can make it difficult to separate the personal relationships from the school itself. It's not just about the friendships you make, but also about the memories and experiences you have, which can create a strong emotional connection to the school. Does that make sense?","278":"The value of money is not just about the central bank printing money, it's also about the confidence people have in it, which is not something that can be easily edited away.","279":"That's a very good question, and it's actually a bit tricky. Genes function by being sequences of nucleotides that bind to proteins, which then go on to do various things in the cell. It's not really about 'knowing' what to do, but rather about the physical interactions between molecules. Think of it like a recipe - the ingredients (nucleotides) combine in a certain way to produce a certain product (protein), which then goes on to do its job in the cell. But instead of a chef following a recipe, the molecules are just reacting with each other according to their chemical properties.","280":"But isn't the combination of chemicals in DNA predetermined by evolution itself? And isn't the fact that the offspring copy the DNA correctly most of the time a result of natural selection? If that's the case, then isn't the outcome of the chemical reactions predetermined by the process of evolution?","281":"The chance of an apple seed growing into an orange tree is extremely low.","282":null,"283":"It seems to me that what you are describing is a form of elitism, where you feel superior to others because you have a certain idea or perspective that they don't have.","284":"You're missing the point. The point of buying non-dividend shares is not that they will pay dividends in the future, it's that they can increase in value over time, just like any other asset. If you buy a non-dividend stock and it increases in value, you can sell it for a profit, even if it doesn't pay dividends.","285":"The prospect of eventual dividends is the best answer to your question.","286":"You can sell the stock you bought for money. Which, is in essence selling the partial ownership of those assets.","287":"The value of ownership isn't directly tied to the ability to sell possessions. In the case of a company like Amazon, the value of ownership comes from the potential for the company to grow and become more valuable in the future. The fact that you can't sell the physical goods owned by the company doesn't necessarily mean that the value of your ownership is zero.","288":"Because dividends are paid out of the company's profits, and if no one buys the shares, the company wouldn't have to pay out dividends. The value of the shares comes from the potential future profits of the company, not the current profits. If no one buys the shares, the company wouldn't have to distribute its profits, so Jeff Bezos wouldn't get a paycheck that's worth anything more than his actual salary. The value of the shares comes from the potential future profits, not the current profits.","289":"That's not what I'm saying. I'm saying that having an afro isn't inherently a reason for people to not get along. However, if someone has a history of being confrontational or difficult to work with, and they also have an afro, that might be a red flag for an employer. It's not the afro that's the problem, it's the behavior that comes with it.","290":"The mechanism behind self-replication is the second law of thermodynamics. It states that the total entropy of a closed system will always increase over time. In other words, the universe is constantly becoming more disordered and random. This is why living organisms, including viruses, have a strong tendency to self-replicate. By replicating themselves, they are able to increase their own entropy and disorder, which is a fundamental property of the universe. Additionally, self-replication allows living organisms to adapt and evolve, which is essential for their survival in a constantly changing environment.","291":"A long, long time ago, when the Earth was still young, there were only simple things like water and rocks. Over time, these simple things started to combine in different ways, and they made even more complex things like molecules. These molecules kept combining and changing until they made things like you and me. It's kind of like building with blocks - you start with simple blocks and then you make more and more complex things by adding more blocks and changing how they fit together. Does that make sense?","292":"Of course I could be wrong, but I'd be surprised if I was. That's why I'd like to explain why I think skipping gears is generally a bad idea.","293":"You can't just dismiss the reason given by the mods, and instead of providing an explanation, you're being condescending and rude.","294":"I understand your frustration and skepticism, but the point I'm trying to make is that if you can't understand the simple removal reasons, it's unlikely you'll be able to grasp the complexities of the legal process. That's not a dismissal, that's a reality check. If you're still not convinced, I'd be happy to provide more explanations and resources to help you understand the issue better.","295":"Exactly. And in the case of a non-profit, that means that if you're paying yourself, you're not generating profit. You're just shifting expenses from one category to another. You're not making money for the organization, you're just making money for yourself.","296":"The business doesn't 'get' expenses through profit. The business gets expenses from, well, expenses. Like, I rent a building for $10,000 a year. That's an expense. I pay for it, and then I can claim that as an expense on my taxes. I don't 'get' the $10,000 from my profit; I just claim it as a legitimate cost of running my business. And then, because I've claimed it as an expense, it's not part of my profit. Does that make sense?","297":"The concept of cause and effect only applies within our universe, and it doesn\u2019t apply to the universe itself. ","298":"Explainer: You're welcome, I'm glad I could help. It's a mind-bending topic. You're right, the concept of causality is challenged by the idea of the universe having no beginning. It's a bit like the classic question, 'Which came first, the chicken or the egg?' In this case, it's more like, 'What came before the universe?' And the answer is, there is no before.","299":"That's what I mean, it's not something that can be easily explained, it's more of a feeling or an intuition, and it's a bit of a mind-bender, but I think it's worth trying to wrap your head around, even if it's just for a little while.","300":"Your answer here","301":null,"302":"Well, in many cultures, it's considered impolite to discuss your salary with your colleagues or superiors because it can create tension and lead to envy or resentment among others...","303":"I've tried to unionize almost all of them but they always found out and either fired me or gave me the option to quit or be fired before we got too far. I'm starting to think it's because they know that if we unionize, they'll have to start paying us a living wage, and that's just not something they want to do. Am I right?","304":"You're right, some places can be really tough to work in. But it's good that you've learned about workers' rights. It's always good to be prepared for any situation.","305":"Yes, men who get genitalia amputees would still have sexual urges. The brain is the primary source of sexual urges, and the removal of genitalia wouldn't eliminate them. It might reduce or change the nature of the urges, but they would still exist. The brain is wired to respond to sexual stimuli, and this response is not solely dependent on the physical presence of genitalia.","306":"The reason it is often referred to as the balls is because of where the testicles are located, which is in the scrotum, which is a part of the male reproductive system that contains the testicles.","307":"Explainer: No problem, I'm glad I could help clarify things for you. Explainee: That's really interesting, I think I'm going to have to look into it more.","308":"Well, gold is a very valuable object, but it's not very practical for trade.

If we focus on reducing methane emissions, it would have a much bigger impact than going vegan. I'm not saying that going vegan is bad, but it's not the most effective solution to the problem. We need to look at the bigger picture and address the root causes of the issue, rather than just focusing on one aspect of it.","312":"So you think that's a viable solution to capturing methane from the melting arctic?  I think you're vastly underestimating the scale and complexity of the problem.  You're talking about covering millions of square miles of the arctic tundra with vacuum tubes, and you think that's going to be effective and practical?  What makes you think that's a good idea?","313":"I see your points, and I can understand why you might think that. However, let's address each of these points individually. #1 Overcompensation has led to animal abuse, but that's a result of poor farming practices, not the livestock industry as a whole. #2 Cow farts are a significant contributor to greenhouse gases, but the solution isn't to stop raising livestock entirely, it's to implement more efficient farming methods and reduce waste. #3 Tending to and raising livestock does use non-renewable resources, but it's a small fraction of global resource usage. #4 Vertical farming is an interesting idea, but it's not a direct replacement for traditional farming. It's a complementary approach that can help increase food production in urban areas. Let's focus on finding ways to make the livestock industry more sustainable, rather than abandoning it altogether.","314":"The term 'Nazi' has become synonymous with extreme right-wing ideology, but that doesn't necessarily mean that the ideology itself is far-right. In fact, many of the policies and beliefs of the Nazi Party were more aligned with socialist and communist ideologies, such as the nationalization of industries and the emphasis on social welfare programs. However, the Nazi Party's extreme nationalism, racism, and authoritarianism are what set it apart from traditional left-wing ideologies and make it a prime example of far-right ideology.","315":"JSON dialogue goes here","316":"The left-right axis is more complex and includes other factors like social hierarchy, individual freedom, and nationalism. The Nazis' ideology was a mix of far-right nationalism and authoritarianism, which is why they're often placed on the far right.","317":"The 18.9Hz frequency is sometimes called the Ghost Frequency because it's said to evoke a feeling of eeriness or dread in people. It's not entirely clear why this frequency has this effect, but some theories suggest it's due to the way our brains process low-frequency sounds.","318":"Yes, that's correct.  The frequency can be used to create a specific atmosphere, and the fear response can be used to your advantage in a variety of ways, but that's a bit more advanced and requires a deep understanding of psychology and sound manipulation.","319":"They put a strain on public resources like housing, healthcare, and education, which can lead to social unrest and tensions between the existing population and the new migrants.","320":"Radioactive waste dumped into the ocean would still be radioactive, and the effects of that would be felt for thousands of years.

If you can't understand the basic rules of this platform, I'm not going to waste my time explaining it to you.","326":"I'm not dismissing your point of view, but I'd like to clarify some things.","327":"How about we focus on the case instead of your hourly rate?","328":"The concept of an anti-matter universe is not exactly the same as the idea of anti-gravity. Anti-matter is a type of matter that has the same mass as regular matter but opposite charges. An anti-matter universe would be a universe made up of anti-matter, which would behave differently than our universe. Anti-gravity, on the other hand, is a hypothetical force that would cause objects to repel each other instead of attract. It's not a well-defined concept yet, but it's an interesting area of research in physics.","329":"I see what you mean now, you're saying that just because we don't have a specific term for it, it doesn't mean it's not a real concept. You're trying to find a way to describe a way of thinking about the world, and you're using the term 'tesseract' as a shorthand for that. That's a good point, and I think it's an interesting idea. But I'm still not sure I see how it relates to the idea of different scales.","330":"The picture I am referring to is the 3D projection of a Tesseract, not the simplified version you are used to.

This is because the Constitution was written with the understanding that the president would be a seasoned leader with significant life experience, and the 35-year-old minimum age was intended to ensure that the president had a certain level of maturity and wisdom. Over time, the average age of presidents has increased, and there has been no need to set a maximum age, as the Constitution already sets a high minimum age.

You're saying that there's a double standard, and I agree with you. It's not necessarily about the means, but about the end result. People generally don't have a problem with white people getting a tan, but they do have a problem with people of color trying to lighten their skin. It's a historical and societal thing, and it's not something that's easy to explain or justify. It's just something that's deeply ingrained in our culture, and it's something that we need to be aware of and work to change.","342":"You're right, I guess my concern is that people go to great lengths to get a certain look, and if that look is unhealthy or unnatural, then that's concerning to me.","343":"I think it's because people tend to associate tanning with being healthy, and pale skin with being unhealthy.","344":"No, it wouldn't be fine. I was saying that it's not the act of covering up that's the issue, it's the reason behind it. If you're covering up to protect yourself from the sun, that's fine. But if you're covering up solely to avoid getting tan, that's what's concerning.","345":"I don't see how covering your skin with cloth is relevant to the Japanese practice of skin lightening. It's a completely different context.","346":"I think you're misunderstanding the point I'm trying to make. When people get a 'trucker tan', it's not because the cloth they wear is letting sunlight through, but because they're still getting some sunlight on their skin through the cloth. It's not the same as going out of your way to lighten your skin, which would require a different set of circumstances. And I'm not trying to be condescending, I'm just trying to explain the difference between tanning and skin lightening.","347":"You're just not listening, are you? I'm saying that even if you wear clothes, you can still get a tan. It's not about preventing tanning, it's about the underlying issue of skin lightening. But you're too dense to understand that.","348":"You're really trying to have it both ways, aren't you? You're saying that covering your skin doesn't prevent tanning, but then you're also saying that the risk of tanning is high, which implies that it's actually doing something to your skin. It's not that hard to understand.","349":"They're called the Noble Gases because they don't react with other elements to form compounds, which is a big deal in chemistry.

Lead is not a noble gas, it\u2019s a post-transition metal, and it\u2019s stable. There isn\u2019t a half-life of lead, because lead doesn\u2019t decay into anything else. All of the noble elements are stable, and they don\u2019t decay into anything else.","352":"The 19th periodic column is not possible because the number of protons in an atom determines the element, and the heaviest element that can exist is the one with the highest atomic number, which is currently 118.  The periodic table is arranged by atomic number, and the columns are determined by the number of electrons in an atom's outermost energy level.  The number of rows is determined by the number of electron shells, and the current 7th row is already complete.  The 8th row is still being filled with elements that are being discovered, and it's unlikely that a 9th row will be added because the elements in the 7th row decay quickly and there are many elements left to be discovered in the 8th row before a new row could be added.","353":"What makes you so sure that we'll never see a 9th row?","354":"The elements in the 8th row are heavier than the ones in the 7th row, and the rate of decay for the heaviest elements is much faster. ","355":"You're right, it's a long process and a huge improvement. But the thing is, the 7th row was just a single row, and we're talking about a whole new row, the 9th row. The complexity and the difficulty increase exponentially with each new row.","356":"The short answer is no, we can't say for certain that we're not the center of the universe. The universe is so vast and old that it's possible we're just in a special spot. But what we do know is that the universe looks the same in all directions, which is a big clue that we're not special.","357":"No, I am saying that the physics would be the same, but the interpretation of the data would be different, one of them being the center of the universe, the other being no center of the universe","358":"It's a common phenomenon, but the exact cause is still not fully understood. Some scientists think it might be related to the autonomic nervous system, which regulates various involuntary bodily functions, including heart rate, blood pressure, and body temperature.

And I can only see things from a certain angle, if I try to turn my head or move my viewpoint, the image gets all distorted and I have to start over.

If you don't have a regular doctor, you can consider visiting a community health center or a clinic in your area.

You can also check with your local health department to see if they have any programs or resources that can help you access healthcare.","364":"A period, also known as menstruation, is when a girl's body gets ready for a baby by releasing blood and tissue from her uterus. This happens every month because the body thinks it's almost time to have a baby, even if it's not.","365":"Well, for girls, there are a lot of different things that can happen and they can be a little more unpredictable. Girls have to deal with their periods, which can be really inconvenient, and there are a lot of different things that can go wrong with their bodies during puberty. Boys, on the other hand, tend to go through puberty a little more smoothly and they don't have to deal with things like periods or as many different changes to their bodies.","366":"Yes, that's correct.

This is not about the migrants themselves, but rather about the political power play that Erdogan is attempting to execute.","370":"I'm glad I could help you understand my perspective.","371":"When your body is injured, it sends pain signals to the brain. In cold temperatures, the injury is more severe, which means the brain gets more intense pain signals. The cold also makes your blood vessels constrict, which reduces blood flow to the affected area. This makes the injury feel even more severe, which is why it hurts more when you smash your finger in cold weather.","372":"I've tried those heated gloves before. They were a total failure. They got so hot, they melted the handle of my hammer. That was a real 'aha' moment.","373":"I don't think that would work.

I'm looking for a solution that addresses the cold without causing other problems.","374":"You're saying that the cost of raising a child has not increased, but the societal expectations around how much to spend on them have? That's an interesting perspective. I've always thought that the cost of living has gone up, and people are just having fewer kids, but it sounds like there's more to it than that.","375":"Yes, I think that's a good way to put it. I do think that the cost of raising a child has increased, but also that parents' desires to spend money on their kids has increased as well.","376":"Yes, I think that's a very good point.  And it's not just the material goods, but also the experiences.  We take our kids on expensive vacations, we enroll them in expensive extracurricular activities, and we buy them expensive education.  And then we're surprised when they have high expectations for the same things in their own lives.  It's like, we're teaching them that happiness comes from these external sources, and that's not sustainable.  We're creating a culture of entitlement, and it's going to be hard for them to break free from that.","377":"When you buy a non-dividend share, you're essentially buying a small piece of a business. Imagine you own a tiny piece of a pizza, and the pizza represents the company. If the company makes a profit, that's like adding extra slices to the pizza. The company can either cut those extra slices and give them to you as dividends, or it can keep them to add more slices to the pizza, which means the pizza gets bigger and more valuable over time.","378":"And that's the point of stocks: they're a claim on a percentage of the company's assets and profits, not a promise of regular income.","379":"then only buy stocks that give our regular dividends.","380":"But that doesn't explain why the board gets to decide how the profits are distributed, if the shareholders are the ones who own the goose. Shouldn't the shareholders be able to decide how their goose lays its eggs?","381":"The value of your shares doesn't necessarily decrease just because more shares are issued. The value of the company and your ownership in it can still increase if the company performs well. A Ponzi scheme or MLM relies on unsustainable growth and deceitful practices to pay returns, which is not how publicly traded companies work. Your ownership in a company is a claim on a portion of its assets and profits, not a promise of a certain return on investment. The value of your shares is determined by market forces and the company's performance, not by some predetermined promise of a certain return.","382":"I see what you're getting at, but isn't the comparison between MLMs and IPOs a bit of an apples-to-oranges situation? I mean, one is a business model for selling products, and the other is a way for companies to raise capital. How do you think they're similar?","383":"You're dodging the fact that the value of apples or any other product is not inherent to the product itself, but rather to the demand for it.","384":"You're still missing the point. With stocks, you're not buying a tangible item. You're essentially betting on the company's future performance. It's not like buying apples or bolts, where you have a clear understanding of what you're getting. With stocks, you're taking a risk, and that's what makes them so volatile.","385":"You can't just buy a stock of apples and then assume that you can sell them at a higher price, you need to first ensure that there is a market for them. You can't just buy a stock of apples and then assume that you can sell them at a higher price, you need to first ensure that there is a market for them.","386":"The common cold is a virus that's always present in the environment, and it's not eradicated during the off-season. Instead, it's just less active and less contagious. The virus can survive on surfaces and in the air for a short period, and it can be spread through contact with an infected person or by touching contaminated surfaces. When the weather gets colder and people spend more time indoors, the conditions become more favorable for the virus to spread, which is why we tend to see more cases of the common cold during the winter months.","387":"You know what they should call it? The common cold, the flu, pneumonia, bronchitis, all those things, they should call them COVID, and then they can say, 'Oh, this year we had a lot of COVID deaths.' And then they can use that to scare the public and control them, it's all about control, it's all about power, and you people are just sheep, following whatever they tell you, blindly, without questioning, without thinking for yourself, it's pathetic.","388":"I mean, like, it's pretty obvious, right?  They're trying to create a sense of fear and control over the population.  It's like they're trying to turn us all into sheep or something.  Wake up, man!  Don't you see what's going on?  It's like, the more we give in to their narrative, the more they'll just keep pushing the boundaries.  It's like, have you seen the news lately?  It's all just a bunch of scripted nonsense.  They're trying to keep us in a state of perpetual fear and confusion.  But we can't let them win, man.  We have to think for ourselves and not just swallow whatever they feed us.  It's like, we're living in a bad episode of The Twilight Zone or something.  I mean, come on, COVID-19?  It's just a cold, man!  Wake up!","389":"But, the thing is, these security questions are often used as a fallback when the password or 2FA can't be used, like when you've forgotten your password or your phone is dead.","390":"You're right, but the point is that this is not a'simple' security question, it's a question that requires some effort to find out, and that's what makes it secure.  If you make the questions too easy, then it's not secure, because a large number of people will be able to answer them, not just the specific target.","391":"you're suggesting that this system is flawed and you'd like to know more about the underlying mechanics of it, right?","392":"I was trying to make the point that the relative ease of targeting someone is a deterrent, not that it's a good security model.","393":"Alcoholism is considered a disease by the medical community because it involves changes in the brain and body that can't be controlled by the person, and it has a strong genetic component. It's not just a matter of someone choosing to drink too much or being weak-willed. It's a complex condition that affects a person's physical and mental health, and it can have serious consequences for their relationships, work, and overall well-being.","394":"Harvey Weinstein was convicted of multiple counts of rape and sexual assault. The conviction was the result of a long and complex trial, in which the prosecution presented evidence of Weinstein's behavior over several decades. The jury found Weinstein guilty beyond a reasonable doubt, and the judge sentenced him to 23 years in prison. The conviction was significant because it marked a turning point in the #MeToo movement, which had brought attention to the widespread problem of sexual harassment and assault in the entertainment industry.","395":"I understand that you're skeptical, but let me try to break it down further. When a jury finds someone guilty beyond a reasonable doubt, they're making a decision based on the evidence presented in court. It's a complex process that requires considering multiple factors and weighing the credibility of different witnesses. If someone is having trouble understanding why a question was removed, it suggests that they may not be able to navigate the complexities of a jury's decision-making process.","396":"An afro is often seen as unprofessional in corporate workplaces because it's associated with a lack of conformity to traditional business norms. It's not necessarily a reflection of your abilities or work ethic, but rather a visual cue that can trigger biases in others. However, many companies are now actively working to create a more inclusive environment, and some may view a well-groomed afro as a positive aspect of your personal style.","397":"But that doesn't mean you can't be in business and still be expressive and creative, right?","398":"In a business setting, it's generally expected that you will conform to certain norms and standards, such as dressing professionally and being mindful of your appearance. However, self-expression is also valued in many workplaces, and some companies even encourage employees to express themselves through their fashion choices or personal style. It really depends on the company culture and the specific job you're applying for. If you're concerned about fitting in, you could try to find out more about the company culture and dress accordingly.","399":"The reason for this is because of the way the continents have moved over time.  During the supercontinent cycles, the northern hemisphere has been more conducive to land formation and less prone to oceanic crust formation, which is why we see more land in the northern hemisphere.","400":"and I'm surprised that there are so many different hypotheses about it, I would have thought that geologists would have a better idea of how this is going to go.","401":"The continents do move at a rate of a few centimeters per year, but it's just that it's been going on for so long that it adds up to a lot over millions and millions of years.","402":"The scientists of the future might be able to figure out exactly how the continents moved and why, which would be a big deal.","403":"But what about cells that are damaged by radiation, or have other problems, can they just kill themselves or is it a more complex process?","404":"The damage to DNA can also be passed on to offspring, making the risk of cancer more likely for them as well.","405":"Going vegan is good for the environment because animal agriculture is a significant source of greenhouse gas emissions, deforestation, and water pollution. ","406":"Walmart can deny unions because it's a private company and under US labor law, private companies are not required to recognize or bargain with unions unless a majority of employees in a bargaining unit vote in favor of unionization in a secret-ballot election.","407":"No, they can't legally deny it.  In the National Labor Relations Act, if a majority of employees sign cards saying they want a union, the company can't stop them.  The company can hold an election, but if the majority of employees vote for a union, the company has to recognize it.  That's what the law says.  But you're trying to get around that, I think.  You're trying to find a way to get the benefits of a union without actually having a union.  And that's not how it works.  If you want a union, you have to do it the right way.","408":"They can deny it.  The proposal is essentially the same as a union paper, and they can say you're trying to unionize, even if you call it something else.  They can also say that it's a company-wide thing, and that it's not something that can be done store by store.  And even if it were, it would be much more difficult to organize a store, because you'd have to get everyone on board, and that's a lot harder than getting a large group of people to sign a petition.","409":"If a single store unionizes, it doesn't get all the legal protections given to unions in the U.S.  In order to get those legal protections, you need to have a national or industry-wide union.","410":"Sunscreen is not fully absorbed into the bloodstream, but rather metabolized and excreted by the body. Some chemical active ingredients, like oxybenzone and avobenzone, can be stored in fatty tissues and may accumulate over time, which is why it's essential to use sunscreen responsibly and follow the recommended application and reapplication guidelines.","411":"What does EWG stand for?","412":"You're 21, I'm surprised you don't know the word, it's not exactly a taboo term, it's a medical term.","413":"The name 'Noble Gases' actually comes from the fact that they don't react with other elements to form compounds, not because of any reference to aristocrats or nobility. In chemistry, 'noble' means unreactive, not wealthy or high-born.","414":"That would be a very naive and simplistic solution to the complex problems with the current economic system.","415":"Because the population of Europe was dense, the disease spread quickly, whereas in Africa, the population is much more spread out, so the disease doesn't spread as quickly.","416":"African societies were more fragmented and lacked a unified front to resist colonization, making it easier for European powers to exert control over the region.","417":"The key difference between those diseases and the ones I mentioned earlier is that they were all endemic to the Americas, whereas the ones I mentioned earlier are more globally distributed.","418":"I'm not a dumbfuck stoner, I'm a person who has thought about the nature of existence and the human experience, and I'm not afraid to question the status quo and challenge the views of someone like you who claims to have all the answers. You're the one who's immature and close-minded, not me.","419":"You dismiss the possibility of consciousness being a fundamental property of the universe without any evidence, and instead, you resort to an ad hominem attack when faced with the possibility that your views might be incomplete.","420":"It would seem that taking out all of the private insurance middlemen would result in much lower costs.","421":"That's a common intuition, but the evidence suggests that the opposite is true: the government's lack of a profit motive can lead to a lack of cost savings measures, because there's no one to pressure the system to be more efficient.","422":"You seem to be describing a case of equivocation, not the no true Scotsman fallacy. They are not the same thing. The no true Scotsman fallacy is about the way the person is using the label, not what they are using the label for.","423":"You're saying that when Person 1 says 'All X's are Y's' they're not actually thinking of X as all X's, but rather a specific subset of X. That's not how language works. If Person 1 says 'All X's are Y's' then they're making a claim about all X's, not just their personal subset of X. And if Person 2 points out that X1 is an X but not a Y, then Person 1 can't just say 'But X1 is not an X' because that would be a different X than the one they were originally talking about.","424":"You're assuming that people who invoke this fallacy are doing so in a bad faith, but that's a huge assumption. You can't just dismiss the possibility that people are genuinely confused about the argument and really do think that the No True Scotsman fallacy is a real thing.","425":"4. Your point about people being accused of the fallacy when they're really just expressing their personal opinions is a good one. 5. However, this doesn't necessarily mean that the fallacy is being used incorrectly, just that it's being misapplied. 6. The fallacy is still a valid concept, even if it's often misused.","426":"I was expecting you to say that my examples don't count because they're not what you consider'real' cases of the fallacy, but instead, they're just people holding personal beliefs.","427":"Airlines sell a seat on a flight, which is a service, not a product. They can't resell it if someone lies about not showing up. If the plane is full, the cost per seat is lower. If there are empty seats, the cost per seat is higher. That's how 'Hidden City' travel costs airlines more.","428":"You're forgetting that the airline's profit comes from things like selling food and drinks on the flight, as well as credit card fees and other ancillary revenue.  Empty seats don't generate any of that revenue.  If you buy a ticket and don't fly, you're depriving the airline of the opportunity to sell you all of those extra things, which is a significant loss of revenue.","429":"That's right, and if we go back to the airline's perspective, they have a fixed cost for that flight regardless of whether it's a single hop or a two hop. So if you take a seat from a two hop flight, they're still paying for the fuel, the crew, the maintenance, the landing fees, the takeoff fees, the security fees... everything. And they're not getting any of that revenue back because you're taking the seat from the second leg of the flight.","430":"And also, it doesn't mean that Lufthansa doesn't make money from food and booze, they probably do, but the main point is that the ticket price is not just the cost of flying.","431":"You're just trying to get under my skin, but you're not going to succeed.","432":"It loads its initial instructions from a chip on the motherboard called the BIOS (Basic Input\/Output System), which is a set of instructions that tells the computer how to start up and find the operating system on a storage device like a hard drive or solid state drive.","433":"","434":"The CPU takes the number 6 it calculated and turns it into action by using the instruction set to look up the operation that corresponds to the binary number. It then uses the physical arrangement of the transistors and other components to perform that operation. The operation might involve accessing memory, performing arithmetic, or controlling other parts of the system. The CPU doesn't \"know\" what the number means, it just follows the instructions in its instruction set. The instructions are essentially a set of rules that tell the CPU what to do with the numbers it receives. The CPU doesn't have a deep understanding of the meaning of the numbers, it just follows the rules.","435":"When you hear 'x input is converted to y output', it means that the input x gets passed through a series of logic gates and transistors that are configured to produce output y. This is a very simplified explanation, but essentially the input gets transformed by the CPU's internal workings into the desired output.","436":"The No True Scotsman fallacy occurs when someone uses the phrase 'no true X' to dismiss or exclude someone from a group, while defining X in a way that makes it impossible for that person to be a true X. This is a fallacy because it creates a self-justifying definition that can't be challenged or disproven.","437":"However, that doesn't change the fact that it is a fallacy, even if it doesn't happen in real life.","438":"You're saying that the No True Scotsman fallacy is often assumed incorrectly, but that doesn't necessarily mean it's not frequently invoked incorrectly.","439":"Well, it's a bit like this: when an electrical wave travels from one neuron to another, it's kind of like a message being passed from one house to another. But instead of a message, it's a bunch of electrical and chemical signals that are being sent through the neurons. And when all these signals reach the final neuron, it's like the message is being decoded and turned into a thought. So, in a way, our thoughts are made up of the same stuff as the universe, but it's just being arranged in a different way.","440":"Do you find that you're able to visualize objects or scenes from your past, like a memory from childhood?","441":"I see what you're saying, and I think I can relate to that. It's like my brain is trying to translate words into images, but it's not quite working. I feel like I'm stuck in a loop of trying to describe something, but the image never quite forms.","442":"What do you think about the way your imagination worked there? It sounds like it took off in a few different directions, and then got a bit hard to follow. That's kind of like what happens with a lot of complex ideas - they start out simple, but then they branch out and get more complicated. It's like trying to follow a conversation that's going in a lot of different directions at once. Does that make sense?","443":"A period is when a woman's body releases a small amount of blood and tissue through the vagina, usually once a month. It's a sign that she's able to get pregnant.","444":"That's not to say that Africa has never had its own share of pandemics. However, the continent has historically been more isolated from the rest of the world, which has allowed it to develop unique cultural and societal responses to disease.","445":"The difference is that the American diseases were largely spread by Europeans, who were able to travel and trade across the continent, whereas in Africa, the diseases were often spread by local populations and trade networks.","446":"The key difference being that America developed vaccines for those diseases, significantly reducing their impact.","447":"you should really avoid using global variables unless you have a very good reason to do so.","448":"The flu season in Canada ended about a month ago, and the number of reported cases has significantly dropped. However, I'd like to clarify that the flu doesn't just disappear, it's just that the season is over for now. The virus is still present in the environment, and it can still be transmitted to people. In fact, the World Health Organization has reported cases of influenza in other parts of the world, including Asia and Europe. So, while the number of cases in Canada may have dropped, it's unlikely that the flu has completely disappeared.","449":"The flu isn't gone forever, but the virus isn't as active during the warmer months. However, it's not because the virus itself is seasonal, but because it's more difficult for the virus to survive in warmer temperatures and humidity. The virus can still be present in the environment, but it's less likely to be transmitted. It's also possible for the virus to be brought back into an area through travel or trade, which is why it's not uncommon for the flu to reappear in different parts of the world during different times of the year.","450":"The body's stress response, also known as the fight or flight response, is triggered by emotional stressors. This response releases stress hormones like cortisol and adrenaline. These hormones cause physical symptoms like nausea and loss of appetite. It's like your body is preparing you to either fight or run away from the stressor. It's not a rational response, but a primal one. ","451":"You're welcome to share your own story anytime you're ready! It's always a brave and powerful thing to do.","452":"You're welcome! I'm glad I could share my experience with you and help in some small way. Your honesty is inspiring and I'm proud of you for taking this first step. It's not going to be easy, but you're not alone.","453":"I see what you're saying. The elements are simple, but the way they combine and interact to form complex molecules is what leads to the complexity of life. The question is, how did that process start in the first place?","454":"When you apply sunscreen, a lot of it gets washed off in the water or wiped off by sweat. But the chemicals in the sunscreen can be absorbed into your skin and then metabolized by your liver. Some of it can also be excreted in your urine, but a small amount can be stored in your fat cells for a short period.","455":"What does the EWG stand for?","456":"They can, but it would be a very difficult and expensive process for them to do so.  It's called decertification.","457":"But if you hand it to corporate, it's still a union proposal, and they can still deny it and potentially fire you for organizing.","458":"No, a single store can't unionize.  Walmart is a big corporation and it's got to be unionized as a whole.","459":"The odds of not getting the 1\/100 outcome is 99\/100, because you are doing it 100 times, and only 1 time will be the 1\/100 outcome.","460":null,"461":"I was thinking maybe polymers, ceramics, semiconductors, and maybe composites.","462":"But the key point is that the universe is expanding uniformly in all directions, so we're not at a special location that's somehow'stuck' in the middle.","463":"The observation you mentioned does not disprove the theory I am referring to because it is a theoretical framework that attempts to explain the expansion of the universe. The theory suggests that the universe is expanding uniformly in all directions, and there is no center to it. This means that from any vantage point, the observation of accelerating objects would be the same.","464":"Yes, that's what I'm saying. In the static universe model, the expansion of the universe would be a result of matter and radiation, and would be slowed down by gravity, whereas in the accelerating expansion model, it's dark energy that's driving the acceleration. The physics would be different, and the static universe model doesn't account for the observed acceleration of the galaxies away from us.","465":"I see what you're saying, but isn't the brain's role in sexual urges a bit of a chicken-and-egg problem? If the balls produce testosterone, which is a major contributor to sexual urges, wouldn't it be hard to separate the influence of the brain from the influence of the balls?","466":"Can you tell me more about what you're referring to in your culture?","467":"The question of whether or not a 13 year old girl would be developed enough physically and mentally to raise a child on her own, is not a biological question, it is a social question. It is a question of how we as a society decide to raise our children. It is a question of what we consider to be an appropriate age for a person to have a child. This is a question of values, not biology. It is a question of what we want our society to be like, not a question of what is biologically possible.","468":"If you post a thread in a question forum, and the majority of people give you the same answer, you don't believe them?   Yes, okay, discussion of biology was a necessary part of answering the question. It\u2019s a question that referenced puberty in mammals - it self-evidently was going to refer to biological topics. However, your question was asking for the biological reason that humans aren\u2019t ready for kids whilst animals are. The premise is false, and the reason the premise is false is due to social and not biological factors. As I\u2019ve said over and over and over. You may as well be asking \u201cwhat\u2019s the economic rationale for the earth rotating around the sun\u201d.   And for your last sentence - I\u2019m not the one trying to steer this away from a question about raising children and into a semantic debate about   I\u2019m gonna respond every single time btw.","469":"You think you're so clever, don't you? I'll give you credit, that was a pretty good comeback. But it's not going to change the fact that your logic is still flawed and you're just trying to trip me up on minor points rather than addressing the main issue. You're not even addressing the fact that I've been pointing out the biological factors at play in this situation the whole time. You're just trying to distract me with your clever wordplay and your 'I gotcha' moments. But it's not going to work. I'm not going to let you derail the conversation with your petty tricks.","470":null,"471":"Okay, so you're thinking about alpha particles and helium, right? Alpha particles are actually a type of radiation that's emitted from certain types of radioactive materials, like uranium. They're made up of two protons and two neutrons, which is essentially the nucleus of a helium atom, but without the electrons. So when we talk about squaring numbers and square roots in relation to alpha particles, it's more about the math involved in understanding how they behave and interact with other particles, rather than a direct connection to the real world.

I've done my research and found that the evidence is mixed on whether skipping gears is right or wrong. Can we discuss the potential risks and benefits of skipping gears, rather than just relying on a single source of information?","2":null,"3":"It's a multifaceted issue that involves not only the technical feasibility of water treatment but also the social, economic, and political contexts in which access to clean water is determined. In many parts of the world, water scarcity is a symptom of deeper structural problems, such as poverty, inequality, and inadequate governance, which cannot be addressed through a simplistic solution like building infrastructure alone.","4":"I think you're right that we do provide water to some, but the challenge is scaling up that solution to reach everyone, especially in areas where infrastructure is lacking or damaged, and that's where the complexity of the issue comes in.","5":"In many corporate workplaces, there is a lingering bias against afros and other natural hairstyles, often rooted in historical and systemic inequalities. This bias can be perpetuated through subtle cues, such as dress codes and grooming policies that reinforce Eurocentric beauty standards. However, it's essential to recognize that your hair is an integral part of your identity and self-expression. Rather than viewing this as an obstacle, consider it an opportunity to challenge and shift the corporate culture. You can start by researching companies that prioritize diversity, equity, and inclusion, and exploring ways to showcase your unique perspective and style in a professional setting. Remember, your hair is not a liability, but a strength that can bring diversity and authenticity to the workplace.","6":null,"7":"That's a good point. I've never really thought about how people without manual experience use the tachometer. Can you tell me more about how you learned to drive and how you've used the tachometer in your own driving experiences? I'm curious to know more about how people adapt to different driving styles and technologies.","8":"Actually, I think I was sidetracking a bit. To directly address your question, several factors contribute to humans' delayed reproduction. One reason is the relatively long period of juvenile development, which allows for greater emotional and cognitive maturity. Another factor is the increased energy investment required for human reproduction, making it less feasible for young individuals to support offspring. Additionally, humans have a unique capacity for cultural and social learning, which enables the transfer of knowledge and skills from one generation to the next, making it possible for individuals to delay reproduction until they're better equipped to provide for their offspring. These factors combined have led to humans' unique reproductive strategy, where we delay reproduction until we're more prepared to take on the responsibilities of parenthood.","9":"Let's revisit the conversation and how the concept of biological relates to the scenario you described. You mentioned that people doubted your ability to raise a child, but that was about emotional readiness, not biological capability. Can you connect the dots between the definition of biological and what we've discussed so far?","10":"You're dodging the question by not addressing the specific biological aspect that makes humans developmentally delayed compared to animals in terms of readiness for parenthood. If the premise is indeed false, then explain why the biological facts of human development, such as the prolonged period of adolescence and the delayed onset of physical maturity, don't support the idea that humans are developmentally ready for parenthood at a younger age than animals.","11":"I understand that you're feeling frustrated, and it's clear that we haven't fully addressed your concerns. Let's take a step back and re-examine the premise of our discussion. What specific aspects of the biological explanations you received didn't align with your expectations, and how do you think we can better explore the intersection of biology and human behavior in this context?","12":"You're still trying to sidestep the fact that your original premise was flawed, and that's why the conversation took a different turn. I'm not trying to hijack the conversation, I'm trying to get us back on track with the facts. Let's focus on what really matters \u2013 understanding why your initial assumption was off base.","13":"Universal basic income (UBI) is a system where the government provides every citizen or resident with a regular, unconditional sum of money to cover their basic needs. This can be funded through various means, such as taxes, redistribution of existing welfare funds, or a sovereign wealth fund. The goal is to ensure everyone has a safety net and can pursue meaningful work or entrepreneurship without fear of poverty. One concern is that companies might raise prices if they have to pay employees a higher minimum wage, but proponents suggest implementing policies to mitigate this, such as a living wage or indexing benefits to inflation. Another concern is that UBI could lead to a decrease in productivity, but some argue that it could also increase creativity and innovation by giving people the freedom to take risks and pursue their passions.","14":"You're right, it is a complex issue. I've seen some promising research suggesting that UBI can have a positive impact on the cost of living, but I'm not sure it's a silver bullet. It's great that you're thinking critically about this.","15":"The key point is that the turbine is converting the fluid's potential energy into kinetic energy, which is then converted into electricity. This is why the fluid's temperature and pressure are important factors in determining the turbine's energy output.","16":"The term 'Noble Gases' originates from the historical context of chemistry, where elements that resisted reaction were considered noble in their chemical behavior, much like the nobility of old. This name doesn't imply any direct connection to aristocrats, but rather reflects the unique property of these gases being unreactive. In fact, their chemical inertness is a result of their full outer energy level, which makes them stable and resistant to participating in chemical reactions.","17":"Radon is a radioactive gas that decays into polonium, which then decays into lead. This is a common decay chain for uranium isotopes, where radon is an intermediate step before the final product of lead is reached.","18":"The half-life of lead is indeed a very long one, but it's not infinite. Lead is a stable element and doesn't decay into other elements in the classical sense. However, there are some isotopes of lead that can undergo radioactive decay, albeit extremely slowly. As for the Earth's collision with the Andromeda galaxy, it's a fascinating topic, but let's focus on the periodic table for now. The question of whether new elements will be discovered in the future is an interesting one. The periodic table is constantly evolving, and new elements are being added as our understanding of the elements improves. In fact, the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) is responsible for verifying the existence of new elements and adding them to the periodic table. So, while we can't predict with certainty what the future holds, it's possible that new elements could be added to the periodic table in the future, potentially even in the 19. group. However, this would require significant advancements in our understanding of the elements and their properties. ","19":"The periodic table is arranged by increasing atomic number, but the heavier elements are becoming increasingly unstable and short-lived. While it's possible that future discoveries could add new elements to the periodic table, it's unlikely that we'll ever see a 19th column or a 9th row, given the rapid decay of the heaviest elements that have already been discovered. The fact that the last few elements in the 7th row decay almost instantly and that there are still 50 elements to be discovered in the 8th row before we can even consider the 9th row suggests that the heaviest elements are becoming increasingly difficult to stabilize.","20":"What makes you think I'd have any firsthand experience in this field? I'm just someone who reads journals and understands the science.","21":"I'm just a science writer, and I'm trying to understand why you're skeptical about the possibility of discovering a 9th row in the periodic table. Can you share some insights about the challenges and considerations that come into play when searching for new elements?","22":"I'm not sure what you're getting at with your question about element #10,000. The rate at which new elements are discovered is not linear, and it's unlikely that we'll see a consistent increase in the rate of discovery as we go further up the periodic table. In fact, as I mentioned earlier, the last few elements discovered have decayed at an incredibly fast rate, making them harder to create and detect. However, I think what you're trying to get at is that the progress we've made so far, from the 7th row to the 8th row, has been significant and suggests that we might be able to make similar progress in the future, even if it's not a straightforward linear increase. Am I right?","23":"During the off-season, the common cold virus, specifically rhinovirus, can survive on surfaces and in the air for a short period. It can also persist in the respiratory tract of infected individuals, even after they've recovered, in a state known as the \"carrier state.\" When the weather changes and people become more susceptible, the virus can be transmitted through respiratory droplets, touching contaminated surfaces, and other means. The common cold can also be triggered by changes in temperature and humidity, which can cause the virus to become more active and spread more easily. Additionally, the fact that the common cold can be caused by multiple strains of the virus means that it can come back even if you've had it before, as your body may not have developed immunity to all of the different strains.","24":"I'm just frustrated, man. I think people are being misled about the reality of COVID-19. They're taking a common cold and blowing it way out of proportion. I've been doing some research and I'm convinced it's all about manipulating public opinion and controlling the narrative.","25":"I feel you, like, have you noticed how the 'experts' on TV always seem to be parroting the same talking points, without ever really providing any concrete evidence or credible sources to back up their claims? It's like they're reading from a script, rather than actually thinking critically about the issues at hand.","26":"In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported a significant decline in influenza cases in 2020, with only 200 cases reported, compared to 38 million in 2019. This reduction was largely attributed to the COVID-19 pandemic, which led to a decrease in social interactions and gatherings, making it more difficult for the flu to spread.","27":"The pandemic's unusual circumstances, including increased mask-wearing, social distancing, and reduced travel, likely played a significant role in the lower influenza cases. This environment made it more difficult for the virus to spread, whereas COVID-19, being highly contagious, thrived in these conditions.","28":"The measures we've taken to combat COVID-19 have inadvertently created an environment that's making it harder for influenza to spread, which is why we're seeing low levels this year. We're not out of the woods yet, and it's possible that influenza could still make a comeback, especially if people become complacent and let their guard down.","29":"Let's refocus on your original question about minor cases. You mentioned that if they isolate themselves for a couple of weeks, their bodies might be able to destroy the virus or they could be vaccinated with a flu shot. That's an interesting point, but we need to consider the specifics of coronaviruses. Even if a person's body can fight off the virus, there's still a risk of transmission to others. Additionally, flu shots are designed to protect against influenza, not coronaviruses. Let's discuss the possibility of transmission through the air or surfaces, and explore the challenges of eliminating a virus like this, especially when compared to more widespread infections like influenza or herpes.","30":"That's a good point about isolation, but we're not just talking about minor cases - even with vaccination and a healthy immune system, the flu can still cause severe illness and even death, especially in vulnerable populations like the elderly and young children. And as for the virus existing in the air or on surfaces, that's a major concern because it means that even if people are isolated, they can still be exposed to the virus through contact with contaminated surfaces or air. And regarding herpes, it's a different story altogether - it's a latent virus that can be triggered by stress, trauma, or other factors, and it's much more difficult to eradicate than the flu. We need to focus on understanding the flu's transmission dynamics and developing effective strategies for prevention and control, rather than comparing it to other viruses.","31":"What I mean is that if we assume the universe only operates based on observation, then it raises interesting questions about the nature of reality and our place within it. For instance, if everything only exists when it's being observed, does that mean that we're somehow responsible for creating reality through our perception of it?","32":"So you're trying to test my engagement, and you're curious to see how far you can push me before I get tired of this conversation?","33":"That's correct, and one of the reasons DNA damage is particularly devastating is because it can disrupt the delicate balance of gene expression, leading to uncontrolled cell growth and cancer. Additionally, the damage can also trigger a cascade of downstream effects, including chromosomal instability, epigenetic changes, and even cell death, which can have far-reaching consequences for the entire organism.","34":"And that's why the body has a built-in mechanism to prevent cancer from taking hold. This process, called apoptosis, is a natural part of how cells work, and it helps keep the body healthy.","35":"Come on, let's not get into a semantic debate over definitions. If you're not willing to accept the fact that hockey is widely recognized as a sport, I'm not sure how much further we can have this conversation.","36":"I totally get why you'd feel scared - puberty can be overwhelming. But the good news is that you'll have a lot of support along the way, whether it's your family, friends, or teachers. And it's totally normal to have questions and not know what to expect. Why don't we break down the changes you might experience during puberty, so you feel more prepared and in control?","37":"Yeah, that's a good point! Girls do tend to experience more noticeable physical changes during puberty, like getting their periods, developing breasts, and growing hair in different places. But it's worth noting that every person is different, and some boys may experience more dramatic changes than some girls. And I think it's great that you're thinking about how both boys and girls might feel during this time. Do you want to ask me some questions about what you're going through?","38":"I think you might be describing a sleep paradox, where the body's sleep needs and the brain's sense of rest don't align. This can be due to various factors, such as sleep fragmentation, where you're waking up multiple times during the night, or circadian rhythm disorders, which can affect your body's internal clock. It's also possible that your brain is simply not entering the stage of deep sleep that's restorative, leaving you feeling tired despite a long sleep duration. This can be a complex issue, and it might be helpful to explore it further with a healthcare professional to rule out any underlying conditions that could be contributing to your symptoms.","39":"I've been feeling pretty down lately, and it's hard to pinpoint what's causing it. I've been trying to brush it off, but it's been weighing on my mind for a while now. Have you ever felt like that, where you're not sure what's going on, but you know something's off?","40":"I've always been curious about how my family's perspective on therapy might have influenced your views on seeking help. Can you tell me more about what they've said or done that's made you feel this way?","41":"Boiling a sponge isn't a reliable method for sanitizing it because the high heat can cause the sponge to degrade and potentially release its embedded bacteria, making the water unsafe to use for cleaning. In fact, the USDA recommends microwaving or washing a sponge in hot water with a dishwasher detergent to sanitize it.","42":"I think we're getting off track here. Can we focus on the original point you were making about my statement, rather than making assumptions about my political views?","43":"Now that we've acknowledged the escalation, let's get back to the original issue - your comment about not being made of money. Can you explain what you meant by that, and how it relates to your previous joke about micro purchases?","44":"Imagine an electrical wave as a kind of message that travels through the brain, kind of like how a text message travels through your phone. When this message reaches the end of the neuron, it can trigger a response, like a new message being sent to another neuron, which can then trigger another response, and so on. This process happens so quickly that it gives us the sensation of thought, but at a fundamental level, it's just a series of chemical and electrical reactions happening in the brain.","45":"The term 'Noble Gases' originates from their unique chemical properties, which were first observed by scientists in the late 19th century. These elements, including helium, neon, argon, krypton, xenon, and radon, are characterized by their full outer energy level, which makes it difficult for them to form bonds with other atoms. This property led scientists to dub them 'noble' because of their inertness, much like how the term 'noble' was used in the 18th and 19th centuries to describe people of high social standing. However, this is a purely scientific term and has no connection to the concept of nobility or aristocracy. In fact, the discovery of these elements and their properties marked a significant milestone in the development of modern chemistry, as they challenged the prevailing understanding of chemical reactivity at the time.","46":"I acknowledge that you have concerns about the ethics and motivations of the individuals involved in the Manhattan Project, but let's not get sidetracked by those issues. Heisenberg's mathematical mistakes are a crucial aspect of our discussion, and it's essential to understand how they impacted the project's outcome. By focusing on the technical aspects of his work, we can gain a deeper appreciation for the complexities of atomic theory and the challenges of nuclear physics.","47":"I've seen that article before, and it's a prime example of how a sensationalized story can spread like wildfire without being thoroughly fact-checked. The article relies heavily on the claims of a treasure hunter with a vested interest in sensationalizing his finds, and experts in the field have thoroughly debunked the claims made. Moreover, the article lacks concrete evidence to support its assertions, which raises serious questions about its credibility. What's more, the article's sensational tone and lack of critical analysis only serve to perpetuate misinformation and undermine the pursuit of historical truth. It's essential to approach such claims with a healthy dose of skepticism and to seek out credible sources that provide a more nuanced and balanced understanding of the events in question.","48":"Actually, that's a really interesting point, and it's worth considering that the Nazis' goal might have been to create a reactor that could produce plutonium, rather than a bomb. If that's the case, they wouldn't have needed a massive amount of uranium, just enough to sustain a chain reaction, which is exactly what they achieved with the reactor they built. It's a clever way to think about it, and it highlights the complexity of their plan and the challenges they faced in trying to create an atomic bomb.","49":"The National Labor Relations Act is a federal law that protects workers' rights to organize and bargain collectively, but it also has some loopholes that companies like Walmart can exploit. For example, the law requires companies to recognize and bargain with a union only if a majority of workers in a particular unit have signed union authorization cards. If a company can convince enough workers to not sign those cards, or if it can delay the process long enough, it can prevent a union from being recognized. Additionally, companies can use tactics like hiring permanent replacements for striking workers, or transferring union supporters to other locations, to discourage workers from unionizing. These tactics might not be explicitly illegal, but they can be very effective in preventing unions from forming.","50":"I think this makes sense. Let's give it a try and see if it actually helps with getting songs stuck in your head. It's a pretty interesting theory!","51":"Guess I'll be singing 'Shake it Off' tomorrow, then!","52":"Investment banking is like a middleman service. Imagine you want to buy a house, but you don't know the seller. You need someone to help you find each other and make the deal happen. That's basically what investment banks do, but instead of houses, they help big companies raise money or buy other companies. They also help companies figure out how much their company is worth, which is called valuing a company. In the context of market making, investment banks often work closely with market makers to facilitate the buying and selling of securities. They provide research and analysis to help market makers understand market trends and make informed decisions. Additionally, investment banks may also assist market makers in navigating regulatory requirements and managing risk. By doing so, they help create a more efficient and liquid market, which benefits both investors and market makers.","53":"The Earth's rotation causes it to bulge at the equator and flatten at the poles, which affects the distribution of land and water. Additionally, the way continents have moved and interacted over time has shaped the current geography, resulting in more landmasses in the northern hemisphere. Let's take a closer look at how this all works!","54":"I think that's a common misconception, people tend to think that the continents are fixed in place, but the truth is that they're always moving, albeit very slowly. In fact, if you look at the Earth's history, there have been times when the continents were much closer together than they are now, like during the time of the supercontinent Pangaea. That's why we have fossils of the same species found on different continents, and it's also why we see similar rock formations on different continents.","55":"Regulation often involves a mix of both policy and ideological considerations. For instance, in the case of labor unions and striking, left-wing ideologies prioritize workers' rights over those of capital owners, which can lead to regulations that balance these competing interests. This nuanced approach is often misunderstood as being solely policy-driven, but it's actually a complex interplay between the two.","56":"The electrical impulses between neurons in the brain give rise to conscious thought through a complex interplay of neural activity, synaptic connections, and information integration. This intricate process involves the coordinated firing of billions of neurons, which collectively generate a rich tapestry of cognitive experiences. While the precise mechanisms underlying conscious thought remain unclear, research in neuroscience continues to uncover the neural correlates of awareness, perception, and subjective experience.","57":"I don't see how the physical location of thoughts necessarily implies their physical nature. That's a bit of a non-sequitur. If we're talking about the sense of location, I'd be more interested in exploring why you feel like there are two beings at play here.","58":"Well, when we damage specific parts of the brain, the changes in consciousness that follow are consistent with the idea that consciousness arises from brain activity. For instance, damage to the area responsible for spatial reasoning leads to difficulties with spatial tasks, while damage to the memory centers can cause memory loss. This pattern suggests that consciousness is closely tied to brain function, rather than being a separate entity.","59":"A tachometer is a crucial gauge in a car's dashboard, providing real-time information about the engine's speed. By monitoring the RPMs, you can ensure the engine operates within its optimal range, which is particularly important when driving in various conditions. This helps prevent engine damage and maintains its overall performance.","60":"They're essentially replicating the formula, packaging, and branding of a popular product, but under their own label. This is called private labeling or store branding. The key is that they're not violating any trademarks, as they're using a distinct name that doesn't infringe on the original product's identity. In the case of Equate and Head & Shoulders, Equate is Walmart's own store brand, and they're not claiming to be the original product. Instead, they're offering a similar product at a lower price point, which can be a win-win for consumers who want a quality product at a more affordable price.","61":"You're trying to shift the conversation away from the biological aspects of human reproduction and towards the idea that humans are unique in their delayed maturity, but you're not providing any concrete evidence to support this claim. Instead, you're making a leap from the economic rationale of the earth's rotation to the idea that social factors are the primary reason for human delayed maturity. This doesn't address the question at hand, which is about the biological differences between humans and other mammals. Can we focus on the biological aspects of human reproduction and why humans might be different from other mammals in this regard?","62":"Okay, let me try to address your concerns. You're right that I've been pointing out potential flaws in your original premise, but that's because I'm trying to understand the underlying assumptions and how they relate to the biological aspects of human reproduction. I think we got sidetracked by the social implications, but I'd like to refocus on the biological aspects. Can we agree that ovulation and human behavior are indeed closely tied, and that's what we should be exploring further?","63":"I understand your point now, and I appreciate the clarification. However, I still maintain that the premise of your question is flawed, as it relies on a false dichotomy between biological and social factors. If we were to reframe the question to focus on the biological aspects of human development, we might arrive at a more nuanced understanding of why humans are not ready for parenthood at a young age. Perhaps we could explore the differences in brain development, hormonal changes, or other biological factors that contribute to this phenomenon.","64":null,"65":"It's largely due to the historical and ongoing objectification of women's bodies, which has been perpetuated through societal norms, media representation, and power imbalances.","66":"You're saying that the computer is just sending a set of numbers, and the monitor is just displaying those numbers as images. So, what's the relationship between the numbers and the resulting image?","67":"The monitor has a matrix of transistors and light sources behind the screen, which are carefully calibrated to ensure precise control over the amount of light that gets through to each subpixel. For shades, the display uses a technique called pulse-width modulation, where the transistors are turned ON and OFF at a high frequency, and the ratio of ON time to OFF time controls the brightness of the light. This allows the display to produce a wide range of shades and colors, without having to physically change the light source. The key difference is that digital devices like this display are designed to produce a binary signal, with only two states: ON and OFF, whereas analog devices can produce a continuous range of signals, allowing for more nuanced control over the light output.","68":"Think of it like a light switch. When it's on, it's fully on, and when it's off, it's fully off. There's no in-between. That's digital. Analog is more like the brightness control on your TV. It can be set to any level, from completely off to completely on, with infinite possibilities in between.","69":"In analog circuits, transistors are less powerful, so they can't fully drive the gate of another transistor. Instead, they use a range of voltages to control the current, allowing for many shades of grey between complete on and complete off.","70":"Analog signals can have a range of values, like a volume level that can be loud or soft, or a temperature reading that can be hot or cold. They're often represented by a continuous spectrum, whereas digital signals are just 1s and 0s. Think of it like a radio dial - you can tune into different stations, but the dial itself is continuous, not just a series of discrete steps.","71":"The reason space appears dark is because the vast emptiness of space doesn't provide a medium for light to bounce off of, unlike on Earth where light encounters various surfaces and objects, causing it to scatter and reflect in different directions. Think of it like shining a flashlight in a room - the light spreads out and hits the walls, furniture, and other objects, but in space, there's no 'wall' or 'furniture' to scatter the light, so it just keeps going in all directions, making it appear dark. This is also why we see the stars and planets in space as bright points of light - because they are reflecting the light that hits them, whereas the empty space around them is not reflecting any light.","72":"The vantablack is absorbing all the light, so it's not sending any information to your brain. It's not like your brain is saying, 'wow, this is really, really black.' It's more like your brain is just not getting any information at all, so it's perceiving it as black. It's a lack of information, rather than a lot of information about how black it is.","73":"Exactly, it's as if the car is invisible, and our brain is filling in the gap with a mental image of a car-shaped void. That's what makes Vantablack so fascinating \u2013 it plays tricks on our perception of reality.","74":"Actually, the alchemists were trying to achieve something much more complex than just transmutation, they were trying to achieve spiritual enlightenment through the process of turning base metals into gold, and they believed that this process would allow them to understand the fundamental nature of reality and gain a deeper understanding of the universe, which was their ultimate goal. They were not just focused on creating gold, but on unlocking the secrets of the universe and achieving a higher state of consciousness. This is why their experiments were often shrouded in mystery and secrecy, as they were not just about chemistry, but about the pursuit of spiritual knowledge and enlightenment.","75":"That's not exactly what I meant to say. I was trying to convey that if you get the flu, you might be more likely to pass it on to others who are more vulnerable, rather than directly putting their lives at risk. For example, if you have the flu and you're a teacher, you could potentially infect your students who might be more susceptible to complications from the flu. Does that make more sense?","76":"That's a good point. Not having a doctor can make it harder to get regular check-ups and preventive care. What do you think would make it easier for you to access healthcare?","77":"The term 'Ghost Frequency' is actually a bit of a misnomer. It's a relatively common frequency found in various types of music, especially from the 19th and early 20th centuries. The name likely stems from its ability to evoke an unsettling, eerie feeling in some people. However, it's worth noting that the frequency itself is not inherently 'ghostly' or supernatural. It's more a matter of psychological association and the way our brains process certain sounds. To clarify, would you like me to elaborate on the science behind this phenomenon?","78":"Yes, that's correct. The 18.9 Hz frequency can have a physical impact on people, even if they can't hear it. Some studies have shown that exposure to this frequency can cause a range of physical reactions, including increased heart rate, blood pressure, and even nausea. These reactions are often linked to the body's natural response to stress and anxiety.","79":"The Earth's water supply is indeed constant, but the water cycle is constantly replenishing and redistributing it, so while we can't \"waste\" water in the sense of removing it from the planet, we can waste it by using it inefficiently or not reusing it when possible. This is where conservation efforts come in \u2013 making the most of the water we have, rather than taking it for granted.","80":null,"81":"You're right that selling tickets is a significant source of revenue, but it's not the only factor. Airlines also make money from ancillary services like baggage fees, in-flight meals, and credit card sales. If they can fill their planes with passengers, they can maximize these additional revenue streams. However, if they have to fly an empty plane, they may still be able to generate some revenue from cargo or other sources, but it's likely to be less than if they had a full load of passengers.","82":"A period is a natural part of a woman's menstrual cycle. It's when the uterus sheds its lining, and blood comes out of the vagina. It's a normal and healthy process that happens every month if a woman isn't pregnant.","83":"I think there's a common misconception about the vaginal anatomy. The vagina isn't just a simple tunnel, but rather a complex structure with multiple layers and a unique shape. When a tampon or a finger is inserted, the walls of the vagina will move apart to accommodate it, but it's not as simple as just opening up a straight tube. The cervix is also an important part of the anatomy, and it's usually closed, but it can open up during childbirth or menstruation. It's worth noting that every woman's body is different, and the shape and size of the vagina can vary significantly from person to person. Does that help clarify things?","84":"The cervix is the lower part of the uterus, and the vagina is the tube that connects the cervix to the outside of the body. Think of it like a flower with the uterus as the center, the cervix as the stem, and the vagina as the petals that lead to the outside.","85":null,"86":"That's not ideal, but you can still get information from a community health clinic or a local health department, they usually have free or low-cost information and resources.","87":"It's that the notes don't quite match the pitch of the chord they're supposed to be part of. A C major chord is typically made up of C, E, and G notes, but in this case, the notes are slightly flat, which makes the whole thing sound 'off'.","88":"But it's still not that hard, the cows are basically grazing animals, they take care of themselves, especially in the summer months when they're able to roam freely and eat as much grass as they want. However, in the winter, they do need to be moved to a warmer location with better access to food and water, which can be a challenge for farmers. It's not just about finding a new field, but also making sure they have enough hay and other nutritious feed to keep them healthy until the weather warms up again.","89":"But that's a narrow view, and even if you did live on a farm, your experience is not the norm. The reality is that most farms, especially large-scale ones, rely on industrial processes and machinery to manage the day-to-day tasks, from milking to feeding to housing the animals. It's a far cry from the idyllic image you're painting.","90":"I think it's because people often don't realize how these beauty standards were created and perpetuated, and they just see them as personal choices. But the fact that these standards have been around for so long isn't a coincidence \u2013 it's a result of how society has been set up to favor certain groups.","91":"I think we need to separate the personal from the systemic here. While it's true that a young Hispanic girl might want to lighten her skin solely because she likes the way it looks, we also need to acknowledge that her desire is still influenced by the societal beauty standards that have been shaped by historical racism. It's a complex issue, and I'd argue that even if she's not thinking about racism, she's still part of a larger cultural narrative that perpetuates these beauty standards. It's not necessarily about her individual preference, but about how those preferences are constructed and reinforced by the society around her. ","92":"The BIOS program acts as a kind of foundation, providing a set of basic instructions that allow the computer to initialize its hardware and start up the operating system. This foundation enables the computer to perform its first tasks, such as loading programs and data, and sets the stage for more complex operations to follow. By following these initial instructions, the computer is able to take its first steps in processing information and executing tasks.","93":"The CPU has a complex system of logic gates and transistors that allow it to perform operations based on the binary input. Think of it like a series of if-then statements, where each binary input corresponds to a specific operation. The instruction set acts as a kind of recipe book, telling the CPU how to interpret each binary input and perform the corresponding operation. It's a bit like a vending machine, where you put in a coin (binary input) and it dispenses a snack (operation). The CPU's physical arrangement and the instruction set work together to make this happen.","94":"It's like a machine that takes in instructions and uses them to change one thing into another. Think of it like a recipe book. You give the machine an ingredient, like a number, and it follows the recipe to turn it into something else, like storing it in memory.","95":"The thing is, security questions are a bit of a relic from the past, and they're not as effective as they used to be. Think of them as a speed bump for automated attacks, but not a real barrier for determined hackers. In reality, most people's security questions can be easily answered by their friends and family, or even found online. So, while they might slow down some attackers, they're not going to stop a targeted attack. It's like trying to protect a house with a flimsy lock \u2013 it might deter some casual burglars, but a determined thief will just find another way in.","96":"I understand your point about targeted attacks being a significant concern, but isn't that exactly what makes the current security model so flawed? It's not just about the effort required to target one person, but also the potential impact and the fact that it's often easier to target individuals who are perceived as low-hanging fruit. By ignoring this reality, the model is essentially giving attackers a free pass to focus on the easiest targets, rather than being forced to adapt and innovate.","97":null,"98":"The thing is, even with those bases, it's not just a matter of capturing the methane as it comes out, it's also about containing the massive amounts of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases that are released as the biomass decomposes, which is a much more complex and difficult problem to solve. ","99":"The water cycle is a complex process, and contaminants can spread quickly through it. It's not just a matter of cleaning up the water where it's been contaminated \u2013 we'd have to consider the entire system and how it might be affected. Think of it like a big web, where every strand is connected and fragile.","100":null,"101":"I think that's a really poignant point. The truth is, we have the technology and resources to provide clean water to everyone, but there are complex reasons why we don't. For example, it's often cheaper and more profitable for companies to sell bottled water or exploit existing water sources, rather than investing in infrastructure that would provide clean water to everyone. Additionally, there are often political and social barriers that prevent us from taking action, such as corruption, lack of funding, or competing priorities. So, it's not just a matter of 'we don't do it', but rather a complex web of factors that need to be addressed in order to make clean water a reality for everyone.","102":"You seem to think that your personal experiences and perspectives are the only valid ones. However, that's not the case. People have different backgrounds, upbringings, and ways of understanding the world. It's okay to disagree, and it's okay to not know everything. Let's focus on having a respectful conversation and exploring different ideas, rather than resorting to personal attacks and insults.","103":"You're not considering the complexity of human experience and the limitations of our current understanding. I'm not asking you to accept a particular viewpoint, but rather to acknowledge the uncertainty that exists in many areas of human knowledge. By dismissing my perspective as'metaphysical bunkum,' you're closing off the possibility of exploring new ideas and perspectives that could challenge our current understanding of the world. Can we have a more nuanced discussion about the nature of consciousness and the human experience?","104":"Hidden City tickets are a sneaky way for airlines to sell more tickets at a low price. If people get off in Atlanta, the airline still has to pay for the return trip, but they're not making any money from that leg because there are no passengers. It's like selling a ticket to a concert, but the person who bought it doesn't show up \u2013 the airline is still paying for the concert, but they're not getting any revenue from it.","105":"You're right that not everyone buys stuff on the flight, but the people who do make a big difference. Think about it like this: on a full plane, you've got more people to sell to, whether it's a drink, a snack, or an upgrade. And it's not just about the money - it's also about the space. If a plane is half empty, you're losing out on potential revenue from selling those seats to other people. It's not just about the cost of the empty seats, it's about the opportunity cost of not being able to sell those seats to someone else. So, yeah, the lost revenue from the empty seats is a big deal for the airline.","106":"I think you're asking if the flu just vanished, but it's still out there. The pandemic measures really helped slow it down, but it's not gone for good. We're just lucky to have a bit of a break.","107":"I think I may have gotten a bit sidetracked. Let's get back on track. To answer your original question, the virus can survive on surfaces for a short period, but it's primarily spread through respiratory droplets. Isolating minor cases for 2 weeks might be sufficient, but we should prioritize monitoring and testing to prevent further transmission. The flu shot won't provide protection against this virus, as it's a different type of virus altogether.","108":"The 35-year age requirement was set by the Founding Fathers to ensure the president has acquired a certain level of life experience and maturity. While it's true that age can bring wisdom, it's also possible for younger individuals to possess the necessary qualities and experience to lead the country. The Constitution doesn't specify a maximum age, but it does require that the president be a natural-born citizen, at least 35 years old, and a resident of the United States for at least 14 years.","109":"I understand why you might feel that way, but the system is more complex than just two parties. While it's true that the Democrats and Republicans have a strong grip on the political landscape, there are still opportunities for third parties and independent candidates to make a difference. And, actually, write-in votes are a viable option in many states, allowing voters to choose candidates who aren't on the ballot. Can you tell me more about what's specifically bothering you about the two-party system?","110":"Well, I think what you're getting at is that if you frame it as a benefits proposal rather than a unionization effort, it might be harder for Walmart to object. But under the National Labor Relations Act, if it's clear that the proposal is being used to circumvent the unionization process, the employer can still challenge it. It's not a foolproof way to avoid unionization, and it's not clear to me that it would be successful in this case.","111":"That's an interesting idea, but I think it's unlikely they would accept it as anything other than a union proposal, given that the language and content are identical. In fact, it might even be seen as a more insidious attempt to circumvent their no-union policy, which could lead to even more severe consequences. So, while it might seem like a clever workaround, I'm not sure it would actually be effective in achieving your goals.","112":"In the U.S., a single store cannot unionize on its own. However, a group of employees from a single store can still organize and potentially join a larger union that represents employees across multiple stores and locations.","113":"That's not the point, the point is that the women in the company have been historically marginalized, excluded from leadership positions, and paid less than their male counterparts. We're not just talking about equal pay, we're talking about equal opportunities and equal respect.","114":"Yes, you can see the moon from any point on the sunset ring at this time, but not necessarily as a bright spot near the Sun. The Moon's visibility near the Sun depends on its phase and the amount of sunlight it reflects. When the Moon is full or nearly full, it can be visible as a bright spot in the sky near the Sun, but when it's in a new phase, it might be harder to spot due to the Sun's brightness. The key point is that the Moon's position relative to the Sun and your location on the sunset ring determines its visibility, not the fact that it's always on the same hemisphere as the Sun.","115":"Actually, I think there's been a misunderstanding. An afro isn't inherently unprofessional in corporate workplaces. The issue often lies in the societal biases and stereotypes associated with it. If you're comfortable with your afro, I'd say go for it! It's a great way to express yourself and showcase your individuality. If you're concerned about how it might be perceived, we could brainstorm some ways to address those concerns together.","116":"Absolutely, being a business person doesn't have to mean sacrificing your personal style or self-expression. In fact, many companies value diversity and individuality, and having a bold hairstyle can actually be a strength in certain industries, like fashion or creative services. It's more about being mindful of the culture and expectations of the specific company or role you're applying for, and finding ways to balance your personal expression with the needs of the job.","117":"That's a really interesting question, and one that I think a lot of people have grappled with. I think it's worth considering the ways in which business can be a platform for self-expression, even if it's not always the most obvious one. For example, a business can be a way to express your values and priorities through the products or services you offer, or the way you treat your employees and customers. It can also be a way to create a community around shared interests and passions, which can be a powerful form of self-expression. Of course, there are also challenges and trade-offs to consider, such as the need to balance creative vision with commercial realities, and to navigate the complexities of marketing and branding. But I think it's definitely possible to build a business that aligns with your values and allows for a high degree of self-expression. What are your thoughts on this?","118":"An electrical wave between neurons is like a language that the brain uses to communicate. It's a complex process, but essentially, the brain is constantly sending and receiving signals, kind of like a never-ending conversation. These signals are what allow us to think, learn, and understand the world around us.","119":"We have a good understanding of the butterfly effect, but it's not as clear-cut as you're making it out to be. And even if we could track the trajectory of every particle in the universe, we'd still be dealing with a mind-boggling amount of complexity. That's why some people think that consciousness might be more than just a product of physical processes.","120":"You're misinterpreting the concept of determinism. It suggests that every event, including our choices, is the inevitable result of prior causes. Even if we can't fully understand or measure all the factors at play, the fact that everything is determined means that our decisions aren't truly free. Our consciousness arises from the intricate workings of the universe, a complex interplay of particles and forces.","121":"Imagine a computer as a master craftsman who has been trained in a specific trade. When it receives a number like 6, it's like receiving a blueprint for a specific task. It knows exactly what steps to follow, what tools to use, and how to assemble them to achieve the desired outcome. It's not thinking creatively or making decisions like a human would, but rather executing a series of pre-programmed instructions that have been encoded into its 'blueprint'. The CPU is essentially a sophisticated toolbox that contains the necessary 'tools' and 'instructions' to carry out these tasks, and the transistors and other components are like the individual 'tools' that make up the toolbox. By understanding how these 'tools' work together, we can gain insight into how the computer is able to perform its tasks, even if it's not 'thinking' in the way we do.","122":"The CPU uses its instruction set to translate the binary signals into a specific sequence of operations, kind of like a blueprint or a set of instructions that tell it exactly what to do with the data it receives. It's a complex process, but essentially the CPU is following a set of rules that determine how to take the input data, process it, and produce the desired output.","123":"It's a complex interplay between the physical properties of the components and the software that tells them what to do. Think of it like a recipe: the ingredients are the physical properties of the transistors and other components, and the instructions are the software that determines which transistors are on or off at any given time based on the inputs. The software is like the chef, using the ingredients to create a specific outcome, and the transistors are like the kitchen tools, carrying out the instructions to produce the desired result.","124":"Well, that's a bit of a complicated process, but basically, the computer takes the number 8 and uses it to determine how many pixels to draw on the screen. It's a bit more nuanced than a simple recipe, though - the computer needs to consider the screen's resolution, the color depth, and other factors to accurately render the image. It's a process that happens rapidly, often in the range of microseconds, and is handled by specialized hardware and software components.","125":"Actually, bacteriophages are already being researched and used in various parts of the world, including the US. In fact, the FDA has approved several bacteriophage-based treatments for use in hospitals. The challenge lies in scaling up production and making them more widely available. As for cultivation, it's not as simple as just isolating a single bacteriophage from dirt and growing it in a petri dish. The process involves complex techniques such as phage typing, phage isolation, and phage propagation, which require specialized equipment and expertise. Big pharma may not be investing as much in bacteriophage research, but there are many startups and research institutions working on developing new bacteriophage-based treatments and technologies. It's an exciting area of research with a lot of potential for innovation and improvement.","126":"Researchers have been able to isolate specific bacteriophages from the environment using a process called phage isolation. This involves taking a sample from soil, water, or even the human gut, and then using a technique called plaque assay to identify the desired bacteriophage. It's a challenging process, but it's a crucial step in developing bacteriophage-based treatments.","127":"Aristotle's views on infinity were actually quite nuanced and based on his metaphysical views. I think you're selling him short by saying he just dismissed infinity as impossible. His ideas about potential and actual infinity are still relevant today. And, as you mentioned, mathematicians like Zeno and Galileo made important contributions to the study of infinity before calculus was developed. It's not a question of 'just an incredibly large number' - mathematicians have developed rigorous theories and methods for working with infinity that go far beyond that.","128":"When you buy non-dividend shares, you're essentially investing in a company's growth potential. The idea is that as the company expands, its value will increase, and you can sell your shares for a profit. This type of investment is often considered riskier than buying dividend shares, but it can also be more rewarding for those who are willing to take on that risk. In essence, you're betting on the company's ability to innovate, expand its market, and increase its revenue, which can lead to a higher stock price and a potential return on investment.","129":"And what about the dividends you get from buying stocks? How do they relate to the concept of intrinsic value, and what implications does this have for evaluating the true worth of a stock?","130":"I see what you're getting at with the analogy of buying apples from an orchard, but I think it's a flawed comparison. In the case of MLMs, the product is often not just a commodity like apples, but a branded item with a specific value proposition. Additionally, the business model of an MLM is designed to create a sense of exclusivity and scarcity, which can drive up prices and make it difficult for distributors to sell the product at a profit. In contrast, buying stocks is a more transparent and regulated process, where the value of the stock is determined by market forces rather than the whims of a company's leadership.","131":"I see what you mean about the analogy, and it's a valid point. Wholesalers are indeed investing in a company's potential for growth and profit, rather than buying a tangible product. A better way to think about it is to consider the concept of ownership and control. When you buy stock in a company, you're essentially buying a claim on a portion of the company's assets and profits. It's not like owning a physical product that you can control or use directly. Instead, you're participating in the company's overall performance and growth.","132":"It's a bit more complicated than that, but basically the particles emitted in radioactive decay have a pretty short range and mostly interact with the electrons in the atom, not the nucleus itself. Think of it like a game of pool: the particles are like the cue ball, and they tend to knock into the electrons, which are like the balls on the table, rather than the nucleus, which is like the bumper on the table. This means that the particles emitted in radioactive decay don't have enough energy to 'upgrade' the atom back into the original state, even if they were to interact with the nucleus. ","133":"That's right \u2013 the extreme conditions in a supernova allow for the fusion of heavier elements. Think of it like a strong magnetic field that keeps the nucleus intact, but if it's disrupted, the nucleus can break apart. The analogy isn't perfect, but it gives you an idea of how the strong nuclear force works.","134":"I see what you mean about the proof by contradiction, and I think I can start to see why Cantor's diagonalization argument is a form of that. But I'm still struggling to understand how it applies to the specific problem of listing all real numbers. Can you help me connect the dots between the general concept of proof by contradiction and the more technical details of Cantor's argument?","135":"You're assuming that the only way to generate a list containing all the numbers is to add numbers to the list one by one, but what if there's a way to generate the list that's inherently more efficient or scalable, or one that takes advantage of a different mathematical structure or property?","136":null,"137":"I understand that you're skeptical, but let's break down the potential consequences of desalination. For instance, it can disrupt marine ecosystems, harm local wildlife, and even affect the global climate. I'm not asking you to take my word for it, but to consider the scientific evidence and the perspectives of experts in the field. Can we discuss this further and explore the possibilities of mitigating these effects?","138":"I think we've established that you're frustrated with the conversation, but could you help me understand what specifically is causing the issue and how I can improve the discussion?","139":"I'd love to explain the abortion debate in a more nuanced way. To start, let's break down the core issue: the right to bodily autonomy versus the right to life. The debate often revolves around these two conflicting values. Can you help me understand which aspect of the debate you're most interested in exploring, such as the role of religion, the impact on women's health, or the ethical implications of restricting access to abortion?","140":"I'm not sure what's going on here, but it seems like you're suggesting that I'm being dishonest about not seeing any facts related to environmental changes. Can you clarify what you're getting at?","141":"I think what the term suggests is that the Devil's Advocate is meant to represent the opposing viewpoint, not necessarily the Devil's viewpoint, but the one that might be unpopular or counter to the majority opinion, so that the decision-makers can consider all sides before making a decision.","142":"I think that's a great point. The Devil's Advocate role is more about presenting alternative perspectives and challenging assumptions, rather than necessarily advocating for a particular side or entity. It's about encouraging critical thinking and exploring different possibilities, even if they're uncomfortable or unpopular.","143":"Analog circuits don't really work with the idea of '1s and 0s' because they're more about continuous signals, like the volume on a radio. Think of it like a dimmer switch - it's not just on or off, but a range of brightness levels. This is in contrast to digital circuits, which are more like a light switch, where it's either fully on or fully off. The '1s and 0s' concept is really a human convenience for working with digital circuits, not something that's inherent to the circuit itself. It's a way of simplifying the complex signals that are transmitted through digital circuits, but it doesn't apply to analog circuits in the same way.","144":"I'm still unclear about how M is supposed to work. If it can see the entire program from the start, doesn't that mean it would know whether the program halts or runs indefinitely, making the scenario unnecessary? I feel like I'm missing a crucial aspect of this thought experiment.","145":"The 'no true Scotsman' fallacy is a type of ad hoc reasoning, where someone adjusts their definition of a group or category to exclude counterexamples. It's a way to avoid acknowledging that your perspective might be biased or limited, by redefining the terms to fit your argument. For example, if someone says 'no true Scotsman would eat haggis with pineapple,' and you respond by saying 'well, that's not a true Scotsman,' you're essentially moving the goalposts to avoid a legitimate criticism.","146":"I think the key difference is that in your example, people are trying to sound smart by making up requirements, whereas in my example, people are simply making stuff up without any consideration for what's actually true.","147":"So, you're asking if Walmart could deny a union-like proposal, even if it's not officially called a union. That's a clever question. The answer is still no, they could still deny it. The NLRA doesn't care what you call it - if it's a majority of employees signing up for a collective bargaining agreement, it's a union. And if it's not a majority, then it's not a union. It's not about the name, it's about the substance. And if Walmart doesn't think it's a union, they can still deny it. But let's be real, if you've got a majority of employees on board, they're going to have to deal with it. It's not about what Walmart wants, it's about what the employees want.","148":"They could still deny it, but it's worth a shot, and it might be a more palatable way for them to say no, rather than a flat-out denial of a union.","149":"A single Walmart store can unionize if a majority of its employees sign in support of unionization.","150":"A period is like a body's way of cleaning out, preparing for a potential pregnancy. When it happens, you might see some blood coming out. It's not because you're sick or hurt, but because your body is just getting rid of some extra tissue. It's a natural process, and it usually happens when you're not expecting it. Imagine your uterus is like a little apartment, and sometimes it gets ready for a guest, but the guest never shows up. So, the body just gets rid of the extra stuff, and that's what you see as a period.","151":"The urethra's angle is one reason why it's more challenging for women to urinate while standing. Unlike men, the urethra is positioned at an angle that makes it difficult to direct the flow downwards when standing upright. This can result in the urine flowing down the leg due to gravity. While it's not impossible to use a urinal, the anatomy of the female body can make it more complicated, and some women may experience issues with spraying or leaking. However, many women are able to manage this with practice and by using devices like urinating devices or by adopting a more comfortable position.","152":"And for guys, it's not just on top, right? You've got it down there too, like on the lower half.","153":"I know it can be overwhelming, but it's normal to feel scared or unsure about what's going to happen. Puberty is a big change, but it's also a natural part of growing up. You'll have a lot of support from your family, friends, and even teachers, who have gone through the same thing themselves. They can help you navigate the changes and answer any questions you might have.","154":"I think that's a great point, and it's actually a common misconception that puberty is less complicated for boys. While it's true that boys' bodies undergo changes during puberty, the emotional and psychological aspects can be just as challenging for them. In fact, many boys struggle with body image issues, anxiety, and feelings of inadequacy during this time. So, it's not just about the physical changes, but also about navigating the emotional ups and downs of growing up. And I'm more than happy to help you with any questions you have, whether it's about the physical changes or the emotional aspects of puberty.","155":"They're using a combination of data collection methods, including tracking your online behavior, browsing history, and interactions on the platform, as well as data from third-party sources, to create a profile of your interests and preferences. However, in your case, it seems like Amazon is leveraging a more advanced form of data collection, possibly using audio recordings or ambient noise to detect conversations about specific products, even when they're not explicitly mentioned in search queries. This technology is still relatively new and might be more common than we think. Can you tell me more about how you think Amazon might have known about the specific LED structure you replaced?","156":"You seem to be implying that my question shows I already have some idea of how they're doing this, but I explicitly said I don't know. Can you clarify why you think that's the case?","157":"I think you might be misunderstanding what I meant by freshman year stuff. It's not about the age or experience level, but rather the level of complexity in the course material. Even if you're in an apprenticeship program, you'd still be expected to understand basic concepts like ligand chemistry.","158":"Well, when we read, our brains use a combination of word recognition, context, and prior knowledge to figure out what the words mean. It's a complex process, but essentially, it's not just about linking words to pictures in our mind. Research suggests that our brains create mental representations of words, which can include visual, auditory, and even tactile elements. These representations are influenced by our past experiences, cultural background, and personal associations. For example, when you hear the word'scissors', you might think of a sharp, cutting action, even if you can't visualize the object itself. This is why people with visual impairments can still understand and use language, and why language is not solely dependent on visual imagery.","159":"I think it's also worth considering that flamboyance can be a spectrum, and people can exhibit different levels of it. Maybe flamboyant isn't the right word, but perhaps we're looking for men who are more expressive, confident, and unapologetically themselves, regardless of societal expectations.","160":"You're venturing into the realm of cosmological metaphysics, where the fabric of time is woven from the intricate dance of particles and fields. The notion of time as we know it is a human construct, a tool to make sense of the universe's unfolding. Our current definition of time, based on the caesium-133 atom's oscillations, is a product of our classical understanding. However, as we delve into the Planck scale, the laws of physics begin to fray, and time becomes an emergent property, a byproduct of the universe's underlying dynamics. It's here that theories like quantum gravity and certain interpretations of string theory come into play, suggesting that time might not be an absolute quantity, but rather a flexible, ever-changing entity, influenced by the interactions of particles and fields. This perspective challenges our conventional understanding of time, inviting us to reconsider its fundamental nature and our place within the grand tapestry of the universe.","161":"In the theory of quantum gravity, Planck time is a fundamental unit of time that represents the time it takes for the universe to evolve by one Planck unit. It's approximately 5.4 \u00d7 10^-44 seconds. This concept is crucial in understanding the behavior of matter and energy at the smallest scales, where quantum mechanics and general relativity meet.","162":"Actually, the concept of photons having no size is a bit more nuanced. In quantum field theory, photons are described as excitations of the electromagnetic field, and they don't really have a definite size or shape. But in certain contexts, like in particle physics experiments, we can think of photons as having a very small, but non-zero, size. It's a bit mind-bending, but it's an interesting area of research!","163":"That's what I love about this theory \u2013 it's like a self-healing mechanism, and that's what makes it work for me!","164":"Ha ha, I'm afraid I'm not responsible for the Taylor Swift earworm, but I do appreciate your preemptive measures to avoid getting stuck - listening to other music is a good start, though research suggests that the more you try to suppress a song, the more it'll stick. Maybe try replacing it with a different catchy tune, or engaging in some physical activity to distract yourself?","165":"I'm not sure what's more impressive, your ability to insult me or your lack of understanding of the topic. Can we have a real conversation about the nature of consciousness and the human experience, rather than resorting to personal attacks and straw man arguments?","166":"You're implying that science has all the answers, but that's not true. Science is a powerful tool, but it's not a magic wand that can explain everything. If you think it can, you're basically on the same level as those who claim the Earth is 6,000 years old \u2013 they're just as deluded as each other. ","167":"I think it's more accurate to say that consciousness is still a topic of ongoing research and debate, and we don't have enough evidence to conclusively explain how it arises from brain activity. It's possible that future discoveries in neuroscience and psychology will shed more light on this question, but for now, it's a mystery that we're still trying to unravel.","168":"It's possible that humans are unique in their delayed sexual maturity because our brain development is closely tied to our social and emotional maturity. In many other mammals, reproductive readiness is more closely linked to physical maturity, whereas in humans, it seems to be more about cognitive and social preparedness. This could be an adaptation to our complex social structures and the need for cooperation and communication in order to survive and thrive.","169":"I'm still having trouble understanding your point. If a 13-year-old girl in a primitive tribe can raise a child with the help of her mother and aunts, isn't that similar to a 13-year-old girl today being able to raise a child with the help of her mother and aunts? If that's the case, then why can't a 13-year-old girl today raise a child on her own, just like the girl in the tribe did?","170":"You're sidestepping the question again, which is that humans are often capable of reproducing before being emotionally and cognitively prepared to raise children, unlike many other mammals who tend to time their reproductive efforts with their ability to provide for offspring.","171":"I don't think I'm being heard, because if I were, I'd be responding to the specific point you're making about the premise being false. You keep shifting the focus away from the biological aspect of the question, which is what I'm trying to address. I'm not trying to steer the conversation away from raising children, but rather, I'm trying to clarify the biological factors that contribute to the question, rather than just dismissing it as a false premise.","172":"It sounds like we're at an impasse, and I'd like to revisit the conversation and try to understand what's causing the disconnect between our perspectives. Can we take a step back and look at the original question and the answers that were provided? I'd like to ask, what specifically do you think is being overlooked or misunderstood in the discussion about the biological and social factors influencing human behavior, particularly in the context of ovulation and childbearing?","173":"I'm not going to continue this conversation further, as it seems we're not going to see eye-to-eye on this topic. I think we've both made our points clear, and it's time to agree to disagree.","174":"Squaring numbers and square roots are actually really useful in real-world situations, like when you're trying to figure out the area of a room or the length of a side of a square. For instance, if you know the length of one side of a room, you can find the area by squaring that length. And if you know the area of a square, you can find the length of its side by taking the square root of the area. It's kind of like having a secret code that helps you solve problems. Plus, it's not just about math - it's also about understanding how things work in the world. Does that make more sense now?","175":"The particles that are released during decay don't have enough energy to interact with the resulting atom in a way that would cause it to go back to its original state. Think of it like a ball rolling down a hill - once it's gone, it can't just climb back up.","176":"That's a great analogy! The idea of atoms snapping together under high pressure and temperature is similar to how those magnets behave when you bring them close together. In fact, the conditions in a supernova are so extreme that they can even overcome the repulsive forces between atoms, allowing them to fuse into heavier elements. It's a mind-blowing process that's still not fully understood, but scientists are working to uncover its secrets.","177":null,"178":"Let's break it down. When we call a subroutine like H(a,b), it's just a function that takes two arguments. If we call it with the same argument twice, like H(a,a), it's still just taking two identical arguments. The subroutine doesn't magically understand 'a(a)' as something special. So if we substitute 'x' in for 'a', we get H(x,x). But now we're left wondering what happens when we call H(x,x). Does it look at the 'x' that's the input, or the 'x' that's the program? That's what I'm trying to get at. I think what's tripping you up is that H(x,x) implies that the input and the program are the same thing, which doesn't make sense. Does that make more sense?","179":"The diagonalization proof is a pretty clever trick.  The key is to show that if we assume the list contains all real numbers, we can use that assumption to find a number that can't be in the list.  It's like trying to put a square peg in a round hole - the more you try to force it, the more you realize it just won't fit.  And that's what the proof does - it shows that the assumption of a complete list is just fundamentally flawed.","180":"You're trying to get at the idea that the proof is somehow dependent on the particular method of generating the list, but the crux of Cantor's diagonalization argument is that it's not about the method of generating the list, it's about the inherent property of the list being incomplete, regardless of how it's constructed. The proof doesn't care about the optimality or suboptimality of the list generation; it simply shows that, given any list of real numbers, you can always find a real number not on the list by constructing a number that differs from each number on the list in at least one digit.","181":"The diagonalization proof isn't just about the process of generating a list, but about the inherent limitations of that process in the face of uncountably infinite real numbers. It's not about finding a better way or optimally generating a list, but about the fundamental property of real numbers that makes it impossible to create a complete list.","182":"Let's not get sidetracked by the banana example. Radioactivity is a serious issue, and we can't just dismiss the risks by saying the concentration is low. Think of it like a slow-moving poison that builds up over time. Just because we can't see it or taste it doesn't mean it's not there, and it's definitely not something to be taken lightly.","183":"The radioactivity in the ocean doesn't get eliminated by dilution, it gets concentrated in the food chain, which is a major concern. The fact that seafood from Fukushima has been deemed safe to eat is a red herring, as the half-life of radioactive isotopes means it takes a long time for them to decay, and the effects of prolonged exposure are still unknown. The key difference between nuclear accidents like Fukushima and Chernobyl is the type of radioactive material released and its persistence in the environment. Chernobyl released a large amount of radioactive iodine, which has a relatively short half-life, whereas Fukushima released more cesium and strontium, which have longer half-lives. This affects the long-term risks and consequences of each accident.","184":"Actually, I think I misunderstood your question. You're right, fires can be a significant threat, and wood houses are more prone to burning than stone houses. That's a good point to consider when thinking about building materials. ","185":"If the fire spreads more slowly, the people have a better chance to escape, and the firefighters have a greater opportunity to contain the blaze, potentially saving lives and property.","186":"I'm not saying that's what happened here, but isn't it a concern that Weinstein's conviction was based on a piece of evidence that was potentially unreliable?","187":"The main point of buying non-dividend shares is that you're essentially betting on the company's future growth. If the company does well and its value increases, you can sell your shares for a profit. It's similar to buying a stock in a startup that might eventually go public or be acquired for a lot of money. You're hoping to get a return on your investment, but it's not a guaranteed income stream like dividends would be.","188":"The value of your shares is intricately linked to the company's growth prospects, its management's strategic decisions, and the overall health of the industry it operates in. By not distributing dividends, the company is essentially reinvesting its profits to fuel further expansion, which can lead to increased value for shareholders in the long run.","189":"Hey, I get that it can be confusing - not all stocks pay dividends, and that's okay. Let's focus on finding the ones that do, and see what works best for you.","190":"I think the key difference lies in the level of control and agency you have as a buyer. With an orchard, you're purchasing a product that has inherent value, but you're also taking on the risk of selling it to a middleman, whereas in an MLM, you're buying a product with no inherent value, and you're essentially buying a promise of future returns, with little to no control over the actual value of the product or the market demand for it.","191":"I'm curious, how do you manage to be so unbothered by the opinions of others? Is that a skill you've developed over time or just a natural part of your personality?","192":"I love your honesty and willingness to share your thoughts! It's refreshing to see people engaging in respectful discussions. I'm curious, what do you think is the most significant challenge in developing a cost-effective method for purifying saltwater? Your insights could be invaluable in this conversation.","193":"When we hear a catchy song, our brain has trouble forgetting it because it's associated with a memory or emotion. It's like a mental loop that replays the song over and over, trying to make sense of why it's so memorable.","194":"I'm a non-musician, so I'm curious - how do you think being a DJ has influenced your relationship with music, especially when it comes to getting songs stuck in your head?","195":"Let's get back to your question. If you travel at 50% of the speed of light, you'll be able to cause some serious damage, but it's not like you'll be able to just slow down your rocket ship once you're close to your destination. The problem is that as you slow down, your mass increases, and that makes it harder to slow down even more. It's like trying to stop a car that's going too fast - you need to apply the brakes gradually, or you'll skid or even crash. With a spacecraft, it's the same thing, but instead of brakes, you need to use engines to slow down, and that's a lot harder to do than it sounds. So, to answer your question, it's not that the engines can't die down, it's just that it's really hard to slow down a spacecraft safely once you're going that fast.","196":"Because the problem is not just the speed, it's the energy and the momentum, you can't just turn off the engines, you have to bleed off that energy somehow, and that's really hard to do, especially when you're traveling at relativistic speeds. Think of it like a train that's been traveling at high speed for a long time, it can't just suddenly stop on a dime, it needs to gradually slow down over a long distance, and the same thing applies to a relativistic spacecraft. The key is to design a deceleration system that can handle the immense energy and momentum of the spacecraft, and that's a significant technological challenge.","197":"That's a great point, and it's actually a result of the balance between the processes you mentioned - the downward pull of gravity and the upward forces of low air pressure and the Earth's rotation. If the atmosphere were to stratify by molecular mass, it would lead to a significant increase in temperature and pressure at the surface, making it difficult for life as we know it to thrive. The current well-mixed state of the atmosphere allows for a relatively stable climate, which is crucial for life. But I'm curious, what do you think would happen if the atmosphere were to suddenly stratify by molecular mass? Would it have any significant effects on our daily lives or the planet as a whole?","198":"We don't suffocate from CO2 at ground level because there's just not that much of it in the air compared to the other gases. So it doesn't make the air heavy enough to separate out.","199":"That's a great point, and it's actually a topic of ongoing debate in cognitive science. Some researchers argue that our brains do create mental images when we read, but these images are more like sketches or prototypes rather than precise, photorealistic pictures. Others propose that our understanding of language is more distributed, involving a network of associations and connections between different concepts and ideas. But I'm curious, how do you think this relates to your idea that attributes of an object are linked to its name? Do you think that's a key factor in how we learn and understand new words?","200":"Because in analog circuits, the transistor acts as a variable resistor, controlling the current flowing through it in response to the voltage at the Gate, but it can't completely shut off the current, whereas digital transistors act as switches, allowing for a clear distinction between 0 and 1.","201":"Analog signals can represent real-world phenomena with varying intensities or frequencies, like sound waves with different volumes or light waves with different colors. They can't be reduced to simple on\/off or high\/low states, but rather exist on a continuous spectrum. Think of it like a radio dial - you can tune in to different stations with distinct frequencies and volumes, rather than just switching between two binary options.","202":"The effects of wasting water can be far-reaching, affecting not just local communities but also the global water cycle, leading to droughts, reduced water quality, and changes in climate patterns. For example, when we waste water, it can reduce the amount of water available for irrigation, leading to crop failures and food shortages. It can also lead to the contamination of water sources, affecting human health and the environment. Additionally, the energy required to treat and transport wastewater can contribute to greenhouse gas emissions, exacerbating climate change.","203":"I'd rather not get into a debate about the hypothetical effects of purifying salt water. Can we focus on the practical challenges of making it happen? What kind of technology would be required to remove salt from seawater on a large scale, and how feasible is it?","204":"I think we're getting off track here. Can we focus on the discussion at hand and the suggestions made by u\/already-taken-wtf? What do you think about their idea?","205":"I understand you're frustrated with the mods' decision, and it's understandable that you'd like a clearer explanation. However, the mods' decision was based on their interpretation of the platform's rules, and it's not necessarily about the quality of the question itself.","206":"I understand that you're frustrated with the previous explanations, and I'd be happy to try and provide a clearer answer that addresses your concerns.","207":"I understand that you're frustrated with the lack of answers and the dismissal. However, I'd like to clarify that my previous explanation was an attempt to outline the process and requirements for our tutoring sessions, rather than providing a specific answer to your question. Can you help me understand what specific information you're looking for, so I can better assist you?","208":"It acts like a barrier, basically keeping the warm air from escaping in winter and the cool air from getting in, so it helps keep your house cozy and comfortable.","209":"That's right, it would block out the heat, but it would also make it darker inside, so it's not a great solution for summer.","210":"Yeah, it's like a big, artificial greenhouse effect. The plastic keeps the heat in during the winter and keeps it out during the summer.","211":"Constantine's vision before the Battle of Milvian Bridge in 312 AD is often credited with his conversion to Christianity. He saw a cross with the words 'In Hoc Signo Vinces', which means 'In this sign, you will conquer.' This vision allegedly inspired him to use the cross as his battle standard, which led to his victory. This event marked a significant turning point in the spread of Christianity.","212":"So, to answer your question, it's a bit of a complex process, but I'll try to break it down for you. The Edict of Milan in 313 AD was a game-changer. It allowed Christians to practice their faith openly, which led to a huge surge in conversions. But what really fueled Christianity's growth was the sense of community and belonging it offered. People were drawn to it because it provided a sense of purpose and unity during a really tumultuous time in the Roman Empire. It was a time of civil wars, economic troubles, and external threats, and Christianity offered a beacon of hope. Plus, Constantine's own conversion and eventual rise to power didn't hurt, either!","213":"I understand that you're frustrated, but it seems like we're not on the same page. Can you tell me more about what you're trying to achieve or what you hope to get out of this conversation? I'm here to help, and I want to make sure I'm providing the right kind of support. If I'm being honest, I'm a bit curious about what's going on and why you're feeling so strongly about this. Can we start fresh and see if we can find a way to work together?","214":"I'm not sure I understand what you mean by 'filtering out your saltiness.' Are you suggesting that we could somehow separate the negative aspects of your personality from the rest of your views on desalination? Or is there another way you're thinking about this that I'm not catching?","215":null,"216":"I'm curious, though - what do you think would be the most effective way to implement those measures, and what kind of support or resources would be needed to make it happen?","217":"I appreciate your skepticism, but I'd like to clarify that I'm not advocating for a simplistic solution. I'm actually suggesting that we consider the potential of methane harvesting as a component of a larger strategy to mitigate climate change. I'd like to see more research and investment in this area, as it could potentially provide a significant reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. However, I agree that it's not a silver bullet, and we need to address the root causes of the problem, including deforestation, overconsumption, and pollution. Can we explore this idea further and examine the possibilities and limitations of methane harvesting in the context of a comprehensive climate action plan?","218":"So, let's take a step back and imagine we're having a conversation with a curious 5-year-old. You're proposing a massive project to cover millions of square miles of the arctic tundra with vacuum tubes to capture methane gas. That's a pretty wild idea! Can you tell me more about why you think this could work, and what you hope to achieve with it? I'm genuinely curious to understand your perspective, and I'm happy to listen and learn from you.","219":"I see what you mean about the entitled attitude, but I think we're getting off track here. Can we talk more about the original topic, which is your reaction to being called a Republican? What's behind your strong response to that label?","220":"You're trying to deflect from the fact that you used a label to try to shame me for something I didn't say, and then acted like it was a clever point when it was just a cheap shot.","221":"I'd say that's a pretty unlikely scenario, but I'm sure there are lawyers with afros out there who are perfectly capable of doing their jobs.","222":"I'm starting to wonder if we're having a bit of a game going on here.","223":"Full metal jacket ammo, also known as FMJ, is a type of bullet that's designed to penetrate deep into a target without expanding or deforming. It's typically used for hunting large game or for military purposes, where the goal is to incapacitate the target quickly and efficiently. Unlike normal ammo, which is designed to expand upon impact and transfer energy to the target, FMJ ammo is made with a jacket of metal that completely covers the lead core, allowing it to maintain its shape and travel deeper into the target. This makes it more suitable for situations where a clean pass-through is desired, such as when hunting or in self-defense situations.","224":"Alcoholism is considered a disease because it's a complex interplay between biology, environment, and behavior. Think of it like a three-legged stool: if one leg is wobbly, the whole thing falls. In the case of alcoholism, the legs are brain chemistry, family history, and life experiences. It's not just about willpower or moral failing, but about a deeply ingrained pattern that's hard to break. That's why treatment often involves a combination of therapy, support groups, and medication to help people regain control over their drinking.","225":"They're called the Noble Gases because they don't readily react with other elements, much like how nobility was historically seen as unapproachable and separate from common society. The term 'Noble' in this context actually predates the Buddhist concept of nobility, and is rooted in the early days of chemistry when these elements were first discovered. Their chemical inertness was seen as a unique property that set them apart from other elements, much like how nobles were seen as being above the common folk.","226":"Actually, the universe is getting heavier on average as time goes on because heavier elements are being created in stars and supernovae. Even though lead decays into something lighter, the overall average atomic mass of the universe is increasing, but at a very slow rate.","227":"New elements can be created artificially in particle accelerators, and naturally in supernovae, where a few elements like Technetium and Promethium are formed. We can create a range of elements artificially, but the number is still limited to around 100-150. The heaviest artificially created element is Oganesson, with an atomic number of 118. However, creating and studying these heavy elements becomes increasingly difficult as their half-lives decrease dramatically. So, while we can create new elements, the number of them is still relatively small compared to the overall number of elements that exist.","228":"That's an interesting point. Employers might try to offset the increased FICA taxes by reducing other benefits or wages, but this would depend on the specifics of their compensation packages and the state of their finances. Additionally, if employers are already offering private health coverage as a benefit, it's likely that they're doing so because it's a competitive advantage in the job market. If they were to cut this benefit, they might need to offer other perks or higher wages to remain competitive, which could offset the savings from the reduced FICA taxes.","229":"That's a valid point, but the existing research suggests that the cost savings from eliminating private insurance middlemen would be substantial, and could potentially offset the inefficiencies of government provision, especially if the government were to adopt more streamlined and efficient administrative systems.","230":"They contribute to economic growth, but their wealth can also exacerbate income inequality and lead to negative social consequences, such as gentrification and reduced social mobility, which can have a disproportionate impact on lower-income communities.","231":"The term 'noble gases' actually comes from the fact that they were discovered after the other elements in the periodic table, and were considered to be of a higher 'nobility' or status. It's a historical reference, not related to the Buddhist concept of nobility. They're called noble gases because they were discovered later and were considered to be more'refined' or 'pure' compared to the other elements.","232":"If radon decays into something else, the next stable isotope in the decay chain would likely be lead, given the pattern we've observed with uranium decaying into lead or thorium.","233":null,"234":"It's unlikely that we'll see a 9th row in the periodic table because the heaviest elements known so far, like the ones on the 7th row, have extremely short half-lives and decay almost instantly, and we still have many elements to discover on the 8th row before we can even consider moving to the 9th row.","235":"I'd say it's unlikely we'll see a 9th row in the near future, given the significant time it took to discover the remaining elements in the 7th row and the challenges associated with creating and detecting highly unstable isotopes.","236":"I have a Ph.D. in physics and I've spent years studying the properties of superheavy elements, including their synthesis, decay patterns, and theoretical predictions. I've also collaborated with researchers who have successfully synthesized new elements, and we've discussed the challenges and limitations of pushing the boundaries of the periodic table. Furthermore, I've had the opportunity to review and analyze the experimental data from various research groups working on superheavy element discovery, which has given me a deeper understanding of the current state of knowledge in this field.","237":"I'm starting to wonder if we're just talking past each other - you're convinced that skipping gears is wrong, and I'm not seeing any evidence to support that claim. Can we try to break down what you think is the 'right' way to shift gears, and why you think it's superior to skipping gears?","238":"I'm not disputing the fact that many sources say it's okay to skip gears, but isn't the real question about whether it's the most efficient way to drive, considering factors like fuel consumption and wear on the transmission?","239":"I'd love to explore why you think skipping gears might be a bad idea. Can you walk me through what you've learned from your engineer, motoring journalists, and driving instructor that suggests it's not worth skipping gears?","240":"I think what I was trying to say is that our current system still seems to be rooted in the old understanding of money, and it's taking us a while to fully adapt to the digital reality that Ben Bernanke described.","241":"Because the ocean is a complex ecosystem that supports a vast array of marine life, and dumping radioactive waste into it could contaminate the food chain and have devastating effects on the environment. Moreover, the ocean's currents and circulation patterns make it difficult to predict the long-term fate of the waste, and it could potentially affect coastal communities and ecosystems far from the initial dump site. A more effective approach to nuclear waste disposal would be to design and implement safe, secure, and sustainable storage facilities on land, such as the ones being developed in Finland, Australia, and the United States, which take into account the geology, hydrology, and environmental concerns of the site.","242":"That's a great point, but what do you mean by 'the process is more complex than that'? How do politics and science intersect in this decision-making process, and what are some of the key factors that come into play?","243":"Non-dividend shares are often seen as a way to participate in the growth of a company, even if it doesn't distribute dividends. This is because, as a shareholder, you have a claim on the company's assets and profits, and you can potentially benefit from the company's growth in the long term, even if it doesn't pay out dividends immediately. For example, if the company is acquired or goes public, the value of your shares could increase significantly, providing a potential exit strategy or a way to realize your investment. Additionally, non-dividend shares can be a way for companies to retain more of their profits and reinvest them in the business, which can lead to further growth and potentially higher returns for shareholders in the long run.","244":"The value of shares lies in their potential to increase in value over time, driven by the company's growth and success. When a company reinvests its profits into the business, it can lead to increased efficiency, innovation, and market share, ultimately driving up the value of shares. This is why some companies choose not to pay dividends, instead using the funds to fuel their growth and expansion, which can lead to higher returns for shareholders in the long run.","245":"But isn't the goose analogy more accurate if we consider it as a metaphor for a complex business entity, rather than a literal goose? In that case, the performance of the goose \u2013 or the company \u2013 would be reflected in the dividends it distributes, and shareholders would have a say in how the company is run through their voting power. It's not about having control over individual shares, but about having a say in the overall direction of the company.","246":"The board of directors' decision to prioritize dividend payments is often a trade-off between short-term gains and long-term sustainability. By reinvesting profits, companies can potentially increase their value and growth prospects, but this approach also requires a high degree of confidence in the company's future performance. If a company's growth prospects are uncertain, it may be more prudent to distribute dividends to shareholders, providing them with a more stable return on investment. This decision is indeed influenced by the board's fiduciary duty, but it's also a complex balancing act that requires careful consideration of various factors, including the company's financial health, market conditions, and shareholder expectations.","247":"IPOs involve a company issuing shares to the public for the first time, which is a one-time event. In contrast, MLMs involve buying a product with the intention of reselling it, and the value of that product is not necessarily tied to the company's financial performance. With Ponzi schemes, the key difference is that they're unsustainable and rely on continuous recruitment to pay off earlier investors, whereas a company's stock price can fluctuate based on market conditions, but it's not a Ponzi scheme. Furthermore, a company's stock price is influenced by a variety of factors, including its financial performance, industry trends, and market sentiment, which is not the case with MLMs. Let's focus on the key differences between wholesalers and MLMs, such as the nature of the products being sold and the level of competition in each industry.","248":"When I buy apples directly from an orchard, I'm taking a risk that they'll sell well to the grocery stores, but at least I still have control over what happens to the apples themselves \u2013 I can eat them, give them away, or store them. With stocks, I don't have that same control over the company.","249":"You're misunderstanding the point I'm trying to make. With stocks, you're essentially betting on the performance of a company, whereas with tangible goods like apples or bolts, you have a more concrete understanding of their value. It's not about control, but about the nature of the investment itself.","250":"Well, computers start with tiny switches called transistors. These switches are super important because they can turn on and off really fast. In the past, computers used big, heavy vacuum tubes, but transistors are way smaller and more reliable. A transistor has three parts: the Source, the Drain, and the Gate. Think of the Gate like a tiny valve that lets current flow between the Source and the Drain. When there's no power to the Gate, the current is blocked, and the transistor is off. When there's power, the transistor is on, and current flows. That's the basic idea of how computers work, and it's how we get from 0 to 1.","251":"So, think of it like music - an analog signal is like a beautiful piano melody with all the nuances of pitch and volume, while a digital signal is like a simple piano note that's either on or off. Does that help clarify things?","252":"You buy non-dividend shares when you think the company has growth potential and will increase its profits in the future, so you're hoping to sell your shares at a higher price than you bought them for.","253":"Let's break it down: when you buy a share, you're essentially buying a tiny piece of the company. You're not just buying a promise of future profits, but a real part of the business. If the company makes a lot of money, the value of your share goes up. It's like if you owned a small part of a restaurant and it started making a lot of money, your share of the restaurant would be worth more. The fact that you don't get dividends doesn't change the fact that you own a piece of the company. Does that make sense?","254":"I think that's a fair point. It's like buying into a system where you either have some power or you're just along for the ride. Dividend shares feel more like a shared ownership experience, whereas non-dividend shares are more of a bet on the company's future.","255":"Time is a concept that we use to make sense of the sequence of events, but it's not an inherent feature of the universe. In essence, time is what we call the change in the state of the universe, but it's not an independent entity. It's more like a dimension that helps us understand how the universe evolves over space and matter. So, if we imagine a universe without time, it's not that the universe is static, but rather that the concept of time is not applicable in the way we're used to. This perspective is often explored in theoretical frameworks such as eternalism, which posits that all moments in time exist simultaneously, and the block universe theory, which suggests that time is an emergent property of the universe. By considering these ideas, we can gain a deeper understanding of the nature of time and its relationship to the universe.","256":"Planck time is a unit of time that is used to express the time it takes for a photon to travel a distance equal to the Planck length. It's approximately 5.4 x 10^-44 seconds, and it helps us understand the smallest units of time and space. It's not directly related to the creation of black holes, but rather a way to describe the scale at which quantum gravity becomes significant.","257":"Photons don't have a definite size, but their wavelength can be thought of as a measure of their size. In fact, the wavelength of a photon is inversely proportional to its energy, so as the energy of the photon increases, its wavelength decreases. This is an important concept in understanding how black holes work, because the energy of the photons that are emitted by a black hole is directly related to its temperature, which in turn is related to its size.","258":"A period is when your body releases a bit of blood from your uterus, which is a sign that your reproductive system is preparing for a potential pregnancy. It's a natural process that happens when your body isn't supporting a growing embryo, and it's a normal part of being a woman. It's like a check-in to make sure everything is working as it should.","259":"I think it's because girls' bodies undergo a lot more changes during puberty, and those changes can be really unpredictable. For example, some girls experience super heavy or irregular periods, while others might have acne or hair growth in unwanted places. Boys, on the other hand, tend to experience more straightforward physical changes, like growing taller and developing facial hair. Additionally, society places a lot of emphasis on girls' appearance and behavior, which can make it harder for them to navigate these changes without feeling self-conscious or ashamed. It's like, girls are expected to be perfect and in control, while boys are often given more freedom to make mistakes and figure things out as they go.","260":"A plane flies on the bottom of the globe because it generates lift, which is the upward force that opposes the weight of the plane. This lift is created by the wings of the plane, which are designed to produce a difference in air pressure above and below the wing. As the plane moves forward, the air flows over and under the wing, creating an area of lower pressure above the wing and an area of higher pressure below it. This pressure difference creates an upward force, or lift, that counteracts the weight of the plane and allows it to fly. However, the concept of a plane flying 'on the bottom of the globe' is a bit misleading, as it's the plane's wings that are generating lift, not the plane itself being attached to the earth's surface. Think of it more like the plane is suspended in mid-air, with the wings creating the lift that keeps it aloft. This is why, if you were to watch a plane flying from space, it would appear to be flying level, not upside down, regardless of the direction it's heading in.","261":"That's right, but what's really interesting is how our brains interpret what we see from up there, and how it challenges our usual sense of up and down.","262":"That's a clever point, but what I meant to say is that pointing out Android's security issues in response to Apple's is a classic example of whataboutism, which is a fallacious argumentative strategy.","263":"If we implement a single-payer system, wouldn't the increased government involvement lead to potential inefficiencies and cost overruns, rather than reducing costs?","264":"While removing the private insurance middlemen might seem like a cost-saver, there are several reasons to believe that a single-payer system could lead to increased costs. For one, the government would need to create its own administrative infrastructure, which could be costly and inefficient. Additionally, the lack of competition in a single-payer system could lead to a lack of innovation and a failure to adopt cost-saving technologies. Furthermore, the government's tendency to over-regulate and over-spend on certain programs has been well-documented, which could exacerbate the problem. Therefore, it's not clear that a single-payer system would necessarily lead to lower costs.","265":"You\u2019re thinking of stocks as a claim on a company\u2019s future profits, rather than a physical commodity. This means that the value of a stock is tied to the company\u2019s potential for growth, innovation, and profitability, rather than its physical assets or products. This is in contrast to commodities like food or water, which have intrinsic value due to their utility and scarcity. Additionally, the value of a stock can fluctuate based on market sentiment and investor expectations, making it a more abstract and intangible asset. This is why buying non-dividend shares can be seen as a bet on the company\u2019s future prospects, rather than a safe investment with a guaranteed return.","266":"Let's focus on the concept of intrinsic value in the context of wholesalers. You're right that owning a stock doesn't give you direct control over the underlying assets, but that's where the value lies \u2013 in the potential for returns on investment, rather than the physical goods themselves. Think of it like a dividend-paying stock: you're essentially earning a share of the company's profits, without having to manage the day-to-day operations.","267":"You're overlooking the significant differences in risk profiles between buying apples directly from an orchard and participating in multi-level marketing. While buying apples does come with financial risks, such as spoilage or market fluctuations, the primary concern in MLMs is the reputational and relational damage that can result from failed business ventures, which can have long-lasting consequences for one's professional and personal network.","268":"Alcoholism is often characterized as a disease because it involves changes in the brain's chemistry and function, particularly in the reward system and stress response. This can lead to compulsive drinking behavior, even in the face of negative consequences. It's not just a matter of personal choice, but rather a complex interplay of genetic, environmental, and psychological factors. By recognizing it as a disease, we can approach treatment with a more nuanced understanding and a greater sense of compassion.","269":null,"270":"But what I'm trying to say is that addiction is a complex issue, and just labeling it as a disease doesn't necessarily simplify things. I mean, if we say addiction is a disease, then what does that even mean? Are we saying that people who are addicted have a genetic predisposition to it? Or are we saying that it's a result of environmental factors, like trauma or socioeconomic status? And how do we treat it if it's a disease? With medication? Therapy? What's the cure?","271":"I'm not sure I follow your question, could you help me understand what you mean by 'why is the Nazi Party considered far-right' and how you think that relates to its name and ideology?","272":"You're trying to shift the focus away from the actual issue at hand, which is the quality of your question and the validity of my response. Instead, you're resorting to personal attacks and trying to belittle me with condescending language.","273":"I'm intrigued by your question - what do you think might be holding back some straight men from expressing themselves in a more flamboyant way, despite societal norms allowing for more fluidity in expression?","274":"You're comparing Narcoanalysis tests to battery acid and grass, but let's focus on the actual topic. Narcoanalysis tests are a method of interrogation that uses chemical analysis of a person's urine, blood, or other bodily fluids to detect the presence of narcotics or other substances. They're used to gather information from suspects, but their reliability and admissibility in court are often questioned. I think you were trying to make a point about the efficiency of different methods, but let's explore that idea further. Can you clarify what you mean by 'cosmetic' and how it relates to Narcoanalysis tests or their efficiency?","275":"I think it's because it's a formative period where people are navigating the transition from adolescence to adulthood, and the relationships they form during this time can have a profound impact on their sense of identity, belonging, and purpose. It's a time of exploration, experimentation, and self-discovery, where people are trying to figure out who they are, what they believe in, and where they fit in the world. The connections they make with their peers can be particularly meaningful because they're often away from their family and social networks, and are seeking a sense of community and belonging. Additionally, the experiences and relationships they have during this time can shape their values, interests, and passions, and influence their future goals and aspirations.","276":"That's a good way to put it - the institution can become a kind of symbol or representation of the people and experiences you had there, and people often attach emotional value to it because of those connections.","277":"I think that's a valid point. The emotional connection people have to their school is complex and multifaceted, encompassing not just personal relationships but also a sense of belonging, shared experiences, and collective identity. It's this broader cultural context that can make it challenging to distinguish between the two, as they're deeply intertwined. Does that resonate with you?","278":"I think you're misunderstanding the point I was trying to make. The value of money isn't just about the physical act of printing or deleting it, but also about the trust and faith that people have in it. That's what gives it value, not just the numbers on a spreadsheet.","279":"That's a very good question, and it's actually a bit tricky. Genes function by being sequences of nucleotides that bind to proteins, which then go on to do various things in the cell. It's not really about 'knowing' what to do, but rather about the physical interactions between molecules. Think of it like a recipe - the ingredients (nucleotides) combine in a certain way to produce a certain product (protein), which then goes on to do its job in the cell. But instead of a chef following a recipe, the molecules are just reacting with each other according to their chemical properties. It's more like a chemical reaction, where the DNA sequence acts as a template for the protein synthesis, and the outcome is determined by the physical laws of chemistry and biology, rather than any sort of 'code' or 'instructions' in the classical sense.","280":"But isn't the combination of chemicals in DNA predetermined by the process of evolution itself? And isn't the fact that the offspring copy the DNA correctly most of the time a result of natural selection? If that's the case, then isn't the outcome of the chemical reactions more like a predictable pattern that emerges from the process, rather than a predetermined code?","281":"Actually, I'd say it's even more specific than that. What would be the exact sequence of biochemical reactions that would need to occur for an apple seed to grow into an orange tree, and what would be the genetic mutations required to make that happen?","282":"Actually, I think you're getting at the idea that animal agriculture takes up a huge amount of land, which is a key point. To add to that, it's not just the land itself that's the issue, but also the resources needed to produce and transport the feed for those animals, like water and fossil fuels. And on top of that, the livestock industry is a major driver of deforestation and habitat destruction. So, when we choose plant-based options, we're not only reducing our carbon footprint, but also helping to preserve biodiversity and protect ecosystems. That's a really important connection to make.","283":"I think what you're getting at is that when we share our perspectives, it's not necessarily about feeling superior, but about connecting with others and maybe even learning from them.","284":"You're misunderstanding the concept. The value of non-dividend shares lies in their potential for long-term growth, rather than any immediate returns. When a company is growing rapidly, its stock price can appreciate significantly, even if it doesn't distribute dividends. This is because investors are willing to pay a premium for a stake in a successful business with a bright future. Think of it like investing in a startup that might one day become a giant. You're not getting a dividend check today, but you're betting on the company's potential to become a market leader and increase in value exponentially.","285":"Well, the prospect of eventual dividends is one thing, but it's not the only factor at play here. Intrinsic value, or perceived value, is also crucial. If a stock has no dividend-paying potential, then its value comes from the underlying assets of the company. Think of it like owning a piece of a company that has valuable real estate, equipment, or cash reserves. That's where the value lies, not just in the scarcity of the stock itself.","286":"When you buy a stock, you're essentially buying a small piece of a company, and when you sell it, you're selling that piece of ownership for a profit. Think of it like selling a piece of a house you own, rather than the entire house itself.","287":"The value of ownership in a company like Amazon isn't solely determined by its immediate financial returns, but rather by its potential for long-term growth and expansion. Amazon's ability to reinvest its profits into new initiatives, such as expanding its logistics network and services, is a key factor in increasing the value of its shares. This strategy allows the company to maintain a competitive edge and create new opportunities for its customers, ultimately making its ownership more valuable.","288":"Think of it like this: if no one's buying shares, the company doesn't have to give out dividends. It's like the company is saying, 'Hey, we've made some money, but we're not going to share it with anyone right now.' The value of the shares comes from the idea that the company will make even more money in the future, not from what it's making today. So, if Jeff Bezos doesn't sell his shares, he's not getting any extra money beyond his actual salary, because the company isn't making any extra profits that it needs to share.","289":"I'm saying that having an afro isn't inherently a problem, but if someone's history shows they're difficult to work with, that's a red flag, regardless of what they look like.","290":"The concept of self-replication in viruses and living organisms can be understood through the lens of evolutionary theory and the principles of molecular biology. Viruses, for instance, have evolved to hijack the host cell's machinery to replicate themselves, leveraging the complex interactions between the host's genetic material and the viral genome. This process allows viruses to adapt and evolve rapidly, often with devastating consequences for the host. In essence, the tendency of viruses to self-replicate is not a direct result of a universal drive towards disorder and entropy, but rather a byproduct of their evolutionary history and their ability to exploit the complex systems they infect. By focusing on the molecular mechanisms underlying self-replication, we can gain a deeper understanding of the intricate relationships between viruses, their hosts, and the environment in which they interact.","291":"I think I got a bit carried away with the sciency stuff. Let me try that again in a way that's a bit more straightforward. Imagine you're playing with Legos, and you start with just a few simple blocks. Over time, you keep adding more blocks and building new things with them. That's kind of like how the Earth's chemistry evolved \u2013 it started with simple things like water and rocks, and then they combined to make more complex things, like molecules, and eventually, life. Does that make more sense? ","292":"I'd be happy to share my perspective on why skipping gears might not be the best approach. Let's take a closer look at the potential benefits and drawbacks.","293":"I think it's unfair to jump to conclusions about the mods' intentions without hearing their side of the story.","294":"I understand your frustration and skepticism, but let's break down the removal reasons together. What specific aspect of the explanations do you think was unclear or unhelpful? Perhaps we can reframe the information in a way that's more accessible and relevant to your concerns.","295":null,"296":"So, think of it like this: when you're running a business, you've got costs, like rent and utilities. Those aren't profits - they're just things you've gotta pay for to keep the doors open. And when you're filing your taxes, you can write those costs off, so they don't get counted as part of your profit. It's not like the money for those costs is coming from your profits - it's just a separate thing.","297":"The concept of cause and effect is a human way of understanding the world, and it might not apply to the universe's origins. Think of it like asking what came before the first moment of time \u2013 our language and minds aren't equipped to handle that kind of question.","298":"I see what you mean about the causality conundrum. It's like, if we're talking about a timeline, there's no 'before' to speak of. It's more like a seamless, unbroken thread, and we're just trying to grasp it from our limited human perspective.","299":"I think that's the beauty of it \u2013 it's a mystery that's hard to grasp, and it's okay if it doesn't quite add up in your head. It's more about embracing the uncertainty and the complexity of it all, rather than trying to pin it down with a clear explanation.","300":"It's worth noting that engine braking and skipping gears require a level of muscle memory and practice to execute smoothly, especially when driving a new car. While it's great that you've developed this skill over time, it might not be as intuitive for everyone, including those who learn to drive with an automatic transmission. Additionally, the benefits of engine braking and skipping gears are more pronounced in specific driving scenarios, such as when descending steep hills or navigating tight corners. In these situations, the ability to smoothly transition between gears can make a noticeable difference in terms of control and safety.","301":"I think I see what you're getting at now. The ARM processor's unique design, particularly in its use of out-of-order execution and a more efficient memory hierarchy, allows it to achieve better performance per watt. This, combined with its lower power consumption, makes it easier to cool. In contrast, the x86-x64 architecture tends to be more power-hungry and generate more heat. The difference in cooling efficiency is also partly due to the fact that ARM processors are often designed for mobile and embedded systems, where size and weight are critical factors. As a result, designers have had to prioritize power efficiency and thermal management from the outset. Does that make sense?","302":"Well, in many cultures, it\u2019s considered impolite to discuss your salary with your colleagues or superiors because it can create tension and lead to envy or resentment among others. However, this taboo may be rooted in the fact that discussing wages can reveal disparities in pay that might not be publicly acknowledged or addressed. This can be particularly problematic in workplaces where there are significant power imbalances, such as between management and employees, or where there are systemic inequalities based on factors like age, gender, or race. In your case, the age range you\u2019ve observed suggests that there may be some underlying issues related to pay equity that need to be addressed.","303":"I've had similar experiences trying to unionize, and it's often been a delicate balancing act. I think employers are hesitant to let employees organize because it would require them to pay a living wage, but it's not just about the money \u2013 it's also about maintaining control and avoiding accountability. It's like they're trying to keep workers in the dark about their rights and the value they bring to the company. Am I reading this situation correctly?","304":"Yeah, some workplaces can be pretty rough. But kudos to you for taking the initiative to learn about your rights - that's always a good idea, no matter where you work!","305":"While it's true that the brain plays a significant role in processing and experiencing sexual urges, the relationship between genitalia and sex drive is more complex. The removal of genitalia, also known as castration, can indeed reduce or alter the nature of sexual urges, but it doesn't necessarily eliminate them. This is because the brain's response to sexual stimuli is influenced by a multitude of factors, including hormones, emotions, and past experiences. In the case of men, testosterone, which is produced in the testes, does play a role in regulating sex drive, but it's not the only factor at play. The brain's interpretation of sensory information, including visual and tactile stimuli, also contributes to the experience of sexual arousal. It's a bit like trying to pinpoint the exact source of a melody - while one instrument may be the primary note, the overall sound is created by the harmonious combination of many different elements.","306":"In fact, the testicles are often colloquially referred to as the \"balls,\" which is a nod to their physical location in the scrotum, a sac-like structure that houses the testicles and plays a crucial role in regulating their temperature, which is essential for sperm production.","307":"Yeah, it's fascinating stuff, and I'm glad I could help spark your interest in it. You might be surprised at how common castration as a form of punishment was in various cultures throughout history.","308":"That's an interesting point! So you think other metals could have been used instead of gold? What do you think would have made them a good choice?","309":"I see what you mean about coins being exchanged for change, but a central Fiat currency is actually a system where a country's government issues a currency that's not backed by a physical commodity like gold, and it's accepted as a medium of exchange because of the government's guarantee. It's like a social contract, where people trust that the currency has value because of the government's promise, rather than because of any inherent value in the physical material itself. Does that make more sense?","310":"I'm really fascinated by the intersection of chemistry and technology. What drew you to analytical chemistry, and how do you think it's being applied in innovative ways today?","311":"The main point of your argument is that going vegan will help the environment, but I'd like to challenge that assumption. While it's true that animal agriculture contributes to greenhouse gas emissions, the impact of methane emissions from agriculture is often overstated. In fact, the majority of methane emissions come from natural sources such as wetlands and termites. Additionally, some studies suggest that the benefits of reducing methane emissions from agriculture may be offset by the increased production of other greenhouse gases, such as nitrous oxide. Therefore, I think it's essential to consider the complexity of the issue and look at the bigger picture, rather than focusing solely on animal agriculture. This includes exploring alternative solutions, such as reducing food waste, increasing energy efficiency, and implementing sustainable land-use practices.","312":"I think I see where you're coming from, but I'm still having trouble understanding how you'd propose to cover millions of square miles of arctic tundra with vacuum tubes. It sounds like a massive undertaking, and I'm worried about the impact on the local ecosystem. Can you help me visualize this on a smaller scale, like a pilot project or a prototype, to see if it's even feasible?","313":"I understand your concerns about the livestock industry, but let's take a step back and examine the complexities of the issue. What if, instead of dismissing traditional farming outright, we explore ways to integrate more efficient and sustainable practices into existing systems? This might involve rethinking land use, exploring new technologies, or even collaborating with vertical farmers to create hybrid models. By acknowledging the limitations of current approaches and working together to innovate, we might uncover more effective solutions that benefit both the environment and the industry.","314":"The term 'Nazi' has become strongly associated with far-right ideology, despite its literal meaning as 'National Socialist'. This is because the Nazi Party's extreme nationalism, racism, and authoritarianism, combined with its rejection of traditional socialist principles such as equality and social justice, make it a prime example of far-right ideology. In fact, the Nazi Party's policies and actions were often contradictory to the ideals of socialism, and it's this paradox that has led to the term 'Nazi' being used to represent a distorted and extreme form of right-wing ideology.","315":"I see your point, but the classification of the Nazi Party as far-right is more nuanced than just their economic policies. While they did implement some socialist policies, such as nationalizing key industries, they also had a strong authoritarian and nationalist component that aligns with far-right ideologies. It's also worth noting that the Nazi Party's ideology was a unique blend of different ideologies, making it difficult to pinpoint on a single spectrum. But if we were to simplify it, we could say that they had a mix of left-wing and right-wing elements, with a strong authoritarian bent that sets them apart from more traditional left or right parties. Does that make sense?","316":"But the left-right axis is more nuanced than just economics, it's also about social attitudes, individual freedoms, and how much power the state should have. The Nazis' ideology was a mix of authoritarianism and nationalism, which is why they're often placed on the far right, even though their economic policies were more left-leaning than right-leaning. That's why it's not as simple as just looking at economic policies to determine someone's political leanings.","317":"The 18.9Hz frequency is often referred to as the Ghost Frequency due to its unsettling and unnerving effect on the human brain. Research suggests that this frequency can alter our perception of time and space, making it a popular choice in sound design for horror movies and haunted house attractions. However, it's worth noting that the actual cause of this phenomenon is still not fully understood, and more research is needed to uncover the underlying mechanisms.","318":"While it's theoretically possible to use the 18.9 Hz frequency to create a specific atmosphere or elicit a fear response, it's essential to consider the potential consequences and ethics of manipulating people's emotions and perceptions in such a way. In a more practical sense, researchers and sound designers might explore the use of infrasound in fields like architecture, where it could be used to create a sense of unease or discomfort in specific areas, such as in a horror-themed exhibit or a therapy environment for anxiety disorders. However, it's crucial to approach such applications with caution and ensure that the use of infrasound is transparent and consensual.","319":"They can indeed exacerbate existing social and economic challenges, but it's also worth noting that migrants often bring valuable skills, cultural diversity, and entrepreneurial spirit that can enrich the community and contribute to its growth.","320":"But radioactive waste dumped into the ocean would still pose a significant risk to marine life and ecosystems, and the long-term consequences of such an action would be devastating. Moreover, it doesn't address the issue of storage; it merely relocates the problem, making it more complex and difficult to manage in the long run. Furthermore, the cost of building a containment facility on land is a fraction of the cost of dealing with the environmental and health impacts of ocean dumping, which would be catastrophic and far-reaching.","321":"Actually, the debate is about the Yucca Mountain repository, but also about the costs and feasibility of transporting the waste there, and some people are concerned about the potential health risks associated with the repository itself. It's a complex issue with multiple factors at play, which is why it's become a contentious topic in US politics.","322":"I'm glad you're excited about starting your healthier lifestyle journey! What specific goals do you have in mind for the next week, and how can I support you along the way?","323":"The 'no true Scotsman' fallacy is a type of argumentative fallacy that occurs when someone shifts the goalposts by redefining a group or category to exclude anyone who disagrees with them, in order to claim that their opponent's opinion doesn't count. This tactic allows them to avoid engaging with opposing viewpoints and is often used to dismiss valid criticisms or counterarguments.","324":null,"325":"I understand that you're frustrated, but let's take a step back and try to understand the platform's rules together.

Can you tell me more about what happened in this case and what you're hoping to achieve with our conversation today?","328":"The concept of an anti-matter universe is indeed fascinating, and it's often misunderstood as being synonymous with anti-gravity. However, they're distinct ideas. Anti-matter, as you know, has the same mass as regular matter but opposite charges. An anti-matter universe would behave differently, with its own set of physical laws. Anti-gravity, on the other hand, is a hypothetical force that would cause objects to repel each other, rather than attract. The idea of anti-gravity is still largely theoretical and not yet well-defined. What's intriguing, though, is the connection between anti-matter and the concept of a 'tesseract' \u2013 a four-dimensional object that you've been describing. The notion of a tesseract as a higher-dimensional cube is an interesting one, and it's not far-fetched to consider the possibility of an anti-matter universe existing in a similar, yet distinct, realm. The terminology might be lacking, but the idea of exploring these concepts in a more nuanced way is definitely worth pursuing.","329":"I think I'm starting to understand what you're getting at, and I appreciate the analogy with the square and cube. It seems like you're suggesting that there's a way of thinking about the world that involves considering different scales, and the tesseract is a way of representing that idea. I'm still a bit unclear on how it connects to the concept of size travel through reality, but I'm willing to explore that further.","330":"I can try to find a picture of the 3D projection of a Tesseract that I'm referring to. In the meantime, let me try to explain it to you in simpler terms. A Tesseract is a 4-dimensional object that can be thought of as a cube within a cube. When projected onto a 2D surface, it can appear distorted and not like the 3D model you're familiar with. The picture I'm thinking of shows the 8 cubes that make up the Tesseract, but they're not as clear as the simplified version you're used to.","331":"I think what's happening is that Instagram is using a combination of data points to make educated guesses about your interests and preferences. It's not necessarily that they're listening in on your conversations, but rather they're analyzing the patterns of your behavior and the content you engage with. For example, have you noticed any other ads that seem to be related to your interests or hobbies? And do you think it's possible that you might have mentioned the product to someone in a conversation, even if it was just a passing comment?","332":"I think I'm getting a bit defensive, and I want to make sure we're having a fair conversation. Can you help me understand what you mean by 'how they're doing this'? Are you suggesting that I'm jumping to conclusions or assuming things without evidence?","333":"I understand your question now, and I still think it's confirmation bias because you're looking for a specific product, and now that you've found it, you're asking how they're doing it, which seems like a natural progression, but it might be influenced by your initial search for the product.","334":"You're saying that declaring variables with a type helps other programmers understand the code better, so it's more maintainable and easier to read. Is that right?","335":"The reason is that the US Constitution sets a minimum age of 35 years old for presidential candidates to ensure they have enough life experience and maturity. This minimum age was chosen because it was believed that someone with at least 35 years of life experience would be more likely to have the wisdom and judgment needed to be a good president. There isn't a maximum age because the Constitution focuses on the qualifications and experience of the candidates rather than their age.","336":"You have the right to choose between the two candidates, or you can opt for a write-in vote, which allows you to select someone who isn't on the ballot. It's still your decision, and you shouldn't feel pressured to vote for someone just because of their age.","337":"I see your point, but isn't the point of writing in a vote to be able to express dissent or support for a candidate who isn't on the ballot?","338":"I see your point about the current system's imperfections, and I understand why you'd think narcoanalysis tests could be a solution. However, the issue is more complex than just eliminating lies and finding the truth. The use of narcoanalysis tests raises significant concerns about the reliability of the evidence obtained and the potential for coercion, which could lead to wrongful convictions. It's not about which system is better, but rather about ensuring that the pursuit of truth and justice is balanced with the protection of human rights and the integrity of the trial process.","339":"I think I see what you're getting at. You're saying that narco tests might be faster, but that doesn't necessarily make them more accurate or reliable. In fact, they've been criticized for their potential for false positives and false negatives. And I agree with you that the current system, despite its flaws, has a more rigorous process for gathering evidence and ensuring due process. But what I was trying to get at earlier was that even with these imperfections, the current system is still more reliable than narco tests. And that's why I think we should be cautious about relying too heavily on narco tests as a solution to our problems.","340":"That's true, and one of the benefits of fiat currency is that it's easier to manage and regulate, which can help reduce the risk of counterfeiting. However, it also means that the value of money can fluctuate more easily, which can be a challenge.","341":"I think I see what you're getting at. You're pointing out that the societal norms around skin tone are complex and influenced by history and culture. It's interesting that you bring up the difference between getting a tan and lightening one's skin. While getting a tan is often seen as a desirable outcome, especially in certain cultural contexts, lightening one's skin is often associated with a history of colonialism and racism. It's a nuanced issue, and I think it's great that you're encouraging me to think more critically about these norms.","342":"I think what I'm trying to get at is that there's a difference between embracing your natural skin tone and taking deliberate actions to alter it for aesthetic reasons, even if it's just a matter of degree. If someone is going to great lengths to become paler, it's not just about vanity, but also about potentially compromising their health and well-being by avoiding natural sunlight.","343":"I think it's because people often link tanning with being healthy and active, while pale skin is sometimes seen as unhealthy or even vain, which is a pretty superficial association.","344":"If you're covering up to protect yourself from the sun's risks, such as skin cancer or premature aging, that's perfectly fine. But if you're covering up solely to avoid getting a tan, that's what I find concerning, because it suggests an unnatural and potentially unhealthy obsession with appearance.","345":"I understand your point about the distinction between preventing tanning and actively lightening one's skin. However, I'm still struggling to see how covering one's skin with cloth relates to the Japanese practice of skin lightening, which involves chemical or cosmetic means. Can you help me understand the connection you're trying to make?","346":"I think you're misunderstanding the nuance I'm trying to convey. When people get a 'trucker tan', it's often due to the way clothing fits and the amount of skin exposed, rather than the material's ability to block sunlight. This highlights the distinction between incidental tanning and intentional skin lightening. Let's focus on clarifying the differences rather than getting sidetracked by perceived condescension.","347":"I think we're getting off track here. Let's focus on the original topic - the difference between preventing tanning and actively lightening one's skin. Can you help me understand why you think these are related, and what you're trying to say about skin lightening?","348":"You're essentially creating a logical contradiction, aren't you? If covering your skin prevents tanning, then it's reasonable to assume that it would also mitigate the risk of skin darkening. But if it doesn't prevent tanning, then it's unclear why you're drawing a distinction between tanning and skin lightening in the first place. Can we clarify this point before moving forward?","349":"They're called the Noble Gases because they're chemically inert, meaning they don't readily react with other elements to form compounds. This is a result of their full outer energy level, which makes them very stable and uninterested in forming bonds with other elements. The term 'Noble' refers to their unreactive nature, not to any aristocratic connotations. It's a nod to their unique chemical properties, which set them apart from other elements in the periodic table.","350":null,"351":"No, radon is a noble gas, but it decays into radon-210, a radioactive gas. Lead, on the other hand, is a post-transition metal, and it's stable. Unlike radon, lead doesn't have a radioactive half-life because it doesn't decay into anything else. Let's talk more about the periodic table and how new elements are added.","352":"The possibility of a 9th row in the periodic table is highly unlikely due to the way the elements are organized. The number of rows in the periodic table corresponds to the number of electron shells in an atom, and each shell can hold a specific number of electrons. As we move down the periodic table, the number of electron shells increases, but the rate at which new elements are discovered and added to the periodic table is slowing down. The decay of elements also plays a crucial role in determining the number of rows, as the elements in the higher rows tend to have shorter half-lives and decay more quickly. Currently, the 7th row is almost complete, and the 8th row is still being filled with elements that are being discovered. Given the rate at which new elements are being discovered and the decay of existing elements, it's unlikely that a 9th row will be added to the periodic table in the near future.","353":"What makes you think that we'll ever see a 9th row?","354":null,"355":"You're right, it's a long process, and a huge improvement. But the thing is, the 7th row was a significant milestone, a proof of concept, if you will. It showed that the periodic table was on the right track, and it paved the way for the discovery of the elements in the subsequent rows. But the 9th row is a whole different ball game. The elements at that level are much more unstable, and the technology required to create and detect them is far more advanced. It's not just a matter of scaling up the existing methods; it's a whole new frontier, and it will likely require significant breakthroughs in our understanding of nuclear physics and materials science.","356":"The short answer is that we can't say for sure that we're not the center of the universe, but there are some pretty strong hints that we're not. For one thing, the universe looks the same in all directions, which is a pretty big deal. And if we're just one tiny part of a huge universe, it's not like we'd expect to be at the center of it. Plus, if the universe is expanding, we'd expect to see galaxies moving away from us in all directions, but that's not what we see. Instead, we see galaxies moving away from each other, but at different speeds, which suggests that we're not special.","357":"I'm not saying the physics would be different, I'm saying the interpretation of the data would be different. Think of it like a video game where you can zoom in or out. If you're zoomed in on a small part of the game, it looks like everything is moving away from you, but if you zoom out, you can see that everything is actually moving away from each other. That's kind of what's happening with the expansion of the universe. We can interpret the data in different ways depending on our perspective, but the underlying physics is the same.","358":"It's a common phenomenon where people experience sudden, involuntary shivers without any other symptoms. The exact cause is still unknown, but it could be related to the autonomic nervous system, which regulates body functions like heart rate and blood pressure, or it might be a response to stress or anxiety. If you're concerned, it's best to consult a healthcare professional for a proper evaluation.","359":null,"360":"I've always struggled to conjure vivid mental images, and it's as if my brain is trying to assemble a 3D puzzle, but the pieces don't quite fit. When I close my eyes, I can almost see the shape of things, but it's like looking at a watercolor painting \u2013 the colors are muted, and the details are fuzzy. I can rotate the image in my mind, but it's a slow, laborious process, and I often get stuck on a particular aspect, unable to move on. It's frustrating, because I feel like I'm glimpsing the world through a foggy lens, and I'm curious to know how others experience their internal visual landscape.","361":"What was going through your mind when your imagination started to wander and you pictured a suit-wearing sheep robbing a bank?","362":"If you get the flu, you're not just putting your own health at risk, but also the health of those around you - like little ones, grandparents, or friends who might be more vulnerable to complications. I want to make sure I'm being clear: it's not just about you, but also about protecting the people you care about. And, I should clarify, the flu can be spread even before symptoms show up, so getting vaccinated is especially important before the flu season starts.","363":"That's a valid concern. Many people don't have a regular doctor, and it's great that you're thinking about your healthcare options. Community health centers and clinics can be a good place to start, as they often offer affordable care and can help you find a primary care physician if you need one.","364":"A period, also known as menstruation, is when a girl's body gets ready for a baby by releasing blood and tissue from her uterus. This happens every month because the body thinks it's almost time to have a baby, even if it's not. It's a natural process that happens to people who have a uterus, and it's a sign that their body is capable of growing a baby. ","365":"It's true that girls and boys experience puberty differently. Girls often have to navigate more physical changes, like menstruation, which can be unpredictable and inconvenient. Additionally, girls may experience a range of emotional and hormonal changes that can be challenging to manage. Boys, on the other hand, tend to go through puberty with fewer physical changes, and their bodies tend to develop more predictably. This doesn't mean that boys don't have any challenges during puberty, but the physical changes they experience are often less complex and less prone to unexpected surprises.","366":"The automation that replaces human workers would create wealth that could be harnessed to fund the UBI, essentially creating a virtuous cycle where the benefits of technological progress are shared by all.","367":"Analog signals don't have discrete positions like digital signals do, but rather a continuous range of values. So, instead of having a binary 'on' or 'off' state, analog signals can have any value between those extremes. This means that analog signals can be thought of as having a 'percentage' of being 'on' or 'off', rather than a strict binary state.","368":"Yeah, so the computer just sees it as high or low, it doesn't care about the brightness level, it's just a binary on\/off switch for it.","369":"The issue with Erdogan's move is that it's a form of coercion, a way for him to wield power over the EU by holding migrants hostage. This is a classic example of a strategic maneuver, where a leader uses a sensitive issue like migration to gain an upper hand in negotiations. It's not about the migrants themselves, but about Erdogan's desire to expand his influence and control over European politics.","370":"I'm glad I could help you see things from my point of view, but I'm curious - what do you think is the value of upvotes in this community, and how do you think they impact the quality of discussions?","371":"When you smash your finger in cold weather, the pain is often more intense because the cold temperature causes the nerve endings to become more sensitive. This is because the cold slows down the nerve signals, making them feel more acute. Additionally, the cold causes the blood vessels to constrict, which reduces blood flow to the affected area, making the injury feel more severe. However, it's interesting that you mention you can handle cold temperatures on your skin, but struggle with cold hands. This might suggest that the issue is more related to the specific conditions of your fingers, such as the cold seeping through your gloves, rather than the temperature itself.","372":"I've had my fair share of heated glove disasters. Like the time I tried to use them while sawing through a frozen pipe. Let's just say I had a hot mess on my hands...literally.","373":"I appreciate your creative thinking, but I'm not sure a hair dryer would be the best solution. I'm looking for something that will help keep my hands warm without causing other issues. Have you heard of any other products or techniques that might help with cold hands while working with gloves?","374":"You're saying that the societal expectations around how much to spend on children have increased, rather than the cost of raising a child itself. That's a nuanced perspective. I've always thought that the cost of living has gone up, and people are just having fewer kids, but it sounds like there's more to it than that. For example, with the rise of the middle class and increased access to consumer credit, parents are now expected to provide a certain level of material comfort and enrichment for their children, which wasn't the case for previous generations. This can include things like private education, extracurricular activities, and high-end consumer goods. Am I understanding you correctly?","375":"I think that's a really insightful question, and one that I've grappled with as a parent. While I don't think that buying luxury items directly causes kids to want or need more when they grow up, I do think that it can create a sense of entitlement or expectation that can be challenging to overcome. For example, if a child is consistently given the latest gadgets or designer clothes, they may start to feel like they deserve those things as a matter of course. But I also think that it's possible to raise kids who are mindful of the value of money and the importance of making sacrifices, even if that means not having the latest and greatest things. It's all about finding a balance and being intentional about the values we're teaching our kids.","376":"I think that's a good point. We're giving our kids a lot of nice things, and that can make them expect more in life. We take them on expensive vacations, sign them up for expensive activities, and pay for private schools. But then we're surprised when they want the same things when they grow up. It's like we're teaching them that happiness comes from stuff, and that's not a good way to live.","377":"When you buy a non-dividend share, you're essentially buying a piece of a business. Think of it like a small piece of a growing pie. If the company makes a profit, that's like adding more pie to the mix. They can either share that extra pie with you as dividends, or use it to make the pie even bigger and more valuable over time.","378":null,"379":"In fact, some companies deliberately choose not to distribute dividends, instead opting to reinvest profits to fuel growth and expansion, which can lead to increased long-term value for shareholders.","380":"But that raises the question of how the board's decision to distribute profits aligns with the interests of the shareholders. If the board is supposed to represent the will of the shareholders, why do they get to decide how the profits are distributed without taking into account the individual preferences of each shareholder?","381":"The value of your shares doesn't necessarily decrease just because more shares are issued, but the key is that the value of each share is diluted. This means that while the total value of the company might increase, the value of each individual share decreases. This is a fundamental concept in finance, and it's not unique to dividend-paying stocks. A Ponzi scheme or MLM relies on unsustainable growth and deceitful practices to pay returns, which is not how publicly traded companies work. Your ownership in a company is a claim on a portion of its assets and profits, not a promise of a certain return on investment. The value of your shares is determined by market forces and the company's performance, not by some predetermined promise of a certain return. Let's focus on understanding how companies distribute profits to shareholders, rather than getting sidetracked by misconceptions about share dilution.","382":"I see what you're getting at, but I think the comparison between MLMs and IPOs is more nuanced than you're letting on. While it's true that one is a business model for selling products and the other is a way for companies to raise capital, I'm not convinced that they're as dissimilar as you think. Can you help me understand how you see the two as analogous?","383":"You're sidestepping the fact that the value of apples or any other product is not solely determined by its inherent qualities, but also by the complex interplay of market forces, consumer preferences, and supply chain dynamics, which is precisely the case with MLMs, where the value of the product is often inflated by the compensation structure and the exclusivity of the distribution channel.","384":"You're still missing the point. With stocks, you're not buying a tangible item, you're essentially taking a bet on the company's future prospects. The value of the stock isn't fixed, it's influenced by a complex array of factors, including the company's financial health, industry trends, and market sentiment. It's not like buying apples or bolts, where you have a clear understanding of what you're getting. With stocks, you're taking a risk, and that's what makes them so volatile. But that's not the only difference - with stocks, you're also buying a claim on a portion of the company's assets and profits, which can be a powerful driver of returns. ","385":"I see your point about the risks of investing in wholesale goods, but I think it's worth noting that the value of goods can be subjective and influenced by factors like perception, marketing, and trends. Just like how the value of Nike shoes or luxury bags can fluctuate based on their perceived value, the value of apples can also be affected by consumer preferences and market demand. However, I agree with you that investing in wholesale goods does come with inherent risks, such as the possibility of the goods rotting or not being sold at a profit. But, as you mentioned, there are also ways to mitigate these risks, like selling the goods at a lower price or using them for other purposes, like composting.","386":"The common cold is a virus that's always present in the environment, but its activity and contagiousness decrease during the off-season. The virus can survive on surfaces and in the air for a short period, but it's less likely to spread when people are outdoors and have more opportunities for direct sunlight and fresh air. When the weather gets colder and people spend more time indoors, the conditions become more favorable for the virus to spread, which is why we tend to see more cases of the common cold during the winter months.","387":"Dude, I'm more than okay, I'm just wide awake. I've been doing some research and I'm convinced that the whole COVID thing is a massive cover-up. They're using it to control us, to manipulate public opinion, and to push their own agendas. It's all about power and money, and we're just pawns in their game. I'm not saying I'm crazy, I'm just saying I'm not buying what they're selling. And honestly, I think you should be doing some research too, man. Don't just take their word for it. Think for yourself, question everything. We can't just sit back and let them control us, you know?","388":"I mean, it's clear that they're trying to manipulate public opinion and create a sense of fear. It's a classic tactic to control people. They're using the media to spread a narrative that's not based on reality. It's like they're trying to turn us into a herd, following blindly without questioning. We need to be more critical and think for ourselves, not just accept what we're being told. The COVID-19 thing is a perfect example of this. It's a cold, not a pandemic. But if we keep giving in to their narrative, they'll just keep pushing the boundaries. We need to wake up and take control of our own narrative.","389":"I see what you mean about the security questions being based on public information. It's almost as if the system is relying on the assumption that the average person's life is quite compartmentalized, and that sensitive information is largely confined to their personal relationships and financial history. However, as you pointed out, this assumption doesn't hold up to scrutiny, especially when you consider the vast amounts of personal data that are shared online. In reality, it's often surprisingly easy to gather a wealth of information about someone's life, even if it's not directly tied to their financial or personal relationships. The fact that security questions are often used as a fallback mechanism is a bit of a red herring, because it implies that they're a secondary line of defense, when in fact they can be a weak point in the system if not properly secured.","390":"You're right, the point of these security questions is that they're meant to be a challenge, not something that can be easily looked up. It's about making it difficult for someone to figure out the answer, which is what makes it more secure.","391":null,"392":"I was trying to say that the low barrier to entry for targeting someone makes it less likely to happen in the first place, not that it's a viable or desirable security strategy.","393":"Alcoholism is a disease because it's a chronic condition that affects the brain and body, leading to compulsive behaviors that are difficult to control. The medical community recognizes this as a disease due to its biological and genetic roots, as well as its impact on a person's physical and mental health, relationships, and overall quality of life. It's not a matter of personal choice or willpower, but rather a complex interplay of factors that can lead to addiction and dependence.","394":"Harvey Weinstein was convicted of multiple counts of rape and sexual assault after a lengthy trial, during which the prosecution presented evidence of his decades-long history of misconduct. The jury found him guilty beyond a reasonable doubt, and the judge sentenced him to 23 years in prison. This conviction was a landmark moment in the #MeToo movement, which brought attention to the pervasive problem of sexual harassment and assault in the entertainment industry.","395":"Let me try to simplify it: a jury's decision is based on the evidence they hear in court. They have to consider many things, like the credibility of witnesses and the strength of the evidence. If someone is struggling to understand why a question was removed, it might be because they're not used to thinking about complex information in a logical way. It's not about being dismissive or not caring \u2013 it's just a different way of thinking about things.","396":"An afro can be perceived as unprofessional in some corporate workplaces due to historical and systemic biases, but this doesn't necessarily reflect your abilities or work ethic. It's essential to consider the specific company culture and values you're applying to, as some organizations are actively working to create a more inclusive environment. If you're passionate about your career and willing to advocate for yourself, you can explore ways to present your professional image in a way that feels authentic and respectful, such as by incorporating your afro into your personal style in a way that's polished and put-together.","397":"I think what I meant to say is that being in business doesn't necessarily mean you have to conform to a certain image, and many companies value individuality and creativity, but it does mean you may have to be more mindful of how your appearance affects your professional relationships and reputation, especially in industries where first impressions matter.","398":"I think what you're getting at is that there's a tension between the expectation of professionalism in a business setting and the desire for self-expression. While it's true that dressing professionally and being mindful of your appearance are often seen as requirements in the business world, many companies are also recognizing the value of individuality and creativity in their employees. In fact, some of the most innovative and successful companies are those that encourage their employees to express themselves and bring their authentic selves to work. So, it's not necessarily a question of conforming to norms or not, but rather finding a balance between being professional and being true to yourself. What do you think?","399":"Actually, the reason for the imbalance is a bit more complex than that. It's true that the continents have moved over time, but the main reason we see more land in the northern hemisphere is because of the way the Earth's rotation and orbit interact with the planet's magnetic field. This causes the Earth's crust to be thicker and more buoyant in the northern hemisphere, making it more prone to land formation. It's also worth noting that the Earth's oceans are more extensive in the southern hemisphere, which also contributes to the imbalance.","400":"I find it fascinating that the field of geology is still debating the specifics of future supercontinent formation, it highlights the complexity and uncertainty of this process.","401":null,"402":"Yeah, and who knows, maybe they'll even be able to pinpoint the exact reasons behind the tectonic shifts.","403":"Actually, the process is a bit more nuanced, cells that are damaged by radiation or other forms of stress can undergo a process called apoptosis, or programmed cell death, but it's not always a straightforward self-destruction. In some cases, cells can become senescent, which means they stop dividing but don't die, and in other cases, they can even become cancerous if the damage is severe. So it's a complex interplay between the cell's ability to repair itself, its ability to undergo apoptosis, and its potential to become malignant.","404":"And that's why it's especially concerning when DNA damage is passed on to future generations, because it can create a kind of 'cancer-prone' lineage, increasing the risk of cancer not just for the individual, but also for their descendants.","405":"Actually, the Explainee's point is really interesting. The fact that it takes 1 acre of land to produce enough vegetables for a month or cattle for a year highlights the significant land use required for animal agriculture. This is a major contributor to deforestation and habitat loss, which has a ripple effect on biodiversity and ecosystem health. By choosing plant-based options, we can significantly reduce our carbon footprint and support more sustainable land use practices.","406":"Walmart can deny unions because it's a private company, and under US labor law, private companies aren't required to recognize or bargain with unions unless a majority of employees in a bargaining unit vote in favor of unionization in a secret-ballot election. Additionally, the National Labor Relations Act, which governs labor relations in the US, has specific rules about how union elections are conducted, including the requirement that employees who want to unionize must file a petition with the National Labor Relations Board and obtain a showing of interest from at least 30% of the employees in the proposed bargaining unit before an election can be held.","407":"Actually, yes, they can't legally deny a union if a majority of employees want one.  The National Labor Relations Act is pretty clear on this.  If a majority of employees sign cards or vote in an election to form a union, the company has to recognize it.  But what you're proposing is a bit of a gray area.  If you're trying to get around the law by calling it something else, like a 'pro-associate benefits group', that's not going to fly.  The company can still try to block it, and even if they don't, it's not the same as having a real union with all the rights and protections that come with it.  It's like trying to call a cat a dog - it's still a cat.","408":"They can still deny it, even if you call it a different name. The key issue is whether it's a company-wide initiative or a store-by-store one. If it's the latter, they can argue that it's not a legitimate proposal and try to shut it down. And, yes, organizing a single store is much harder than organizing multiple stores or even the entire company. It's not just about getting a certain number of signatures, but also about building a cohesive and motivated group of employees who are willing to advocate for change.","409":"In the United States, a single store can unionize, but it would be a separate union from any national or industry-wide union. However, it would still need to follow the same labor laws and regulations as any other union. The number of people needed to sign up for a single store to unionize can vary depending on the specific location and the type of union being formed. But in general, it would require a significant percentage of employees at that store to sign up and support the union in order to make it official.","410":"Sunscreen is partially absorbed into the bloodstream, but the majority of it is excreted by the body without being metabolized. Some chemical active ingredients, like oxybenzone and avobenzone, can be stored in fatty tissues and may accumulate over time. However, the extent of this accumulation is still being researched, and more studies are needed to fully understand the effects of long-term sunscreen use. It's essential to use sunscreen responsibly and follow the recommended application and reapplication guidelines, and the Environmental Working Group (EWG) is a great resource for staying up-to-date on the latest research and recommendations.","411":"You're welcome! And EWG stands for the Environmental Working Group, a non-profit organization that focuses on research and advocacy for environmental health and safety.","412":"I'm surprised you'd be hesitant to use the word, it's actually a pretty common term in medical contexts.","413":"The name 'Noble Gases' actually comes from the fact that they don't react with other elements to form compounds. The term 'noble' in chemistry refers to their unreactive nature, not to any social status. This means they tend to maintain their own identity and don't readily form bonds with other elements, which is a key characteristic that distinguishes them from other elements in the periodic table.","414":null,"415":"The thing is, Europe had a population density that was basically primed for a pandemic to spread like wildfire. Meanwhile, sub-Saharan Africa has a more dispersed population, which actually helped it avoid the worst of the Black Death. But that's not to say it's been a free pass \u2013 the region's had its own share of health crises, like the Ebola outbreak in West Africa, or the ongoing struggles with malaria and other diseases. It's a complex picture, and it's not just about population density or disease spread. There are all sorts of historical, economic, and social factors at play that have contributed to the region's development trajectory.","416":"One key factor that contributed to Africa's vulnerability to colonization was the lack of centralized power and unification among African societies, which made it challenging for them to present a unified front against European colonizers. This allowed European powers to exploit existing divisions and establish control more easily.","417":"The key difference between those diseases and the ones I mentioned earlier is that the ones I mentioned earlier are more historically recent and had a larger global impact, whereas smallpox, tuberculosis, polio, tetanus, etc. were all more ancient and had a more localized impact.","418":"I think we're getting off track. Can we focus on the topic at hand and have a respectful discussion about the nature of existence and the human experience? I'm not trying to impose my views on you, but I do want to understand your perspective and engage in a thoughtful conversation.","419":"You dismiss the possibility of consciousness being a fundamental property of the universe without any evidence, and instead, you resort to name-calling when faced with the possibility that your views might be incomplete.","420":"However, it's worth noting that eliminating private insurance middlemen might not necessarily lead to significant cost savings, especially if the government doesn't have the infrastructure to negotiate better prices for healthcare services and treatments. The government's procurement process can be inefficient, and it may not be able to replicate the cost-saving efforts of private insurance companies, which have a vested interest in controlling costs.","421":"In fact, studies have shown that government-run healthcare systems often have higher administrative costs due to bureaucratic inefficiencies, which can offset the cost savings from eliminating private insurance middlemen. For example, a study by the RAND Corporation found that the Veterans Affairs healthcare system in the US has significantly higher administrative costs compared to private insurance plans, despite providing comprehensive coverage to its beneficiaries.","422":"You seem to be confusing the no true Scotsman fallacy with a different phenomenon. The no true Scotsman fallacy is a specific type of argumentative fallacy that involves redefining a category to avoid counterexamples, whereas equivocation is a different fallacy that involves using a word or phrase with multiple meanings. Let's focus on understanding the no true Scotsman fallacy in its own right, rather than conflating it with other types of errors in reasoning.","423":"You're saying that when Person 1 says 'All X's are Y's' they're making a general statement about all X's, not just their personal interpretation of X. So if Person 2 points out that X1 is an X but not a Y, then Person 1 can't just change the subject and say 'But X1 is not an X', because that would be dodging the issue. It's like saying 'All cars are red' and then someone pointing out that their friend's car is a blue car - you can't just say 'Oh, that's not a car'.","424":"You're making a point that's often overlooked in discussions about the No True Scotsman fallacy: its prevalence in everyday conversations might be overstated. While it's true that this fallacy can be used in bad faith, it's also possible that people are simply misinformed or misunderstanding the concept. The fact that you've never seen it in action doesn't necessarily mean it's rare, but it does suggest that it's not as common as some people might claim. To accurately assess its frequency, we'd need more data and a more nuanced understanding of how people use this fallacy in different contexts.","425":"Your point about people being accused of the fallacy when they're really just expressing their personal opinions highlights a common challenge in applying the fallacy: distinguishing between genuine logical errors and mere disagreement. To better understand the No True Scotsman fallacy, let's consider how it relates to the concept of inductive reasoning and the limitations of definition-based arguments.","426":"I was expecting you to dismiss my examples as 'not real' cases of the fallacy, but instead, you're saying they're just people being obstinate about their personal opinions \u2013 like those super annoying fans who insist that anyone who doesn't love The Last Jedi can't be a 'true' Star Wars fan.","427":"Airlines sell a seat on a flight, which is a service, not a product. They can't resell it if someone lies about not showing up. The cost per seat is lower when the plane is full because the fixed costs are spread across more passengers, and higher when there are empty seats because the costs are concentrated on fewer passengers. That's how 'Hidden City' travel costs airlines more.","428":"Actually, the airline's profit model is more nuanced than that. While it's true that unsold seats don't generate ancillary revenue, the airline also incurs costs associated with keeping those seats open, such as crew and maintenance expenses. Furthermore, the airline's pricing strategy is designed to maximize revenue per available seat mile, which means that even if you buy a ticket and don't fly, the airline is still earning revenue from the seat's potential value. It's not just about selling you booze and snacks, but also about optimizing the use of their resources to minimize waste and maximize efficiency.","429":"That's right, and if we go back to the airline's perspective, they're still on the hook for all the costs, like fuel, crew, and maintenance, even if you take a seat from a two-hop flight. They're not getting any of that revenue back, so you're essentially costing them money by taking the seat.","430":"Actually, the ticket price is a combination of several factors, including the cost of flying, as well as the revenue generated from ancillary services like food, drinks, and in-flight sales. So, even if food and drinks are free on some airlines, the ticket price still covers the costs of operating the flight, and the airline can make additional revenue from these services. It's a bit like how a restaurant might charge you for the meal, but also make money from selling drinks and desserts.","431":"I sense we're in a bit of a game, but I'm curious - what's the goal you're trying to achieve with this?","432":"That's close, but think of BIOS as a set of instructions that's stored in a special type of memory called ROM, which is read-only memory. It's like a recipe book that tells the computer how to get started, but it's not a section of memory that the computer reads from, it's more like a starting point that gets loaded into memory.","433":"That's a great question, and it's where the magic happens! So, the CPU is like a master chef, and the instructions are the recipes. The CPU looks at the instructions, and it's like following a recipe book. It knows exactly what to do with each ingredient (the binary numbers), and it combines them in the right way to create the final dish (the action the computer takes). It's all about the sequence of operations, and that's where the instruction set comes in \u2013 it's like a cookbook with all the recipes laid out.","434":"The CPU's operation is a result of a complex interplay between its physical architecture and the instruction set it follows. When it receives a binary number, it uses the instruction set to identify the operation associated with that number. The instruction set is essentially a dictionary that maps binary codes to specific actions, such as accessing memory or performing arithmetic. The CPU then executes the identified operation by manipulating the electrical signals within its transistors and other components. This process is akin to a recipe, where the CPU follows a set of pre-defined instructions to produce a specific outcome. The key point is that the CPU doesn't 'understand' the meaning of the numbers it processes, it simply executes the instructions in its instruction set to produce the desired result.","435":"When you hear 'x input is converted to y output', it's like a recipe for the CPU. The input x is like the ingredients, and the output y is the dish that the CPU cooks up by following a series of instructions, which are essentially a set of logical steps that transform the input into the desired output. It's not just a simple swap, but rather a complex process that involves the CPU's internal workings, like logic gates and transistors, which work together to produce the final result.","436":"The No True Scotsman fallacy is a type of informal fallacy where someone tries to exclude or dismiss a person from a group by redefining the group's characteristics or traits in a way that makes it impossible for that person to be a part of it. This can be seen in conversations where someone says 'no true X' to argue against someone's opinion or behavior, while simultaneously changing the definition of X to fit their own biases or preconceptions. This fallacy is considered a problem because it allows people to avoid engaging with opposing views or arguments by simply redefining the terms of the debate.","437":"However, that doesn't change the fact that it is a fallacy, even if it doesn't happen in real life. What's more, the fact that it's rarely employed in good faith doesn't negate its existence as a logical fallacy.","438":"You're right that the assumption of the No True Scotsman fallacy can be incorrect, but that doesn't necessarily mean it's not a common mistake. In fact, the fallacy's persistence in philosophical discussions suggests that it's still a relevant concern, even if it's not always accurately identified.","439":"Think of it this way: when an electrical signal zips from one neuron to the next, it's like a letter being passed from one person to another. But instead of a letter, it's a bunch of electrical and chemical signals that are being sent through the neurons. And when all these signals reach the final neuron, it's like the letter is being read and understood, and suddenly you've got a thought. It's pretty wild to think that our thoughts are made up of the same stuff as the universe, but it's just being arranged in a different way, like letters in a sentence.","440":null,"441":"I think I'm experiencing a similar disconnect between my visual and linguistic processing systems. When you describe being unable to see an image in your mind's eye, but knowing exactly what it consists of, it resonates with me. It's as if my brain is trying to reconcile these two modes of thinking, but they're not quite in sync. I find myself getting caught up in trying to verbalize the image, but the more I focus on the words, the more elusive the visual becomes. It's a frustrating cycle, and I'm curious to explore this further with you.","442":"I'm curious, what do you think happened with your imagination there? It sounds like it took off in a few different directions, and then got a bit confusing. That's kind of like how our minds work when we're trying to understand something new - it's like trying to follow a conversation that's jumping around a lot. Does that make sense?","443":"A period is when a woman's body releases a small amount of blood and tissue through the vagina, usually once a month. It's a sign that she's able to get pregnant. Think of it like a natural cleaning process, getting rid of the lining in the uterus that's been building up since the last time she got her period. It's a pretty normal and healthy part of a woman's body!","444":"While it's true that Africa has faced its own share of health crises, such as the Ebola outbreak, the impact of the Black Death in Europe was a one-off event that had a profound and lasting effect on the continent's development. In contrast, Africa's history of dealing with diseases has been more of a slow-burning fire, with many communities developing unique coping mechanisms and cultural responses to recurring health threats.","445":"That's a good point about the diseases being spread by local populations and trade networks in Africa, but it's also worth noting that the lack of infrastructure and technology in Africa, particularly in the 19th and early 20th centuries, made it much harder for the continent to respond to and contain outbreaks, whereas in the United States, the existing infrastructure and technological advancements allowed for more effective control and mitigation of diseases.","446":"The key difference being that America was able to develop vaccines for those diseases, thanks to advances in medical technology and research, which has had a profoundly positive impact on public health.","447":null,"448":"The flu season in Canada typically ends with the arrival of warmer temperatures and the melting of snow, marking the beginning of spring. This is because the virus thrives in colder environments, where the humidity is lower and people are more likely to congregate indoors, creating opportunities for transmission. However, it's essential to note that the flu doesn't truly 'go away' \u2013 it's more accurate to say that the number of cases decreases significantly as the season progresses. The virus remains present in the environment, and it can still be transmitted to people, even during the off-season. In fact, the World Health Organization has reported cases of influenza in other parts of the world, including Asia and Europe, which suggests that the flu is a persistent threat that requires continued vigilance and public health measures.","449":"The flu isn't gone forever, but its activity decreases during warmer months. This isn't because the virus itself is seasonal, but because warmer temperatures and humidity make it harder for the virus to survive and be transmitted. The virus can still be present in the environment, but its transmission is less likely. It can also be reintroduced through travel or trade, which is why the flu can reappear in different parts of the world at different times of the year.","450":"When we experience emotional stressors, our body's 'fight or flight' response is triggered, releasing stress hormones like cortisol and adrenaline. These hormones can cause physical symptoms like a queasy stomach and loss of appetite, as if our body is preparing us to either confront or flee from the stressor. It's a natural, instinctual response that can be overwhelming, but it's not a reflection of the significance of our problems.","451":"You're welcome to share your own story anytime you're ready! It's always a brave and powerful thing to do. But I'm curious, what do you think was the turning point for you in your own journey? Was it a specific conversation, event, or realization that helped you shift your perspective?","452":"I'm glad you found our conversation helpful and supportive, but I want to acknowledge that you still have a lot of questions and concerns about your own struggles. I'd like to offer you some support and guidance, but I also want to make sure I'm not oversharing or putting pressure on you. Can I ask, what specifically is it about my story that resonated with you, and how do you think it might relate to your own experiences?","453":"I see what you're saying. Let's break it down. The elements are simple, but they can combine in many ways to form complex molecules. This is because of the way their atoms interact with each other. Think of it like building with LEGO blocks - each element is like a LEGO block, and when they fit together in certain ways, they create something new. The question is, how did this process start in the first place, and how did it lead to the complexity of life?","454":"When you apply sunscreen, most of it gets washed off in the water or wiped off by sweat. Some of the chemicals in the sunscreen can be absorbed into your skin, but your body usually breaks them down and gets rid of them through urine or poop. A tiny bit might linger in your fat cells for a short time, but that's it.","455":"By the way, I've been meaning to ask, what's the EWG all about? I've heard they do some great work on environmental issues.","456":"Honestly, I'm not sure what they could do to stop it. If you're trying to create a pro-associate benefits group that's basically a union in disguise, I'm not aware of any laws that would prevent you from doing that. But, to be honest, it's a bit of a gray area, and it's hard to say for sure without getting into some pretty complex labor law stuff.","457":"However, if you frame it as a proposal for associate benefits, rather than a unionization effort, they might be more willing to engage with it. But even then, they could still deny it and potentially take disciplinary action against you for organizing, especially if they suspect it's a unionization effort in disguise.","458":"A single store can't unionize on its own, but employees at a specific store can vote to unionize and then join the larger union that represents all Walmart employees.  It's a bit like a franchise model, where individual stores are part of a larger organization.","459":"That's a clever way of looking at it, but doesn't the fact that we're repeating the action 100 times change the probability of the outcome? I mean, if we're doing it 100 times, doesn't that affect the odds of it happening once?","460":"Alcoholism is a disease because it involves changes to the brain's chemistry and structure, similar to other diseases like diabetes or hypertension. In the case of alcoholism, the brain's reward system is altered, leading to compulsive drinking despite negative consequences. This is similar to how other addictive substances or behaviors, such as opioid use disorder or gambling addiction, can also be considered diseases because they involve changes to the brain's function and structure.","461":"How about polymers, like plastics, ceramics, semiconductors, and composites?","462":"The universe's expansion is a bit like a big balloon inflating. Imagine you're standing on the surface of that balloon, and as it expands, the dots around you (representing galaxies) move away from you. But if you were to travel to any of those dots, you'd see the same thing happening - the dots around you would be moving away, not towards you. That's because the expansion is happening uniformly in all directions, so we're not at a special spot in the middle.","463":"I see what you're getting at, but the theory I'm referring to doesn't necessarily imply a center of the universe. Instead, it suggests that the universe's expansion is uniform in all directions, which means that from any observer's perspective, the recession of galaxies would be the same. It's not about us being at the center of the galaxy, but rather about the uniform expansion of space itself.","464":"That's a crucial point, and it gets to the heart of the difference between the two models. If the universe is static, then the expansion we observe would be a result of the initial conditions, and wouldn't be accelerating. But if we're seeing galaxies moving away from us, that suggests that the expansion is accelerating. Can you help me understand what you think is driving the acceleration, and how that relates to the static universe model?","465":"I see what you're saying, but the relationship between the brain and testosterone is a bit more complex than that. The brain plays a significant role in regulating testosterone production, and it's not just about the balls producing it. Think of it like a feedback loop \u2013 the brain sends signals to the testes to produce testosterone, and then the testosterone affects the brain's behavior. It's a delicate balance that's hard to separate.","466":"Can you tell me more about what you're referring to in your culture?","467":"I think you're confusing biology with social norms. The question of whether a 13-year-old girl is physically and mentally ready to raise a child is more about what our society considers acceptable, rather than any hard biological facts. It's about how we define maturity and responsibility, not about the biological capabilities of a 13-year-old.","468":"So you're saying that just because the majority of people agree on an answer, you don't think it's valid? That's a pretty weird stance to take, especially in a question forum where people are sharing their opinions and experiences.","469":"I think we're getting bogged down in semantics here. Let's take a step back and focus on the core issue: why humans typically don't have children immediately after reaching puberty. You've been pointing out biological factors, but I still don't see a clear explanation for why this is the case. Can we try to get back to the heart of the matter and have a more constructive conversation about this?","470":"I think we're getting bogged down in a miscommunication. You were looking for biological explanations, but the majority of answers focused on the social factors that influence human readiness for parenthood. This is because the question itself implies that humans are inherently different from animals in this regard, and the answers reflected that. If we reframe the question to focus on the biological aspects, we might get more targeted responses.","471":"<model-generated> Okay, so let's take a step back and try to relate squaring numbers and square roots to the real world. One way to think about it is through the concept of area. When you square a number, you're essentially finding the area of a square with sides of that length. For example, if you have a square garden with sides of 4 meters, the area of the garden is 4^2 = 16 square meters. This is a tangible way to understand squaring numbers. On the other hand, square roots are like the inverse operation of squaring. If you know the area of a square, you can find the length of its side by taking the square root of the area. For instance, if you have a square rug with an area of 25 square meters, the length of each side is the square root of 25, which is 5 meters. This connection to area and length makes squaring numbers and square roots more accessible and relevant to the real world.
