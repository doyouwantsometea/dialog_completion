I stopped caring when your post was removed, just been stringing you along seeing how worked up you can get about it.   Of course skipping gears is ok, it's just wrong in certain situations but not to a degree that can't be overcome by adding several hundred kilograms of metal to your vehicle.","2":"I've talked to enough ladies to know that being a woman basically means \"there's a million things out there that want render me incapable of holding in urine, and one of them will eventually get me\".

Well, for starters you're leaving a bunch of acceleration on the table by   &gt; skipping gears  And not using the peak of your power curve as much as you could be.   If you're consistently skipping the same gear that'll sacrifice a bit of longevity, though whether you'll keep the car long enough to need it is another question.

Stars are different, they are fusing elements together, it\u2019s a completely different process to radioactive decay.","7":"&gt;Oh cool, so does that mean that, like radon, all of the noble elements will eventually turn into lead?  What makes your ask this question? Helium will never \u201cdecay\u201d into lead, nor will neon etc.   When stars explode a large amount of heavier elements are formed, but again this isn\u2019t the same process.    &gt;Could lead ever decay into something else? Is there a half-life of lead?  I\u2019ve already told you that every single element has radioactive isotopes, see: https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Isotopes_of_lead - note just how many radioactive isotopes lead has, many are decay products from other elements, lead is the heaviest element that still has stable isotopes.   Isotopes are atoms with the same number of protons but different numbers of neutrons. Only specific configurations of protons and neutrons are stable, everything else is unstable and undergoes radioactive decay.   &gt;If lead does decay into something else, it would probably take us billions of years to find out, right?  See the link above    I think checking out some educational YouTube videos would help you. Try this one: https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=fES21E0qebw","8":"Probably not.  The last few elements discovered on the 7th row already decay within fractions of seconds, and there\u2019s 50 elements to fill up the 8th row yet to be discovered before the 9th row.","9":"Is it really important though? None of these elements have real world applications. It\u2019s mostly a dick waving contest.   If it\u2019s boring in school it\u2019s mostly because of boring teachers or boring curricula, or both. Chemistry is an amazing science because it\u2019s so essential to everything around us.   If it takes 5 years to discover element 119, and even if it takes 5 years past that for each other element you\u2019re looking at nearly 50000 years. And that\u2019s a theoretical number pulled out of nowhere with no basis in reality. There\u2019s other problems to overcome, like heavier elements needing electrons to travel at faster than the speed of light and somehow overcoming the repulsion of protons in the nucleus.","10":"It is funny how that episode came out four years ago and yet all of the people still believe what our media says.

This is philosophy, which is focused on very different things.  &amp;#x200B;  A key point is to imagine that we \\*do\\* live in that universe, where unless something is observed by a human it doesn't happen. How would that affect us?     Not one bit.  &amp;#x200B;  If the universe only operates differently if it has no way of being observed, then by definition it can't affect us. Science is still as useful as it always was. The point of philosophy is to consider the \"what ifs\", and see whether that has any bearing on how we \\*should\\* behave.","14":"There are a few effects; ionization will break apart biologically important molecules, which can then become \"radicals\" which can break apart more molecules or damage proteins. Too much damage to cellular structures can cause the cell to destroy itself, as can too much damage to DNA. This is why bad sunburn causes skin to peel off, the epidermal and dermal layers received enough damage to decide they need to kill themselves for the greater good. However, if DNA is damaged in certain ways, it can lead to cancer. It's not that DNA can't be repaired at all, it's that it is the \"master program\" for the cell and can be modified in ways that make the cell do things that it isn't supposed to.   You can also receive too much damage to important cells like in organs. It's actually therapeutic in some situations, such as using radioactive iodine to destroy some of a large thyroid, but many organs are not good at regenerating so the damage can hamper their functionality.","15":"It's not just skin, it's called apoptosis and most cells in the body can do it. It also goes beyond cancer, you don't want malfunctioning cells dumping chemicals into the rest of the body.

It's a common problem in schools because people are scared to talk about it. Some of the fear is that it will encourage kids to start having sex early but I think it's important for everyone to know how the body works. Everyone has one, so why hide it?  Kids need to know what is normal and what is not normal, so if there is a problem, they can talk to a doctor.

In general they take deposits from individuals and make loans, as well as offering services like credit cards.   Investment banking works more with the markets directly relating to financial securities (stocks, bonds, derivatives, etc) and financial advisory services. But investment banks do not take deposits.   Want to have your company go public and be listed on a stock exchange? The can determine a listing price and distribution. Need to issue $10B in bonds, they can partner with other firms to create the terms and get them sold. Want to merge with another company? They help with due diligence and the terms and the funding (loans, stock conversions, etc.).  Traditionally (at least since the 1933 Glass\u2013Steagall legislation) these were separate institutions. Many banks collapsed (for instance) when they used deposits to speculate on the markets. These functions are still separate but can be housed in one corporation. And most investment banks chose or were pressured to become commercial banks (at least from a regulatory perspective) after the crisis of 2008.","30":"You were looking at just economic policy, there are policies other than economic - namely social and foreign.

Not saying I agree that sex work should be stigmatized but it's definitely different from encouraging a crowd to do a chant at a sporting event.","36":"Puritanical religious bullshit? I dunno. Because religious people like to think no one should ever enjoy sex, so someone who's whole job is doing sexy fun stuff is inherently an evil tempting influence.

Analog devices still use transistors, but they allow for many shades of grey between 0 current an maximum current.   Transistors work like switches, with current flowing from the Source to the Drain, controlled by the Gate. This lets a tiny voltage at the Gate control a much larger current, like how a tiny valve can completely shut off a pipe.   Digital devices are designed to only have their gate ON or OFF. Analog devices can take a range of voltages through the gate that gradually turns on the current flowing through the device. This lets a tiny signal be amplified into a much bigger one, wiggling the \"valve\" creates a much stronger wiggle in the current through the \"pipe\", and this can turn the tiny electromagnetic field of a radio wave into something you can hear, with a little external power supplied by something else to drive the main current.","38":"&gt;Analog devices still use transistors, but they allow for many shades of grey between 0 current an maximum current.

It basically gives your body the \"I have seen that one before\" power over sickness.  However you need to be kind of healthy to get vaccinated. There are certain conditions under which you cannot receive vaccines (you are very young, your immune system is gone due to birth defects or cancer treatment,. ..).  These people rely on an effect called \"herd immunity\".  Basically you die if you get infected but you never get infected because everyone around you is vaccinated. This prevents a disease from spreading.  Unfortunately to achieve herd immunity roughly 98% of the population have to be vaccinated.  So for me personally as a vaccinated, healthy adult it makes no difference if you are vaccinated or not. For my little daughter or my cancer stricken relative it is a life or death situation (unfortunately quite literally).  Therefore if you are healthy and able to get a shot, go get a shot. It will safe someone's life.  (Kind of the same principle as you clear a lane for an ambulance.

I know I had some sex education in school but it wasn't very good. It's a common problem in schools because people are scared to talk about it. Some of the fear is that it will encourage kids to start having sex early but I think it's important for everyone to know how the body works. Everyone has one, so why hide it?  Kids need to know what is normal and what is not normal, so if there is a problem, they can talk to a doctor.

Plus water vapor.  For example, if you open a manhole, the hydrogen sulfide will be near the bottom, because it's heavier than air. If the space has carbon monoxide in it, it could be near the top, as it's slightly lighter than air. CO2 is heavier than air, which is why you can use it to create a a ground fog. Methane is lighter than air, but flammable vapors of organic solvents tend to be heavier.

Analog devices can take a range of voltages through the gate that gradually turns on the current flowing through the device.   Remember, 1 and 0 are just what we call ON and OFF. Its all a matter of how much current is flowing. We get to choose how to interpret that.","107":"Yeah well maybe you should figure out how to filter my saltyness while you're at it.

We know his mother was a Christian. By the fourth century, Christianity was more than just a cult. It was a well-organized religion. Prior to Constantine, it was basically illegal to be a Christian. I think what Constantine actually did was make it perfectly legal to practice Christianity. He himself converted on his deathbed. I think it was actually Constantine's successor who made Christianity the official religion of the Empire.","112":"The teachings of Christ were popular. There's no denying that. Like anything else, Christianity first spread by word of mouth. One community adopts, and then another, and so on. I think it's also worth noting that these early Christians were probably much more in line with Christ's teaching and did what they could to help those who had been hurt by the Roman Empire. And of course Christ was a martyr. People love a good marty. But really, there are a lot of reasons that contributed to the spread of Christianity, but the religion certainly wouldn't be where it is today had it not been adopted by the greatest power earth had ever known.","113":"&gt; It could be as simple as vacuuming it up with big harvesters.

The \"standard\" round for the M16 rifle (and other weapons that use 5.56 ammunition) is something called M855, which is *like* full metal jacket ammo, but it's tipped with a little bit of steel that's colored green (which is why you sometimes hear it called 'green-tip') to enhance its ability to punch through obstacles.  The relatively high ratio of muzzle velocity to bullet weight leads the other popular round, the M193, to fragment near explosively when it hits something.","118":"It depends on the \"level\" of armor you're wearing. *Any* 5.56 round travels so damn fast that it will basically slice right through anything level IIIA or below, hollow-point or not.  The \"levels\" are a concept from the National Institute of Justice, and refer to the types of rounds that a given body armor will stop. Kevlar is basically rated to stop handgun rounds only; armor that stops rifle rounds will generally include hard ceramic or steel plates.

The decision comes from whether the stockholders (in aggregate) think the company can use that money to make the company more valuable than what the stockholder can normally do.   Using you example earlier, if you made hundreds of your blood paintings, you wouldn't be rich, because no one would buy them. It's basic economics at that point, partial ownership of Amazon is more valued than your paintings are.

The complicated things like growing and protecting oneself and getting food and reproducing are all handled by the host cell. *Somebody* has to do those things, and the virus simply allows the host cell to do them. Viruses don't even really understand how to make more viruses - they simply turn themselves over to the advanced machinery of the host and allow the host to use its own 'knowledge' of replication to make more virus.","145":"Oop - I slipped into nerdspeak.

I\u2019ve already told you that every single element has radioactive isotopes, see: https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Isotopes_of_lead - note just how many radioactive isotopes lead has, many are decay products from other elements, lead is the heaviest element that still has stable isotopes.   Isotopes are atoms with the same number of protons but different numbers of neutrons. Only specific configurations of protons and neutrons are stable, everything else is unstable and undergoes radioactive decay.   &gt;If lead does decay into something else, it would probably take us billions of years to find out, right?

It basically gives your body the \"I have seen that one before\" power over sickness.  However you need to be kind of healthy to get vaccinated. There are certain conditions under which you cannot receive vaccines (you are very young, your immune system is gone due to birth defects or cancer treatment,. ..).  These people rely on an effect called \"herd immunity\".  Basically you die if you get infected but you never get infected because everyone around you is vaccinated. This prevents a disease from spreading.  Unfortunately to achieve herd immunity roughly 98% of the population have to be vaccinated.  So for me personally as a vaccinated, healthy adult it makes no difference if you are vaccinated or not. For my little daughter or my cancer stricken relative it is a life or death situation (unfortunately quite literally).  Therefore if you are healthy and able to get a shot, go get a shot. It will safe someone's life.  (Kind of the same principle as you clear a lane for an ambulance.

Some of the fear is that it will encourage kids to start having sex early but I think it's important for everyone to know how the body works. Everyone has one, so why hide it?  Kids need to know what is normal and what is not normal, so if there is a problem, they can talk to a doctor.

However, if DNA is damaged in certain ways, it can lead to cancer. It's not that DNA can't be repaired at all, it's that it is the \"master program\" for the cell and can be modified in ways that make the cell do things that it isn't supposed to.   You can also receive too much damage to important cells like in organs.

Couple that with by the point America had to deal with much of that, we already had the infrastructure, and tech, to be able to fight it.","215":"It is good practice to have variable names with clear naming that accurately describes what they are for. What you're suggesting results in variables with absolutely no name whatsoever. (array[0], array[1], array[2] are hardly descriptive).  Moreover, good programming means dissecting your problem into small easily managed chunks. So small, clear functions or objects.

The highest month is usually February) is lower than 2019-20.  Again, the reason is because of our precautions to covid are very effective at keeping flu number down. Influenza isn't usually a big deal, so we never go to great lengths to stop it. While Covid is very contagious, and Can result in hospitalization (influenza can too). The reason that we have been so precautious with Covid is because so many hospitals are at above 100% capacity. That was the entire point of flattening the curve, to keep the numbers at a more manageable rate for a long period of time. But people have let up on the precautions because everyone is understandably sick of the isolation","217":"People or goods travel, the virus travels. It just sticks around more in winter weather.   Technically you could still get the flu in the summer, but it's much more unlikely. It's already pretty unlikely to get it in the outer months of the season, but outside of the season it's a lot less likely.  But right now it'll still be in the US and Canada, and in a few months it'll be more prominent in Brazil, and then next year it'll come back. And it will have mutated, just like it does every year, but hopefully we'll have predicted a correct vaccine and it won't be too bad","218":"Stability and complexity are unrelated. The added complexity *in some contexts* clearly makes life more able to sustain itself, otherwise it wouldn't evolve. In places where it is not useful, it does not evolve. This is why viruses are simple - they don't benefit from added complexity.  As for exactly how they work, they take advantage of the complexity in their hosts. The complicated things like growing and protecting oneself and getting food and reproducing are all handled by the host cell. *Somebody* has to do those things, and the virus simply allows the host cell to do them. Viruses don't even really understand how to make more viruses - they simply turn themselves over to the advanced machinery of the host and allow the host to use its own 'knowledge' of replication to make more virus.","219":"Many systems can be self-sustaining so long as they have 'food'. While we don't know the exact path that life followed as it formed, it seems safe to say that a very rudimentary von Neumann 'machine' molecule or arrangement of molecules came to be which then developed more and more complex 'programs' that eventually became DNA.  Again, such developments are very unlikely, but given the sheer number of molecules forming and breaking in the oceans even now, on the order of quintillions or more every second, over the course of trillions of years, it shouldn't be too shocking that it happened *once*.","220":"Oop - I slipped into nerdspeak. A von Neumann machine is a machine that can replicate itself by first building a body and 'downloading' the blueprint for that body into it allowing the new body to then replicate again.  As for the exact chemistry of it all, that is unfortunately beyond my knowledge. Organic chem is hell.","221":"This  is why Bio-fuel is a good alternative to include. Sure it depends on farming rates and things but it's better than relying on oil from nations who are unreliable in the long term.","222":"Arable land is an issue, In this respect Bio-fuel only works if you can grow algae or other plant source in places that doesn't have proper soil.    I often wish Vertical farms were more common but there are some companies out there now making them.   Vertical farms reduce our farming effects on acres and acres of land and can be designed to use little energy and being inside a building crops don't need pesticides or other harmful chemicals.","223":"Not only is it absorbed but research has found that certain chemicals in sunscreens like oxybenzone, octinoxate, octocrylene, homosalate, and avobenzone are not only absorbed into the blood but are even found in the blood of a fetus of a woman who used it while pregnant. The research has even shown links to these chemicals and hormonal imbalance.","224":"No problem. When we found out about it years ago we check everything that contains any sunscreen. Even lip balms have the chems.  We switched to zinc\/ titanium dioxide organic sunscreens and our daughter who has more fair skin than either of us has yet to burn.  Do watch the ones that are safe lotion wise but also have a spray on version as well (disgustingly marketed for use on toddlers) have the chems in the spray and not the lotion.","225":"What have they \"denied\"?

So, the probability of not happening is 0.99.  If you wanted to know the probability of it not happening twice in a row you would multiple 0.99 x 0.99 which equals 0.9801 or 98.01%  To calculate the odds of it not happening 100 times in a row you multiple 0.99 times itself 100 times which is also written as 0.99^100. The answer is 0.366 or 36.6%","227":"Smoking isn't a disease. Being addicted to nicotine is a disease. Drinking isn't a disease. Being addicted to alcohol is a disease.

The universe is not static, and doesn\u2019t have a barrier for said galaxies to rebound off of. It is constantly accelerating expansion. For example if you drop a rock in a lake, the waves ripple outwards, not towards the rock. But if some galaxies, had a lighter mass, they would be moving faster and possibly overtake others as will happen with the Milky Way and andromeda","232":"Testosterone is largely produced in the testicles, and it is distosterone that provides a large amount of the driving force of male sexual urges and desire.

To be fair this isn't unusual, my first driving instructor skipped it as well.\nExplainee: I drove first 13 years of my driving life with manual transmission, and I had no issues using gears. I still drive a manual occasionally without any issues, and without looking at the RPM when changing gears. Even with cars I haven't driven before.

If I'm on fourth gear and at or close to my speed goal, I usually skip straight to sixth. Sure, acceleration, if I still need to do any, might be slightly slower than if I changed to fifth instead. But I'm not usually in a situation that demands maximum acceleration.  And lets be honest: skipping gears is perfectly safe.

Why you doing this\n","5":"Explainer: To start with, I made a mistake in my previous comment.  The turbine speed and torque is going to be based on super complicated fluid mechanics stuff that I don't know to well.    No, it won't have the same energy output.  Lets say that substance 1 has a boiling point of 50 degrees Celsius and substance 2 has a boiling point of 100 degrees Celsius.  Lets also say that they require the same amount of energy to heat up 1 degree Celsius (1 kj).  Substance 1 absorbs 50 kj of energy but substance 2 absorbs 100 kj.  This means that substance 2 can have more energy extracted by the turbine.    The pressure doesn't actually have much to do with it, it's actually held constant during the boiling process and a pump is used to get the liquid to the right pressure.\nExplainee: Right, this explanation is all compatible with thermodynamics (more energy in=more energy out), but why? Why doesn't a gas molecule at the same pressure affecting the same surface area and moving at the same speed, just at a different temperature, not move the turbine the same amount? The turbine extracts energy by spinning. It doesn't convert heat energy at all, it converts the kinetic energy of the paddles spinning to electricity, and that kinetic energy is generated by pressure.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","6":"Explainee: ELI5: In Chemistry, why are they called the Noble Gases?

Light particles are still bouncing around and being reflected off everything, everywhere, but in the case of the vantablack, when light hits that area, it just reflects less light than other surfaces. (less information is being reflected)  Another way to look at it is take a digital camera and point it at the car.  Well there is a sensitive chip in there that is like an eye.  The light hits the chip, and activate certain parts of that chip which the computer makes into an image on the screen.  The vantablack areas did not activate that part of the chip.

The best I can do for ELI5: using transistors you can build logic gates. Using logic gates you can build logical functions. Transistors can also control which logic gates get activated based on a given input. You change which transistors are activated by sending signals to certain CPU pins in a certain order. The CPU is designed such that it would automatically read instructions from certain pins when powered on (which is where the BIOs\/boot process comes in).

Feed it a \"6\" and it will add the next two numbers. Feed it an \"8\" and it will store a number into memory. How exactly the transistors are arranged to do so is not even remotely ELI5, and the people who know it are paid millions for their expertise. If you want to see what it looks like inside a CPU you can watch [this video](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=Fxv3JoS1uY8).  The best I can do for ELI5: using transistors you can build logic gates. Using logic gates you can build logical functions. Transistors can also control which logic gates get activated based on a given input. You change which transistors are activated by sending signals to certain CPU pins in a certain order. The CPU is designed such that it would automatically read instructions from certain pins when powered on (which is where the BIOs\/boot process comes in).

And a ponzi scheme requires others to keep joining so it can keep the cycle going, although in  this case a company is generally self sufficient, but at same time isnt obligated to buy your shares if you decide to sell.

A) there is intrinsic value, as you have partial ownership of material goods (what the company owns)   B) the competition is between companies, aka you can buy that companies stock or this companies stock.

Maybe the analogy is not the best to price your point, but you can easily ensure you have sales before purchasing.   Also, you have the intrinsic value of apples which you can eat (I assume you're not allergic to it).

But that's not different in investing in nike shoes or luxury bags to resell later. The value of the stock comes from perception rather than anything thay can be more objectively discerned (dividends). E.g. Nike shoes are inherently shoes, so they have a level of intrinsic value. But is it worth 1k, is a matter of perception.  Point 2. Actually that highlights my point. If you invest in yen and try to use it in another country, it is very likely most places will not accept the currency unless you are willing to trade at a decent or significant loss. So that investment makes no sense because it is unusable until converted, which requires a person willing to trade it.

This is less Computer Science and more Electrical Engineering.  An analog circuit is either \"on\" or \"off\", but its operation can also change based on the energy level. Usually we design the circuit for a specific voltage level (eg. 110V in a US household), and change the current draw to change its operation. Eg. to make a toaster coil hotter or a fan spin faster.  A digital circuit always just \"exists\", with its operation determined by the sequence of on\/off electrical signals transmitted through it. Note that it's the circuit as a whole that is designed to be \"digital\". Individual components like transistors or capacitors are inherently \"analog\", we just use them in different ways.  The concept of \"1s and 0s\" is just something we humans use to help work with digital circuits because of the constant stream of on\/off data going through the circuit - it's useful to represent it as binary numbers.

The alpha\/beta\/gamma particles coming out might crash around and damage other atoms, but this is a result of the decay and doesn't precipitate more decay in most cases (fission can be an exception).  &amp;#x200B;  For fission, you can imagine the nucleus like a deformed ball.

If you invest in yen and try to use it in another country, it is very likely most places will not accept the currency unless you are willing to trade at a decent or significant loss.

And a ponzi scheme requires others to keep joining so it can keep the cycle going, although in  this case a company is generally self sufficient, but at same time isnt obligated to buy your shares if you decide to sell.

It is, in theory, the shareholders that decide whether or not the company pays a dividend, management can advise but the board decides.   So if a company doesn't pay dividends it is usually a joint consensus of the management and the owners (shareholders) of the company. Of course, if someone owns 0.00001% of the shares of the company, they probably cannot expect to have much say (other than voting at the AGM) in the major strategic decisions of the company.\nExplainee: yeah, so I feel like buying non-dividend shares is more of a winner takes all system.

It was a massive ball of unimaginable amounts of energy,  This is also false. I'm not even sure what this is supposed to mean.  When you rewind the clock, things get closer and closer together until at some point, the energy is packed together so tightly that spacetime has to be described with quantum mechanics, but there are numerous problems with formulating such a theory.  &gt;I am hope full that when a nuclear clock is finally created (much more accurate than an atomic clock) we may start to unwrap some of the mysteries of time.

But in the process, you get rid of the negotiators involved in drug\/treatment cost negotiations, and instead the government will just pay whatever the cost is without thinking about it, again because the government doesn't have significant means to fight for cost savings.

If you invest in yen and try to use it in another country, it is very likely most places will not accept the currency unless you are willing to trade at a decent or significant loss. So that investment makes no sense because it is unusable until converted, which requires a person willing to trade it.

In that case, mlms make the world function......  A ponzi scheme requires there to be an exaggerated or novalue behind the product being bought or sold. If everyone just held their stocks, (thus demand for buying stocks just froze), then people would sell their stocks (potentially liquidating the company) or stock holders would then demand dividends. Either way, there is value behind the product (ownership) being exchanged...  And yes, companies do typically buy back stock during recession (the opposite of dilluting) to manage stock prices, which is based on the majority of stock holders decision.\nExplainee: The difference with wholesalers, is that there is intrinsic value, i.e. Food, water, etc. Stocks don't have intrinsic value. And there's competition for the same objecrlt, e.g. Tomatoes. MLMs don't have competition, because you buy it from the company only.

Maybe the analogy is not the best to price your point, but you can easily ensure you have sales before purchasing.   Also, you have the intrinsic value of apples which you can eat (I assume you're not allergic to it). So even though you may lose some of your money (the apples rot) you're guaranteed a certain level of return regardless. Hell, even rotten apples can be turned into compost for further loss mitigation. There's so much more flexibility there.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Point 1. You are correct. But that's not different in investing in nike shoes or luxury bags to resell later. The value of the stock comes from perception rather than anything thay can be more objectively discerned (dividends). E.g. Nike shoes are inherently shoes, so they have a level of intrinsic value. But is it worth 1k, is a matter of perception.  Point 2. Actually that highlights my point. If you invest in yen and try to use it in another country, it is very likely most places will not accept the currency unless you are willing to trade at a decent or significant loss. So that investment makes no sense because it is unusable until converted, which requires a person willing to trade it.   Furthermore, from another comment, someone said that money is useless until spent, which I fully agree with.

The thing is that in most of them, the mayority of the land mass will be found in the northern hemisphere (for example, in the Amasia hypothesis, all the land mass is on the northern hemisphere except for the Antarctica).

Too much damage to cellular structures can cause the cell to destroy itself, as can too much damage to DNA. This is why bad sunburn causes skin to peel off, the epidermal and dermal layers received enough damage to decide they need to kill themselves for the greater good. However, if DNA is damaged in certain ways, it can lead to cancer. It's not that DNA can't be repaired at all, it's that it is the \"master program\" for the cell and can be modified in ways that make the cell do things that it isn't supposed to.   You can also receive too much damage to important cells like in organs. It's actually therapeutic in some situations, such as using radioactive iodine to destroy some of a large thyroid, but many organs are not good at regenerating so the damage can hamper their functionality.\nExplainee: Never really thought about it that way.

The best I can do for ELI5: using transistors you can build logic gates. Using logic gates you can build logical functions. Transistors can also control which logic gates get activated based on a given input. You change which transistors are activated by sending signals to certain CPU pins in a certain order.

The added complexity *in some contexts* clearly makes life more able to sustain itself, otherwise it wouldn't evolve. In places where it is not useful, it does not evolve. This is why viruses are simple - they don't benefit from added complexity.  As for exactly how they work, they take advantage of the complexity in their hosts. The complicated things like growing and protecting oneself and getting food and reproducing are all handled by the host cell. *Somebody* has to do those things, and the virus simply allows the host cell to do them. Viruses don't even really understand how to make more viruses - they simply turn themselves over to the advanced machinery of the host and allow the host to use its own 'knowledge' of replication to make more virus.\nExplainee: I get that viruses are simple because they dont benefit from added complexity, but I mean in terms of chemistry even viruses are incredibly complex compared to the elements on the periodic table.

A von Neumann machine is a machine that can replicate itself by first building a body and 'downloading' the blueprint for that body into it allowing the new body to then replicate again.

Too much damage to cellular structures can cause the cell to destroy itself, as can too much damage to DNA. This is why bad sunburn causes skin to peel off, the epidermal and dermal layers received enough damage to decide they need to kill themselves for the greater good. However, if DNA is damaged in certain ways, it can lead to cancer. It's not that DNA can't be repaired at all, it's that it is the \"master program\" for the cell and can be modified in ways that make the cell do things that it isn't supposed to.   You can also receive too much damage to important cells like in organs. It's actually therapeutic in some situations, such as using radioactive iodine to destroy some of a large thyroid, but many organs are not good at regenerating so the damage can hamper their functionality.\nExplainee: Never really thought about it that way. So skin cells \"voluntarily\" end it because probably evolutionarily speaking, the ones who didn't, developed cancer more often, limiting their own baby production.

Maybe that's a reason car manufacturers design their transmission systems to withstand this practice. It's possible they know most drivers will do it and they want to ensure the car's longevity. ","1":"No, I don't think I am wrong on this issue. However, the consequences of skipping gears depend on several factors such as the specific car you're driving, the conditions you're driving in, and your familiarity with the car. While it may be a common practice in certain circumstances, it's generally not recommended as it can potentially lead to unnecessary wear and tear on your transmission over time.","2":"Yes, there is a space around most organs called the body cavities. For females, the main body cavity is the abdominal cavity which contains organs like the uterus, ovaries, and the bladder, among others. The organs are usually kept in place by things like ligaments and muscles, but they have room to move slightly due to this. However, some organs like the lung are suspended in place within the chest cavity by a framework of connective tissues, called the mediastinum. In regards to the bladder, it is located in the lower abdomen, behind the pubic bone and in front of the rectum. It stores urine until it's full, and when it's full, the muscles in the bladder walls contract to push the urine out through the urethra. In some women, especially as they age or after childbirth, the muscles supporting the bladder can weaken, causing a condition called stress urinary incontinence \u2013 when urine leaks out, even when not urinating, like your mom experienced. It's not awful or dangerous, just inconvenient, but it can be managed with lifestyle changes and sometimes medications or surgical procedures.","3":"I think the reason you're advocating looking at the RPM when changing gears is based on the idea of optimizing performance. When you skip gears, you're not following the optimal revving pattern for engines, which can potentially lead to less efficient energy usage and increased wear on certain parts. While the effects might be subtle and not a concern for casual driving, there's always room for improvement and more efficient driving techniques.","4":"So, the question about a 13-year-old girl's readiness to raise a child doesn't have a straightforward biological answer. While she may be physically capable, the question involves psychological, social, and legal factors that are beyond biology. Biology can tell us what is physically possible for the girl, but it can't address her emotional preparedness, the quality of care she could provide, or the societal and legal implications of her having a child at that age.","5":"Substances at the same pressure and moving with the same kinetic energy won't necessarily move the turbine the same amount because not all kinetic energy is converted to mechanical energy in the turbine. The efficiency of the turbine depends on the temperature (in this case, the boiling point) of the substance. A higher temperature substance will deposit more energy into the moving paddles, thereby making them move faster, and hence producing more mechanical energy, which is converted to electrical energy.","6":"The name 'Noble Gases' isn't a reference to aristocrats, but to the noble metals (such as gold, silver, and platinum). These elements are stable and don't react with other elements easily, much like these gases. They are called these gases because they complete their valence shell and thus are electronically stable, making them less likely to form compounds, hence the name 'noble'.","7":null,"8":"No, it's very unlikely that there will be a 9th row. The process of creating new elements gets progressively more difficult and requires more advanced technology. As you can see from the time it took to discover the elements in the 7th row, it would take a significant amount of time, technological advancements, and resources to create elements in a potential 9th row.","9":"Yes, it is possible that elements with higher atomic numbers may take even longer to discover. The search for new elements becomes increasingly challenging as we move towards the heavier elements due to their shorter half-lives and the need for more advanced technology. Current predictions suggest that it could take several centuries before we reach element #10,000, if the search continues at the current pace.","10":"I guess it's like they're taking the absurdity of Southpark and making it the reality we live in.","11":"The flu didn't completely disappear in 2020 as you thought. However, its cases dramatically decreased due to preventive measures like social distancing, wearing masks, and quarantining to control the spread of Covid-19. This led to a significant decrease in flu cases, but 47 cases in a year can still potentially spread if not handled properly.","12":"You're underestimating the complexity and adaptability of the flu virus, and overconfident in our abilities to eliminate it. And no, influenza can survive on surfaces for a considerable amount of time.","13":"Given that science is based on observation, it cannot disprove those theories, but it also cannot prove them wrong, because they do not conform to the evidence we have. Science can only work within the confines of observable and measurable phenomena. It's important to be skeptical and question the evidence, but it's equally important to base conclusions on evidence, not personal biases or emotions.","14":"Apoptosis, or programmed cell death, is a natural mechanism in our bodies to prevent the growth of damaged or malfunctioning cells. While this process helps maintain a balance in healthy cells, it also means that some cells, especially those with damaged DNA, might not be able to reproduce, which can lead to cell death and potentially contribute to the development of diseases such as cancer.","15":"Exposure to high levels of radiation can increase the risk of cancer due to DNA damage. The DNA damage can lead to mutations that may cause uncontrolled cell growth, a key characteristic of cancer. However, the body has mechanisms to repair DNA damage and prevent cancer development. In cases where the damage is extensive, or the repair mechanisms are not enough, the cell might die to prevent further damage or the potential development of cancer.","16":"The 'off'ness refers to the lack of exact synchronization among the three notes in a chord, a characteristic that's particularly noticeable when playing multiple identical notes simultaneously. This is because the human ear is attuned to perceiving consistency in such situations, expecting perfect harmony. However, when a slight dissonance is introduced, as in the case of triplets, it creates an 'off' sound.","17":"The growth of hair in the genital area is a sign of sexual maturity for both boys and girls during puberty. While girls may experience more noticeable physical changes, the growth of pubic hair is a common occurrence for boys as well. It can be removed or not, depending on personal preference.","18":null,"19":"It might be helpful then to start with a general practitioner, who can assess your symptoms and recommend further steps, such as a referral to a sleep specialist or a mental health professional, if necessary.","20":"If you boil a sponge, the heat causes the water inside the sponge to superheat. When you try to break this surface tension that the superheated water forms, the water suddenly cools and vaporizes, causing an explosion. That's why you should never boil a sponge to sanitize it.","21":"I'd rather be called a republican for pointing out hypocrisy than be the hypocrite. If you take that as an insult, it's on you.","22":"I'm saying I don't see any correlation between the topic of the conversation (gaming micro-purchases) and your political leanings, and it doesn't change the fact that bringing up my political identity was unnecessary and a poor attempt to deflect the conversation from the initial point.","23":"When firing electrical signals, neurons in your brain communicate using neurotransmitters. Those complex interactions of electrical signals and chemical reactions are what give rise to your thoughts, feelings, and consciousness.","24":"However, your assertions about Oppenheimer, the Manhattan Project, and the Nazis' atomic bomb are incorrect. Oppenheimer was a key figure in the development of the atomic bomb, and there's no evidence to support the theories you've mentioned about him trying to sell out the Soviets or the Nazis detonating an atomic bomb. The reason the Americans didn't nuke Japan until after Germany was 'defeated' was due to strategic reasons, not because of any Nazi bomb. The Nazis indeed had some enriched uranium, but they didn't have a functional atomic bomb, which was mostly due to Heisenberg's incorrect calculations. This miscalculation was rectified when he was found with a lump of cadmium near an open nuclear reactor, as I previously mentioned.","25":"I see your point, but let me share some evidence with you that I think will help clarify the situation. The original plans for the Nazi atomic bomb project actually called for the use of a smaller amount of uranium than the one they ended up using. The reason they did this was because of a calculation error in the initial design. You can find the original notes and calculations, if you'd like to look at them for yourself. This suggests that, if they had succeeded in building the bomb, it would have been much less powerful than a modern atomic bomb. This is in line with the evidence we have about the relative success of the atomic bomb program compared to other Nazi technological projects.","26":"Well, even if they had checked, they might not have realized the exact quantity required as Heisenberg was not able to predict the precise amount of uranium needed to create a critical mass. Additionally, the conditions under which the chain reaction would occur in a nuclear reactor are complex and would have required extensive calculations. It's possible that, despite their efforts, they still would have made a mistake due to the inherent uncertainty in the process.","27":"Well, I think you've found a catchy tune to stick with me for a really long time then!","28":"You should try to play the entire song and see if it helps. Sometimes that works for me.","29":"Investment banking is a key part of the financial services sector. It involves helping clients (usually corporations, governments, and institutions) to access various forms of capital and financing. This includes advising on mergers, acquisitions, and initial public offerings (IPOs), providing market intelligence, and executing trades on behalf of the clients (known as market making). In terms of market making, it involves acting as a broker to buy and sell securities (stocks, bonds, etc.) in the secondary market. This helps maintain liquidity, provide prices for securities, and reduce the volatility of prices. To do this, investment banks act as both buyers and sellers and constantly buy and sell securities to balance the supply and demand. As you're focusing on market making, it might be helpful for you to learn about how investment banks execute trades, the types of orders and securities they deal with, and the risks and regulations they must adhere to.","30":"Exactly, the political orientation of a regulation can depend on both the specific policies it enacts and the broader ideological perspective that guides its creation. In the case of labor unions, a regulation may be considered as left-wing if it supports workers' rights and collective bargaining, but it might be seen as right-wing if it restricts these rights or promotes the interests of employers over those of workers.","31":"You're right, it might seem that way, but the physical processes in your brain are what give rise to your thoughts, feelings, and personality. It's a complex process, but essentially, electrical signals called neurons fire in specific patterns to create thoughts. Your 'animalistic brain' and 'higher thoughts' are all part of the same neural network. Neuroscientists believe that the structure and connections of your brain play a significant role in shaping your thoughts, feelings, and conscious experiences. However, it's important to remember that while the brain is a physical organ, understanding consciousness is still a topic of ongoing research and debate among scientists.","32":null,"33":"because the generic version of Dave isn't directly infringing on the trademark of the original product by having a similar name, but rather creating a separate brand with its own distinct packaging and marketing. Also, it's legal to make products that are comparative to other popular brands as long as they're not using exact names or logos. This allows companies to offer cheaper alternatives while still ensuring brand recognition for the original product.","34":"And I'm still waiting for you to provide a biological reason why humans aren't ready for kids at puberty, while animals are. Yes, there might be some social reasons, but you haven't provided any evidence for those, only stated your opinion. Your question was specifically about the biological reasons, and the arguments you've provided so far have not addressed that. It would be helpful if you clarified your question to include the social aspects you're interested in, as well, so I can better understand your request.","35":"However, the stigma around strippers might be more pronounced because their work is seen as more overtly sexual, while cheerleading is considered more athletic. This perception contributes to the societal valuation of them as workers, with strippers often being seen negatively and cheerleaders being seen as more acceptable, even though both jobs involve a degree of sexualisation.","36":"It's rooted in societal norms and moral judgments. Historically, society has viewed sex work as immoral and exploitative, although this perspective is shifting in some communities.","37":"In digital, signals are represented in two levels (binary), either 0 or 1. Analog, on the other hand, can have any value between 0 and 255 (continuous signal). The difference lies in how they interpret and manipulate the signals.","38":"Analog signals actually take a continuous range of values. Let's say you have an instrument that measures temperature. Instead of only showing on or off states, it can show any value between, say, 0 degrees Celsius and 100 degrees Celsius. That's the advantage of analog - it can represent a range of values, which is important for things like music, where nuances make a difference.","39":"Space appears dark because it's a vacuum, which means there are no molecules or particles to scatter light (except for occasional cosmic dust). Thus, sunlight sent from Earth can't reach other parts of space because there's nothing for it to interact with.","40":"Also, alchemy is a pseudoscience and not a viable method for creating gold or any other valuable substance. Moreover, the scientific method and the technological advancements we have today could never be replicated by individual efforts. You would require a team of scientists, a huge amount of resources, and a well-equipped lab to even come close to creating something like gold through the modern scientific processes.","41":"Yes, because the flu shot not only protects you from getting the flu, but it also helps reduce the spread of the disease, which is especially important for individuals who can't get vaccinated, such as young children, pregnant women, and people with weakened immune systems. Therefore, by getting vaccinated, you're not only protecting yourself, but also helping to protect those who may be more vulnerable.","42":"Many people do have a primary care physician or a family doctor whom they visit regularly for check-ups and general health concerns. If you don't have one, you can always consult a healthcare provider, such as a pediatrician or an internist, based on your age and medical needs.","43":"Water on Earth isn't a constant. Although the total amount of water in the ocean remains fairly consistent, the amount of fresh water available for human use can fluctuate greatly due to factors like evaporation, precipitation, and human use. So, when we waste water, we're reducing the amount of fresh water available for human consumption, agriculture, and other needs.","44":null,"45":"Well, a period is when a female's body sheds the lining of the uterus because a fertilized egg didn't implant itself. The uterus lining thickens in preparation for the possibility of a fertilized egg attaching to it. If the egg doesn't attach, hormone levels drop, leading to the lining breaking down and shedding. This is what we call a period.","46":"The vaginal canal and the external vagina are different parts of the female reproductive system. The vaginal canal is located internally and is a flexible, muscular canal, while the external vagina is the visible part outside of a woman's body. It's important to understand they are separate but connected structures.","47":"Many people do, but it's not uncommon for others to not have a regular doctor. If you don\u2019t have one, you can consider finding a primary care physician to guide you through health matters.","48":"The 'off'ness' you're hearing is due to the triplets being played slightly ahead or behind their marked spots, which creates a rhythmic inconsistency or syncopation that is intentionally used in some types of music.","49":"But it's important to understand how these beauty norms evolved and why they exist, as that understanding can help us combat them and support each other in embracing our unique features.

The situation is complex and requires careful planning, funding, and collaboration to successfully address.","55":"If there's no magic involved, as you claim, then it should be possible to find an explanation for consciousness in terms of subatomic particles and physics. Currently, we don't have a comprehensive explanation, but it doesn't mean there won't be one in the future. Pursuing the idea of consciousness as a material phenomenon seems more scientifically plausible than assuming it's caused by a supernatural entity.","56":"Influenza did not disappear entirely in 2020. Instead, the number of flu cases significantly decreased due to the COVID-19 pandemic precautions, such as social distancing, mask-wearing, and increased hygiene, which had a rippling effect on the spread of influenza. However, with the easing of restrictions, there is a possibility that the number of flu cases may increase again.","57":null,"58":"The age requirement for the presidency is set based on the Constitution, as it stated that the President must be at least 35 years of age and have been a U.S. citizen for at least 14 years.

The mathematics used today to solve complex problems often handles extremely large numbers, or, in some cases, the concept of limits that approach infinity, without explicitly using the infinite number itself.","65":"Well, non-dividend shares usually don't provide immediate returns in the form of dividends. Instead, their value appreciates over time based on the performance of the company. Dilution refers to the decreasing value of existing shares when a company issues more shares, spreading the ownership among more shareholders. If the company grows and becomes more valuable, even with dilution, the value of your shares can still increase. MLMs and Ponzi schemes are illegal pyramid schemes where the majority of the cash inflows go to early participants, not as a result of selling a product or service, but by recruiting new members to buy in.","66":"While MLMs do have products with some intrinsic value, the value is primarily derived from selling the products to others, rather than owning a piece of the company or its assets. In contrast, for wholesalers, the value comes from owning a portion of the material goods. Additionally, the competition in the stock market is between different companies, each selling stocks representing their assets and ownership. This competition drives the stock values, and there is no similar competition in MLMs since the products can only be bought from the company.","67":"This is akin to mlms, where the representatives take the risk of selling products directly to consumers. However, their success depends on the consumers' demand for the products, and if the demand drops, they might end up with unsold products, just like the rotting apples.","68":"In a traditional business or investment, you can sell your apples (or stocks) on a market where there is demand. If there is no demand, you can choose not to sell, or lower the price to attract buyers. In an mlm, the selling process is often dependent on recruiting others to sell under you. If no one is recruited, there is no one to sell to, and the apples (or products) remain unsold.","69":"Squaring numbers and square roots have a connection to the real world through geometry.

Let's focus on the main discussion now.","74":"So, you claimed not to have seen 'facts' but you seem to have seen a comment about number 1? Can you explain?","75":"Yes, the term 'Devil's Advocate' simply means arguing against a popular view or position, it does not imply that the person advocating is necessarily evil or promoting evil. The reason the person is labeled as the 'Devil's Advocate' is that their argument is seen as opposing what is generally accepted as 'good' or 'right'.","76":"For a computer to 'learn', we are talking about a subset of computer science known as Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence. The computer doesn't literally learn in the human sense, but through algorithms and statistical models it can adapt to new data and make decisions or predictions based on this data. This process of the computer adapting can be thought of as 'learning' even though it's essentially just crunching numbers.","77":"Well, P works by examining M's code and detecting any potential loopholes that M might try to exploit. This is not cheating because it's simply M's own code being used against it. M could have chosen to make its code more robust, but it didn't, and now it's paying the price. That's the logic behind P's behavior.","78":"For instance, if one says 'All Scotsman hate haggis', and another says 'But some Scotsman I know love haggis', the 'No True Scotsman' fallacy occurs when the first person retorts 'Well, then they aren't true Scotsman.' This is problematic because the distinction of who qualifies as a 'true Scotsman' is completely subjective, yet it is used to dismiss the second person's argument without any real grounds.","79":"They are just making something up, without any basis in reality or logic, just like in your example.","80":"It depends on whether or not your group meets the legal requirements to be recognized as a union. Typically, this involves a majority of employees agreeing to join and being represented by union representatives. If it meets these requirements, even Walmart has to recognize it as a union and grant collective bargaining rights.

The question of consciousness and what happens when we die is a complex one that science is still trying to unravel. Until we have definitive answers, it's essential to maintain an open mind and continue asking questions, rather than jumping to conclusions based on current understanding.","90":null,"91":null,"92":"So you may have misunderstood the question. It was not about modern teenagers, but rather about humans in general reaching sexual maturity before they are able to fully take care of the children they might have, unlike other mammals. Even early humans might not have had all the things you mentioned, despite being considered as tribes.","93":"You haven't acknowledged the responses from other people that provided sound biological explanations. While it is true that some answers were framed in a social context, your initial premise that humans are not ready for children while animals are is based on a misunderstanding of biology. Your statement about the 'only social answers' contradicts your earlier assertion that there was a 'decent mix of answers that I saw', indicating a change in your original viewpoint. Now, it seems you are trying to shift the focus back to the biological aspects again, but it is important to address that the question itself was flawed in its assumption and any answers provided should be viewed in that light.","94":"In most cases, the energy of the emitted particles is not sufficient to force a reverse reaction. An already decayed Uranium atom won't turn back into Thorium through such interactions. The exceptions would be in cases of nuclear reactions induced by a high energy particle, such as neutrons, which can cause further nuclear reactions. This is common in nuclear reactors and some types of radiation therapy.","95":"The halting problem refers to the conjecture that there is no general algorithm to determine in advance, without running the program, whether a given program will run forever or terminate. It was proven by Alan Turing that a decision procedure for the halting problem does not exist. However, the self-referential proof demonstrates the halting problem by creating a program that can only find its own solution if it does not loop infinitely.","96":"The diagonalization proof in Cantor's theorem doesn't rely on a specific optimal method to generate the list; instead, it demonstrates that regardless of the generation method, there will always be numbers not accounted for due to the creation of the diagonal. This proof is derived from the relationship between countable infinite sets (like integers) and uncountable infinite sets (like real numbers). Your intuition may suggest a possibility, but the mathematical proof shows that the diagonalization argument is indeed valid, regardless of the optimization in list generation.","97":null,"98":"Since wood, being highly flammable, would burn much quicker than stone.

The more familiar you are with a song, the easier it is for it to become an earworm.","104":"Actually, reducing the speed or stopping the engines requires deceleration, which requires energy. The amount of energy needed to stop a relativistic spacecraft is enormous, as its kinetic energy is immense due to its high speed. Slowing down also generates a lot of heat, and the spacecraft's structure might not withstand it. Hence, it's impractical to simply slow down whenever you're close to your destination.","105":"The reason this doesn't happen is due to the Earth's rotation and the way atmospheric pressure works. The Earth rotates and this creates an effect called the Coriolis force, which causes the wind to spiral around high- and low-pressure systems instead of blowing directly as the difference in temperature between the equator and poles causes air pressure to vary. The Coriolis force causes the air to blow from high-pressure areas to low-pressure areas. Because of this effect, the heavier gases, such as CO2, are not kept at the bottom. Besides, the concentration of CO2 in our atmosphere is only 400 ppm, and we would not feel its effects until the concentration reaches 40,000 ppm, which is far from our current levels.","106":"Analog signals can take on any value within a certain range. They are continuous signals, meaning they can change gradually over time or space. In contrast, digital signals can only take on discrete values, usually limited to 0 or 1, based on whether a switch is open or closed.","107":"Water gets wasted in several ways such as leakage in pipes, overuse in agriculture, industries using too much for their operations, and also by individuals doing activities like leaving taps running unnecessarily. These activities can lead to less fresh water available, increased cost of production and treatment, and also affects the water ecosystem and biodiversity. That's why we are told not to waste water.","108":" The desalination of seawater is an energy-intensive process that requires large amounts of energy to extract fresh water. This process produces a large amount of brine, a highly saline waste product that can harm marine ecosystems if discharged back into the ocean. Desalinated water also lacks essential minerals naturally found in fresh water, and can lead to the depletion of groundwater resources. Furthermore, desalination plants have high capital and operating costs, making them relatively expensive to construct and maintain.","109":"Actually, I was referring to the astute need in terms of the requirement for a detailed and comprehensive understanding of a concept or skill.

This is different from normal ammo, which has a lead bullet core covered by a thin layer of a softer metal like copper. The full metal jacket bullet is designed to primarily penetrate through the target and retain its shape. That is why it is often used for military applications, where the goal is to penetrate through armored targets. On the other hand, normal ammo is designed to expand on impact, making it more effective for hunting or self-defense, where the goal is to stop the target as quickly and humanely as possible.","118":"The 7.62-38 may not pierce through material as the 5.56 does, but it is heavier and would do more damage to the target upon impact.

However, the majority of them are unstable and decay quickly. There are 118 confirmed elements and, as of now, element 119 has been synthesized but has not been officially recognized by the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC). Creating new elements beyond that requires even more extreme conditions and energies. The total number of possible elements is not infinite but is difficult to determine precisely as it depends on various factors such as nuclear bonds and stability. So it is certainly possible to create new elements, but creating many elements beyond 119 and establishing their stability is challenging and beyond our current technological capabilities.","121":"I'm glad you asked about that. While eliminating private insurance middlemen would reduce certain costs, it's important to consider that those savings may be offset by other factors. If the government doesn't have a profit motive, it may not be as vigilant in identifying and implementing cost-cutting measures as a private insurance company would. Additionally, bureaucratic red tape and the complexities of managing such a large system can contribute to inefficiencies, which could potentially drive up costs.","122":"Right now, billionaires and millionaires do generate revenue for the economy, but their wealth is often disproportionate to the average person's wealth. When wealth becomes concentrated in relatively few hands, it can exacerbate income inequality in society. This can lead to a lack of opportunities for those who are less well-off, as the resources required to start businesses or purchase assets can become out of reach. Additionally, when a small percentage of people hold a large portion of the wealth, it can stifle economic growth and innovation overall. A more equitable distribution of wealth can lead to a more stable and prosperous society for everyone.","123":null,"124":"As for your question about element 10,000, that's purely speculative since we're far beyond the limits of our current understanding and capabilities. However, considering the time it took to find elements 95-118 and the challenges involved, it's safe to say that the discovery rate would significantly slow down. It's difficult to predict, but it could potentially take many, many centuries to find that number of elements.","125":"Government borrows money to fund its expenditure, which is more than its tax revenue.

The ocean water is not a suitable long-term storage solution, and there is a risk of contamination to the food chain within hours of disposal.","127":"When you buy non-dividend shares, the value comes from the potential increase in the share price. This is because as the company grows, its market value increases, and so does the value of your shares. This is known as capital appreciation. Unlike collectibles and inventory, however, you can also have voting rights as a shareholder, which can give you some influence over company decisions.","128":"companies can choose between reinvesting their profits into the growth of the company (which increases its value) or distributing a portion of the profits to shareholders in the form of dividends. Dilution can become a concern if a company issues too many new shares, reducing the value of existing shares. It is not necessarily a bad thing if done strategically to fund growth.","129":"MLMs, on the other hand, don't have intrinsic value, as you're selling a product that has no inherent value apart from what the company says it's worth. Also, unlike stocks, the 'competition' in MLMs is within the network of sellers, not between different companies.","130":"Also, the intrinsic value argument for wholesalers doesn't hold up, as the apples (or any product) could be of lower quality or spoiled before delivery, resulting in a loss for the wholesaler. In the case of a MLM, the product is not perishable, which alleviates this risk. However, the main difference lies in the structure of the business model. In a MLM, distributors are also forced to buy and sell a product, often at inflated prices, to achieve profits, while wholesalers usually buy and sell a product for profit within a competitive market.","131":"In such cases, individual investors who own a small percentage of shares might not have a significant impact on the major strategic decisions, but they can still make their opinions heard through other means such as shareholder activism, proxy voting, or participating in shareholder meetings. They can also sell their stocks if they are unhappy with the company's performance or decisions.","132":"Here's a bit about the theory: According to Quantum Mechanics and General Relativity, the fundamental building blocks of the universe may not be pointlike particles, but rather minuscule regions of space-time called Planck lengths. This length is calculated using fundamental parameters of the universe like gravity's constant (G), the speed of light (c), and the reduced Planck's constant (h). Specifically, Planck length is the square root of the product of the Planck constant over G and the square of the speed of light.","133":"Planck time is the smallest possible unit of time in the gravity's planck length and the Plank's constant's reciprocal. In other words, this is the time taken for light to travel a distance equal to the Plank's length.","134":"A plane doesn't fly on the bottom of the globe, it flies above the globe's surface. The planet's curvature causes the Earth to appear round when viewed from space, so if a plane is flying east, it would appear to be flying 'level,' but if viewed from the north or south, it would appear to be at an angle. This is a commonly misunderstood concept, often due to the way maps flatten the Earth, giving us the impression that it's flat.","135":"by misdirecting the discussion from Apple\u2019s security to Android\u2019s vulnerabilities when it's not relevant to the current conversation","136":null,"137":"There isn't direct evidence, but in the past, government-run healthcare systems have had higher administrative costs compared to private insurance companies, which is a significant portion of healthcare costs. This is due to a variety of factors, such as the lack of a profit motive leading to less emphasis on cost-savings, bureaucratic red tape, and inefficiencies in managing large numbers of people and resources. However, it's worth noting that the potential savings from eliminating the private insurance middlemen could offset some of these costs to a certain extent.","138":"In the case of MLMs, the apples are the products that you're selling, and the grocers are the customers who may or may not want to buy them. The main difference is that you're not just selling the apples, but also the opportunity to sell more apples (or recruit more sellers) to make a profit. This creates a vicious cycle where you're not just selling apples, but also selling the idea of selling apples to others. In traditional business, if your products don't sell, you can pivot, create new products, or adapt your strategy. In MLMs, if your sales decline, it's often difficult to adjust because your income is tied to the sales of a larger network, not just your own efforts. Also, the value of apples can be easily determined by their weight and quality, whereas the value of goods in MLMs can be much more subjective and dependent on recruitment and sales targets.","139":"It's possible that flamboyant behavior in males is strongly influenced by their upbringing and societal expectations. So, if a straight male is raised by flamboyant parents, he may be more likely to exhibit similar characteristics.\n","140":"The market wouldn't react immediately because the new shells you've found aren't part of the existing supply. However, if you decide to use these new shells circulate them in the market, there will be an increase in supply of shells which might cause deflation. If the supply increase exceeds the demand, people might stop using shells as money as they become less valuable. This is similar to the effect of a central bank printing more money, which can lead to inflation if the increased quantity of money outpaces the increased demand, thus reducing the value of the money.","141":null,"142":"When a company decides to distribute its profits to stockholders, it does so by paying dividends. However, not all companies pay dividends, especially if they believe that reinvesting the profits can provide greater returns for the shareholders in the long run. In such cases, instead of paying dividends, the company may choose to reinvest the profits back into the company to finance its growth, improve its infrastructure, or develop new products or services. Jeff Bezos' wealth is not solely dependent on the sale of his shares, but also on the appreciation in the value of Amazon as a whole. If Amazon continues to grow and increase its value, the shares that Jeff Bezos still owns will also increase in value, making him wealthier.","143":"Well, not everyone who buys stocks get immediate dividends. Dividends are usually announced by the company's management and are typically based on factors like the company's earnings, financial needs, and the number of shares you own. Also, not all companies distribute dividends and Jeff Bezos's wealth is primarily from Amazon's growth and appreciation of his stocks, not just from dividends.","144":"The basic building blocks of life, such as proteins and nucleic acids, formed through a process called abiogenesis. This is the natural process by which life arose from inanimate matter. Over long periods of time (billions of years), these building blocks combined and recombined in various ways, eventually leading to complex macromolecules and eventually the first living cells. These primitive cells had the ability to reproduce, which is the key to life as we know it. As for the tendency to self-replicate, it's a characteristic passed down through generations of these primitive cells, and it's what kept them stable and perpetuated their survival.","145":"The 'rudimantary von Neumann machine' is a hypothetical self-replicating system proposed by a mathematician named John von Neumann. This theoretical system is thought to have evolved over time, developing more complex instructions or 'programs'. These programs were not designed but came into existence due to chemical interactions and random combinations of molecules, which, when combined over a very long period of time, could give rise to the complex sequence of instructions we know as DNA. While it's a complex and unlikely process unfathomable to us currently, it's believed that due to the sheer number of molecular interactions happening every second in the early ocean environment, such an event eventually occurred by sheer chance.","146":"Yes, it could be possible that I am wrong on this issue. It's generally considered inadvisable to skip gears unless specifically designed for in some specific cases, like racing or in certain vehicles. However, in everyday driving, it's often recommended to avoid it as it can lead to premature wear on the car's components and might affect fuel efficiency.","147":"I'm sorry if my previous response didn't address your concern, but as a tutor, I have to clarify that I was merely using an example to explain the meaning of 'astute need' from our earlier conversation.

I'm sorry if my responses came across as rude or dismissive, that was not my intention. Let's continue the conversation focusing on the practicalities and possible solutions for methane capture in the arctic.","154":"Well, to put it bluntly, your proposed solution is not practical nor economically viable. Vacuuming methane gas as it comes out of the ground would require a massive infrastructure that would likely cost more than the potential benefit.

It has a nuclear structure that doesn't allow it to decay. This means there will never be a change in lead's atomic number, and it will never be added to any future periodic rows. The number of groups in the periodic table is fixed because it's based on the discovery and properties of the elements, not a prediction of future elements. Groups 1 through 18 are well-established, and no changes are expected.","170":"The concept of a 9th period is not yet feasible according to our current understanding of the periodic table. While it's possible that new elements could be discovered in the future, it's highly unlikely that there will be a 9th row due to the inherent instability and short half-lives of the elements closer to the bottom of the table.","171":"Mendelev's periodic table was only based on the first 66 elements that were known at his time.

The board of directors is responsible for making major decisions about the company's direction, including whether to issue dividends. However, your idea of automatically reinvesting dividends is an interesting one. Some companies do offer dividend reinvestment plans (DRIPs), which allow shareholders to reinvest their dividends instantly, but this is different from the company's decision to pay dividends. Concerning your points about dilution and ponzi schemes, it's important to note that dilution refers to the decrease in the ownership's stake in the company due to the issuance of new shares. While it may seem counterintuitive, dilution can also create more opportunities for existing shareholders to profit from the growth of the company. Ponzi schemes and MLMs are deceptive financial schemes that promise high returns to early investors using funds from later investors instead of real earnings. A legitimate company issuing new shares is not the same as a ponzi scheme. ","182":"In that case, being a wholesaler (MLM) is similar to being in an MLM in the sense that both involve buying a product directly from a company and then reselling it to consumers or other businesses. The main difference is that with a traditional wholesale business, you're selling tangible goods that have intrinsic value and can be bought and sold on the open market. In contrast, an MLM product's value is based on its potential for profit earned through recruiting new members, rather than the product's inherent value. Both models involve taking on the risk that the product won't sell, and both require you to market and sell the product to make a profit.","183":null,"184":"The common cold doesn't reside in any particular place like a body, country, or continent.

This includes the widespread use of masks, social distancing, and increased hand hygiene, which are also effective at preventing the spread of influenza. Additionally, travel restrictions and closed schools have also contributed to the decrease in cases. However, it's important to note that influenza is not gone forever and can come back, especially during the typical flu season. It is possible for 47 people to bring it back if they are infected with the virus and come into contact with others.","217":"It's a virus, so it doesn't have a physical form like other objects. When not in a host (a person), it can exist on surfaces for a short period of time, usually up to 24 hours, especially on objects that are often touched. For instance, doorknobs, light switches, and countertops. The influenza virus can also remain in the air for short periods. When these virus particles come in contact with a host, they can infect the host, multiplying in their body and spreading from there. Eradicating the flu would require constant vigilance, sanitation efforts, and widespread vaccination, as there are many strains of the virus and it mutates somewhat each year. It's also not easily destroyed by most cleaning products, but soap and water or alcohol-based sanitizers can kill it. However, it's important to remember that, despite our best efforts, viruses like influenza will likely always be around, as they are a part of nature and play important roles in maintaining balance within ecosystems.","218":"Life 'wants' to self-replicate because it is a way for its genetic material to be passed on to the next generation, increasing its chances of survival and reproduction. Over billions of years, through processes such as natural selection, life forms have evolved to become increasingly complex to better adapt to their environment and survive. As for viruses, they contain genetic material and are able to replicate using the machinery of the host cell they infect. The process of life developing from simple molecules is still a topic of debate among scientists, but one theory is that molecules with self-replicating abilities began to form and evolved over time into more complex life forms. The formation of such molecules is extremely unlikely, but given the enormous number of molecules constantly forming and breaking down in environments like the early Earth's oceans, it is possible that it occurred.","219":"Originally, simple molecules like amino acids and nucleic acids formed naturally, and over time, through a process called abiogenesis, they combined accidentally to form much more complex molecules, such as proteins and RNA. These complex molecules could then perform more specialized tasks, like self-replication. This was the beginning of what scientists call the 'RNA world', where RNA molecules not only replicated themselves but also functioned as enzymes, genes, and messengers, essentially acting as the first cells. Over billions of years, these early structures evolved into more and more complex programs we now know as DNA and cells.","220":"The rudimentary machine molecule or arrangement of molecules formed a mechanism for replication in a process we now call autocatalysis. This means that certain molecules in the environment can create more of themselves. Over time, these self-replicating molecules began to combine and rearrange in different ways, creating more complex molecules. This process continued until a molecule formed that could carry genetic information effectively - this molecule was the first form of RNA, which evolved into DNA. So, while the exact mechanisms are not known, we believe that the sheer number of molecules and their interactions in a environment like the early earth made it possible for this process to occur.","221":"The attack at Saudi Arabia creates a disruption in the supply of oil, affecting the global market. Since Saudi Aramco is one of the largest oil producers and exporters, this disruption leads to a decrease in the available supply.

Other things that people can become addicted to, such as drugs, gambling, or even collecting certain items, are also considered diseases because they can also result in compulsive, uncontrollable behaviors due to changes in the brain.","228":"Non-metals are another large grouping. They include the halogens, oxygen, nitrogen, chlorine, and others.","229":"One other large grouping is non-metals. For example, carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, and oxygen are all non-metals.","230":null,"231":"I apologize for any confusion. You're correct that from a purely observational perspective, it could seem that the physics would be the same from any vantage point in the universe. However, it's the underlying theories that try to explain this observation that differ. In your case, you're referring to the theory that our galaxy might be the center of the universe, which is not in line with the widely accepted understanding that there is no center due to the homogeneous and isotropic nature of the universe, as per Hubble's theory. This difference in perspective leads to the debate about the role of dark energy.","232":null,"233":"Explainer: Your observation about the evolutionary benefit of cell suicide in preventing cancer is intriguing. In the context of natural selection, cells that don't undergo programmed cell death when damaged can indeed lead to the formation of cancerous cells. This is because damaged cells with altered DNA will undergo uncontrolled growth, often leading to tumors. Therefore, a mechanism to identify and eliminate damaged cells provides a survival advantage.

While a 13-year-old may be physically able to carry a child, there are many other factors to consider, such as emotional maturity, parenting skills, and the potential impact on her personal development and future. This brings us back to the discussion we had earlier about societal norms that influence age requirements for various responsibilities.","5":"The higher temperature substance will deposit more energy into the moving paddles due to its increased kinetic energy, causing them to spin faster and generate more mechanical energy, which is then converted to electrical energy by the turbine. This increased energy deposition results from the molecules possessing greater momentum, leading to a larger force acting upon the paddles, and subsequently, more electrical energy generated.","6":"Uranium's decay process indeed involves radon as an intermediate product. However, it doesn't end there; radon undergoes further transformations.

At the most basic level, when neurons in your brain communicate, they create intricate patterns of electrical signals, which, in conjunction with the release of neurotransmitters, give rise to the complex experiences we perceive as thoughts, feelings, and consciousness. This interplay of electricity and chemistry is a beautiful example of the elegance of the living system.","24":null,"25":"Indeed, it's possible there was an error in their calculations, leading to insufficient uranium. However, if they did calculate correctly and chose to forgo the use of the bomb, it suggests a level of restraint that seems incongruent with their known actions. The question remains, did they know the correct amount and consciously decide not to use it, or was it an oversight?","26":"That's a great query! In reality, even if the Nazis had checked the quantities of uranium, they might still have missed the mark. You see, Heisenberg was unable to accurately predict the specific amount needed for a critical mass. Moreover, the conditions for a chain reaction in a nuclear reactor are intricate and would've necessitated elaborate calculations.

This is achieved through power switching in transistors, where the presence or absence of power sets the binary state. One transistor's activation can either block or allow current to flow through another, resulting in the strong binary states.","38":null,"39":"Space appears dark because it's largely devoid of matter, such as molecules and dust particles, which are required for light to scatter and be visible. Therefore, any sunlight emitted from Earth or other sources does not interact with anything in space, leaving it seemingly black in our perception.","40":"On a more practical note, alchemy, as a pseudoscience, isn't a viable method for producing gold or other precious metals. The scientific method and modern technology we have today are far too complex for individual efforts. Creating gold requires not just a simple switch, but a team of skilled scientists, a well-funded lab, and extensive resources.

By getting vaccinated, you help limit the spread of the disease.","42":"You can either have a primary care physician or a family doctor that you visit for regular check-ups and routine health issues. If you don't have one, you can consider finding a suitable healthcare provider, such as a general practitioner, based on your specific health requirements and age.","43":"Water on Earth is not a constant, as the amount of fresh water, that is suitable for human use, can change due to natural processes like evaporation, precipitation, and human activities. So, when we waste water, we are decreasing the amount of available fresh water for various purposes such as human consumption, agriculture, and others. This leads to water scarcity and water-related challenges.","44":null,"45":"A period is the shedding of the uterine lining because a fertilized egg did not implant itself. This process, known as menstruation, occurs when hormone levels drop after the egg has not been fertilized. The thickened uterine lining prepares the body for potential fertilization, but when that doesn't happen, the layers of the lining break down and are expelled from the body through bleeding. If you'd like to visualize the reproductive system, there are educational diagrams available online that can clarify the process. For a detailed overview of pregnancy and fetal development, consider visiting this resource: <https:\/\/www.webmd.com\/family-pregnancy>","46":"The internal vaginal canal is a flexible, muscular tube, while the exterior vagina is the visible part outside a woman's body. It's crucial to grasp that they are separate yet interconnected structures, forming an integral part of the female reproductive system.","47":"A lot of people have a regular doctor, but not everyone does. If you don't have one, it's beneficial to find a primary care physician. They can help you navigate healthcare decisions, including information on diseases like measles and chicken pox.","48":null,"49":null,"50":"That process cannot be directly answered in this context as the converting of information into pixels is a complex process involving multiple stages and components, including the CPU, GPU, RAM, and the operating system. The CPU calculates numbers, but it doesn't create pixels. Instead, it provides the necessary data to be rendered by the GPU, which then sends the information to the monitor to be displayed as pixels.","51":"However, the average user typically doesn't employ active defense strategies. Instead, they should prioritize traditional security measures like employing strong, unique passwords, enabling two-factor authentication, and keeping their software updated. This approach covers a wide range of potential threats.","52":null,"53":null,"54":null,"55":null,"56":"Influenza did not go away in 2020, but the number of cases significantly decreased due to public health measures associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. These measures, including social distancing, mask-wearing, and increased hygiene, had a noticeable impact on the spread of influenza. As we gradually return to normal activities, it is foreseeable that the number of flu cases may rise again.","57":"While your suggestions about self-isolation and vaccination for minor cases are sensible, it's important to note that the flu is a complex and highly contagious virus. Self-isolation might help reduce transmission, but it would be challenging to enforce on a large scale. Vaccination is also a preventive measure, not a cure, and the flu virus evolves rapidly, making it hard to develop a vaccine that covers all strains. As for your question about airborne and surface transmission, yes, the flu virus can survive on surfaces for several hours and be transmitted through the air, especially in confined spaces. However, the key to managing an outbreak is comprehensive public health measures, including testing, contact tracing, and isolation of infected individuals. Regarding your concern about the potential for 47 cases to balloon into a larger outbreak, you're right that it's possible for a small number of cases to multiply quickly if left unchecked. In fact, this is one of the reasons why it's vital to respond promptly to any signs of flu outbreaks. As for comparing the flu to other viruses like herpes, they are indeed different in many ways, including transmission routes and the long-term effects they have on the body. However, the point remains that public health measures should be in place to minimize the spread of all infectious diseases, not just the flu.","58":null,"59":"Write-in votes are indeed recognized in the U.S. voting system; however, they may not be officially counted until there is substantial support when compared to the major parties' votes, which are tallied automatically.","60":null,"61":"I agree, and that's the principle behind fairness in pay. It's about getting equal compensation for equal work, not for equal results. The focus should be on the effort, not the outcome.","62":"The CPU is designed with a specific arrangement of transistors and other components that allow it to perform certain operations. When it receives a number, like '6', it processes this number and performs mathematic operations such as addition or storing. This is due to the circuit design of the CPU. While the exact workings of these components are quite complex, a basic understanding is that transistors can act as switches, allowing electricity to flow or not depending on the input. Using these switches, you can build simple logic gates, which can then be combined to create more complex logical functions. These combinations of gates can be manipulated by sending electrical signals to specific pins on the CPU, allowing it to execute the desired instructions automatically.","63":"The program would take the number 8 as an index or coordinates and draw a pixel at that specific location in a graphical interface.","64":"Indeed! The development of calculus in the 17th century was a significant turning point in our understanding of infinity. Modern mathematics employs large numbers or the concept of limits to address problems that were previously thought to require infinity, effectively getting as close to infinity as possible. This perspective is grounded in mathematics, not just our understanding of a finite magnitude. While the formal concept of infinity may appear abstract, it plays a vital role in solving many real-world problems.","65":null,"66":"In simple terms, wholesalers and stocks have value because they are products or stocks representing a share in a company's assets. The competition comes from buyers choosing between different companies or stocks within an industry. MLMs, however, depend on selling products within a closed system, without any competitive market, and the value lies more in recruitment than the products themselves. So, while there's a bit of overlap with IPOs, their structure is fundamentally different.","67":"True, comparing wholesalers to MLMs has its limits. Wholesalers deal with tangible products like food and water, whereas MLMs sell goods that are solely distributed by the company. But, for an MLM, the success of its representatives hinges on the consumers' demand for the product, similar to a wholesaler's reliance on grocers to purchase the products. If consumer interest wanes, representatives may find themselves left with excess inventory, much like the situation of a farmer with rotting apples.","68":null,"69":"Squaring numbers and square roots relate to the real world through geometry. The square of a number (e.g., 4) represents the area of a square with side length equal to the square root (e.g., 2), because the area of a square is equal to the side length squared. This fundamental mathematical relationship is crucial for various applications, such as calculating the area of rectangular regions and solving problems related to physical quantities.","70":null,"71":"In response to your point, you're correct that there might be assumptions that I omitted or didn't fully address. For instance, one could argue that a more optimal list generation method might be possible, or that there could be constraints or rules for the list that were not initially specified. However, even if we consider these possibilities, Cantor's diagonalization argument still holds in the absence of these constraints. The diagonalization process demonstrates that no matter how the list is constructed, it cannot possibly contain all real numbers. This is due to the nature of real numbers themselves, which are infinite, and the fact that they can be represented infinitely as a series. The diagonalization process takes advantage of this property to demonstrate the non-existence of such a list.","72":null,"73":"Apologies for any confusion earlier.

The statement I made was broad and could be misconstrued. I agree that a 13-year-old human in the wild without tools, clothes, or food would not survive. However, my primary argument was that the cognitive development of humans matures beyond sexual maturity, providing them with the ability to learn, adapt, and innovate, which are crucial for their survival. It's not just about physical tools, but also the mental ones. ","91":null,"92":null,"93":"You've yet to recognize the biologically grounded responses provided by other individuals.

Instead, it demonstrates that any list generated, including an optimally generated one, can be overtaken by the diagonal. This effect occurs due to the relationship between countable infinite sets (like the set of natural numbers) and uncountable infinite sets (like real numbers). Despite the apparent limitations posed by the diagonalization proof, there are many aspects of set theory and number properties that you might not be familiar with, which could introduce further complexity to your intuition.","97":"However, it's essential to note that the radiation levels from a large-scale release of nuclear material like uranium or plutonium would not suddenly become safe due to dilution in the ocean. Although the concentration might decrease, the radioactive elements would still pose significant long-term risks for marine life and potentially for humans through the food chain. The difference between the A-bombs and Chernobyl lies in the type and amount of radioactive materials released. A-bombs primarily released fission products and neutron activation products, while Chernobyl released a greater variety and larger amounts of these materials, including isotopes with longer half-lives, which led to more extensive contamination.","98":"Indeed, wood, being highly flammable, would burn much quicker than stone. In a cluster of stone houses, since they don't ignite as easily as wood, it significantly reduces the spread of a fire, providing more time for people to evacuate, and for firefighters to arrive and control the fire.","99":"Harvey Weinstein was convicted following an investigation and trial where sufficient evidence was presented.

And regarding the competition, there is indeed competition between companies in the wholesale market, as you mentioned. That's a key difference from MLMs, where the competition is within the network rather than between companies. As for the stocks' lack of intrinsic value, that's a longstanding debate among economists, but it's true that their value is derived from the perceived worth of the company and its financial performance.

These activities lead to several negative effects: less fresh water available, increased cost of production and treatment, and also harm to the water ecosystem and biodiversity. Therefore, it's crucial to conserve water to maintain a healthy environment for all.","108":"Desalination of seawater is an energy-intensive process that requires large amounts of energy to extract fresh water. This process leads to the production of a large amount of brine, a highly saline waste product that can harm marine ecosystems if discharged back into the ocean. Additionally, desalinated water lacks essential minerals naturally found in fresh water and can lead to the depletion of groundwater resources. Moreover, desalination plants have high capital and operating costs, making them relatively expensive to construct and maintain.","109":"I apologize for the confusion earlier.

One significant factor was the persuasive nature of its teachings, which inspired a sense of unity and community. Another factor was the charismatic leadership of figures like Paul, who played a crucial role in spreading Christianity throughout the Mediterranean region. However, perhaps the most important factor was the persecution and martyrdom of believers, which earned Christianity a reputation for being a powerful and resilient force. This, coupled with its emphasis on love, forgiveness, and mercy, made it a compelling alternative to the established Roman religions. By the time Constantine came to power, Christianity had gained significant popularity and a strong following, making it a logical choice to be adopted as the official religion of the Roman Empire.","112":null,"113":null,"114":"I apologize for any tone that may have seemed confrontational.

However, if we consider the unarmored scenario, the 7.62 caliber bullet would likely cause more damage to the target upon impact due to its higher mass.","119":"Addiction, which includes disorders related to alcohol and other substances, is considered a disease. It's a condition that affects the brain's reward system, leading an individual to continue using a substance despite negative consequences. However, being interested in or collecting items like cards does not qualify as an addiction or a disease since it doesn't cause harm or uncontrollable behavior.","120":"Yes, it's theoretically possible to create new elements in high-energy environments like particle accelerators or nuclear reactors. However, most of these elements are unstable and have very short lifespans. Only 118 elements have been recognized, and so far, element 119 has been synthesized but not officially ratified by IUPAC. Creating new elements beyond this is difficult and challenging as it requires extreme conditions and energy. The number of potential elements is not infinity but hard to quantify as it depends on nuclear bonds and stability. So it is possible to create new elements, but creating many beyond 119 and confirming their stability is beyond our current technological means.","121":null,"122":null,"123":"Radon is not at the end of the decay chain during which different isotopes of uranium decay.

It's important to note that Planck time represents the fundamental scale in our understanding of the interplay between quantum mechanics and general relativity, but it doesn't necessarily indicate the smallest possible scale; rather, it's the limit below which these theories become inapplicable.","133":null,"134":null,"135":"That's essentially a form of deflection known as whataboutism, where instead of addressing the topic at hand - Apple's security - the conversation is redirected towards Android's vulnerabilities, which isn't necessarily relevant to the discussion.","136":"The government's lack of competition and negotiating power, as seen in areas like military spending, could lead to increased costs. In the absence of private insurance companies, the government might not have the same leverage to negotiate lower costs, especially in the case of drugs and treatments. This is akin to the problem we see with student loans, where the government's willingness to provide loans without price controls or cost incentives has contributed to the rise in college costs.","137":"Regarding the increase in costs, past studies have shown that government-run healthcare systems often have higher administrative costs compared to private insurers. Reasons behind this include less focus on cost-savings, bureaucratic red tape, and inefficiencies in managing large numbers of people and resources. However, the potential savings from eliminating private insurance intermediaries could help balance these costs.","138":null,"139":"It's worth exploring a variety of factors such as upbringing, societal norms, and individual personality traits.

Have you come across any cases of flamboyant straight males that have peaked your interest or made you question this topic?","140":"The shells you found wouldn't have an immediate impact on the market. But if you introduced these new shells, there could potentially be too many seashells in circulation. This excess supply might devalue the shells and make them less useful as money, similar to what happens when a country experiences inflation due to too much currency in circulation. As for the link between money and a central bank, in most modern economies, money primarily comes into existence through the issuance of loans, which banks manage digitally, rather than through physical printing.","141":"In simple terms, the government borrows money to fund public spending and investments, which stimulates the economy. The money doesn't go away or get destroyed. Instead, it gets circulated. When the central bank buys the government bonds issued, it's not necessarily inflationary. However, if the government's spending exceeds the economy's capacity to produce goods and services, it can lead to inflation. For a deeper understanding, I'd recommend reading books like David Graeber's Debt: The First Five Thousand Years and Kate Raworth's Donut Economics, and exploring Modern Monetary Theory.","142":null,"143":null,"144":"The formation of life, including viruses, is a fascinating topic that has captivated scientists for centuries. Life can be seen as a self-replicating system that emerged from the natural processes of the early Earth. The elements on the periodic table combined and rearranged themselves, due to random chance and natural laws, to form simpler organic molecules, like amino acids and nucleotides. These organic molecules then combined to form more complex structures, eventually leading to the formation of the first cells. The ability to self-replicate was a crucial factor in the success of these early cells, allowing them to reproduce and evolve into the diverse forms of life that exist today. The tendency for viruses to self-replicate is also due to natural selection, as viruses that can replicate more efficiently have a higher chance of survival and reproduction.","145":"The 'rudimentary von Neumann machine' is a theoretical self-replicating system first proposed by a mathematician named John von Neumann. It's thought to have evolved over time, creating more complex instructions or 'programs'. These programs were not designed but came into existence as a result of chemical interactions and lucky combinations of molecules, and over a very long period of time might have led to the complex sequence of instructions we know as DNA. While it's a complex and unlikely process that's hard for us to understand, it's believed that due to the sheer number of molecular interactions happening every second in the early ocean environment, such an event eventually occurred by chance.","146":null,"147":"I apologize if my response seemed dismissive earlier.

But there's a crucial difference when it comes to usability. While apples can be consumed directly if they don't sell, money is the universal medium of exchange. It's worth noting that money derives its value from its function as a medium of exchange, a store of value, and a unit of account. Its worth is not tied to any intrinsic value like the case of apples. It's the most valuable asset because it allows us to access other valuable resources and services, like land. So, when we invest, we're essentially trying to predict future market demands and leverage the unique flexibility and usability of money.","184":"During colder months, the transmission rate of the common cold decreases due to people spending less time in close proximity.

This process helps in maintaining the overall health and functionality of the organism by removing damaged or malfunctioning cells that could potentially harm the system if they continue to exist. In the context of radiation, exposure to harmful radiation often leads to DNA damage, triggering the apoptosis process in cells. This is particularly crucial in the case of reproductive cells, as damage can lead to genetic mutations that can be passed onto offspring. However, it's important to note that the apoptosis process isn't necessarily a self-sacrifice mechanism to prevent cancer, but rather a mechanism that ensures the overall health and functionality of the organism as a whole.

For instance, 'add 6' directs the CPU to perform an 'add' operation, and the result is stored in a register. It then follows the instruction, typically by reading another number from memory, adding that to the existing number in the register, and storing the result back to memory. This continues in a loop called a machine cycle until it finishes executing the program. The CPU's ability to process instructions is due to its design as a complex circuit of transistors, each of which performs specific functions. For more detail, you might find this video on CPU structure helpful: https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=Fxv3JoS1uY8","208":"For instance, the program might convert that number 8 into an RGB color value (Red, Green, Blue). This RGB value is then used to set the color of individual pixels on the screen.","209":"The 'No True Scotsman' fallacy is recognized as an evasive argument strategy that erroneously redefines a group's criteria to avoid critiques based on initial definitions. Despite some people questioning its real-life relevance, this logical oversight is widely understood as a fallacy.","210":"I appreciate your perspective. You're right that this specific scenario might not be common in everyday debates. However, understanding logical fallacies is crucial because they serve as a framework to identify and avoid flawed reasoning, regardless of their prevalence. Additionally, being aware of them can help us to engage in more productive and well-informed discussions.","211":"What I'm attempting to convey is not about the frequency of people actually committing the fallacy in the scenarios you provided, but rather the distinction between this specific fallacy and other logical fallacies or non-fallacious assertions, such as personal opinions or beliefs, that occur in these instances.","212":null,"213":"Periods are cycles that occur monthly in individuals with a uterus and ovaries. Each cycle, an egg matures in the ovaries, moves towards the uterus, and the uterus prepares a lining for potential fertilization. If fertilization doesn't occur, the egg disintegrates, the lining sheds off as menstrual blood through the vagina, and a new cycle starts. In terms of male anatomy, boys do indeed have hair growth in the genital area which is sometimes referred to as 'getting it' or simply pubic hair, and some may choose to remove this hair while others may not.","214":null,"215":"When using variables, it's better to avoid declaring them repeatedly within the same scope, as it can make the code difficult to maintain and debug. Instead, consider using objects or arrays to group related variables together, making it easier to keep track of them and reduce the chances of conflicts or errors.","216":null,"217":null,"218":null,"219":"Well, it's a fascinating process. Essentially, simple molecules like amino acids and nucleic acids came together naturally and, through a process called abiogenesis, formed more complex molecules, like proteins and RNA. These complex molecules could then perform specific tasks, such as self-replication. This marks the beginning of what scientists call the pre-cellular era or the 'RNA world'. In this stage, RNA molecules not only replicated themselves but also performed the roles of enzymes, genes, and messengers. Over billions of years, these structures evolved into what we now know as DNA and cells. However, the precise mechanisms of this evolution remain a complex scientific question.","220":"The rudimentary machine molecule or arrangement of molecules, often referred to as 'self-replicators', underwent a process known as autocatalysis. This means that certain molecules in the environment could create more of themselves. Over time, these self-replicating molecules began to combine and change, forming more complex molecules. This sequence of events continued until a molecule came into being that could carry genetic information efficiently \u2013 this was the foundation of RNA. While the specifics of what happened are still unknown, we think that the sheer number of molecules and their interactions in a setting such as early Earth allowed for this process to occur. This implies that, although extremely unlikely, it's not totally surprising that it happened somewhere along the line.","221":"The attack in Saudi Arabia has a significant impact on the price of oil and currencies because it disrupts the global supply of oil, given that Saudi Aramco is one of the world's largest oil producers and exporters. This disruption leads to an increase in oil prices due to supply and demand dynamics. The instability in the oil market further affects the economies of oil-producing countries and commodity-based currencies, resulting in fluctuations in exchange rates and potential instability in the global economy.","222":"Indeed, these concerns are valid, and improvements in efficiency and cost-effectiveness are crucial. However, considering the current state of our environment and dependence on fossil fuels, I believe it's essential to continue researching and innovating in the field of biofuels. After all, every step towards renewable energy helps to mitigate the impact of climate change, even if it's not a perfect solution at the moment.","223":null,"224":"I found some key insights from the EWG report on sunscreen chemicals that might be helpful to you.","225":null,"226":null,"227":"Alcoholism is a disease because long-term alcohol abuse can damage and change the structure and function of the brain, which can make it difficult to stop drinking despite the negative consequences. Other conditions that can lead to compulsive behavior, such as drug addiction, gambling addiction, and some types of impulse control disorders, are also considered diseases.","228":"Non-metals, such as halogens, oxygen, nitrogen, are a separate grouping. Beyond that, a major grouping within metals includes alkali metals, transition metals, rare earth metals, and alkali earth metals. These are the main categories, and there are many others to explore.","229":"Another large grouping are non-metals, like carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, and oxygen.","230":"Although we are part of the cosmic expansion, it doesn't mean we're the center of the universe. The observed expansion suggests that every galaxy is moving away from every other one, including us. This finding implies that the universe doesn't have a unique center, it's simply uniformly expanding in all directions.","231":"You're correct that galaxies are observed to be moving away from us, and this is where the theory of dark energy comes from. However, the question here is whether our galaxy is the center of the universe. The widely accepted understanding, as per Hubble's theory, is that our galaxy is just one among many in a homogeneous and isotropic universe, and there isn't a center per se because all its parts are moving relative to each other. From any vantage point in this universe, whether it's another planet in another galaxy or our very own Earth, the same effect of galaxies moving away would be observed due to the expansion of the universe. This is the basis for the debate on dark energy and the role it plays in the universe's expansion.","232":"In males, the testicles are responsible for producing testosterone, a primary hormone that drives sexual urges. However, the brain also plays a significant role in the experience of sexual urges, as it controls our thoughts, feelings, and emotional responses. Castration, particularly in the past, was used as a form of punishment. There was a movie titled 'The Imitation Game' that explores this topic, focusing on a man who was successful in breaking codes during World War II, but faced challenges with his sexuality.

In the context of natural selection, cells that don't undergo programmed cell death when damaged can indeed lead to the formation of cancerous cells. This is because damaged cells with altered DNA will undergo uncontrolled growth, often leading to tumors. Therefore, a mechanism to identify and eliminate damaged cells provides a survival advantage.
