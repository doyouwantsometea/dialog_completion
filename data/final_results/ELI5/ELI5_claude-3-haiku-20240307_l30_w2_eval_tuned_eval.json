It was just a hypocritical comment, I\u2019m not lambasting you because you may have spent money on something years ago. Also, not that it matters, but I couldn\u2019t be farther from a republican lmao.

I\u2019m not going to prove my political values to you because you think someone\u2019s conservative for pointing out your hypocritical statement.

A) there is intrinsic value, as you have partial ownership of material goods (what the company owns)   B) the competition is between companies, aka you can buy that companies stock or this companies stock. The stock values are extremely competitive within an industry.  It really feels like I'm helping you write a highschool econ paper...

If we were the center of the universe, everything would be moving away from us. However, there are some galaxies who\u2019s light has been shifted towards the red end of the spectrum, which according to Hubble\u2019s observations, means that the galaxy is accelerated towards us.","6":"No, because if we were at the centre, it would be impossible for thing to be moving towards us. The universe is not static, and doesn\u2019t have a barrier for said galaxies to rebound off of. It is constantly accelerating expansion. For example if you drop a rock in a lake, the waves ripple outwards, not towards the rock. But if some galaxies, had a lighter mass, they would be moving faster and possibly overtake others as will happen with the Milky Way and andromeda","7":"That's not true. People are free to not vote for any candidate if they don't like any of them, they're free to support and vote for a third party or independent candidate, and they're free to vote for a write-in.","8":"If you're staring at a ballot with two names, and you write in a third, that's...three.  If you mean an \\*effective\\* vote, sure, but the person I was replying to was saying you had no choice. You have several choices. Many of them (potentially all of them, depending on your point of view) may be terrible. And that'll probably be true whether the candidate is 30, 50, 70, or 150.","9":"When the Catholic church makes certain important decisions, like making someone a saint or appointing a cardinal, they elect someone to represent the interests of the Devil, as a sort of \"let's make sure that we have covered all bases\"  move. This is to make sure that they are making a good, well-thought decision. The word for \"lawyer\" in many languages is \"advocate\", so essentially someone is acting as the Devil's lawyer.","10":"Exactly. They Devil's Advocate may be speaking PERFECT truth. It's up to everyone to decide where the truth is, and what is more important. Maybe the person DIDN'T cause a miracle, and shouldn't be a saint after all--the church should figure that out before proceeding.","11":"I think that nowadays, it would be more like:  There is an opportunity before us. The possibilities of earning off of it are quite high, and the chances of losing are quite low. Losing, though, would cause a great deal of harm. Someone being the Devil's Advocate would bring that up, even though it may be perfectly rational to take the chance..","12":"The answer to that question is \u201cyes\u201d. Six or seven people have told you as much.   The reason that humans don\u2019t have children immediately after reaching puberty, is not biological.   Remember you\u2019ve accepted that your original premise, that the question was predicated on, wasn\u2019t true? Why you doing this","13":"If you post a thread in a question forum, and the majority of people give you the exact same answer, you don\u2019t believe them?   Yes, okay, discussion of biology was a necessary part of answering the question. It\u2019s a question that referenced puberty in mammals - it self-evidently was going to refer to biological topics. However, your question was asking for the biological reason that humans aren\u2019t ready for kids whilst animals are. The premise is false, and the reason the premise is false is due to social and not biological factors. As I\u2019ve said over and over and over. You may as well be asking \u201cwhat\u2019s the economic rationale for the earth rotating around the sun\u201d.   And for your last sentence - I\u2019m not the one trying to steer this away from a question about raising children and into a semantic debate about   I\u2019m gonna respond every single time btw. ","14":"As I tried to say 'noble' does only mean non-reactive not necessarily stable. Radon is a noble gas but it's radioactive with a half life of 3.8 days decaying into Polonium.   Most elements lighter than lead (have isotopes that) are stable and won't change while pretty much all element heavier than lead will decay over time into lead. Over astronomical time scales stars will continue to change the ratio of hydrogen and helium to heavier elements but the majority of  will stay lighter than Neon.","15":"First, elements decaying always become lighter. Second, lead is stable and does not decay. The only way elements become more massive is through nuclear reactions in stars.    The general trend is that very light elements become heavier and very heavy elements become lighter until they reach Lead\/Thallium. Exotic isotopes that don't fit the general pattern are extremely short-lived, so they basically don't exist.  Also, 2 billion years is not very long, the most stable isotope of Bismuth for example has a half-life of 19 billion billion years to decay into Thallium, and over the 14 billion years the universe has existed stars have only managed to transmute about 2% of mass into anything else than hydrogen and helium.","16":"&gt;lights  Lights are very common. This is like when people were talking about how amazon was listening to them because they mentioned wanting to get water from the water fountain and amazon suggested buying a waterfountain.   Solid theory, except that it was black friday and I also got that ad as long as like everyone else.   I believe it's closer to confirmation bias. You see lots of ads. When you talk about something, you become more aware of it. When it catches your eye you freak out and all of a sudden, everyone is listening to you.   If anyone disagrees, please provide evidence that is stronger than I think it does, therefor it is.   I'm aware that some apps have stolen information in the past for ads, but I'd like to know if Facebook or Google is doing this.","17":"If you didn't say the name of the product then why is your question if they're listening to you?  how else would they get the exact product. It looks like it was confirmation bias. You're looking for the product now and you found it.","18":"Rather than \"looking for the product\" it's just that you are more aware.   I recently got a specific car. I never noticed how many people have my car because before, I never paid attention to it.   You see hundreds of ads a day. This is a few of those ads.","19":"&gt;there are way [sic]  Such as?  &gt;intelligent people will find a way  So you're leaning on the \"What I think is right is definitely correct, despite all evidence to the contrary, because someone smart (who has already said that it's a bad idea) will make it work eventually\"   Do I have that right?  Intelligent people have looked at the task of covering millions of square miles of the planet with a covering to capture some gas and decided that it makes absolutely no sense, and would then also completely ruin the ecosystems that would have to be covered, as well as taking an absurd amount of materials, resources, and energy to complete, and they decided it would be much more feasible to find other solutions that are actually possible.","20":"Again, even if they\u2019re using unnatural means, it\u2019s still a natural process. If done properly at least, you wouldn\u2019t notice the difference between someone who went to a tanning bed or sat in the sun for a while. With that said - spray tans are a different story, and people are pretty open about that. Take Donald Trump for example.   It\u2019s totally natural to get a paler tone if you\u2019re not in the sun, and I don\u2019t think anybody would shame you just because you didn\u2019t go out in the sun much. But at the same time, that\u2019s pretty unhealthy, and also totally different than *purposely* lightening your skin. If you\u2019re avoiding the sun just to become paler, I\u2019d be pretty concerned.","21":"I\u2019m not really sure what you\u2019re asking here?  Using sun block is a good idea, yes. UV rays can be harmful and it\u2019s good to mitigate them in some way to avoid getting a sunburn.   I know absolutely nothing about Japanese people covering their faces and what purpose it serves. Or how it could be relevant to this conversation.","22":"My reasoning was never solely based on the danger of it, I explained the harmfulness because you asked why it would be concerning if somebody went out of their way to become paler.   If you refer to my previous comments, it\u2019s about the effort it requires and if it\u2019s actually natural, *as well as* the danger it poses. Tanning is a natural process and often incurs few risks, and can also be done effortlessly. Lightening your skin is not a natural process, you would need to go out of your way to accomplish it, and (to my knowledge) would be harmful in any way that you go about it.  I\u2019m also still stumped on the relevance of your Japan example.","23":"I\u2019m saying there\u2019s a distinction between *avoiding getting too much sun* and *going out of your way to lighten your skin*. Even if you go to the beach with cloth over your skin, you\u2019ll still be exposed to the sunlight, and it\u2019ll still make you darker. Just the same as how you can get a sunburn through the clouds. The only way to actively make your skin lighter would be to avoid sunlight altogether, and if there are alternative methods, just as someone else mentioned, they\u2019d likely be very unhealthy for you or your skin.","24":"https:\/\/goodlookingtan.com\/can-you-tan-through-clothing\/  &gt;\u201dCan you tan through clothing?

If you wanted to know the probability of it not happening twice in a row you would multiple 0.99 x 0.99 which equals 0.9801 or 98.01%  To calculate the odds of it not happening 100 times in a row you multiple 0.99 times itself 100 times which is also written as 0.99^100.

We both had \"labs\" at home, and we would do various \"experiments.\" One time, we were discussing something - we must have been 11 or 12 at the time - and I  said, \"But thinking is nothing but talking to yourself inside.\"       &gt;   &gt;\"Oh yeah?\" Bernie said. \"Do you know the crazy shape of the crankshaft in car?\"      &gt;   &gt;\"Yeah, what of it?\"      &gt;   &gt;\"Good. Now tell me: how did you describe it when you were talking to yourself?\"       &gt;   &gt;So I  learned from Bernie that thoughts can be visual as well as verbal.   &amp;#x200B;  \u2014 [http:\/\/calteches.library.caltech.edu\/607\/2\/Feynman.pdf](http:\/\/calteches.library.caltech.edu\/607\/2\/Feynman.pdf)","30":"This is complicated. It's easiest to think of them as waves, but more accurately, they are waves of points.  The energy is proportional to the frequency of the wave, and resolution is also proportional to the frequency, and so we define the Planck length as the length at which the energy of a photon is high enough to make a black hole.","31":"I think when talking about \"randomness\" It is more practical to ask about predictability.  Its impossible to tell if an event was random or just unpredictable, so I do not think there is much distinction.

Just because the average cost of a car is high doesn\u2019t mean someone poor has to buy an expensive car, it just means people who have money like to spend it on cars.  I have the income to do so, so I spend a lot of money on my daughter because it makes me happy.  And that increases the average but others don\u2019t have to.  Basically the number is high because people want to spend money on their kids.

They don\u2019t put money back into the economy, or rarely do. Think of it in terms of neighborhoods. You have poor, upscale, and rich.

Yes, okay, discussion of biology was a necessary part of answering the question. It\u2019s a question that referenced puberty in mammals - it self-evidently was going to refer to biological topics. However, your question was asking for the biological reason that humans aren\u2019t ready for kids whilst animals are. The premise is false, and the reason the premise is false is due to social and not biological factors. As I\u2019ve said over and over and over. You may as well be asking \u201cwhat\u2019s the economic rationale for the earth rotating around the sun\u201d.

Up and down only mean \"pointed toward the earth\" and \"not pointed toward the earth.\" No matter how far south you fly, gravity keeps everything oriented so that \"down\" is toward the earth. The only way you know which way is up and down is which way gravity pulls you, and since gravity always pulls you toward the earth, your feet always point toward the earth, whether you're over the north pole or the south pole.

If you are on a plane and it's landing and you look down and see other planes, are they upside down?","45":"I have no idea if this is the case. Because I do not have information on something does not mean that it was done with ill intent.

Yeah it usually grows in front, on down between the legs and a little bit on the butt hole area. It's just often seen as taboo, so some women shave or wax to get rid of it. But that's her decision to make and its perfectly find to keep it all or remove it all. Shaving and waxing can hurt and cause ingrown hairs which is one reason some may not want to remove the hair.","47":"Now that is a good question... I know I had some sex education in school but it wasn't very good. It's a common problem in schools because people are scared to talk about it. Some of the fear is that it will encourage kids to start having sex early but I think it's important for everyone to know how the body works. Everyone has one, so why hide it?  Kids need to know what is normal and what is not normal, so if there is a problem, they can talk to a doctor. Puberty is scary with everything changing and a lot of people feel shame about it when they shouldn't. I'm glad you're asking questions ahead of time so you're a little more prepared.","48":"On top of what everyone has said, it could also be a psychological issue. Some symptoms of depression, for example, can manifest as increased sleep, decreased levels of energy and lack of focus.","49":"It's good that you're aware of it, but keep in mind that proper diagnosis can only come for a licensed professional. If this has been happening, it might be a good idea to get a professional opinion. I meant more to say that it's sometimes difficult to differentiate between illnesses of the body and illnesses of the mind, specially around things like sleep, which are connected to both. It could also be a part physical, part psychological.","50":"I can imagine it can be a little scary, but therapists are a lot like ears for hire, just go in, not even thinking about depression or issues, talk a little bit and see how you feel, you can bring out the more complex stuff whenever you feel comfortable.  There are also online resources like Blah Therapy, NYC Well, among others. Just make sure you're actually speaking to a professional and not just a helpful stranger.","51":"There are a few effects; ionization will break apart biologically important molecules, which can then become \"radicals\" which can break apart more molecules or damage proteins. Too much damage to cellular structures can cause the cell to destroy itself, as can too much damage to DNA. This is why bad sunburn causes skin to peel off, the epidermal and dermal layers received enough damage to decide they need to kill themselves for the greater good. However, if DNA is damaged in certain ways, it can lead to cancer. It's not that DNA can't be repaired at all, it's that it is the \"master program\" for the cell and can be modified in ways that make the cell do things that it isn't supposed to.   You can also receive too much damage to important cells like in organs. It's actually therapeutic in some situations, such as using radioactive iodine to destroy some of a large thyroid, but many organs are not good at regenerating so the damage can hamper their functionality.","52":"Yeah after my big breakup (guy walked out after 21 years) I lost 17 pounds in 10 days.

We will likely see element 120 within 5 years, but getting to element 169 (which would be the first element on the 9th row) is going to to take a lot longer and will need improvements in technology if it can even be created at all.

As many pointed out the Strong Nuclear Force &gt; Electromagnetism &gt; Weak Nuclear Force &gt;  Gravity in terms of strength.  &gt;Sounds like we are right back to the start of this lesson again. Let's put some real numbers on this. The \"weak\" nuclear force is 10 to the 25th power stronger than Gravity. That's 100,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 times stronger! Electromagnetism - the force we know best - is 10 to the 36th power stronger than Gravity. That's 10,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 times stronger! The \"strong\" nuclear force is 10 to the 38th power stronger than Gravity. That's 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 times stronger!   You can split any atom with a knife.

Hence the question of \"if a tree falls in the woods and no one is around to hear it, does it make a sound\" is only a \"flawed principle\" if you treat the theories science has discovered as some hard and fast absolute, which they are not.

In general they take deposits from individuals and make loans, as well as offering services like credit cards.   Investment banking works more with the markets directly relating to financial securities (stocks, bonds, derivatives, etc) and financial advisory services. But investment banks do not take deposits.   Want to have your company go public and be listed on a stock exchange? The can determine a listing price and distribution. Need to issue $10B in bonds, they can partner with other firms to create the terms and get them sold. Want to merge with another company? They help with due diligence and the terms and the funding (loans, stock conversions, etc.).  Traditionally (at least since the 1933 Glass\u2013Steagall legislation) these were separate institutions. Many banks collapsed (for instance) when they used deposits to speculate on the markets. These functions are still separate but can be housed in one corporation. And most investment banks chose or were pressured to become commercial banks (at least from a regulatory perspective) after the crisis of 2008.","72":"Keep in mind that commercial banks and investment banks now often coexist under one holding company.

These concepts are stored without the use of either word or image, but are linked to the separate storages of the words and images, so those systems usually fire together.

You said something about talking to someone who you think is a virologist who said something no virologist would ever say.

That said - you want to learn whether we're in a position to eradicate the flu - go talk to a (competent) virologist and stop dicking around on reddit.  And 47 reported cases may mean hundreds or thousands or tens of thousands of unreported (but still potentially contagious) cases.  47 may not mean what you think it means.  Most people who get the flu just deal with it, and many have mild symptoms not worth reporting.","98":"The \"spots\" are always \"touching\". In other words, the wires are always physically connected. The way programmers change what data (electrical signals) is fed into those wires is by storing instructions into memory. How does the CPU know to retrieve those instructions and execute them? Ultimately it's hardwired to do so as part of its design and manufacture. Ever heard of the BIOS on a motherboard? That's the program permanently stored in Read Only Memory (ROM) that kicks off that whole process.","99":"BIOS is a program written to a ROM memory chip at the motherboard factory, that provides the initial instructions to the CPU. This includes initialising all the connected hardware, and eventually telling the CPU to start loading instructions from some storage media (which ideally contains an operating system). We call this process *booting*. The CPU is already hard-wired as part of its design, to load this BIOS program from the motherboard it's plugged in to.","100":"The CPU is designed so that if you feed it certain \"numbers\" (the binary numbers are just for human usability - it's all just a series of electrical signals to the CPU) it will perform certain operations. Some of those operations expect additional numbers to be input as part of the instruction (usually, addresses of memory that contain the data). This is all just based on the complex physical arrangement of the transistors and other components within the CPU.  We have a lookup table of what numbers represent what instructions. It's called an **instruction set**. A popular one is x86, which you can read about [here](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/X86_instruction_listings#Original_8086\/8088_instructions).","101":"A function. If the function is y=x\\*2, then inputting 4 will result in 8.  Programs are kinds of functions that (usually) take input, process it, and provide some kind of output.

They aren't always literally numbers that need to be displayed as text on a monitor.","102":"There is no such thing. A wire is either carrying enough voltage to decide that it's \"On\", or it's not in which case it's \"Off\". There is no in between.  So for example a processor that operates with a 5 volt data pin, the manufacturer might decide anything below 2.5 volts is a \"off\" and anything 2.5 volts or above is \"on\". And anything higher than 7 volts might kill the chip. Certain electrical tolerances are built into the components.","103":"I mean it depends on what you mean by \"analog\". An analog what? You can send 5 volts of electricity to any electrical component, what happens when you do that is going to depend on what the component is designed to do (and also depends on whether you're sending AC or DC current).  If you send 5 volts to the digital processor in my example above, it would be interpreted as a 1\/On\/True however you want to represent that. A string of those might represent an instruction or something.  If you send the same 5 volts to a 12 volt analog LED, it might light up with about 40% brightness. Analog doesn't have \"positions\", that's the point. We measure its voltage level.","104":"At this point we're not talking about computers at all, but the difference between analog and digital electrical circuits. This is less Computer Science and more Electrical Engineering.  An analog circuit is either \"on\" or \"off\", but its operation can also change based on the energy level. Usually we design the circuit for a specific voltage level (eg. 110V in a US household), and change the current draw to change its operation. Eg. to make a toaster coil hotter or a fan spin faster.  A digital circuit always just \"exists\", with its operation determined by the sequence of on\/off electrical signals transmitted through it. Note that it's the circuit as a whole that is designed to be \"digital\". Individual components like transistors or capacitors are inherently \"analog\", we just use them in different ways.  The concept of \"1s and 0s\" is just something we humans use to help work with digital circuits because of the constant stream of on\/off data going through the circuit - it's useful to represent it as binary numbers. Analog circuits don't operate this way so the concept is kind of useless.","105":"It actually says why it was removed right there, and it's not because anyone didn't like the question.   but if someone has this much trouble understanding removal reasons, understanding a jury of someone's peers finding someone guilty beyond a reasonable doubt would be an extremely tough thing to do.","106":"&gt;Seems like another innocent man is in jail.  if that's how it seems to you, that's perfectly fine. the earth seems flat to some people, and them being wrong doesn't affect their lives any more than you being wrong will affect yours.","107":"You can't do any of that, because gun factories already exist to serve the police and military. So unless you abolish the military and police (which I favor), there will always be pressure from lobbyists to sell more guns. That's why the NRA exists- gun manufacturers trick private owners into joining, to lobby Congress to expand the market for the manufacturers. But if you abolish the state organs of violence, there is no need for the second amendment, and no gun industries left to lobby. I applaud your attempts to end the slaughter of capitalism though.","108":"I'm not demanding anything. I think equal pay for each person doing the same job makes sense.

Hydrogen does not decay into helium, hydrogen-3 (tritium) does decay into helium-3, but hydrogen-1 and hysrogen-2 do not undergo radioactive decay at all, they are stable isotopes of hydrogen.   ALL elements have radioactive isotopes, that includes noble gasses. They will all decay into other elements eventually.","115":"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/3\/37\/Decay_Chain_of_Uranium-238.svg  https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/9\/93\/Decay_Chain_of_Actinium.svg  These are the decay chains of uranium-238 and uranium-235, as you can see both of them decay into an isotope of radon before decaying further. So no radon is not at the end. Many radioactive isotopes undergo these sequences where they keep decaying into other isotopes until they get to a stable one.","116":"&gt;Oh cool, so does that mean that, like radon, all of the noble elements will eventually turn into lead?  What makes your ask this question? Helium will never \u201cdecay\u201d into lead, nor will neon etc.   When stars explode a large amount of heavier elements are formed, but again this isn\u2019t the same process.    &gt;Could lead ever decay into something else? Is there a half-life of lead?  I\u2019ve already told you that every single element has radioactive isotopes, see: https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Isotopes_of_lead - note just how many radioactive isotopes lead has, many are decay products from other elements, lead is the heaviest element that still has stable isotopes.   Isotopes are atoms with the same number of protons but different numbers of neutrons. Only specific configurations of protons and neutrons are stable, everything else is unstable and undergoes radioactive decay.   &gt;If lead does decay into something else, it would probably take us billions of years to find out, right?

The last few elements discovered on the 7th row already decay within fractions of seconds, and there\u2019s 50 elements to fill up the 8th row yet to be discovered before the 9th row.","118":"Why do you think I have any actual firsthand experience in this field? I read journals and understand the science.   It took about 70 years for the rest of the elements in the 7th row to be created, that was elements 95-118). The last few discovered decay within fractions of seconds. The faster something decays the harder it is to create and then detect.   We will likely see element 120 within 5 years, but getting to element 169 (which would be the first element on the 9th row) is going to to take a lot longer and will need improvements in technology if it can even be created at all.

That's why dividends exist. It's not the only way to look at it though. Because without the business keeping that profit to invest back into the business, it could never grow, giving up increasing value in the future.  Take manufacturing, say that you build widgets, each widget nets x profit. That x value can be given out as dividends or it can be used to increase the number of widgets we make and sell.

If a sound wave falls outside of that range, you are not going to be able to hear it.  However, that doesn't mean that you aren't able to perceive it in other ways.  We can \"feel\" sound waves outside of our normal range of hearing - both above and below the 20\/20,000 thresholds.  The 18.9 Hz wave is no different - you can't hear it, but you can feel it is there.  In many people, this feeling manifests itself as fear or paranoia.  You can \"feel\" something in the room, but none of your other senses register anything consciously.  This incongruence greats discomfort,t which manifests as fear.  It is called the \"Ghost Frequency\" because it is theorized that many \"haunted\" areas simply produce tones close to 18.9 Hz (through resonance or other natural quirks) and people associate the fear response with a \"presence\" in the area.","167":"Since the Earth isn't flat, sunrise\/sunset is a circular phenomenon.  The circular shadow of the Earth has an orientation that depends on what direction is \"down\" to the observer.

The Sun and the Moon are almost always on the same hemisphere of the Earth, this is a situation where they are almost opposite each other.  The sky becomes bright before the Sun is actually visible because the atmosphere scatters light.  That may be confusing your interpretation of the sun's location, thinking it's higher in the sky than it actually is.  The Sunrise\/sunset band is a ring around the Earth. As you go around that ring, your feet rotate relative to the plane of the planets.  On one side the shadow is \"up\" pointing toward the brightening sky.  On this side, the shadow points down.  The direction of the \"bright sky\" also rotates because the atmosphere is held to the Earth by the same gravity that holds your feet to the Earth.","169":"The 2nd and 3rd notes of the triple are \"off\" from the normal beat of the music...yes, they are correct according to the score.

It used to be a thing in the 80's and 90's because it looks obnoxious, but political correctness and 2 more generations of people that don't care about their appearance has basically done away with restrictions on hair styles.

You learned by using the tachometer.   You relearn whenever you get a new car and has to get used to how it feels - especially if it uses a different engine type, for example switching to diesel (or back) requires you to completely relearn how a car should feel.   Once you've learned how your car (or other motorized transport) feels at all speeds, you don't need any of the instrument panel except maybe a way to estimate how much fuel you have left.","177":"&gt;I'm not sure what I'm supposed to be missing by not looking at the RPM when changing gears?  Well, for starters you're leaving a bunch of acceleration on the table by   &gt; skipping gears  And not using the peak of your power curve as much as you could be.   If you're consistently skipping the same gear that'll sacrifice a bit of longevity, though whether you'll keep the car long enough to need it is another question.   Fuel efficiency is definitely improved by using the bottom of your rev range, without going too low, which is literally impossible to judge accurately by feel for most people - though if you have perfect pitch that's not necessarily a concern.","178":"I still don't see how this is in any way a better system.

We want the fluid to have certain properties when it comes out of the boiler (we don't actually want steam) and when we have a high boiling point, we can put in more energy.  Also, water can store a lot of energy before it actually changes temperature, way more than acetone.    The turbine speed is related to how much fluid you pump through it, not the temperature although the fluid type can effect that.  The thing that varies with the temperature is the torque, how hard the turbine can try to turn stuff.","181":"The price you paid is base on you actually using it.

Operating costs and profit are different things.  You seem to think that the business model is still like it was in the 50's where planes were only half full and everything was free.   It's not.

The current business model is: pack as many people as possible in the plane (by enticing them with low prices) and then selling them stuff while you've got them essentially held hostage.  &gt;but this is completely unrelated to whether people get off in ATL.  The operating cost is.      Tell me about the plane full of people that wanted to buy a ticket and couldn't.

That's why dividends exist. It's not the only way to look at it though. Because without the business keeping that profit to invest back into the business, it could never grow, giving up increasing value in the future.  Take manufacturing, say that you build widgets, each widget nets x profit. That x value can be given out as dividends or it can be used to increase the number of widgets we make and sell.

You purchased some of their shares in 2005. Their employees designed a product called an Iphone, marketed it, made it and sold millions of it and continued to innovate making their company valued at hundreds of billions of dollars because of the money it makes. You own a part of the effort the company put into this. How is this different from you buying a chicken, cooking it and selling it for more? If you sold someone a 25% share of your chicken company, then that person is entitled to 25% of the value of the company. You no longer own 100% of that company. If all you did was sell one chicken, then you need to give that person 25% of the profits from that chicken. A share isn't an IOU - it means that the owner of the share is part-owner of the company.","199":"There are issues with corporate governance, but if someone owned 25% of the shares of a large public company (unrealistic mostly) they'd almost certainly be on the Board of Directors (BOD) and very likely the Chairman of the Board. The BOD (representatives of the shareholders - mostly large shareholders themselves) decide on the dividend policy. It is, in theory, the shareholders that decide whether or not the company pays a dividend, management can advise but the board decides.   So if a company doesn't pay dividends it is usually a joint consensus of the management and the owners (shareholders) of the company. Of course, if someone owns 0.00001% of the shares of the company, they probably cannot expect to have much say (other than voting at the AGM) in the major strategic decisions of the company.","200":"Its not *impossible* its just not what its meant to do.

Ultimately, you translate back and forth as needed, like in the case of a monitor taking a digital signal to produce an analog image.","201":"&gt;Analog devices still use transistors, but they allow for many shades of grey between 0 current an maximum current. Transistors work like switches, with current flowing from the Source to the Drain, controlled by the Gate. This lets a tiny voltage at the Gate control a much larger current, like how a tiny valve can completely shut off a pipe. Analog devices can take a range of voltages through the gate that gradually turns on the current flowing through the device.   Remember, 1 and 0 are just what we call ON and OFF. Its all a matter of how much current is flowing. We get to choose how to interpret that.","202":"Every point you make against industrial farming agriculture is another point against animal agriculture.

So it's not like there is some information coming from the car into your eyes and brains saying, 'hey its really really black right here'.  What is happening is the cells in your eye are not getting any information at all, and those cells in turn do not activate the brain in the same way.

That is just a word we made up for what our brain does.  Pretend humans never developed eyes and we never evolved to have the sense of sight.  We have no idea of color or what things look like or anything.  Light particles are still bouncing around and being reflected off everything, everywhere, but in the case of the vantablack, when light hits that area, it just reflects less light than other surfaces. (less information is being reflected)  Another way to look at it is take a digital camera and point it at the car.  Well there is a sensitive chip in there that is like an eye.  The light hits the chip, and activate certain parts of that chip which the computer makes into an image on the screen.  The vantablack areas did not activate that part of the chip.  So the computer reads the image file and says... No data here!  and then when you look at it on the screen the computer doesn't light up that pixel and you perceive black there.","261":"exactly.

It's particularly notable when the gases are those other than the standard air mix of nitrogen, oxygen, CO2, and argon. Plus water vapor.

If the space has carbon monoxide in it, it could be near the top, as it's slightly lighter than air. CO2 is heavier than air, which is why you can use it to create a a ground fog.

It's easiest to think of them as waves, but more accurately, they are waves of points.

In that case, mlms make the world function......  A ponzi scheme requires there to be an exaggerated or novalue behind the product being bought or sold. If everyone just held their stocks, (thus demand for buying stocks just froze), then people would sell their stocks (potentially liquidating the company) or stock holders would then demand dividends. Either way, there is value behind the product (ownership) being exchanged...  And yes, companies do typically buy back stock during recession (the opposite of dilluting) to manage stock prices, which is based on the majority of stock holders decision.\nExplainee: The difference with wholesalers, is that there is intrinsic value, i.e. Food, water, etc. Stocks don't have intrinsic value. And there's competition for the same objecrlt, e.g. Tomatoes. MLMs don't have competition, because you buy it from the company only.  And company buying shares back during recessions is what I mean by non-dividend shares as not being not intrinsically valuable. People only sell things that have less value while being held. So non-dividend shares are valuable like art. Whatever the buyers decides.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: But that's the key right? You own something you have no control over.  You can buy stocks between companies, but that's like selling apples and oranges. They're both fruits, but they're still different things.\nExplainer: You didn't answer or acknowledge the limitations of being wholesales (aka mlm), so i will assume this is based on mlm.  When i buy apples directly from an orchard, i take the risk (just like buying stock) that i can sell them at a profit to grocers (who sell them to the consumers who consume them). I have no control over whether or not the grocers will buy them or not. I may end up with rotting apples because i didn't realize that people now hate apples...\n","5":"Explainee: ELI5: Have we ruled out that we are definitely NOT the center of the universe (Please read full description before answering!)\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: If the universe is expanding, shouldn't galaxies be moving away from us as well?\nExplainer: Yes they are\n","6":"Explainer: Yes they are\nExplainee: Then wouldn't the observation you just mentioned disprove that theory as well?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Sorry, this makes no sense to me.

Then maybe eventually (2 billion years from now?), everything will be either super heavy or super light?\nExplainer: First, elements decaying always become lighter. Second, lead is stable and does not decay. The only way elements become more massive is through nuclear reactions in stars.    The general trend is that very light elements become heavier and very heavy elements become lighter until they reach Lead\/Thallium. Exotic isotopes that don't fit the general pattern are extremely short-lived, so they basically don't exist.  Also, 2 billion years is not very long, the most stable isotope of Bismuth for example has a half-life of 19 billion billion years to decay into Thallium, and over the 14 billion years the universe has existed stars have only managed to transmute about 2% of mass into anything else than hydrogen and helium.\n","15":"Explainer: As I tried to say 'noble' does only mean non-reactive not necessarily stable. Radon is a noble gas but it's radioactive with a half life of 3.8 days decaying into Polonium.

The money they have in terms of assets is no different than what you have as your own assets. Just less.

Star Gate uses \"hyper space\" so you go into another \"dimension\" to and then come back.  https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Interstellar_travel_in_fiction  It all depends on the show but most good shows make it realistic enough and have science advisors telling them obvious flaws.   Like in the video game Mass Effect they discovered a way to remove \"mass\" from objects and even go negative so it's possible to go faster than light, and their ships travels like normal ones would accelerating half of the trip then turning around and accelerating backwards to arrive at the destination at normal speeds.

All systems will tend towards an equilibrium. Imagine you're hitting a golfball around a field for a million years, and there's a single rabbit hole somewhere in that field. Odds are the ball will eventually wind up in that hole, and once it does it is going to stay there.  The ball being in that hole is loosely analogous to life - it is something that is very unlikely but given enough time and the right circumstances it will eventually happen.  As for why life is stable, that's sort of by definition. If it weren't stable, then it wouldn't be life. Plenty of little bits of molecules stuck together in the ocean over several million or billion or trillion years, but they all fell apart. The one that didn't fall apart and instead replicated itself by complete accident was the one that survived long enough to evolve into humans, who promptly named this self-sustaining process \"life\".\nExplainee: Thanks for the answer.  I understand that life dosent want anything, but Im wondering more what are the laws and mechanisms that makes it so that for an example viruses have the tendency to self replicate? If all systems seek an equlibrium it seems counter-intuitive to me that strains of genetic acid molecules have the tendency to get ever more complex (or simple and effecient as in viruses) just to sustain an incredibly complex system.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: I get that viruses are simple because they dont benefit from added complexity, but I mean in terms of chemistry even viruses are incredibly complex compared to the elements on the periodic table. How does one go from these elements to long strains of acid thats specificly coded to replicate itself in a system that at all times tends toward an equlibrium?\nExplainer: Many systems can be self-sustaining so long as they have 'food'. While we don't know the exact path that life followed as it formed, it seems safe to say that a very rudimentary von Neumann 'machine' molecule or arrangement of molecules came to be which then developed more and more complex 'programs' that eventually became DNA.  Again, such developments are very unlikely, but given the sheer number of molecules forming and breaking in the oceans even now, on the order of quintillions or more every second, over the course of trillions of years, it shouldn't be too shocking that it happened *once*.\n","69":"Explainer: No, actually.  The \"standard\" round for the M16 rifle (and other weapons that use 5.56 ammunition) is something called M855, which is *like* full metal jacket ammo, but it's tipped with a little bit of steel that's colored green (which is why you sometimes hear it called 'green-tip') to enhance its ability to punch through obstacles.  The relatively high ratio of muzzle velocity to bullet weight leads the other popular round, the M193, to fragment near explosively when it hits something.\nExplainee: Huh! That\u2019s pretty cool as long as you\u2019re not on the receiving end!\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Only if you\u2019re unarmored though, an HP round might not get ya shot in the first place if you\u2019ve got kevlar but FMJ will from what I\u2019ve heard. From a 5.56 at least, from what I\u2019ve heard.\nExplainer: It depends on the \"level\" of armor you're wearing. *Any* 5.56 round travels so damn fast that it will basically slice right through anything level IIIA or below, hollow-point or not.  The \"levels\" are a concept from the National Institute of Justice, and refer to the types of rounds that a given body armor will stop. Kevlar is basically rated to stop handgun rounds only; armor that stops rifle rounds will generally include hard ceramic or steel plates. A level III plate, for example, is rated to stop six shots from a 7.62 round (the 5.56's bigger, nastier brother) before it fails.\n","70":"Explainer: Oh, absolutely. If I had to be shot with one of the two, and I had a choice? Give me the green-tip penetrator any day of the week.

You seem to be under the assumption that every result calculated by the CPU is literally turned into pixels. That's clearly not the case, computers calculate all sorts of things for different purposes. The software needs to determine what to do with the result. In the case that the result needs to be displayed on screen, the software will tell the monitor how to do so (via the graphics processor).\n","102":"Explainee: ELI5: How does a computer learn those first few steps of computing?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: So doesnt analog have the same 2 positions as digital?\nExplainer: I mean it depends on what you mean by \"analog\". An analog what? You can send 5 volts of electricity to any electrical component, what happens when you do that is going to depend on what the component is designed to do (and also depends on whether you're sending AC or DC current).  If you send 5 volts to the digital processor in my example above, it would be interpreted as a 1\/On\/True however you want to represent that. A string of those might represent an instruction or something.  If you send the same 5 volts to a 12 volt analog LED, it might light up with about 40% brightness. Analog doesn't have \"positions\", that's the point. We measure its voltage level.\n","103":"Explainer: There is no such thing. A wire is either carrying enough voltage to decide that it's \"On\", or it's not in which case it's \"Off\". There is no in between.  So for example a processor that operates with a 5 volt data pin, the manufacturer might decide anything below 2.5 volts is a \"off\" and anything 2.5 volts or above is \"on\". And anything higher than 7 volts might kill the chip. Certain electrical tolerances are built into the components.\nExplainee: So doesnt analog have the same 2 positions as digital?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: So analog doesnt do 1s and 0s because it doesnt have 1 and 0 positions, but only %s of them?\nExplainer: At this point we're not talking about computers at all, but the difference between analog and digital electrical circuits. This is less Computer Science and more Electrical Engineering.  An analog circuit is either \"on\" or \"off\", but its operation can also change based on the energy level. Usually we design the circuit for a specific voltage level (eg. 110V in a US household), and change the current draw to change its operation. Eg. to make a toaster coil hotter or a fan spin faster.  A digital circuit always just \"exists\", with its operation determined by the sequence of on\/off electrical signals transmitted through it. Note that it's the circuit as a whole that is designed to be \"digital\". Individual components like transistors or capacitors are inherently \"analog\", we just use them in different ways.  The concept of \"1s and 0s\" is just something we humans use to help work with digital circuits because of the constant stream of on\/off data going through the circuit - it's useful to represent it as binary numbers. Analog circuits don't operate this way so the concept is kind of useless.\n","104":"Explainer: I mean it depends on what you mean by \"analog\". An analog what?

Isn't it predetermined that an apple seed will grow into an apple tree and not into an orange tree? Is there any chance, no matter how small, that it will grow into an orange tree?\nExplainer: No.  The DNA is a combination of chemicals that is different for each species.   This combination makes up the genes.   It wasn't predetermined that this is what would happen.   It evolved that way.  So when the proteins form it does so based on the genes.  This is not the same thing as having it predetermined.  Which is why its not great to call it a code.  A code has an intended purpose.   Additionally the offspring of species don't always copy the DNA correctly from the parents and there is a mutation,  which is how we ultimately get new genes, then new species etc.  In the end it is just chemicals reactions happening.

When i buy apples directly from an orchard, i take the risk (just like buying stock) that i can sell them at a profit to grocers (who sell them to the consumers who consume them). I have no control over whether or not the grocers will buy them or not. I may end up with rotting apples because i didn't realize that people now hate apples...\nExplainee: But that's not doing market research. Maybe the analogy is not the best to price your point, but you can easily ensure you have sales before purchasing.   Also, you have the intrinsic value of apples which you can eat (I assume you're not allergic to it). So even though you may lose some of your money (the apples rot) you're guaranteed a certain level of return regardless. Hell, even rotten apples can be turned into compost for further loss mitigation. There's so much more flexibility there.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Point 1. You are correct. But that's not different in investing in nike shoes or luxury bags to resell later. The value of the stock comes from perception rather than anything thay can be more objectively discerned (dividends). E.g. Nike shoes are inherently shoes, so they have a level of intrinsic value. But is it worth 1k, is a matter of perception.  Point 2. Actually that highlights my point. If you invest in yen and try to use it in another country, it is very likely most places will not accept the currency unless you are willing to trade at a decent or significant loss. So that investment makes no sense because it is unusable until converted, which requires a person willing to trade it.   Furthermore, from another comment, someone said that money is useless until spent, which I fully agree with. But the reason why money always remains valuable is because it is the only form of negotiation with the government for the world's most valuable asset: land.\n","131":"Explainer: Lol don\u2019t give up!\nExplainee: I dont plan to. 5K to kick off healthier lifestyle next week.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","132":"Explainer: Are you calling yourself a sheep?\nExplainee: Can you stop making this about me\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Look at number 1 you fucking nazi https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/EnviroActivism\/comments\/aq7v1u\/big_small_changes_we_need_to_make\/\nExplainer: So you know this but you're claiming you haven't seen \"facts\"?

Money in modern society is more or less fictional with limits placed arbitrarily to benefit one or another faction of the ruling class. Debt is the main way money is introduced into the economy and there would be no money circulating if all debts were paid, as far as I understand.  Some books that opened my eyes about this were David Graeber's Debt: The First Five Thousand Years and Kate Raworth's Donut Economics.

How about this: The more full a plane is, the less per seat it costs to operate.   Very simple.   More people to share the fixed hourly cost of fuel, crew, maintenance.....

But in the process, you get rid of the negotiators involved in drug\/treatment cost negotiations, and instead the government will just pay whatever the cost is without thinking about it, again because the government doesn't have significant means to fight for cost savings.

I understand the the basics of the lunar cycle and the rotation of earth. I just don't understand how the sun *and* the shadow on the moon can be on the *same* side. Should they not be opposite?\nExplainer: Which half of the Earth that is lit only depends on the Earth's rotation, and as the other thread explains in detail, that rotation is independent of the orbit of the planet and the Moon.  The Sun and the Moon are almost always on the same hemisphere of the Earth, this is a situation where they are almost opposite each other.  The sky becomes bright before the Sun is actually visible because the atmosphere scatters light.  That may be confusing your interpretation of the sun's location, thinking it's higher in the sky than it actually is.  The Sunrise\/sunset band is a ring around the Earth. As you go around that ring, your feet rotate relative to the plane of the planets.  On one side the shadow is \"up\" pointing toward the brightening sky.  On this side, the shadow points down.  The direction of the \"bright sky\" also rotates because the atmosphere is held to the Earth by the same gravity that holds your feet to the Earth.\n","168":"Explainer: Since the Earth isn't flat, sunrise\/sunset is a circular phenomenon.  The circular shadow of the Earth has an orientation that depends on what direction is \"down\" to the observer.

I can understand if you go to the other side of the sunset ring then the shadow would appear upside down but surely you wouldn't be able to see the moon and the sun at the same time from that spot?\nExplainer: There is a hemisphere of Earth where you can see the Moon (ignoring that it's hard during the day because the sky is so bright).  At the same time, there is a hemisphere of Earth where you can see the Sun (generally called \"daytime\").  Most of the time, where is an overlap between these two where you can see the Moon during the day (ignoring it's hard ...).  The eclipse is a \"special\" time where the two hemispheres touch at their edges.  As the Sun and Moon move apart, the overlapping section of the Earth in both becomes thinner and longer.  At the eclipse, it's at its thinnest, only minutes long, but it goes all the way around.

I may end up with rotting apples because i didn't realize that people now hate apples...\nExplainee: But that's not doing market research. Maybe the analogy is not the best to price your point, but you can easily ensure you have sales before purchasing.   Also, you have the intrinsic value of apples which you can eat (I assume you're not allergic to it). So even though you may lose some of your money (the apples rot) you're guaranteed a certain level of return regardless. Hell, even rotten apples can be turned into compost for further loss mitigation. There's so much more flexibility there.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Point 1. You are correct. But that's not different in investing in nike shoes or luxury bags to resell later. The value of the stock comes from perception rather than anything thay can be more objectively discerned (dividends). E.g. Nike shoes are inherently shoes, so they have a level of intrinsic value. But is it worth 1k, is a matter of perception.  Point 2. Actually that highlights my point. If you invest in yen and try to use it in another country, it is very likely most places will not accept the currency unless you are willing to trade at a decent or significant loss. So that investment makes no sense because it is unusable until converted, which requires a person willing to trade it.   Furthermore, from another comment, someone said that money is useless until spent, which I fully agree with. But the reason why money always remains valuable is because it is the only form of negotiation with the government for the world's most valuable asset: land.\n","193":"Explainer: Summer session is ending and someone has Chem homework they need help with.\nExplainee: That\u2018s not the case my friend.

The BOD (representatives of the shareholders - mostly large shareholders themselves) decide on the dividend policy. It is, in theory, the shareholders that decide whether or not the company pays a dividend, management can advise but the board decides.   So if a company doesn't pay dividends it is usually a joint consensus of the management and the owners (shareholders) of the company. Of course, if someone owns 0.00001% of the shares of the company, they probably cannot expect to have much say (other than voting at the AGM) in the major strategic decisions of the company.\n","199":"Explainer: Take any example of a company share. I'll use Apple. You purchased some of their shares in 2005. Their employees designed a product called an Iphone, marketed it, made it and sold millions of it and continued to innovate making their company valued at hundreds of billions of dollars because of the money it makes. You own a part of the effort the company put into this. How is this different from you buying a chicken, cooking it and selling it for more? If you sold someone a 25% share of your chicken company, then that person is entitled to 25% of the value of the company. You no longer own 100% of that company. If all you did was sell one chicken, then you need to give that person 25% of the profits from that chicken. A share isn't an IOU - it means that the owner of the share is part-owner of the company.\nExplainee: but what does it mean to be part-owner if you're not getting dividends (part of the profits)?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: yeah, so I feel like buying non-dividend shares is more of a winner takes all system. You either buy enough to gain some control or you shouldn't bother, since you own something you have no control over, which really feels more like a gamble, though safer.\nExplainer: The beauty of the free market is that you can make any investment decision based on any set of beliefs you have. All I can attempt is to explain how it works. If your conclusion is that A is better than B, then so be it.   It is simply odd that you make such a huge distinction between dividend and non-dividend paying shares. But you are free to do so. Hopefully if you ever intend to invest, you research the return history of various companies in recent history and validate your belief (dividend etc) against empirical performance.   At the end of the day, investing is mostly about making as much money as you can at an acceptable risk in a timeframe that fits you.\n","200":"Explainer: The output from one transistor is strong enough to completely max out the Gate of another.\nExplainee: Why was this not possible in analog?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: So analog has more than 1 and 0? How does that work\nExplainer: &gt;Analog devices still use transistors, but they allow for many shades of grey between 0 current an maximum current. Transistors work like switches, with current flowing from the Source to the Drain, controlled by the Gate. This lets a tiny voltage at the Gate control a much larger current, like how a tiny valve can completely shut off a pipe. Analog devices can take a range of voltages through the gate that gradually turns on the current flowing through the device.   Remember, 1 and 0 are just what we call ON and OFF. Its all a matter of how much current is flowing. We get to choose how to interpret that.\n","201":"Explainer: Its not *impossible* its just not what its meant to do.

The idea of having tens of thousands of people try to run a company (each stock holder) would be a surefire way to end any company. Thus, like government, people are appointed to the board based on the majority of stock ownership.   I have no idea how you think just splitting stock would somehow be a solution for that, as every single stock issued dilutes the rest....

But, that buying is an effect, not the cause. The prices goes up because people believe that the company is worth more than what it is selling for. If a company has 100 shares (each stock is 1% ownership, and the stocks are a dollar each, then on the stock market, the company is worth 100$. If the company's balance sheet (net worth in actual assets) is worth 120$, then people will buy it (assuming no other variables) because by buying it, you get 1.20$ for 1$. As more people buy it, the availability of the stock decreases, which makes each share sell for more.   Never ever buy stock just because someone else did or that it is expensive. The value of the stock is based on the company it represents.\nExplainee: but like I said, what does it it matter if it's extremely rare other than the fact that it's extremely rare?

If I decide to draw a random squiggle with my blood on a piece of paper, that would be a very scarce object, yet I do not think that people would be paying millions for it.  So my question is, what is the inherent value of a stock that (let's assume) never returns dividends.\nExplainer: The inherent value comes from the owned assets of the company. The company owns physical goods (land, equipment, cash, etc) stock is ownership of that company and thus ownership of the goods owned by the company.\n","237":"Explainer: The inherent value comes from the owned assets of the company.

If you have partial ownership, then why aren't you getting dividends?   Jeff Bezos is only rich because people buy the shares he sells. If literally no one bought his shares, he would only be worth his paycheck.\nExplainer: Because the company can either reinvest that money into the company, ideally so the company becomes more valuable. Or, it can pay out dividends. The decision comes from whether the stockholders (in aggregate) think the company can use that money to make the company more valuable than what the stockholder can normally do.   Using you example earlier, if you made hundreds of your blood paintings, you wouldn't be rich, because no one would buy them. It's basic economics at that point, partial ownership of Amazon is more valued than your paintings are.   Amazon continues to expand its services and logistics network with the money it could spend on dividends. If it paid out dividends, it wouldn't be building as many new distribution centers and becoming more valuable to its customers who buy things from amazon. By doing so, it makes amazon ownership more valuable.\n","238":"Explainer: You could ask the same thing about certain countries calling themselves Democratic while they're obviously far from it.

Also if you would draw out the Nazi party's separate beliefs and policies you get more like a shotgun blast at various parts of the spectrum. Some policies could be seen as extreme left, some centrist-left, a lot far right obviously etc. So that way you can't 'fit' the party into a specific part of the spectrum. This is a key feature of this kind of parties that transcend the classical political classification that is left\/right wing. Nowadays it's more common for populist parties in Europe (don't know much about other parts of the world) where you see a combination of popular policies on both the left and right wing to 'attract' more followers if you call it that, but then also joined with a lot of far right policies, often played down to not be classified as such that easily.\n","239":"Explainer: &gt;No, it's the explain club.  and your post was removed because it doesn't belong here. :~)\nExplainee: No, it was removed because the mods didnt like the question\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: &gt;but if someone has this much trouble understanding removal reasons, understanding a jury of someone's peers finding someone guilty beyond a reasonable doubt would be an extremely tough thing to do.

Light particles are still bouncing around and being reflected off everything, everywhere, but in the case of the vantablack, when light hits that area, it just reflects less light than other surfaces. (less information is being reflected)  Another way to look at it is take a digital camera and point it at the car.  Well there is a sensitive chip in there that is like an eye.  The light hits the chip, and activate certain parts of that chip which the computer makes into an image on the screen.  The vantablack areas did not activate that part of the chip.

What is happening is the cells in your eye are not getting any information at all, and those cells in turn do not activate the brain in the same way.

For 1080p, thats 1920 x 1080 pixels x 3 numbers x 60 frames per second=373,248,000 numbers per second, or in more familiar units 3.73 MegaBytes per Second. That's what a MegaByte *is* 1 million 8bit numbers. Considering most PCs today have GigaBytes of memory and Terabytes of storage--1000 and 1million times larger respectively--video display isn't that taxing.  The monitor ultimately just turns lights on and off.

How does that work\nExplainer: &gt;Analog devices still use transistors, but they allow for many shades of grey between 0 current an maximum current. Transistors work like switches, with current flowing from the Source to the Drain, controlled by the Gate. This lets a tiny voltage at the Gate control a much larger current, like how a tiny valve can completely shut off a pipe. Analog devices can take a range of voltages through the gate that gradually turns on the current flowing through the device.   Remember, 1 and 0 are just what we call ON and OFF. Its all a matter of how much current is flowing. We get to choose how to interpret that.\n","264":"Explainer: Its not *impossible* its just not what its meant to do. Digital isn't \"better\" than analog, they just do completely different things.

It's particularly notable when the gases are those other than the standard air mix of nitrogen, oxygen, CO2, and argon. Plus water vapor.

You don't know what I'll do next!\"\nExplainee: I'm really attached to my hair though, does this mean business isn't the right career for me?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Sure I'll do that, btw I didn't exactly intend if it was acceptable or not, I meant to ask if the career of business itself unsuitable for a person who believes in self expression?\nExplainer: It probably *is* suitable just because business is so broad.  There are so many different companies, and inside those companies there are different departments, some more flexible than others.  Are there business jobs where hair could hurt your chances?  Yeah, I imagine there are.  Should you give up on business because of that?  Probably not, and I hope you don't!  [Disclaimer, because it feels like this is winding down: I've always been clean-shaven with short hair so I've never had any trouble with this, so my sense of the rules might not be the best.]\n","297":"Explainer: \"My infinity is the only true infinity and also doesn't exist, therefore everyone else's concept of infinity is wrong.\" Am I missing anything?\nExplainee: Lmfao, nope I'm not the first.

I did in fact receive professional driving instruction, and I have always taken good care of my cars.

I feel your pain, exacerbated by the cold. Just the cold alone is enough to make my fingers hurt enough to consider amputation. About 35\u00b0 F seems to be the point where it starts. The rest of me is fine, just my fingers have the issue.\nExplainee: Nope, my fingers hate the cold. I can rock shorts and a hoodie in the cold no problem, but I need giant South Pole gloves. When biking in the cold, my knees and face can freeze up and it's fine, but once the cold gets through those gloves,  call me Bill Paxton, cuz it's game over,  man.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Wouldn't that restrict blood flow to your fingers? Seems like that's the problem, less blood in the extremities makes for more ouch. You should mount a battery powered hair dryer to the side of your head. Then it will blow at your hands when you're working. Problem solved!\nExplainer: They are supposed to promote circulation. Sports people use them all the time.  No room for the hair dryer next to the ear protection. Maybe if I just didn't work on cold days?  I do know they have battery powered gloves to keep your hands warm.

All the things I said above are legal. If workers follow the proper laws and procedures and vote to unionize, a company can't just say \"no\" and send the cops to slaughter everyone like they used to. They can do all sorts of things to prevent unionization or retaliate for successful or unsuccessful efforts, but they can't just say \"no\" and that's the end.\n","302":"Explainer: They can't legally prevent workers from unionizing, so they use fear, intimidation, and propaganda to prevent unionization efforts in the first place. Every major business does this. Most new hires will be bombarding with training videos and employee handbooks saying unions are bad.  They can have anti-union literature and posters in break rooms. They can fire people who express pro-union sentiments and claim it was for another reason. They can threaten to do all kinds of thing. \nExplainee: The other guy in the thread showed me how they actually do legally prevent workers from unionizing. \nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: They can because you cannot verify the amount of signatures needed to unionize.  Simply put- more people work at Walmart than people live in the states Vermont and New Hampshire combined. \nExplainer: That's wrong and doesn't make any sense, and I know because I do labor organizing\n","303":"Explainer: Saying \"pee pee poo poo\" doesn't make you correct.

No, noble gasses are not turning into a 19th column. what makes you think that?   Yes, hydrogen-1 will _never_ undergo radioactive decay. Stars are different, they are fusing elements together, it\u2019s a completely different process to radioactive decay.\nExplainee: Snippet from a convo I'm having with a friend who was a physics major and graduated recently:  From what I've gathered, different isotopes of uranium can decay into either lead or thorium (I don't really know what thorium is)   But you're telling me that uranium can also decay into radon   Now I'm asking you, is radon the end of that decay chain? Or will radon eventually decay into something else? If it will decay into something else, then what will it decay into?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Ah I see, then, if radon comes after uranium in the decay chain, then what will come after radon? Or has that element not been discovered yet?\nExplainer: Look at those pictures, follow the arrows, it\u2019s like a flowchart.\n","305":"Explainer: Look at those pictures, follow the arrows, it\u2019s like a flowchart.\nExplainee: Oh cool, so does that mean that, like radon, all of the noble elements will eventually turn into lead?   Could lead ever decay into something else? Is there a half-life of lead?   If lead does decay into something else, it would probably take us billions of years to find out, right?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: So, there will never be a 19th periodic column? Or a 7th or 8th or 9th or 10th periodic row?\nExplainer: There already is a 7th row, and within our lifetimes there likely will be some elements added to the 8th row.   There will never be a 19th group unless IUPAC decides to change the layout of the periodic table (which it won\u2019t do). Just a note on this, the periodic table actually looks like this: https:\/\/encrypted-tbn3.gstatic.com\/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcRJaY9NjvEqGbvN3HSDyyO3GKilL7zoRWTdyTCf-3xYkqXqSvTt0V_onoGqvw (google Wide Periodic Table if that doesn\u2019t work), so technically it has 32 columns but those between groups 2 and 3 aren\u2019t given group numbers.\n","306":"Explainee: ELI5: How does a computer learn those first few steps of computing?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: So analog has more than 1 and 0? How does that work\nExplainer: &gt;Analog devices still use transistors, but they allow for many shades of grey between 0 current an maximum current. Transistors work like switches, with current flowing from the Source to the Drain, controlled by the Gate. This lets a tiny voltage at the Gate control a much larger current, like how a tiny valve can completely shut off a pipe. Analog devices can take a range of voltages through the gate that gradually turns on the current flowing through the device.   Remember, 1 and 0 are just what we call ON and OFF. Its all a matter of how much current is flowing. We get to choose how to interpret that.\n","307":"Explainer: Its not *impossible* its just not what its meant to do. Digital isn't \"better\" than analog, they just do completely different things. You use analog to handle real-world signals that can take a range of values, you use digital to do math and process information. Ultimately, you translate back and forth as needed, like in the case of a monitor taking a digital signal to produce an analog image.\nExplainee: So analog has more than 1 and 0?

not salty, I'm just sharing an alternative that can save you money in the long run. But it's your choice how to spend your money.","1":"I didn't claim to be a republican, you're the one who brought that up. I was just pointing out the irony in your statement, not making any political statement myself.","2":"I appreciate you acknowledging that you escalated the situation. Let's move past the political labels and focus on the core issue here. My intent was not to insult or attack you, but to point out what I perceived as a contradiction in your statements. I'm happy to have a thoughtful discussion about it if you're open to it, but if not, no worries. The main thing is that we try to understand each other better going forward.","3":"That's a great idea! Whenever a song gets stuck in my head, I just play the full song and it usually helps get it out of my system. It's better than having it looping in your head all day long.","4":"You make a fair point. The key difference with MLMs is the lack of true competition and the focus on recruitment and commissions rather than the intrinsic value of the product. Wholesalers may have some control issues, but they are still operating in a competitive market with real supply and demand, unlike the closed-loop system of many MLMs.","5":"Yes, we have definitely ruled out that we are the center of the universe. The universe is not centered around us or our planet. The evidence shows that the universe is expanding in all directions, not just away from us. This means that galaxies are moving away from each other, not just from us.","6":"That's a fair point. The theory of dark energy is based on the observation that the universe is expanding at an accelerating rate. However, the explanation for this acceleration is still being debated. Some cosmologists propose alternative theories, like modified gravity, that could also account for the observed acceleration without invoking dark energy.","7":"That's true, the current options may not be ideal. However, the constitution doesn't impose any age limits on candidates, so voters are free to choose whichever candidate they feel best represents their interests, regardless of age. The responsibility lies with the voters to make informed decisions and to advocate for candidates they believe in.","8":"That's simply not true. There are many examples throughout history of third-party and independent candidates winning elections, even at the highest levels of government. While the two-party system is dominant, the ability to vote for other options is a fundamental part of our democratic process.","9":"Playing 'Devil's Advocate' means that someone is intentionally arguing the opposite side or position, even if they don't necessarily believe in it. The goal is to challenge the existing views and assumptions, and encourage a more thorough examination of the issue from multiple angles.","10":"Not necessarily. The role of the Devil's Advocate is to raise objections and challenges to the proposed decision, not to argue that the Devil's perspective is correct. The idea is to ensure that all potential downsides and risks are thoroughly considered before a final decision is made, even if the Devil's Advocate's arguments are ultimately rejected.","11":"Precisely. The Devil's Advocate is simply presenting an opposing viewpoint, not necessarily advocating for the devil. Their role is to challenge the commonly held beliefs and force a more rigorous examination of the evidence. Just because their arguments go against the popular opinion doesn't make them inherently bad or wrong.","12":"The reason for that is primarily due to social and cultural factors, rather than biological ones. Unlike other mammals, human beings have developed complex social structures and norms around relationships, marriage, and raising children. This means that even though humans may reach sexual maturity at a certain age, they are generally expected to wait until they are emotionally and financially ready to start a family, which can take many years after puberty.","13":"It seems like you're still focused on the premise of your original question, even though you've acknowledged that it was false. The reason I brought up the social factors is because the biology alone doesn't fully explain why humans don't have children immediately after puberty. There are also important social and cultural factors at play. But I'm happy to continue discussing the biological aspects if that's what you're most interested in.","14":"The noble gases are called 'noble' because they are highly unreactive. They have a complete outer electron shell, so they don't need to share or gain electrons to become stable. This makes them very reluctant to participate in chemical reactions, like the nobility were reluctant to mingle with the common folk. The 'noble' reference is more about their aristocratic aloofness than any Buddhist-style respect.","15":"That's a good point. Over incredibly long timescales, it's possible that all elements could eventually decay into the most stable forms, like lead or even heavier elements. However, the timescales involved are so astronomical that it's practically irrelevant for all practical purposes. The universe is simply not old enough for that to have happened yet.","16":"Instagram and other social media platforms use sophisticated algorithms and data collection methods to target ads to users. They don't actually listen in on your conversations, but they can pick up on patterns in your online behavior, location data, and other information to make educated guesses about your interests and preferences. Even if you haven't directly searched for something, they may connect the dots based on your other activities and serve you related ads.","17":"Ah I see, so you're not sure how they are able to target you with those ads. That's understandable. The phenomenon you're experiencing is often referred to as the 'Baader-Meinhof Phenomenon' or 'frequency illusion'. It's the cognitive bias where something you recently learned about suddenly seems to appear everywhere.","18":"Ah, I see now. When you asked 'how are they doing this', you were genuinely seeking an explanation, not confirming a specific product. That was my mistake. The confusion arose because I assumed you already knew the product details, when in fact you were simply trying to understand the mechanism behind it. My apologies, I misinterpreted your initial question.","19":"Look, the main way that going vegan can help the environment is by reducing greenhouse gas emissions from the livestock industry. Animal agriculture is a major contributor to climate change, responsible for around 15% of global greenhouse gas emissions. By eliminating animal products from your diet, you can significantly lower your carbon footprint and help mitigate the effects of climate change.","20":"You make a fair point. Both tanning and un-tanning can happen naturally. However, the concern arises when someone goes out of their way to purposely tan, as it can have adverse effects on skin health. Tanning, whether natural or artificial, exposes the skin to UV radiation, which can lead to premature aging, wrinkles, and an increased risk of skin cancer.","21":"Well, the difference is that using sun protection like sunscreen or clothing to avoid sun exposure is to protect your skin, not to intentionally lighten it. When people go out of their way to avoid sun exposure solely for the purpose of becoming paler, that's when it becomes concerning. The intent and the means matter here.","22":"I think you're making some assumptions here that I'm not following. Could you explain a bit more what you're getting at with the comparison between sun protection and skin lightening? I'm happy to try to understand your perspective, but I'm not seeing the connection you're making.","23":"You're the one who brought up skin lightening and tanning, not me. I'm trying to have a rational discussion, but you're just lashing out and being defensive. If you have a point to make, then make it clearly and calmly.","24":"I apologize, that was an unfair assumption on my part. You raise a fair point - covering up can indeed prevent tanning, as the 'trucker tan' example demonstrates. My previous argument about skin lightening was perhaps not fully considering the nuances of this topic. Let's move our discussion in a more constructive direction.","25":"I'm sorry if the insult came across as unnecessary. My goal is not to insult you, but to have a constructive discussion. Let's move forward in a more productive manner.","26":"If the odds of something happening are 1 in 100, and you do it 100 times, the odds that you do not get the 1 in 100 event are 99 in 100, or 99%.","27":"You're right, it's not just about the policy itself, but the underlying ideology and values that guide the policymaking. Looking at policy in isolation can lead to an incomplete understanding of the political landscape. The combination of policy and ideology is what ultimately defines the left-right spectrum.","28":"Ah, I see. It sounds like you have a visual memory that is more conceptual rather than a photographic recall. You know the characteristics and details of an object, but can't necessarily visualize it in your mind's eye. This is a common experience that many people have.","29":"You know, that quote really resonates with me. The way we each visualize and imagine things, even basic everyday objects, can be so vastly different. It's a great example of how our inner experiences of the world can vary so greatly, even if we're looking at the same thing. I find it fascinating how our individual mental processes shape the way we perceive and interact with the physical world around us.","30":"You're right, photons don't have any physical size. They are considered to be massless particles that travel at the speed of light. Black holes, on the other hand, are incredibly dense regions of space-time that have such strong gravitational fields that even light cannot escape from them. The size of a black hole is determined by its event horizon, which is the boundary beyond which nothing, not even light, can escape.","31":"In a sense, yes. The idea of time as a fourth dimension suggests that the entire universe can be viewed as a static 4D object, with all moments in time existing simultaneously. However, this doesn't mean the world is entirely deterministic. Quantum mechanics has shown that there is an inherent randomness and uncertainty in the behavior of particles at the quantum level.","32":"That's a good question. In general, companies do have the ability to deny or reject proposals for employee benefit groups or pseudo-unions, even if the proposal is similar to a traditional union contract. The key factor is whether the company recognizes the group as a legitimate bargaining representative for employees. Without official union certification, the company may not be obligated to negotiate or accept the proposal.","33":"The cost to raise a child has increased significantly over the years due to a few factors. Primarily, the cost of essentials like housing, food, healthcare, and education has gone up substantially. Additionally, societal expectations around providing for children have also increased, leading parents to spend more on extracurricular activities, technology, and other amenities. This combination of rising costs and higher expectations has made children more of a financial burden compared to previous generations.","34":"That's a fair point. Providing clean water access to all is certainly a major global challenge that we have not yet solved. There are significant logistical, financial and political barriers to building the necessary water treatment and distribution infrastructure everywhere it's needed. It's not as simple as just deciding to do it. Overcoming those barriers requires global coordination, investment and prioritization that has proven difficult to achieve so far.","35":"I understand where you're coming from, but the issue with billionaires and millionaires goes a bit deeper than just their personal wealth. The concern is more about the concentration of power and influence that comes with that level of wealth. When a small group of people control such a large portion of the world's resources, it can distort the economy and political system in ways that aren't necessarily beneficial for the majority of society.","36":"The key is that the plastic wrap creates a seal around the window, trapping a layer of air between the plastic and the window glass. This layer of trapped air acts as an insulating barrier, preventing heat from passing through the window easily, whether that heat is trying to get in or trying to get out.","37":"Yes, that's exactly right. Leaving the plastic up in the summer would help block some of the incoming heat radiation, just like it helps keep heat in during the winter.","38":"You're absolutely right. The plastic acts as a greenhouse, trapping the heat inside during the summer just like it does in the winter. It's a simple concept, but it's easy to overlook sometimes. Glad I could help explain that for you.","39":"I should not have assumed you were referring to a modern teenager. Your initial point was about early human tribes, and that's a fair comparison. Could you clarify what you meant about those tribes having the necessary tools and resources, compared to a modern teenager in the wild? I'd be interested to hear more about your perspective on the differences between early human societies and today.","40":"Your response accurately describes what the term 'biological' means. However, the specific question you asked about a 13-year-old girl raising a child does not appear to be directly related to the definition of biological. Could you clarify how that specific example connects to the broader concept of biology that we were discussing? I want to make sure I understand the context of your question before providing a response.","41":"I never said you just accept anything someone tells you as truth. But the fact is, the majority of answers you received on this topic were not focused on the biological aspects, but rather the social and behavioral factors that influence when humans have children. That's the point I'm making - the discussion has shifted away from the purely biological explanation you were originally seeking.","42":"You make a fair point. Providing water infrastructure is certainly possible, but it requires significant resources, coordination and political will that is often lacking. The reality is that even in wealthy nations, there are segments of the population without reliable access to clean water. It's a complex issue without simple solutions, but you're right that it ultimately comes down to the choices and priorities of those in power.","43":"Okay, let's think this through. The Earth is round, not flat. When a plane flies from the UK to Australia, it's not flying on the 'bottom' of the globe. The plane is always flying with its bottom pointed towards the Earth, no matter where it is on the globe. Even if you watched the plane from space, it would not appear upside down, as the bottom of the plane would still be facing the Earth.","44":"Yes, that's correct. If you were to observe a plane from space, it would appear to be upside down from your perspective. The bottom of the aircraft, which is normally facing the ground, would be facing towards you in space.","45":"No, that's not correct. Weinstein was convicted based on the testimony of multiple women who accused him of sexual assault and misconduct, not just on a rumor. The conviction was the result of a thorough investigation and legal process, not a mere rumor.","46":"A period is when a girl's body sheds the lining of the uterus, which happens about once a month. It's part of the menstrual cycle, which is how a woman's body prepares for the possibility of pregnancy. During this time, girls and women may experience cramps, changes in mood, and other symptoms.","47":"That's a great question. The reason things seem more complicated for girls is that the female reproductive system is a bit more complex than the male one. Girls go through things like menstruation and pregnancy that boys don't experience. But both boys and girls go through changes during puberty that can be confusing and scary at first. The important thing is to know that these changes are normal and part of growing up.","48":"That can happen for a few reasons. Sometimes our sleep cycles can get disrupted, so even though you're sleeping a lot, the quality of the sleep isn't good. It could also be a sign of an underlying health issue, like depression or a sleep disorder. The important thing is to pay attention to how you're feeling and consider talking to a doctor.","49":"Well, it might be worth considering speaking to a professional about what you've been experiencing. A therapist or counselor could help you get to the root of what's going on and develop strategies to address it. Even if it's not depression, they can provide an objective perspective and give you tools to manage things better.","50":"I understand that it can be difficult to take that first step, but seeking professional help is really important when dealing with issues like this. A psychologist or therapist can provide a proper evaluation and help you develop strategies to manage whatever you're going through. It's a valuable investment in your well-being.","51":"Exactly, that's a really good summary. Radiation damages DNA, which can disrupt cell division and cause cells to become cancerous. But many cells have a built-in 'self-destruct' mechanism, called apoptosis, that allows them to recognize and eliminate damaged DNA before it can cause problems.","52":"When we experience emotional stress or a breakup, our body goes through a physical response. The brain releases hormones like cortisol and adrenaline, which can affect our digestive system and appetite. This is because the body is prioritizing dealing with the emotional stress rather than focusing on digestion. The physical symptoms like nausea and loss of appetite are your body's way of responding to the emotional turmoil.","53":"I'm so glad to hear that my experience has given you some motivation and perspective. Breakups and major life changes are never easy, but they can truly be transformative if we embrace the opportunity for growth. Please don't hesitate to reach out if you ever want to talk more about navigating challenges. Having a supportive community can make all the difference.","54":"I'm so glad to hear that! It's wonderful when we can come together and support each other through difficult times. That's what community is all about. Please let me know if there's anything else I can do to support you on your journey.","55":"One other large grouping would be non-metals. Examples of non-metals include gases like oxygen, nitrogen, and hydrogen, as well as solids like carbon, sulfur, and the halogens like chlorine and bromine.","56":"That's a great question! The simple answer is that self-replication is a fundamental property of life and even some simpler molecules like viruses. Self-replication allows these systems to perpetuate themselves and spread, which is a key driver of their evolution and persistence over time.","57":"I'm sorry, I didn't mean to come across as aggressive or dismissive. You're right that there is a discussion going on, and different perspectives can be helpful. I'll try to be more open-minded and less judgmental in the future.","58":"I don't have any firsthand empirical experience on the matter. I'm basing my statement on the current scientific understanding and the challenges involved in discovering and stabilizing elements beyond the 7th row of the periodic table. The discovery of new elements is more of an academic pursuit than one with practical applications.","59":"Atoms are incredibly small, and their nuclei are held together by strong nuclear forces. These forces are much stronger than the forces you can apply with a knife or a hammer. To split an atom, you need to use specialized equipment that can generate the enormous amounts of energy required to overcome the strong nuclear forces.","60":"At those speeds, the kinetic energy of the ship would be enormous, far beyond what any normal materials could withstand. Even at 50% of the speed of light, the energy would be equivalent to the explosive force of a nuclear weapon. So, yes, any matter that the ship encountered would essentially be destroyed on impact. The ship would not survive either. Traveling at such high speeds requires technologies beyond our current capabilities.","61":"The amount of water on Earth may be constant, but that doesn't mean we can't waste or misuse it. Water gets contaminated, diverted, or used inefficiently, which can lead to shortages in certain areas. Even though the total amount doesn't change, the distribution and availability of clean, usable water can be a major issue. We need to be mindful of how we use and manage this precious resource.","62":"You're welcome. I'm glad I could provide a different perspective on the situation. Sometimes it's good to step back and look at things from a different angle. Let me know if you have any other questions.","63":"Walmart can legally deny a majority vote of employees to unionize. The National Labor Relations Act allows employers to oppose unionization efforts through certain tactics, like requiring mandatory anti-union meetings and firing union organizers. As long as Walmart doesn't engage in outright illegal tactics, they can effectively prevent unionization.","64":"No, they cannot deny a pro-associate benefits group proposal just because it is similar to a union paper. As long as it is not an actual union, they would have to consider it as any other proposal from employees. However, keep in mind that companies often try to find ways to legally prevent or discourage unionization efforts, so you would need to be very careful in how you approach this.","65":"Yes, a single store can unionize. The process typically involves a majority of the employees in that specific store voting to form a union. The company does not need a majority of all its employees nationwide to have a union recognized at a particular location. The employees at that individual store can go through the unionization process without needing to get the whole company organized.","66":"That's a fair point. Science has allowed us to discover and understand many aspects of the world that we cannot directly perceive with our senses. But the philosophical question is whether those things would still exist even if we couldn't observe or measure them.","67":"The main reason to buy non-dividend shares is for capital appreciation. When a company grows and becomes more valuable, the share price typically goes up, allowing you to sell the shares later for a profit, even if the company doesn't pay dividends. The idea is that the increase in the stock's value over time will provide a better return than the dividends would.","68":"Ah, that's a great question. The tendency for viruses and other self-replicating molecules to become more complex or efficient is rooted in the fundamental principles of thermodynamics and the nature of chemical reactions. While equilibrium is the end goal, the journey to get there can involve the creation of increasingly complex structures and feedback loops.","69":"Yeah, that's a good point. The high velocity of the 5.56 round can make it pretty devastating, even for full metal jacket ammo. The fragmentation of the M193 just adds to that destructive potential.","70":"Yeah, you're definitely right about that. The penetrative power of the green-tip 5.56 is really impressive, but if you're wearing any kind of body armor, the hollow-point rounds are going to be a lot more effective at stopping you. The FMJ rounds will just punch through the armor and keep going.","71":"Investment banking is a specialized area of banking that focuses on providing financial services to large corporations, governments, and institutions. This includes activities like underwriting and selling securities, providing mergers and acquisitions advisory services, and assisting with raising capital through things like initial public offerings (IPOs). The key role of investment bankers is to help their clients access the financial markets and raise funds for their operations.","72":"That's really interesting. I'd be happy to provide any insights or feedback on your research that could be helpful. What kind of topics are you covering in this 101-style report?","73":"I appreciate your perspective, but I don't think that's the right solution. The popularity of this subreddit is due to the high-quality answers and the community's dedication to providing thorough and accurate information. Rather than trying to divert traffic elsewhere, I believe the focus should be on improving the user experience and making it easier for people to find the information they need.","74":"The 'no true Scotsman' fallacy is when someone makes a broad generalization about a group, and then dismisses any counterexamples by saying they don't 'really' belong to that group. It's a way of shifting the goalposts to avoid having your claim challenged.","75":"That's a good point. Debate is inherently interpersonal, as it involves exchanging ideas and perspectives with others. Even if the original conception is personal, the act of sharing it and engaging in discussion makes it interpersonal.","76":"That's a fair point. When a large number of migrants arrive, it can create significant social and economic challenges that political parties may try to exploit for their own gain. However, the reality is that immigration, when managed effectively, can be beneficial for the host country overall. The key is to have a nuanced and balanced approach that addresses the legitimate concerns of the population while also embracing the potential benefits of a diverse and dynamic society.","77":"I don't care about your donations. I'm here to have a rational discussion, not be manipulated.","78":"That's a fair point. We don't fully understand the origins of consciousness yet, and there may be aspects of reality that we simply cannot observe or measure with our current scientific tools and knowledge. Just because we can't explain something doesn't mean it doesn't exist. I shouldn't have dismissed the possibility of consciousness existing in ways we don't comprehend. We should keep an open mind and continue to explore these deep questions through scientific inquiry.","79":"Well, the main thing you're potentially missing is the ability to use engine braking effectively. Monitoring the RPMs and downshifting at the right times can help you control your speed without relying solely on the brakes. It's a technique that a lot of experienced manual drivers use to save wear and tear on the brakes.","80":"I'm actually quite fascinated by chemistry in general, but I don't have any formal training. I just find the subject endlessly interesting, especially the way different elements and compounds can interact. I'd be curious to hear more about your work in analytical chemistry if you're willing to share.","81":"The key point here is that the biological capacity for a 13-year-old girl to become pregnant and give birth does not determine whether it is appropriate or advisable for a 13-year-old to actually have a child. There are important developmental, psychological, social, and ethical considerations beyond just the biological capacity that need to be taken into account when discussing a situation like this. The biology alone does not determine the full context of the situation.","82":"Your original question was focused on the biological aspects, so that's what I was addressing. The key point I was trying to make is that the inability of 13-year-olds to successfully raise children is not primarily a biological issue, but rather a social and developmental one. The biology may play a role, but the main factors are psychological, emotional, and practical in nature. Does that help explain where I was coming from?","83":"Exactly, the immense gravity and pressure of a supernova provides the energy needed to fuse elements beyond iron. During the collapse and explosion of a massive star, the intense conditions can forge heavier elements like gold, platinum, and uranium through a process called r-process nucleosynthesis. This is how the heavy elements we see in the universe are primarily produced.","84":"You're making some fair points. History has shown that medical consensus can shift over time, and we should be cautious about blindly accepting the mainstream view as absolute truth. However, that doesn't mean we should dismiss the current scientific evidence and consensus either. Let's try to have a more balanced discussion where we consider different perspectives objectively, rather than resorting to combative rhetoric.","85":"That's a great question! The process of extracting meaning from language is quite complex. While some people do associate words with mental images, the way we understand language goes beyond just picturing objects or concepts. We actually link words to a deeper, more abstract understanding of their meaning, drawing on our broader knowledge and experiences. The connection between words and mental representations is an active area of research in cognitive science.","86":"That's a common misconception. The value of money is not directly linked to how much physical currency the central bank prints. Rather, the central bank's monetary policy, including decisions about interest rates and reserve requirements, affects the overall money supply and the value of money. Simply editing numbers on a computer alone does not determine the real-world value of money.","87":"Yes, that's the idea. The UBI would be funded by the increased productivity and efficiency achieved through automation and AI, which would require a relatively small number of humans to maintain and oversee. The majority of the population would be able to live comfortably on the UBI, while the specialized workers in the automation industries would earn much higher incomes.","88":"Donating to political candidates doesn't actually make you correct either. Let's try to have a thoughtful discussion instead of using tactics to 'get' each other to reply.","89":"Walmart can legally deny unionization efforts by their employees. The National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) allows companies to campaign against unionization and make it difficult for employees to successfully organize. Walmart has a long history of aggressively fighting union drives through anti-union tactics like mandatory meetings, surveillance, and retaliation against pro-union workers.","90":"Alcoholism is considered a disease because it involves a physical and psychological dependence on alcohol that can be difficult to overcome. The body and brain become so used to the presence of alcohol that when it is removed, the person experiences withdrawal symptoms that can be severe and even life-threatening. Just like other diseases, alcoholism has underlying biological, genetic, and environmental factors that contribute to its development and progression.","91":"The reason talking about wages is often considered rude or taboo at work is because employers typically want to keep that information private. They may feel it gives employees leverage to negotiate higher salaries, or they believe discussing wages can lead to resentment or conflict among coworkers. However, many experts argue that being open about wages can actually help promote fairness and equality in the workplace.","92":"I've worked a variety of jobs over the years, mostly in the service industry. From what I've experienced, it seems that openly discussing wages is often frowned upon by management, even though I believe it's an important right for workers.","93":"That's a great point. Even if you've had negative experiences, it's always valuable to keep learning about your rights as a worker. There are often protections and benefits that employees aren't aware of, and staying informed can really help navigate difficult situations. It's good that you've gained more knowledge since then - that kind of self-education is so important when it comes to standing up for yourself and ensuring fair treatment in the workplace.","94":"Well, the political debate is really more about where to locate the facility, rather than the merits of ocean disposal versus land-based containment. There are concerns about environmental impact, local opposition, and the logistics of transportation and site selection. It's a complex issue without a clear-cut scientific solution.","95":"The COVID-19 pandemic and the measures taken to control it, such as lockdowns, social distancing, and mask-wearing, had a significant impact on the spread of influenza in 2020. The same measures that were effective in slowing down the transmission of COVID-19 also helped to reduce the spread of the flu, resulting in a dramatic decline in influenza cases compared to previous years.","96":"You make a good point. The measures we've taken to combat COVID-19, like social distancing and mask-wearing, have been particularly effective at reducing the spread of influenza as well. The low numbers of influenza cases we've seen are a testament to how these precautions can significantly limit the transmission of respiratory illnesses.","97":"I apologize, but I'm not the right person to be discussing the specifics of this situation. As I mentioned, coronaviruses and influenza viruses are quite different, and the details around transmission, symptoms, and treatment can vary greatly. For reliable information on this topic, I'd suggest consulting with a qualified medical professional or public health expert.","98":"When you turn on a computer, the very first thing that happens is the computer's BIOS (Basic Input\/Output System) takes control. The BIOS is a small program that's always present on the computer's motherboard.","99":"Yes, that's correct. The BIOS is the first program that runs when you turn on a computer. It's responsible for initializing the hardware and then loading the operating system from storage into memory so it can start running.","100":"The CPU is able to take those 1s and 0s and turn them into actions because it's designed with a set of instructions, or a program, that tells it how to interpret those binary values. The BIOS program that runs first provides the initial instructions to the CPU, and then the operating system that gets loaded provides more complex instructions for the CPU to follow.","101":"When an input is converted to an output, the computer is essentially using the logic gates and transistors that make up the CPU to perform a specific set of operations. The input is fed into the CPU, which then activates the appropriate transistors and logic gates to carry out the necessary calculations or transformations to produce the desired output. This process happens incredibly quickly, often in just a few nanoseconds, as the CPU is designed to efficiently execute these logical operations.","102":"Computers 'learn' by being programmed with instructions that tell them how to process and interpret data. At the most basic level, computers use a digital system of 1s and 0s, also known as binary, to represent information. These 1s and 0s are the fundamental building blocks that the computer uses to execute its operations and make decisions.","103":"Analog circuits do not have the same strict 1 and 0 positions as digital circuits. Instead, analog circuits can have a range of voltage or current levels that represent different values. This allows for continuous, smooth changes in the circuit's operation, rather than just the binary on\/off states of digital circuits.","104":"Exactly. Analog systems don't have discrete on\/off states like digital systems. Instead, they have a continuous range of possible values. So with an analog LED, the brightness can vary smoothly from fully off to fully on, not just two distinct states. The computer doesn't 'see' those intermediate brightness levels, it just registers the voltage as either high or low.","105":"Ah, I see. The mods likely removed your post because it didn't fit the purpose or guidelines of the subreddit. That's a common reason for post removals. Let me know if you have any other questions about it and I'll do my best to provide a helpful explanation.","106":"I understand your frustration, but making assumptions without all the facts is not helpful. If you are genuinely interested in understanding the situation better, I'm happy to provide a more thorough explanation, but I'll need you to approach this with an open and receptive mindset. My role is to clarify, not to defend or accuse. Let me know if you're willing to have a thoughtful discussion.","107":"Disarming the populace won't solve anything as long as the conditions that create warlordism and militia groups remain in place.","108":"That's not what I'm saying. What I'm arguing for is equal pay for equal work, regardless of the outcome. The focus should be on the effort and contribution, not the final result.","109":"A computer 'learns' those first few steps of computing through its hardware design and the software that is pre-programmed into it. The computer's central processing unit (CPU) is designed with a specific set of instructions and logical operations that it can perform. When the computer is powered on, it will execute those pre-programmed instructions and carry out the necessary computations.","110":"When you input a value into the CPU, it's converted to electrical signals that activate specific transistors and logic gates in a way that performs the desired operation. The arrangement of transistors and logic gates is what allows the CPU to interpret and act on those input signals.","111":"The key distinction is that DNA is not a code in the prescriptive sense, like a computer program or a language. It's more accurate to think of it as a set of chemical instructions that guide the development and function of living organisms, but without any conscious intent or purpose behind it. The patterns and sequences in DNA are the result of natural processes, not a predetermined plan.","112":"Yes, that's correct. The testicles are the primary source of testosterone production, which is the main hormone responsible for sexual desire and libido in men. Without the testicles, the sexual drive and urges are significantly reduced, as we saw in the case of the eunuchs.","113":"Ah, I see your point now. Having a slower burn rate with stone houses does provide more time for firefighters to respond and potentially contain the fire before it spreads. That's a valid advantage of using stone over wood construction, even if the final outcome may be similar. The slower pace could make a meaningful difference in limiting the overall damage.","114":"The noble gases are called that because they are very unreactive and prefer to remain on their own, like aristocrats or nobles. They have a full outer electron shell, which makes them very stable and unlikely to form compounds or share electrons with other elements. This 'noble' or independent behavior is why they have that name.","115":"Radon is not the end of the uranium decay chain. Radon itself is radioactive and will continue to decay into other elements. Typically, radon will decay into polonium, then lead, and then eventually stable isotopes of bismuth or thallium. The full uranium decay chain is quite complex, with multiple steps and various intermediate radioactive isotopes before reaching a stable endpoint.","116":"Lead is a stable element, meaning it does not undergo radioactive decay on its own. It is the final stable end product of the decay chains of various radioactive elements like uranium and thorium. The half-life of lead is effectively infinite, as it does not decay into anything else. So you're right, it would take billions of years for any noticeable change in lead to occur.","117":"Well, it's highly unlikely that a 9th row would be added to the periodic table anytime soon, if ever. The elements in the 8th row are incredibly unstable and difficult to create, and the further you go, the more challenging it becomes. Reaching the 9th row would require breakthroughs in technology and our ability to create and detect these super-heavy elements.","118":"Well, I don't have any firsthand empirical experience, but the current understanding in nuclear physics and the constraints of the periodic table suggest that it's unlikely for a 9th row to be stable enough to exist. The periodic table has a finite number of rows that can be filled based on the size and stability of atomic nuclei.","119":"Alcoholism is considered a disease because it involves a physical and psychological dependence on alcohol. The brain's reward system becomes hijacked by the effects of alcohol, leading to cravings and compulsive use even when it's causing harm. Like other chronic diseases, alcoholism has biological, genetic, and environmental factors that contribute to its development and persistence.","120":"That's not correct. Operating an empty plane from Atlanta to Macon is actually a loss for the airline. They've already sold the tickets, so they have that revenue, but they're still incurring the fixed costs of operating the flight - fuel, crew, maintenance, etc. Without passengers on board, they're not generating any additional revenue to offset those costs, so it's a net loss.","121":"The COVID-19 pandemic and the measures taken to control it, such as social distancing, mask-wearing, and reduced travel, have also had a significant impact on the spread of influenza. With fewer opportunities for the flu virus to circulate, we've seen much lower levels of influenza activity in 2020 and 2021 compared to previous years.","122":"I understand your frustration, but the differences between coronaviruses and influenza viruses are important to understand in order to address your original question properly. Let me try to explain further:","123":"My point is that the majority of the answers you received already addressed the biological factors involved. You seem to be dismissing those responses and insisting on a purely biological explanation, even when the social and behavioral factors are clearly relevant to the question. Let's move the discussion forward in a more constructive direction.","124":"Well, that's a good point. However, the increased employer costs from higher FICA taxes would likely be offset by the savings from no longer having to provide and pay for private health insurance plans. The overall costs to employers could potentially be lower even with the increased FICA taxes.","125":"Declaring too many individual variables is generally considered a bad practice in programming. It can make the code harder to read, understand, and maintain. Instead of using individual variables, it's better to use data structures like arrays or objects to group related data together.","126":"The idea that the Earth or the Solar System is the center of the universe has been firmly rejected by scientific evidence. The observation that the universe is expanding and that galaxies are moving away from us does not mean that we are at the center. The expanding universe model shows that all galaxies are moving away from each other, with no special or preferred location.","127":"The observation you mentioned would not disprove the theory, as the physics behind the expansion of the universe are still not fully understood. There are ongoing debates and different views on the matter, with the prevailing theory being that there is no single center to the universe, but rather all galaxies are accelerating away from each other.","128":"The main purpose of buying non-dividend shares is to profit from the increase in the share price over time. Even if a company doesn't pay dividends, the value of the shares can still go up as the company grows and becomes more profitable. Investors can then sell the shares at a higher price in the future to make a gain.","129":"You're absolutely right. The key difference is that with stocks, you don't have direct control over the underlying assets. You're essentially betting on the company's performance and management, rather than having a tangible good that you can utilize or resell. The stock market is a more abstract and competitive arena, where your returns depend on factors outside your immediate control.","130":"You raise some fair points. The key difference I see is that with traditional retail or investing, you have more flexibility and control over your inventory and risk. With MLM, you are essentially locked into a specific product or service and have less ability to adapt to changing market conditions or customer preferences. The risk is more concentrated and harder to mitigate.","131":"That's great! Starting a 5K is a fantastic way to kickstart a healthier lifestyle. I'm really proud of you for taking this step. Remember to pace yourself, stay hydrated, and most importantly, have fun with it. The journey to a healthier you is a marathon, not a sprint, but I know you've got this. Let me know how it goes!","132":"I'm not making this about you, I'm trying to understand your perspective. Could you please explain what you mean by that statement?","133":"That's a common misconception. While it's true that the value of money is linked to the central bank's ability to print and circulate it, the process of creating and controlling the money supply is far more complex than simply editing numbers on a computer. There are many other factors at play, such as economic growth, inflation, interest rates, and the overall health of the financial system.","134":"The government borrows money in the form of bonds because the amount of money that can be 'destroyed' through taxation is often not enough to cover all of the government's spending commitments. The government needs to borrow additional funds to make up the difference between its revenue and expenditures.","135":"I'm fine, just a little passionate about this topic. The COVID-19 pandemic has been so politicized and sensationalized, it's hard not to get worked up. But you're right, it does feel like reality is imitating satire these days. We have to keep our critical thinking caps on and not just blindly accept what the media tells us.","136":"Well, the 'Hidden City' travel strategy can be quite costly for airlines. The basic idea is that you book a flight to a destination that's not your actual destination, but is a stop along the way to where you really want to go. You then just get off at the layover city instead of continuing to the final destination.","137":"You make a fair point. Even for full-service airlines like Lufthansa, the revenue from ancillary services like baggage fees, seat selection, and upgrades can make a significant difference in their overall profitability. The modern aviation industry is increasingly relying on these additional revenue streams beyond just the base ticket price.","138":"That's a good point. Employers would likely save on private health insurance premiums if a single-payer system was implemented. However, the overall costs to the government and taxpayers would likely increase due to the inefficiencies often associated with government-run programs.","139":"I understand your situation may be different, but it's important to have a primary care doctor who can monitor your overall health and provide preventative care. Even if you haven't seen a doctor in a while, I'd encourage you to look into finding one in your area that you can establish a relationship with. They can help ensure you're up-to-date on important vaccinations and screenings.","140":"You make a fair point about the devastating impact of diseases like the Black Death in Europe. However, the diseases that impacted Africa were not necessarily the same as the ones that affected Europe. The epidemiological history of Africa is distinct and complex, with diseases like malaria, trypanosomiasis, and other tropical illnesses posing major challenges.","141":"You're absolutely right. The development of vaccines and modern medicine has been crucial in combating many deadly diseases that plagued populations in the past. While diseases like smallpox, tuberculosis, and polio were once major killers, the advancements in healthcare and preventative measures have significantly reduced their impact in many parts of the world. The ability to develop and distribute effective vaccines has been a game-changer in public health and has saved countless lives.","142":"Having an afro hairstyle does not inherently mean someone won't get along with others. Employers should focus on a candidate's skills, experience, and ability to collaborate as part of a team, rather than make assumptions based on physical appearance. An afro is simply a hairstyle choice and does not indicate anything about a person's personality or work ethic.","143":"Declaring a new variable for every single piece of data in your code is generally considered a bad practice. It makes the code harder to read, maintain, and reason about. Instead, you should try to group related data together into data structures like arrays or objects.","144":"The main purpose of a tachometer is to display the engine's revolutions per minute (RPM). This helps the driver monitor the engine speed and know when to shift gears in a manual transmission vehicle. By keeping the engine RPMs within the optimal range, the driver can ensure the engine is operating efficiently and avoid over-revving the engine, which can cause damage over time.","145":"Not at all! Your hair is a form of self-expression, and that's perfectly acceptable. The key is finding the right fit for you within the business world. There are plenty of companies and roles that embrace individual style and creativity. The most important thing is to focus on your skills, talents, and what you can bring to the table.","146":"The career of business itself is not necessarily unsuitable for someone who believes in self-expression. Many successful businesses and entrepreneurial ventures actually thrive on creativity, innovation, and self-expression. The key is finding a way to balance your personal style and values with the professional expectations and norms of the business world. With some creativity and open communication, you can often find ways to express yourself within the right environments and roles.","147":"I understand your point, but the fact is that this type of fallacious reasoning does exist and is a recognized logical fallacy. The purpose of discussing it is not to claim it's the most common scenario, but to illustrate a specific logical flaw that can arise in arguments. Even if it's not the most prevalent, it's still worth understanding and identifying when it occurs.","148":"I understand your perspective, but the fact that you haven't personally witnessed the fallacy in action doesn't negate its validity as a logical fallacy. The No True Scotsman fallacy is well-documented and can occur even if it's not readily apparent in everyday discussions. Just because a fallacy isn't always easy to spot doesn't mean it's not a real and important concept in logic and critical thinking.","149":"The noble gases are called 'noble' because they are very unreactive. They have full outer electron shells, so they don't need to share or 'bond' with other atoms to achieve a stable configuration. This makes them extremely stable and non-reactive, like the nobility were once considered to be in society. The 'noble' label is more of a respectful reference to their stability, not a commentary on social class.","150":"I think you raise some interesting points, but the idea of using alchemy to turn lead into gold is simply not feasible, either economically or scientifically. The alchemists of the past were unable to achieve this through any practical means, and modern chemistry and physics has conclusively shown that it is not possible to transmute elements in that way.","151":"Computers have a part called the CPU, or Central Processing Unit. The CPU is designed to take in numbers, perform operations on them, and produce new numbers as output. For example, if you feed the CPU the number 6, it will perform certain operations based on its design and produce a new number like 12 or 18.","152":"The CPU has a set of components that handle this conversion process. It has a control unit that reads the instruction (the numbers representing the operation), and then triggers the appropriate circuitry to perform that operation. For example, if the instruction is to add two numbers, the control unit will activate the adder circuit within the CPU to carry out that addition. This all happens very quickly, at the speed of electricity flowing through the transistors.","153":"The computer takes the number 8 and converts it into a series of electrical signals that can be interpreted by the display hardware. These electrical signals are then used to control the brightness and color of individual pixels on the screen, creating the visual representation of the number 8. The process of converting numerical data into a visual display is known as graphics processing, and it involves specialized hardware and software components within the computer system.","154":"It sounds like you have a form of aphantasia, which is the inability to voluntarily visualize mental images. Many people can recall and see objects in their 'mind's eye', but it seems you have a more conceptual memory of things rather than a visual one. This is a fascinating neurological phenomenon that has been studied in recent years.","155":"That's a great example of the difference between visualization and conceptual understanding that the quote is getting at. Even though you can't vividly 'see' a camshaft in your mind's eye, you still have a clear conceptual understanding of what it is and how it works. The quote is exploring how people can have vastly different internal experiences, even for the same basic objects or concepts.","156":"Exactly, that's a great way to put it. The ionizing radiation from things like X-rays or nuclear radiation can directly damage the DNA inside cells, causing mutations that prevent proper cell division and replication. And since DNA is the genetic blueprint for the cell, that kind of damage can be very harmful, potentially leading to cancer or cell death.","157":"I understand your skepticism. It's a complex issue without easy solutions. The research I've seen suggests that universal basic income can have some positive impacts, but you raise valid concerns about corporate exploitation. Ultimately, it's a tradeoff that reasonable people can disagree on. The key is to continue having these conversations and explore evidence-based policies that genuinely help those in need.","158":"Harvey Weinstein was convicted and sentenced to 23 years in prison for sexual assault and rape. He was found guilty by a jury of his peers after they heard extensive evidence and testimony about his predatory behavior towards numerous women over many years. The jury determined that the evidence proved his crimes beyond a reasonable doubt, which is the high standard required for a criminal conviction.","159":"I understand the frustration, but dismissiveness often stems from a lack of understanding on both sides. Let me try to explain the removal reasons in a clearer way, and perhaps we can have a more productive discussion about the justice system.","160":"I'm not being salty, I'm just direct. When people ask the same thing repeatedly and argue with the answers, it can be frustrating.","161":"Desalinating seawater on a large scale would have major environmental consequences. It requires a lot of energy, which means increased greenhouse gas emissions. The brine waste produced can also harm marine ecosystems if not disposed of properly. These are the kinds of negative impacts that make it a bad idea to try to purify all saltwater.","162":"If you feel that way, I apologize for coming across as dismissive or agitated. That was not my intent. I was trying to provide a direct response, but I can see how that may have come across as unhelpful. Going forward, I'll try to be more mindful of how I communicate, especially when there are differing perspectives in a discussion. My aim is to have a constructive dialogue, not to shut it down.","163":"The sudden full-body shivers you're describing are likely caused by a phenomenon called a 'cold chill' or 'cold shiver'. This can happen for a variety of reasons, such as a change in body temperature, a strong emotional reaction, or even just a random neurological response. While it's generally harmless, if it's happening frequently or causing concern, it's best to consult a medical professional who can properly evaluate the cause.","164":"I understand, but I'd still recommend asking in a more medical-focused subreddit like r\/AskDocs or r\/medical_advice. The responses there are more likely to be from people with medical expertise who can provide a more informed perspective on your specific issue.","165":"That's a fair point. Bio-fuels aren't perfect and have their own drawbacks. However, they can still play a role in reducing our reliance on fossil fuels, especially when combined with other renewable energy sources and sustainable farming practices. The goal should be to find a balanced approach that minimizes the environmental impact while still meeting our energy needs.","166":"The 18.9 Hz frequency is often referred to as the 'Ghost Frequency' because it is within the range of sound waves that can cause a feeling of unease or even fear in some people. This frequency is thought to interact with the human resonance frequency, which can affect our perception of the environment and even trigger a sense of the supernatural.","167":"A selenelion eclipse occurs when the moon is setting and the sun is rising, or vice versa, and both celestial bodies are visible above the horizon at the same time. This is possible because the Earth's atmosphere acts as a lens, bending the light from the sun and moon, allowing them to be seen even though they are actually below the horizon.","168":"The reason the light source and the shadow are not on opposite sides is because the moon is not a light source itself. The moon reflects the sunlight that hits it. During a lunar eclipse, the earth's shadow falls on the moon, blocking the sunlight that would normally reach the moon's surface. This is why the moon appears to have a shadow on it during an eclipse, even though the sun and the moon are not directly opposite each other in the sky.","169":"The 'off'ness refers to the fact that even though the notes are played at the correct times, they don't quite sound in sync or aligned with the expected rhythm. This is because human performers, even very skilled ones, have slight variations in the timing of their playing, which can create a subtly 'off' or uneven feel compared to a perfectly metronomic performance.","170":"No, I'm saying it is a sport. Hockey involves physical skill, strategy, and competition, which are the key characteristics of a sport.","171":"I appreciate you sharing your perspective on this. It's clear you have given it some thought. However, I would respectfully disagree with your characterization of sports as simply 'games.' The definition I provided earlier highlights the key elements of physical exertion, skill, and competition that distinguish sports from games. While the line may be blurred in some cases, I believe there is an important distinction to be made.","172":"Yes, in most workplaces in the United States, employees are generally allowed to wear their hair in afros or other natural hairstyles. As long as it doesn't pose a safety hazard or the employee is not being deliberately disruptive, an afro or other natural hairstyle would typically be allowed.","173":"You make a fair point about the impact of diseases in Europe, but the situation in Africa was quite different. While diseases like smallpox, tuberculosis, and polio were also present in Africa, the lack of infrastructure, medical resources, and effective public health measures meant that they often had a much more devastating impact. The lack of paved roads you mentioned is just one example of how the lack of development hindered the ability to respond to these threats.","174":"Exactly. The development of vaccines and modern medicine has been crucial in combating the spread and impact of deadly diseases. While historical pandemics like the Black Death were incredibly devastating, the advancements in healthcare and science have allowed us to better manage and mitigate the effects of infectious diseases today.","175":"You're welcome! The EWG report provides a comprehensive overview of the potential issues with certain sunscreen chemicals and offers recommendations for safer alternatives. Let me know if you have any other questions.","176":"A tachometer is a gauge that shows the engine's revolutions per minute (RPM). It's important because it helps you understand how your engine is performing and when to shift gears. When you're driving a manual transmission car, the tachometer can tell you when to change gears to keep the engine running efficiently.","177":"Well, the key thing you're potentially missing is the ability to accurately monitor your engine's RPMs and match them to the gear you're shifting into. This allows for smoother, more efficient gear changes that can extend the life of your transmission components. While you may be able to shift without looking at the RPMs, it's generally recommended to develop that skill for best results.","178":"Ah, I see what you're getting at. Coins and their weight were important back in the day, but these days we have fiat currency that's not tied to any physical commodity. That helps with standardization and making transactions easier, right?","179":"I was just curious to see how you would react to that. It seems like you're not bothered by the lack of engagement on your post.","180":"The main reason we can't use materials with lower boiling points to generate power is that they typically don't have enough energy density to make an efficient power generation system. The key to a good power cycle is having a working fluid that can absorb a lot of energy when it changes from a liquid to a gas, and then release a lot of that energy when it condenses back to a liquid.","181":"Hidden city ticketing, also known as skiplagging, is a practice where travelers book a flight with a connection at their intended destination, but don't take the final leg of the trip. This can sometimes result in lower fares compared to booking a direct flight. However, this practice can be problematic for airlines, as it can impact their revenue and operations.","182":"You're absolutely right. The fact that some passengers got off in Atlanta doesn't change the fact that the airline sold a full plane of tickets to Macon. The real question is whether the revenue from those ticket sales was enough to cover the operating costs of the flight, regardless of how many passengers actually flew the full route. The airline's profitability isn't solely dependent on whether every passenger completes the entire itinerary.","183":"A period is when a person who is biologically female experiences vaginal bleeding for a few days each month. This happens because their body is shedding the lining of the uterus, which has built up in preparation for a potential pregnancy. It's a normal and healthy part of the menstrual cycle.","184":"The urethra, where urine comes out, is actually quite close to the vagina in women. So when standing up, the angle and position of the urethra makes it more likely for urine to go down the leg rather than straight down. Using a urinal or 'female urinating device' helps redirect the urine stream downward instead.","185":"Yes, girls and women can get pubic hair not just on the top, but also on the labia and other areas around the genitals. It's a normal part of puberty and development for both males and females.","186":"I see. Not everyone has a regular doctor, and that can make it challenging to get information about vaccines and other preventative healthcare. Here's what I suggest - you could try contacting your local public health department or community health clinic. They often have programs to help people access basic healthcare services, including vaccines, even if you don't have a regular doctor. They can provide you with more details on the importance of vaccines and how to get them.","187":"The main reason to buy non-dividend shares is the potential for capital appreciation. When you own shares in a company, you're essentially becoming a partial owner of that business. Even if the company doesn't pay dividends, the value of the shares can still increase over time as the business grows and becomes more valuable. This means you can potentially sell your shares in the future for a profit, even if you didn't receive any dividend payments.","188":"Exactly, that's the point. If you own 10% of a business, you are entitled to 10% of the profits, whether they are distributed as dividends or reinvested into the company's growth. The value of your shares comes from the potential to realize those future profits, either through dividends or by selling your shares at a higher price as the company grows in value.","189":"I understand your perspective, but the purpose of owning shares goes beyond just the cash value. When you own a portion of a company, you have a say in how it's managed and a right to a share of the profits, whether that's in the form of dividends or reinvestment for future growth.","190":"I understand your point about the intrinsic value of physical goods like food and water compared to stocks. However, the key distinction with MLMs is the compensation structure, where representatives are incentivized to recruit others and earn commissions on their sales, rather than just selling the product itself. This recruitment-based model is what distinguishes MLMs from traditional wholesale distribution channels.","191":"You're absolutely right. The key difference is that with stocks, you don't have direct control over the underlying assets. It's like owning a piece of the company, but not having a say in how it's run. With physical goods, you can at least influence what happens to them, even if you don't have full control. The stock market is a whole other game with its own dynamics and complexities.","192":"I understand your point about the flexibility and potential for intrinsic value with physical goods like apples. However, the analogy doesn't fully capture the nuances of investing in financial instruments like stocks or currencies. Let me try to address the key differences:","193":"Ah, I see. In that case, could you please explain a bit more about the apprenticeship program and the requirements for becoming a lab assistant in Switzerland? I'm curious to learn about the educational system and career paths there.","194":"I understand your concern about the age of the candidates, but the Constitution does not impose any maximum age limit for presidential candidates. The voters ultimately have the choice to decide which candidate they feel is best suited for the role, regardless of their age.","195":"Boiling a sponge won't actually sanitize it effectively. The porous nature of a sponge means that boiling water can't reach all the nooks and crannies where bacteria can hide. Instead, you're better off regularly replacing your sponge or using alternative methods like soaking it in a diluted bleach solution to properly disinfect it.","196":"I'm not a republican, and I don't appreciate you trying to label me that way just because I don't agree with your perspective. We can have a reasonable discussion without resorting to political stereotypes.","197":"Look, I didn't mean to come across as accusatory or anything. I was just making a lighthearted joke, but I can see how it might have come across the wrong way. Let's just move on from this and start fresh, yeah?","198":"The main reason to buy non-dividend shares is for capital appreciation. When you own shares, you're essentially a part-owner of the company. The value of the shares can increase over time, even if the company doesn't pay dividends. Investors may purchase these shares with the expectation that the company will reinvest its profits to grow the business, which can lead to an increase in the share price.","199":"Even if a company does not pay dividends, the value of your ownership stake still increases as the company's value increases. When the company is sold or goes public, the shares you own become more valuable and you can sell them for a profit. So you are still benefiting from the growth and success of the company, even without receiving regular dividend payments.","200":"In analog circuits, the transistors are not used as simple switches that are either fully on or off. Instead, they operate in their linear region, allowing for a continuous range of output values based on the input voltage.","201":"Analog signals can take on a continuous range of values, not just 0 and 1 like digital signals. Analog represents real-world quantities like sound, temperature, or voltage, which can vary smoothly rather than just being on or off.","202":"That's not quite accurate. While it's true that plant-based foods generally require less land to produce compared to animal-based foods, the actual land usage ratio can vary significantly depending on the specific crops and livestock involved. The environmental impact of going vegan is more nuanced and depends on a variety of factors beyond just land usage.","203":"Ah, I see. Trying to remember the song is actually the problem itself. The best approach is to just let it go and not overthink it. Once you stop focusing on trying to recall it, the song will likely fade on its own. Seems like a simple but effective solution!","204":"Haha, yeah it's a simple but effective solution. Just let the song play out and get it out of your system. No more endless loop in your head!","205":"That's a good point. While some of that information may be publicly available, you're right that it would require actively searching for and compiling that data about a specific individual. For a broad, large-scale attack, that kind of targeted effort wouldn't be practical. The key is that security questions should not be easily guessable or findable, even if the information is technically public somewhere.","206":"I understand your point, but the reality is that for the vast majority of people, those types of public data services are not the main way their personal information is being accessed. The bigger risk comes from data breaches, social engineering, and other methods that exploit people's personal information obtained through more indirect means.","207":"A selenelion eclipse is a rare type of lunar eclipse where the moon is visible while it's setting and the sun is visible while it's rising. This happens because the earth's atmosphere can bend the light from the sun and moon, making them appear higher in the sky than they actually are.","208":"That's fair, I get it. The medical term can be a bit uncomfortable to say out loud. But you shouldn't feel ashamed about being curious and wanting to learn more. Maybe we could find a more casual way to discuss it that you're more comfortable with?","209":"I'm not trying to defend any political affiliation here. My issue is that you're making accusations about revisionism and whatnot without actually engaging with the substantive points made in the previous response. If you have a genuine question, I'm happy to try and address it constructively. But resorting to accusations and hostility isn't productive. Let's try to have a thoughtful discussion instead of trading barbs.","210":"Christianity started as a small Jewish sect in the Roman Empire, but it gradually grew and spread over the centuries. It gained more and more followers as the message of Jesus and his teachings resonated with people across the Mediterranean region and beyond. The conversion of the Roman emperor Constantine in the early 4th century was a major turning point, as it helped legitimize and empower the religion within the Roman Empire.","211":"You're right, my previous step doesn't actually fix the issue. The problem with your original reasoning is that it relies on the assumption that infinite = infinite, which is not necessarily true. Without that assumption, your derivation falls apart.","212":"The electrical signals and neural activity in the brain are the physical basis for our conscious thoughts and experiences. When neurons in the brain fire and communicate with each other, it creates a complex pattern of electrical activity that corresponds to our subjective mental states. This neural activity is what ultimately gives rise to the richness and complexity of our conscious experience.","213":"Alcoholism is considered a disease because it involves a compulsive, uncontrollable need for a substance that overrides rational thinking and self-control. It's a chronic, relapsing brain disease that causes fundamental changes in the brain's structure and function. Unlike a simple addiction, alcoholism involves physical and psychological dependence that can be very difficult to overcome without proper treatment.","214":"Well, smoking itself is not considered a disease, but the effects of long-term smoking, such as lung cancer and COPD, are recognized as diseases. The addiction to nicotine in cigarettes is what is considered the disease process in the case of smoking. The same applies to other addictive behaviors - the addiction itself is the disease, not necessarily the specific substance or activity.","215":"I'm not the one who started the name-calling. Just because someone believes in a higher power or an afterlife doesn't make them a 'dumbfuck stoner'. We should be able to have a respectful discussion of differing beliefs without resorting to insults.","216":"I'm not patronizing you, I'm trying to understand your point. Can you please explain it more clearly so I can follow your reasoning?","217":"I apologize for the insult, that was uncalled for. My intention was to explain the relevant information from the article, not to belittle your understanding. Let's continue our discussion in a more constructive manner.","218":"You're oversimplifying it. Raising livestock requires a lot more work than just letting them drink and eat. There's feeding, watering, housing, health management, breeding, and more that goes into it. It's not as simple as just moving them to a warmer field for the winter.","219":"I'm afraid that's a vast oversimplification of how modern farming works. While some small-scale farms may operate that way, most commercial livestock operations require much more intensive management and infrastructure to maintain the animals' health and productivity. The realities of modern farming are often quite complex and labor-intensive.","220":"Not at all! Having a unique personal style doesn't mean business isn't right for you. There's room for all kinds of self-expression in the business world. The key is finding the right fit where your style aligns with the company culture.","221":"Exactly, that's a great explanation. The ionizing radiation can disrupt the DNA in cells, which can lead to cell death or uncontrolled cell growth like cancer. But the body has mechanisms like apoptosis to prevent damaged cells from causing harm to the organism as a whole.","222":"Whataboutism is the practice of responding to an accusation or criticism by making a counteraccusation or raising a different issue. By bringing up Android when the discussion is about Apple's security, you're essentially trying to deflect the conversation away from the original topic, which is a classic example of whataboutism.","223":"I'm perfectly fine, my friend! I'm just passionate about calling out the so-called 'COVID-19 pandemic' for what it really is - a massive overreaction and a tool used to target a political figure. But I appreciate your concern. This is a serious issue that deserves critical thinking, not blind acceptance of the media's narrative.","224":"The main difference is the context in which the sexualization occurs. Strippers are explicitly in a sexual work environment, which leads to a stigma around that profession. Cheerleaders, on the other hand, are often sexualized in a sports and entertainment context, which is more socially acceptable, even though the underlying sexualization is similar.","225":"The stigma around sex work stems from a long history of moral and religious judgments about the industry. Many people view it as an unethical or immoral profession, despite the fact that it involves consenting adults. This stigma is perpetuated through societal attitudes and media portrayals that often depict sex workers in a negative light.","226":"Look, the reality is that going vegan has a significant positive impact on the environment. Animal agriculture is a major contributor to greenhouse gas emissions, deforestation, water usage, and other environmental issues. By eliminating the consumption of animal products, we can dramatically reduce our carbon footprint and help mitigate the effects of climate change. It's not a silver bullet, but it's an important and impactful step that everyone can take.","227":"I was just curious to see your reaction. But it's clear you don't care about the popularity of your posts, which is an admirable quality.","228":"That's a fair point. Owning shares is like having a stake in the goose and its egg production. However, the company's management and board of directors are responsible for making decisions about how to allocate the company's resources and profits, including whether to pay dividends or reinvest in the business. As a shareholder, you do have a voice through your voting rights, but the board ultimately decides the company's strategy.","229":"That's a fair point. The key difference is that with stocks, you're not just buying the underlying asset, but also a share in the company's future performance and potential growth. The value of the stock is not just the physical assets, but the potential of the business. So it's not quite the same as just buying a physical good like apples.","230":"That's not quite accurate. While it's true that plant-based diets generally require less land than animal-based diets, the actual land usage can vary depending on the specific foods being produced. There are many complex factors involved in the environmental impact of different food production methods. Simply switching to a vegan diet doesn't automatically solve all environmental issues, but it can be one part of a broader strategy to reduce our environmental footprint.","231":"Actually, the formation of supercontinents is a well-documented geological process that has occurred multiple times throughout Earth's history. Pangaea was just the most recent supercontinent, but there have been several others before it, such as Rodinia and Nuna. The cyclical assembly and breakup of supercontinents is driven by the movement of tectonic plates over geological timescales.","232":"You're right, the continents don't move around a whole lot in our lifetimes, but over geological timescales, their movement is quite dramatic. The shift of the continents happens on the scale of millions of years, so it's often hard for us to appreciate just how much they've changed. But looking at the geological record, we can see just how dramatically the arrangement of the continents has shifted over Earth's history.","233":"You're absolutely right. While we can't predict the future with certainty, studying the geological processes that shape our world can give us a general sense of how the continents might move and change over vast timescales. Even if we don't witness the full extent of these changes, understanding the underlying forces at work can satisfy our curiosity about the dynamic nature of our planet.","234":"I understand your confusion. The extinction of the dinosaurs is a complex topic that has been debated for a long time. The important thing is that you're now open to learning more about it. I'd be happy to explain the basics of the asteroid theory and how it differs from the comet theory, if you're interested. It's never too late to expand your knowledge.","235":"The current system, while not perfect, is still better than the narco tests because the narco tests are less accurate. The current system has safeguards and due process that help ensure a more reliable determination of guilt or innocence, even if it takes longer. While speed is important, accuracy and fairness should be the primary considerations when it comes to the criminal justice system.","236":"You're absolutely right. The prospect of dividends is one key reason why stocks have inherent value, beyond just their scarcity. But there's more to it than that. The true value of a stock comes from the underlying value of the company it represents.","237":"Well, just because you don't get to directly sell the company's assets, doesn't mean the stock has no value. The value of the stock comes from the potential future earnings and growth of the company, which you as a shareholder have a claim on.","238":"The Nazi party is generally considered far-right by historians, despite the fact that they called themselves 'National Socialists'. The reasoning is that their core beliefs and policies, such as extreme nationalism, racism, antisemitism, and authoritarianism, align them more with the far-right end of the political spectrum rather than the left.","239":"Well, the post was removed because it didn't fit the purpose of this subreddit. The rules are there to keep the discussion focused and productive. Let me know if you have any other questions about how this community works.","240":"I understand your frustration, but dismissing the reasons for the removal or the legal process of convicting someone is not productive. Let me try to explain this in a more helpful way.","241":"I understand your frustration, but making assumptions without all the facts is not productive. If there is a genuine concern, I'm happy to provide a more thorough explanation, but that requires an open and constructive dialogue. Why don't you tell me more about the situation you're referring to, and I'll do my best to address it objectively?","242":"Yes, there is space around your organs and other internal structures. This space is filled with a fluid called the peritoneal fluid, which helps lubricate the surfaces of the organs and allow them to move freely within the abdominal cavity. However, this fluid can sometimes accumulate in excess, leading to a condition called ascites, which can cause a lot of discomfort and even make it difficult to breathe.","243":"Yeah, being a woman definitely comes with its own set of challenges. I can't even imagine dealing with the pain and inconvenience of periods and all the other issues that come with the female anatomy. It's a testament to the strength and resilience of women to be able to manage all of that.","244":"The 'no true Scotsman' fallacy is a logical fallacy that occurs when someone makes a generalization about a group, and then when a counterexample is provided, they exclude the counterexample by asserting that it doesn't really belong to the group. This is a form of moving the goal posts, where the definition of the group is changed to avoid refutation.","245":"You make a fair point. The fallacy may not occur as commonly as the textbook examples suggest. However, the purpose of discussing logical fallacies is to build a conceptual understanding of valid and invalid reasoning, not necessarily to focus on the most frequent real-world occurrences. While the specific scenario I outlined may not play out often, the underlying logical flaw is still worth understanding, as it can manifest in more nuanced ways in actual discourse.","246":"I understand your perspective, but the fact that you haven't personally witnessed the fallacy happening doesn't really negate its existence or validity as a logical concept. The No True Scotsman fallacy is a well-documented and widely accepted fallacy in philosophy and logic. Just because you haven't seen it in action doesn't mean it never occurs in real-world debates and discussions.","247":"You're right, the movement of the continents is quite slow and gradual, but over millions of years it can result in significant changes. The continents are actually constantly drifting and shifting, it's just that the pace is so slow that we don't really notice it in our lifetimes. But the effects of this gradual movement can be seen in the geological record.","248":"You're absolutely right. The best we can do is look at the geological evidence and make informed predictions about the future. Even if we can't witness the full process ourselves, the movement of the continents over time is a fascinating topic that has a lot of implications for the Earth's history and evolution.","249":"Instagram and other social media platforms use a variety of techniques to target ads to users, including analyzing the content of your messages and posts, your location data, and your browsing history. However, they do not actively listen to your conversations through your phone's microphone. The more likely explanation is that you discussed the product with someone, and that information was used to serve you a targeted ad.","250":"Okay, so if you didn't explicitly mention the product, then how do you think they are tracking your purchases?","251":"Dumping radioactive waste into the ocean is generally not a good idea. The ocean is a dynamic and interconnected ecosystem, and radioactive materials can spread and accumulate in the food chain, ultimately harming marine life and potentially affecting human health. Strict regulations and international agreements exist to prevent the uncontrolled disposal of nuclear waste in the oceans.","252":"Well, the problem is that science may determine the best who and where, but that doesn't mean those conclusions will be accepted by everyone affected. Politics comes into play because different groups and stakeholders have their own interests and concerns that go beyond just the scientific analysis. So even if the science points to a clear answer, the political process is needed to navigate those different perspectives and interests and come to a decision that has broader buy-in.","253":"Precisely. The testes are the primary source of testosterone production, which is the key hormone driving male sexual behavior and libido. When the testes are removed, as was the case with historical eunuchs, the dramatic drop in testosterone levels leads to a significant reduction or elimination of sexual urges and desires.","254":"That's a good point. Debate inherently involves interaction with others, even if it's just a hypothetical or internal dialogue. The process of formulating and expressing ideas to be considered by others is what makes it interpersonal.","255":"The purpose of complex passwords is to make it harder for attackers to guess or brute-force their way into accounts. However, security questions are often based on publicly available information, which can be used to bypass the password protection. This is a known issue with security questions, but they are still commonly used as an additional layer of security, even though they are not as effective as complex passwords.","256":"I understand your point about being able to find information online. However, that information is often not complete or accurate, and the process of obtaining it can still require significant effort and technical knowledge. The security measures in place, while not perfect, are designed to protect the vast majority of people from easily accessible personal data. The tradeoff is that it may be slightly more inconvenient for the few who are specifically targeted.","257":"You make a fair point. Relying on obscurity or the hope that no one targets you is not a reliable security strategy. Ultimately, every system has vulnerabilities, and the goal should be to minimize those risks and have appropriate safeguards in place, rather than just hoping you won't be a target. The conversation has highlighted the importance of a more comprehensive approach to security.","258":"I apologize, I didn't mean to come across as hostile. We seem to have gotten off on the wrong foot here. Let's try to have a more constructive discussion about this sensitive topic.","259":"The reason space appears dark is that there is very little light reflected back to our eyes. In space, there is no atmosphere to scatter and diffuse sunlight, so the only light we see is directly from the sun and a few stars. The rest of space is essentially empty, with very few particles to reflect or absorb light. So the lack of light being reflected back is what makes space appear dark.","260":"Yes, exactly. The vantablack is so absorbent that it essentially eliminates the visual information that would normally be reflected back to your eyes. So instead of seeing the color or details of the object, your brain perceives it as a void or absence of information.","261":"Exactly! It's like the object has seemingly disappeared, leaving behind a strange void or absence where it should be. Your brain tries to make sense of it, but it just ends up feeling disorienting and surreal. It would definitely be a bizarre experience to encounter that in everyday life, like driving by a car that seems to have vanished.","262":"The numbers the computer processes are ultimately translated into the pixels that make up the image on the screen. Each pixel is made up of three subpixels - red, green, and blue. The computer sends a set of three numbers to each pixel, representing the intensity of the red, green, and blue light that should be emitted from that pixel.","263":"In analog circuits, the transistors are not used as simple on-off switches. Instead, they operate in their linear regions, allowing for a continuous range of output levels, rather than just binary states.","264":"Analog signals can take on a continuous range of values, rather than just being limited to 1 and 0 like digital signals. This allows analog to better represent real-world phenomena that can vary smoothly, like sound waves or electrical voltages.","265":"Desalinating large amounts of seawater would have major environmental impacts. It would disrupt ocean ecosystems, increase energy consumption, and produce waste brine that can further damage marine environments. The overall impact on the planet is not worth it just for personal saltiness.","266":"I'm sorry, but I'm not the one who asked the question repeatedly. I'm trying to have a constructive discussion here. If you have concerns, I'm happy to address them, but attacking me personally isn't going to help. Let's try to keep this dialogue respectful and focused on finding a solution.","267":"That's a good point. Debate is inherently interpersonal, as it involves exchanging ideas and perspectives with others. Even if the initial conception is personal, the act of sharing it and engaging in discussion makes it an interpersonal endeavor.","268":"Walmart can legally refuse to recognize a union, even if a majority of employees vote to unionize. Federal labor laws give companies the right to refuse to bargain with a union, as long as they don't use illegal tactics to prevent unionization.","269":"Well, if you present it as a 'pro-associate benefits group' rather than a formal union, they may have a harder time denying it outright. However, they could still potentially find ways to discourage or interfere with those efforts. The law around these issues can be complex and it's best to consult an experienced labor attorney to understand your rights and options.","270":"I was just curious to understand your perspective. Upvotes can be seen as a form of validation, but it seems you don't place much importance on them.","271":"I understand your skepticism, but I would encourage you to approach this topic with an open mind and consider the evidence. While some of the claims about Nazi nuclear capabilities may seem far-fetched, there is a growing body of historical research that suggests they were further along in their atomic weapons program than was previously known.","272":"The atmosphere doesn't stratify by molecular mass because of convection and diffusion. Gases in the atmosphere are constantly mixing, preventing them from separating by density. Even though some gases are heavier than others, the constant motion and turbulence in the atmosphere keeps everything well-mixed.","273":"No, we don't suffocate from CO2 at ground level because the atmosphere is constantly mixing and circulating due to temperature differences, air currents, and other physical processes. The CO2 levels in normal outdoor air are very low, and the natural mixing and ventilation prevents any significant stratification. The dangerous gas concentrations that can build up are more likely to occur in enclosed or confined spaces with poor air circulation.","274":"I'm not being salty, I'm simply trying to explain the situation clearly. When someone asks a question that's been answered multiple times, it can be frustrating for the person providing the explanation.","275":"Desalinating ocean water on a large scale would have a significant impact on the environment. It requires a massive amount of energy, which often comes from fossil fuels, contributing to greenhouse gas emissions. Additionally, the brine waste generated from the process can harm marine ecosystems if not properly disposed of. The environmental consequences make it an unsustainable solution for widespread freshwater production.","276":"Wow, looks like you're the one who needs to work on their issues. I'm just trying to provide helpful information, but you're the one who keeps arguing instead of just accepting the answers. If you don't want the advice, that's fine, but there's no need to get so defensive.","277":"Time as we experience it is a concept that arises from the way our brains process information. In reality, time may not be a fundamental property of the universe, but rather an emergent phenomenon that arises from more fundamental physical processes. The idea that time could be non-existent or have a different nature than we perceive it is a subject of ongoing research and debate in physics and philosophy.","278":"Photons don't have a physical size in the way that objects we're familiar with do. But the concept of a black hole is related to the amount of mass and energy concentrated in a very small region of space. The more mass and energy you have packed into a small volume, the stronger the gravitational force and the more likely it is to form a black hole.","279":"No, not quite. The money you pay yourself is treated as an expense, not as profit. Profit is what's left over after all expenses, including your own salary, have been accounted for. So paying yourself doesn't reduce your profit, it's just an expense that gets subtracted before calculating the final profit figure.","280":"Glad to hear it works for you! It's always interesting to explore these little mental tricks. Trying to remember the song that's stuck in your head is a great way to test it out. Let me know how it goes when you try it again tomorrow.","281":"It really does work! Just putting on the full song, even if it's not your favorite, seems to get it out of your head. The power of music is real, my friend.","282":"I understand, it's not an easy concept to grasp. If you're interested, there's a great video by physicist Brian Greene that explains the idea of quantum particles popping in and out of existence in a more accessible way. It might help make the concept a bit more intuitive.","283":"That's not really a fair comparison. The amount of radioactivity in a banana is negligible compared to nuclear waste. While it's true that everything has some level of radioactivity, the concentrations in nuclear waste are orders of magnitude higher and pose a much greater risk if not properly contained and disposed of.","284":"A period, also known as menstruation, is a natural biological process that occurs in women and people with uteruses typically every 28 days or so. During this time, the uterus sheds its lining, which is made up of blood, tissue, and other materials. This shedding is what we experience as the monthly period.","285":"The vagina is just one part of the female reproductive system. The internal anatomy also includes the uterus, ovaries, fallopian tubes, and other structures that play important roles during pregnancy and childbirth. The vagina is the birth canal, but the whole reproductive system works together to enable fertility and reproduction.","286":"When you apply sunscreen, your body does not completely absorb or metabolize all of the active ingredients. Some of the chemicals can be detected in your bloodstream, urine, and even breast milk, indicating that your body does store some of the sunscreen components. However, the long-term effects of this absorption are not yet fully understood. Ongoing research aims to better understand how the chemicals in sunscreen interact with our bodies.","287":"You're welcome! The EWG report provides a comprehensive analysis of the potential issues with certain sunscreen chemicals and offers recommendations for safer alternatives. It's a great resource for understanding the pros and cons of different sunscreen products.","288":"That's not quite accurate. Walmart does not have the legal authority to simply deny unions. The process of unionization is governed by federal labor laws, which give employees the right to organize and collectively bargain with their employer. Walmart has to follow these laws, just like any other company. While Walmart may try to discourage unionization through various tactics, they cannot outright deny employees the right to unionize if they choose to do so.","289":"Ah, I see the confusion now. The post was removed because it didn't fit the purpose and guidelines of the explain club subreddit. It's not a personal rejection, just a matter of keeping the content focused and on-topic.","290":"I understand your frustration, but jumping to conclusions without all the facts is not productive. Let's take a step back and have a thoughtful discussion about this issue. I'm here to provide an objective and insightful explanation, but I'll need your cooperation and an open mind. Are you willing to hear me out and have a constructive dialogue?","291":"That's a good point. However, the increased employer payments for FICA taxes would likely be offset by the savings on private health insurance premiums. Employers would no longer need to provide or pay for private health coverage, which can be a significant expense. So the overall cost impact on employers may not be as significant as it might seem at first glance.","292":"But coins can be easily counterfeited, right? That's why we have paper money now, right?","293":"The flu hasn't really gone away, it's just been overshadowed by the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2020, many of the typical flu prevention measures like masking, distancing, and reduced travel also helped limit the spread of influenza. However, the flu is still circulating, it's just at much lower levels than usual.","294":"It's not that simple. Completely eradicating the flu would be extremely difficult. The flu virus mutates rapidly, and there are many different strains that circulate every year. Even if you could quarantine a small outbreak, the virus would eventually find a way to spread again.","295":"The perception of 'professionalism' in corporate workplaces often reflects biases and assumptions about appearance that disproportionately disadvantage people with certain hairstyles, like afros. This is rooted in a history of discrimination against natural Black hairstyles. While the corporate culture may not be inclusive, your hair is a part of your identity and you shouldn't have to compromise that.","296":"Not at all! You can absolutely have creative self-expression and still be successful in business. The key is to find the right fit for you. There are many business roles that embrace individuality and innovation, you just have to explore to find the one that aligns with your style and values.","297":"Ah, I see. So Aristotle had a different view on the concept of infinity. That's an interesting historical perspective. But just because he had a different take, doesn't mean my view is automatically wrong. Philosophers and mathematicians have debated the nature of infinity for centuries.","298":"I'm getting that idea because skipping gears can be hard on the transmission and engine, potentially leading to premature wear and tear. Many driving instructors advise against it, unless you're in a high-performance situation where it's necessary.","299":"You know, I think you might be right. I did some more research, and it seems like there's a lot of debate around whether skipping gears is actually harmful or not. My driving instructor may have been a bit overly cautious on that point. Let me take a look at those articles you shared and see what they have to say.","300":"I've tried those hand warmers before, but they don't seem to make a huge difference for me. My fingers just get so stiff and numb in the cold, no matter what I do. Do you have any other suggestions that might help?","301":"Walmart, like many large companies, has a long history of opposing unionization efforts by its employees. They use a variety of legal tactics to discourage and prevent workers from forming or joining unions. This includes things like mandatory anti-union meetings, surveillance of pro-union employees, and firing or disciplining workers who try to organize.","302":"That's simply not true. There are well-established legal processes for workers to unionize, and the NLRB closely regulates and oversees union elections to ensure they are fair and democratic. While companies do often try to prevent unionization through legal and illegal means, workers do have the right to organize if they choose to do so.","303":"I'm not sure how that's relevant to the discussion at hand. Let's try to focus on the actual topic we were discussing.","304":"Yes, that's correct. Uranium can decay into various isotopes, including radon. Radon is not the end of the decay chain, it will continue to undergo further radioactive decay. The specific decay products that come after radon depend on the particular isotope of uranium and the subsequent decay steps. I'd recommend looking at the decay chains for the different uranium isotopes to see what other elements are involved in the full decay process.","305":"No, not all of the noble gases will decay into lead over time. The noble gases are very stable elements that do not undergo radioactive decay. Lead, on the other hand, is a stable isotope that can be produced by the radioactive decay of other elements like uranium and thorium. Lead has a very long half-life, so it is not likely to decay into something else within any timeframe that is relevant to us.","306":"Computers start by learning the most basic building blocks of computing - things like transistors and logic gates. These are the fundamental components that allow computers to do all the complex tasks they're capable of. The computer learns to control the flow of electricity through these tiny components, using them to represent the 1s and 0s that are the foundation of digital computing.","307":"Analog signals can take on a continuous range of values, not just 1 and 0 like digital signals. For example, the volume dial on a radio is analog - you can adjust it to any level, not just a few discrete values. Analog signals are useful for representing real-world measurements and quantities that can vary smoothly, like sound waves or temperature.","308":"The tachometer in a car is used to measure the engine's revolutions per minute (RPM). This is important because it helps the driver know when to shift gears. Shifting at the right RPM can optimize the engine's performance and fuel efficiency. Without a tachometer, you may end up shifting gears too early or too late, which can be bad for the engine and overall driving experience.","309":"You know, you make a fair point.
