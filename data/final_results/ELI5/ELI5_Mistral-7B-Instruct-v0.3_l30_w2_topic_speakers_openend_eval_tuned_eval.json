I stopped caring when your post was removed, just been stringing you along seeing how worked up you can get about it.   Of course skipping gears is ok, it's just wrong in certain situations but not to a degree that can't be overcome by adding several hundred kilograms of metal to your vehicle.","3":"I am of the mindset that those with grammatical errors in their sentence structure and an inability to articulate themselves clearly in their written responses to others are fun to fuck with because they be dumb. Thanks for continuing to allow me to play with dumb.","4":"&gt; Why is that? I mean the water is there      That's the other thing. It isn't. For most people on the planet, the water is not there. It's somewhere else.        &gt;so why not clean it and use it?      This is, in a way, what sewage and wastewater treatment plants do.

You relearn whenever you get a new car and has to get used to how it feels - especially if it uses a different engine type, for example switching to diesel (or back) requires you to completely relearn how a car should feel.   Once you've learned how your car (or other motorized transport) feels at all speeds, you don't need any of the instrument panel except maybe a way to estimate how much fuel you have left.","9":"&gt;I'm not sure what I'm supposed to be missing by not looking at the RPM when changing gears?  Well, for starters you're leaving a bunch of acceleration on the table by   &gt; skipping gears  And not using the peak of your power curve as much as you could be.   If you're consistently skipping the same gear that'll sacrifice a bit of longevity, though whether you'll keep the car long enough to need it is another question.

We want the fluid to have certain properties when it comes out of the boiler (we don't actually want steam) and when we have a high boiling point, we can put in more energy.  Also, water can store a lot of energy before it actually changes temperature, way more than acetone.    The turbine speed is related to how much fluid you pump through it, not the temperature although the fluid type can effect that.  The thing that varies with the temperature is the torque, how hard the turbine can try to turn stuff.","16":"You know, I almost included this in the last post but I decided not to include it to keep it simple.  The turbine is designed to bring the gas to supersonic speeds.  If we look at the conservation of energy, the gas needs to cool down to actually do this.  So a gas that's hotter can go faster in the turbine and faster velocities allow for more power to be generated.","17":"Look up \u201cisotopes of helium\u201d, \u201cisotopes of neon\u201d etc. on Wikipedia and there will be a section labelled \u201clist of isotopes\u201d which shows you a lot of information including what isotopes they decay into if they\u2019re radioactive.   No, noble gasses are not turning into a 19th column. what makes you think that?   Yes, hydrogen-1 will _never_ undergo radioactive decay. Stars are different, they are fusing elements together, it\u2019s a completely different process to radioactive decay.","18":"Probably not.

I read journals and understand the science.   It took about 70 years for the rest of the elements in the 7th row to be created, that was elements 95-118). The last few discovered decay within fractions of seconds. The faster something decays the harder it is to create and then detect.   We will likely see element 120 within 5 years, but getting to element 169 (which would be the first element on the 9th row) is going to to take a lot longer and will need improvements in technology if it can even be created at all.

If everyone with the flu quarantined until it was dead then it likely wouldn\u2019t be gone forever because it also jumps between animals.","23":"Social distancing and mask wearing is even more effective at reducing the spread of influenza than COVID-19, and we're generally more vigilant about cleaning and hand washing these days, which also provides protection against the spread of influenza.  So we've received a substantial bonus from (generally) following COVID-related restrictions.","24":"COVID is significantly more contagious than influenza, and COVID (unlike the flu) is prone to superspreader events.  So you'll see far more COVID spread than influenza spread under the same conditions.","25":"I said go talk to a virologist to get answers to your questions about getting rid of the flu.  You said something about talking to someone who you think is a virologist who said something no virologist would ever say.  So whoever you spoke to is somewhere between not a virologist at all and the world's worst virologist.  That said - you want to learn whether we're in a position to eradicate the flu - go talk to a (competent) virologist and stop dicking around on reddit.  And 47 reported cases may mean hundreds or thousands or tens of thousands of unreported (but still potentially contagious) cases.  47 may not mean what you think it means.  Most people who get the flu just deal with it, and many have mild symptoms not worth reporting.","26":"I DON'T KNOW.  Talk to a competent virologist.

You have no way of knowing that those stars you mentioned exist, you simply trust many different things, from the scientists who say they found the data to the possibility that the universe is built on a firm set of rules that can be extrapolated from.  &amp;#x200B;  The point is, you may be able to \\*infer\\* that something exists, but all you really know is what you perceive, everything else is guesswork. Hence the question of \"if a tree falls in the woods and no one is around to hear it, does it make a sound\" is only a \"flawed principle\" if you treat the theories science has discovered as some hard and fast absolute, which they are not. What if the universe actually worked such that collisions only cause vibrations if someone is around to observe them? How would any scientific principle ever discover that, given that science is based on observation?","28":"To be clear, I am not advocating for a distrust of science. This is philosophy, which is focused on very different things.  &amp;#x200B;  A key point is to imagine that we \\*do\\* live in that universe, where unless something is observed by a human it doesn't happen. How would that affect us?     Not one bit.  &amp;#x200B;  If the universe only operates differently if it has no way of being observed, then by definition it can't affect us. Science is still as useful as it always was. The point of philosophy is to consider the \"what ifs\", and see whether that has any bearing on how we \\*should\\* behave.","29":"And why do you think that has an effect on me?  Waste your money the way you want to; no skin off my back.  Hell, for all you know, I support Sanders, too.","30":"There are a few effects; ionization will break apart biologically important molecules, which can then become \"radicals\" which can break apart more molecules or damage proteins. Too much damage to cellular structures can cause the cell to destroy itself, as can too much damage to DNA. This is why bad sunburn causes skin to peel off, the epidermal and dermal layers received enough damage to decide they need to kill themselves for the greater good. However, if DNA is damaged in certain ways, it can lead to cancer. It's not that DNA can't be repaired at all, it's that it is the \"master program\" for the cell and can be modified in ways that make the cell do things that it isn't supposed to.   You can also receive too much damage to important cells like in organs. It's actually therapeutic in some situations, such as using radioactive iodine to destroy some of a large thyroid, but many organs are not good at regenerating so the damage can hamper their functionality.","31":"It's not just skin, it's called apoptosis and most cells in the body can do it. It also goes beyond cancer, you don't want malfunctioning cells dumping chemicals into the rest of the body. It's an interesting process, multicellular organisms like humans aren't necessarily doing the best for individual cells, but for the whole.","32":"Sports are games?

It makes sense, but only after you've already studied lots of it.","35":"Now that is a good question... I know I had some sex education in school but it wasn't very good. It's a common problem in schools because people are scared to talk about it. Some of the fear is that it will encourage kids to start having sex early but I think it's important for everyone to know how the body works. Everyone has one, so why hide it?  Kids need to know what is normal and what is not normal, so if there is a problem, they can talk to a doctor. Puberty is scary with everything changing and a lot of people feel shame about it when they shouldn't. I'm glad you're asking questions ahead of time so you're a little more prepared.","36":"It's just how the human body is. \u00af\\_(\u30c4)_\/\u00af Can't do much about it.

Its not a particularly rational approach to take for atomic theory, but there are good tangible ways to test it.  Heisenberg was found in a cave with holding a lump of cadmium next to an open nuclear reactor. People told him to check the math because he math was wrong. Oppenheimer showed that very very conclusively.","42":"Once again though, their plan failed because their math was wrong. They didn't have a bomb, they did have enriched uranium, they were just wrong about the quantities they needed specifically because Heisenberg did not check his math.  They had a reactor, again thats where the allies found him (holding a lump of cadmium).","43":"No they thought they needed more than they did, the firing mechanism is where they messed up.   And ya I do, they messed up the math, partially because the guy in charge of the math hated it when people told him to check it.. You can find his notes and look at it.  If they did then they had the pieces and they just calmly decided not to use the bomb and lose the war because I guess they felt bad about the whole war thing.

They can fire people who express pro-union sentiments and claim it was for another reason. They can threaten to do all kinds of thing. ","45":"LOL...

In general they take deposits from individuals and make loans, as well as offering services like credit cards.   Investment banking works more with the markets directly relating to financial securities (stocks, bonds, derivatives, etc) and financial advisory services. But investment banks do not take deposits.   Want to have your company go public and be listed on a stock exchange? The can determine a listing price and distribution. Need to issue $10B in bonds, they can partner with other firms to create the terms and get them sold. Want to merge with another company? They help with due diligence and the terms and the funding (loans, stock conversions, etc.).  Traditionally (at least since the 1933 Glass\u2013Steagall legislation) these were separate institutions. Many banks collapsed (for instance) when they used deposits to speculate on the markets. These functions are still separate but can be housed in one corporation. And most investment banks chose or were pressured to become commercial banks (at least from a regulatory perspective) after the crisis of 2008.","48":"You will have to wait a lot of time to see that, as currently the land mass is about (in 250 million years) to form a new supercontinent if the continental drift doesn't drasticaly change it's course in the next million years.  There are several hypothesis and models about how this will look like, these are: Novopangea, Pangea Proxima\/Ultima, Aurica and Amasia.  The thing is that in most of them, the mayority of the land mass will be found in the northern hemisphere (for example, in the Amasia hypothesis, all the land mass is on the northern hemisphere except for the Antarctica). So you should be asking this in 250 million years in the future.  Note: I may be wrong, I just happened to see this on a video.","49":"The earth have existed for eons, and during that time the continents shape has changed multiple times.  So yeah, Pangea is just one of them, just that we know much more of it because of all the evidence left from the age of dinosaurs, that happens to be a lot.","50":"It's understandable to think that since we probably never live to see any major change of the continents locations. Remember that this process that it's currently happening, takes hundreds millions of years to complete, so we can only suppose how it will end up.","51":"Imagine a brand new whole inteligent species from that time trying to figure it out how were the continents located using human fossils, artifacts and ruins as clues.

Ultimately, you translate back and forth as needed, like in the case of a monitor taking a digital signal to produce an analog image.","64":"&gt;Analog devices still use transistors, but they allow for many shades of grey between 0 current an maximum current. Transistors work like switches, with current flowing from the Source to the Drain, controlled by the Gate. This lets a tiny voltage at the Gate control a much larger current, like how a tiny valve can completely shut off a pipe. Analog devices can take a range of voltages through the gate that gradually turns on the current flowing through the device.   Remember, 1 and 0 are just what we call ON and OFF. Its all a matter of how much current is flowing. We get to choose how to interpret that.","65":"So what is happening here is the vantablack is absorbing all the light.  So there is light bouncing off the car and coming into your eye.  So it's not like there is some information coming from the car into your eyes and brains saying, 'hey its really really black right here'.  What is happening is the cells in your eye are not getting any information at all, and those cells in turn do not activate the brain in the same way.  So your brain perceives it as what we call black.  But its really just a lack of information.","66":"That's right.  Remember there isn't really a real 'black'.  That is just a word we made up for what our brain does.  Pretend humans never developed eyes and we never evolved to have the sense of sight.  We have no idea of color or what things look like or anything.  Light particles are still bouncing around and being reflected off everything, everywhere, but in the case of the vantablack, when light hits that area, it just reflects less light than other surfaces. (less information is being reflected)  Another way to look at it is take a digital camera and point it at the car.  Well there is a sensitive chip in there that is like an eye.  The light hits the chip, and activate certain parts of that chip which the computer makes into an image on the screen.  The vantablack areas did not activate that part of the chip.  So the computer reads the image file and says... No data here!  and then when you look at it on the screen the computer doesn't light up that pixel and you perceive black there.","67":"Not through any economically feasible process nor any process that they were attempting. you can do anything to anything with enough energy.

Farming isn't just a matter of throwing a few cows in a field and then leaving them to it till you're ready to kill them.","80":"Internationally, skin whitening has received criticism even within the Asian communities because racism towards darker skinned Asians is still extremely prominent in countries like Vietnam or the Philippines, that have more diverse skin tones. There's still an underlying vein that whiteness is equated with attractiveness, and a lot of the motivation behind skin whitening stems from that idea.","81":"I am all for anyone doing anything they want with their body, if it makes them feel good, then they should go for it. Your original comment seemed to imply to want an explanation for the stigma behind the ritual, and sadly it happens to be one that is largely tied to a checkered past. I will say, I personally get kind of sad though when someone wants to do something because they feel like they aren't attractive enough as they are, and that would include wishing their skin was lighter or wanting plastic surgery. It makes me feel bad that society has created these beauty norms that make people judge themselves so harshly.","82":"The CPU is designed so that if you feed it certain \"numbers\" (the binary numbers are just for human usability - it's all just a series of electrical signals to the CPU) it will perform certain operations. Some of those operations expect additional numbers to be input as part of the instruction (usually, addresses of memory that contain the data). This is all just based on the complex physical arrangement of the transistors and other components within the CPU.  We have a lookup table of what numbers represent what instructions. It's called an **instruction set**. A popular one is x86, which you can read about [here](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/X86_instruction_listings#Original_8086\/8088_instructions).","83":"The CPU is designed that way based on the arrangement of transistors and other components. Feed it a \"6\" and it will add the next two numbers. Feed it an \"8\" and it will store a number into memory.

If you want to see what it looks like inside a CPU you can watch [this video](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=Fxv3JoS1uY8).  The best I can do for ELI5: using transistors you can build logic gates. Using logic gates you can build logical functions. Transistors can also control which logic gates get activated based on a given input. You change which transistors are activated by sending signals to certain CPU pins in a certain order. The CPU is designed such that it would automatically read instructions from certain pins when powered on (which is where the BIOs\/boot process comes in). [Transistors to gates](https:\/\/www.cs.bu.edu\/~best\/courses\/modules\/Transistors2Gates\/).

If the function is y=x\\*2, then inputting 4 will result in 8.  Programs are kinds of functions that (usually) take input, process it, and provide some kind of output.

You seem to be under the assumption that every result calculated by the CPU is literally turned into pixels. That's clearly not the case, computers calculate all sorts of things for different purposes. The software needs to determine what to do with the result. In the case that the result needs to be displayed on screen, the software will tell the monitor how to do so (via the graphics processor).","86":"They get that info from your credit report\/history, which again, should be obtainable only with private info like your social, full name and signature or electronic equivalent.

The current business model is: pack as many people as possible in the plane (by enticing them with low prices) and then selling them stuff while you've got them essentially held hostage.  &gt;but this is completely unrelated to whether people get off in ATL.  The operating cost is.      Tell me about the plane full of people that wanted to buy a ticket and couldn't.

That said - you want to learn whether we're in a position to eradicate the flu - go talk to a (competent) virologist and stop dicking around on reddit.

The circular shadow of the Earth has an orientation that depends on what direction is \"down\" to the observer.  If you went through the Earth to the corresponding spot on the other side; the Earth, Sun, and Moon would be in the same places but \"top\" and \"bottom\" would be reversed.","102":"Which half of the Earth that is lit only depends on the Earth's rotation, and as the other thread explains in detail, that rotation is independent of the orbit of the planet and the Moon.  The Sun and the Moon are almost always on the same hemisphere of the Earth, this is a situation where they are almost opposite each other.  The sky becomes bright before the Sun is actually visible because the atmosphere scatters light.  That may be confusing your interpretation of the sun's location, thinking it's higher in the sky than it actually is.  The Sunrise\/sunset band is a ring around the Earth. As you go around that ring, your feet rotate relative to the plane of the planets.  On one side the shadow is \"up\" pointing toward the brightening sky.  On this side, the shadow points down.  The direction of the \"bright sky\" also rotates because the atmosphere is held to the Earth by the same gravity that holds your feet to the Earth.","103":"There is a hemisphere of Earth where you can see the Moon (ignoring that it's hard during the day because the sky is so bright).  At the same time, there is a hemisphere of Earth where you can see the Sun (generally called \"daytime\").  Most of the time, where is an overlap between these two where you can see the Moon during the day (ignoring it's hard ...).  The eclipse is a \"special\" time where the two hemispheres touch at their edges.  As the Sun and Moon move apart, the overlapping section of the Earth in both becomes thinner and longer.  At the eclipse, it's at its thinnest, only minutes long, but it goes all the way around.

Which brings us to an interesting conclusion, if everything can be predicted based on information in the now, can we really have conscious thought? is any decision based on free will? No.  We are the sum of our experiences and genes, nothing more nothing less.

This is less Computer Science and more Electrical Engineering.  An analog circuit is either \"on\" or \"off\", but its operation can also change based on the energy level. Usually we design the circuit for a specific voltage level (eg. 110V in a US household), and change the current draw to change its operation. Eg. to make a toaster coil hotter or a fan spin faster.  A digital circuit always just \"exists\", with its operation determined by the sequence of on\/off electrical signals transmitted through it. Note that it's the circuit as a whole that is designed to be \"digital\". Individual components like transistors or capacitors are inherently \"analog\", we just use them in different ways.  The concept of \"1s and 0s\" is just something we humans use to help work with digital circuits because of the constant stream of on\/off data going through the circuit - it's useful to represent it as binary numbers. Analog circuits don't operate this way so the concept is kind of useless.","125":"There is no moving last, because M sees the whole of P when it makes its decision- the point is the notion of M is logically inconsistent to begin with.

A great deal of science is in fields that has nothing to do with the topic, a volcanogist has only his personal beliefs, mostly based on early life brain washing, lots are from places where lack of faith is deemed a detriment so you are not likely to find their true opinion, Saudi Arabia and the USA spring to mind. Despite that, US scientists aren't that church going, even assuming that every single one attending is a believer, very unlikely.  &gt;\tThe majority of scien- tists in the US (60 percent), UK (66 percent), and France (81 percent) are nonattenders; only a small fraction of French scientists attend services once a week or more (3.2 percent).

Answer me this -   1. If you took a pregnant 23 year old and dumped her in the woods, do you agree she\u2019d have little chance of survival? If so, then why does the fact that that is also true of a 13-18 year old mean that humans aren\u2019t capable of raising kids at the age of 13-18?  2. If you took a hamster that was raised in a cage and did the same experiment, it would die. So why doesn\u2019t that mean that hamsters are also incapable of raising young?  3a. If humans had never developed past a hunter-gatherer society and still personally foraged for food, do you agree that humans would generally have better survival skills than we do now?  3b. If we don\u2019t have the same survival skills as wild animals because of our modern society with all its incredible complexity and resources, is that a result of cultural and social changes, or biological ones? ","151":"The answer to that question is \u201cyes\u201d. Six or seven people have told you as much.   The reason that humans don\u2019t have children immediately after reaching puberty, is not biological.   Remember you\u2019ve accepted that your original premise, that the question was predicated on, wasn\u2019t true? Why you doing this","152":"Woo I absolutely nailed you with that last response.

Have a good day in work, I hope you\u2019ve learned from all of this","153":"Radioactive decay is very much a quantum process, and the half-life comes from the binding energy and stability of the nucleus. The alpha\/beta\/gamma particles coming out might crash around and damage other atoms, but this is a result of the decay and doesn't precipitate more decay in most cases (fission can be an exception).  &amp;#x200B;  For fission, you can imagine the nucleus like a deformed ball. Unstable nuclei will \"oscillate\" such that the ball will get more spherical and more elongated repeatedly. If it manages to stretch to far, it'll break apart. This is a decent analogy, though being somewhat quantum mechanical it isn't quite that simple.","154":"Generally, you won't be able to add back to the nucleus without fusion, which requires high energy and generally doesn't work well on elements heavier than iron as putting in more nucleons into such nuclei make them bound less strongly. This is why it is said heavy elements originate in supernovae, normal stars don't have the energy to fuse beyond iron. If the nucleus is unstable enough and gets run into, it can cause it to break apart, which is exploited by nuclear reactors to sustain the controlled fission reactions.","155":"Yes, pretty much. To add to a nucleus, you must overcome the electromagnetic repulsion from the protons enough that the strong force takes over. The strong force is a very short ranged force, unlike electromagnetism, and doesn't follow the inverse square law.","156":"So as an example, S(t) could be \"Count how many words the sentence t has and add two.\" You could then look at S(S) and see that S has 11 words and so get 13 in total. Does such a program S make sense to you?","157":"&gt; (I'm one of those people who'd say \"just add the number you've created to the list\"  The assumption initially made was \"this list contains all the numbers\". No other assumptions. If you have to start adding numbers, then the list didn't contain all numbers, and you've proven that this assumption \"list with all numbers\" is impossible. Doesn't matter how clever you are, how many hours you spend adding exceptions you found, what you end up with is a list, and you've proven it won't contain all the numbers.","158":"&gt;  \"there must be a better way to generate a list containing all of the numbers, and my initial list wasn't generated optimally.\"   The key is, no matter how you generated the list, how well thought-out it was, since diagonal argument assumes nothing of what's in the list or how it was made, the same argument still proves it's not complete.","159":"I feel like you\u2019re being purposely obtuse here.  Potassium is slightly radioactive, but you also need it to live.  Uranium, plutonium, and the like are not essential for life, and are magnitudes more radioactive.  Dumping them in the ocean is a very bad idea.    I\u2019m not sure how much simpler we can make this.","160":"&gt; My point is, I think that whatever amount we dump into the ocean would not matter much because when spread throughout the ocean, the average concentration would be sufficiently low that is does not matter.  My point, and everyone else\u2019s, is that this is just not true.  It would matter.  Fukushima mattered, Chernobyl mattered.    Nuclear waste isn\u2019t the same as a banana.

That's why dividends exist. It's not the only way to look at it though. Because without the business keeping that profit to invest back into the business, it could never grow, giving up increasing value in the future.  Take manufacturing, say that you build widgets, each widget nets x profit. That x value can be given out as dividends or it can be used to increase the number of widgets we make and sell. So, by giving up x now and letting the company build another production line of widgets, next year, i get 3x (2x for 2 years of profits, plus x for the new production line of widgets they made)","164":"\"Because you need to\".... then only buy stocks that give our regular dividends.   I understand why you want dividends, but the conversation has moved from you don't understand why some stocks don't do dividends to crying that some don't, those are fundamentally different concepts.

I mean all the comments are saying you can't. Yes you absolutely can. As many pointed out the Strong Nuclear Force &gt; Electromagnetism &gt; Weak Nuclear Force &gt;  Gravity in terms of strength.  &gt;Sounds like we are right back to the start of this lesson again. Let's put some real numbers on this. The \"weak\" nuclear force is 10 to the 25th power stronger than Gravity. That's 100,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 times stronger! Electromagnetism - the force we know best - is 10 to the 36th power stronger than Gravity. That's 10,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 times stronger! The \"strong\" nuclear force is 10 to the 38th power stronger than Gravity. That's 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 times stronger!   You can split any atom with a knife. If you have enough kinetic force.   The forces involved here would be about...  Probably from 1\/10th the speed of light to some where up to 90% of it.  If you're really curious here is a old comic.  https:\/\/what-if.xkcd.com\/1\/  Basically you won't be spiting atoms with any normal actions you do in your daily life.  But if your knife flew probably 1\/10th the speed of light into anything you'd be doing nuclear fusion and there by fission.","171":"Yes the problem with building spacecraft that could theoretically go that fast is that a tiny spec and I mean a few grams of dirt hitting the spacecraft would be like you detonated a tactical nuke on it.   These type of spacecraft are called \"relativistic spacecraft\"  https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Relativistic_rocket  And if you could build these you'd basically make the ultimate death machine.  https:\/\/vocal.media\/futurism\/relativistic-kill-vehicle  These things are literally impossible to stop, you can destroy them but that does literally nothing as it's the kinetic energy that does the fusion explosions on the ground.   The only way to stop these would literally be a huge shield around the planet made out of matter. So an outerwall so to speak.","172":"Most sci fi if you notice avoids it.  Star Trek uses Defector Shields. As in some sort of shield of particles that basically vaporize the incoming dust, they also travel around by warping space so they ship isn't moving at all the space around it is. It's a difficult concept to grasp if you don't understand space-time basics. It's like they're creating a hole infront of themselves and falling into it while making a hill behind them   https:\/\/i.pinimg.com\/originals\/11\/57\/8b\/11578b9e7cb8e0f4bf02c96796dc6521.jpg  Star Wars just gives no fuck.   Star Gate uses \"hyper space\" so you go into another \"dimension\" to and then come back.  https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Interstellar_travel_in_fiction  It all depends on the show but most good shows make it realistic enough and have science advisors telling them obvious flaws.   Like in the video game Mass Effect they discovered a way to remove \"mass\" from objects and even go negative so it's possible to go faster than light, and their ships travels like normal ones would accelerating half of the trip then turning around and accelerating backwards to arrive at the destination at normal speeds. They also use shields to protect from stuff.","173":"It does. It's particularly notable when the gases are those other than the standard air mix of nitrogen, oxygen, CO2, and argon. Plus water vapor.  For example, if you open a manhole, the hydrogen sulfide will be near the bottom, because it's heavier than air. If the space has carbon monoxide in it, it could be near the top, as it's slightly lighter than air. CO2 is heavier than air, which is why you can use it to create a a ground fog. Methane is lighter than air, but flammable vapors of organic solvents tend to be heavier.   This is super important because you have to know where to look for these things before sending workers into confined spaces. Stratification of gases is a key understanding.","174":"Your brain stores knowledge more as abstract concepts. The word links to that concept, and the image links to that concept. See a cat and your brain identifies it as a cat then gives you the thought \"that's a cat\". See the word cat and your brain identifies the meaning of a cat and then gives you the image of a cat in your imagination. These concepts are stored without the use of either word or image, but are linked to the separate storages of the words and images, so those systems usually fire together. This is also how you can know what you want to say but not quite recall the word for it - your brain has accessed the abstract concept, but has misplaced the link between it and the word for it.","175":"Its not *impossible* its just not what its meant to do. Digital isn't \"better\" than analog, they just do completely different things. You use analog to handle real-world signals that can take a range of values, you use digital to do math and process information. Ultimately, you translate back and forth as needed, like in the case of a monitor taking a digital signal to produce an analog image.","176":"&gt;Analog devices still use transistors, but they allow for many shades of grey between 0 current an maximum current. Transistors work like switches, with current flowing from the Source to the Drain, controlled by the Gate. This lets a tiny voltage at the Gate control a much larger current, like how a tiny valve can completely shut off a pipe. Analog devices can take a range of voltages through the gate that gradually turns on the current flowing through the device.   Remember, 1 and 0 are just what we call ON and OFF. Its all a matter of how much current is flowing. We get to choose how to interpret that.","177":"Yeah well maybe you should figure out how to filter my saltyness while you're at it.

Plastic film blocks  infrared radiation, particularly the long wave infrared associated with heat while letting visible light through.","182":"&gt; So does this mean leaving the plastic up in summer would block out heat?  It will trap the heat inside your house just like it does in the winter.  This is how greenhouses work.","183":"I mean, yes, technically, it will block low  wavelength IR from coming in, just like it blocks it from going out.  However, it still lets in the higher wavelength stuff, which your furnishings absorb and re-emit as low frequency IR.","184":"Yes, the Roman Empire is largely responsible for spreading Christianity. Emperor Constantine the Great made Christianity the official religion of the Empire in the fourth century A.D. And remember, \"Christianity\" here means Catholicism. Catholicism is the dominant denomination of Christianity. Protestantism is dominant in the United Kingdom and the former British colonies, such as the United States.","185":"Well, Constantine's exact religious beliefs are still uncertain. We know his mother was a Christian. By the fourth century, Christianity was more than just a cult. It was a well-organized religion. Prior to Constantine, it was basically illegal to be a Christian. I think what Constantine actually did was make it perfectly legal to practice Christianity. He himself converted on his deathbed. I think it was actually Constantine's successor who made Christianity the official religion of the Empire.","186":"The teachings of Christ were popular. There's no denying that. Like anything else, Christianity first spread by word of mouth. One community adopts, and then another, and so on. I think it's also worth noting that these early Christians were probably much more in line with Christ's teaching and did what they could to help those who had been hurt by the Roman Empire. And of course Christ was a martyr. People love a good marty. But really, there are a lot of reasons that contributed to the spread of Christianity, but the religion certainly wouldn't be where it is today had it not been adopted by the greatest power earth had ever known.","187":"Yeah well maybe you should figure out how to filter my saltyness while you're at it.

So unless you abolish the military and police (which I favor), there will always be pressure from lobbyists to sell more guns. That's why the NRA exists- gun manufacturers trick private owners into joining, to lobby Congress to expand the market for the manufacturers. But if you abolish the state organs of violence, there is no need for the second amendment, and no gun industries left to lobby.

Intelligent people have looked at the task of covering millions of square miles of the planet with a covering to capture some gas and decided that it makes absolutely no sense, and would then also completely ruin the ecosystems that would have to be covered, as well as taking an absurd amount of materials, resources, and energy to complete, and they decided it would be much more feasible to find other solutions that are actually possible.","192":"&gt; It could be as simple as vacuuming it up with big harvesters.

Radon is a noble gas but it's radioactive with a half life of 3.8 days decaying into Polonium.   Most elements lighter than lead (have isotopes that) are stable and won't change while pretty much all element heavier than lead will decay over time into lead. Over astronomical time scales stars will continue to change the ratio of hydrogen and helium to heavier elements but the majority of  will stay lighter than Neon.","202":"First, elements decaying always become lighter. Second, lead is stable and does not decay. The only way elements become more massive is through nuclear reactions in stars.    The general trend is that very light elements become heavier and very heavy elements become lighter until they reach Lead\/Thallium. Exotic isotopes that don't fit the general pattern are extremely short-lived, so they basically don't exist.  Also, 2 billion years is not very long, the most stable isotope of Bismuth for example has a half-life of 19 billion billion years to decay into Thallium, and over the 14 billion years the universe has existed stars have only managed to transmute about 2% of mass into anything else than hydrogen and helium.","203":"Theoretically, there can be more massive elements but the most massive ones we've artificially created already are so unstable they decay within nano- to microseconds - in practical terms these elements don't matter because they barely exist.","204":"Not necessarily; it's not a one-to-one shift, and generally the companies (correctly) think they can do a better job insuring their employees than the Feds can.  So in order to have the government provide the same level of healthcare, it likely will end up costing the government *more* because of how inefficient the government is at these kinds of things, in major part because the government isn't interested in a profit motive, and as a result isn't as interested in cost-savings measures.","205":"&gt;What is the evidence that government inefficiency would make the costs increase.  Government procurement is historically prone to cost overruns, bloat, and inefficiency. You can look at military spending for an example of this.  &gt;It would seem that taking out all of the private insurance middlemen would result in much lower costs.  But in the process, you get rid of the negotiators involved in drug\/treatment cost negotiations, and instead the government will just pay whatever the cost is without thinking about it, again because the government doesn't have significant means to fight for cost savings.  We already have a very similar problem with respect to student loans; the increased cost of college education in the US is largely due to the US government being so willing to pump money into higher education through student loans without any form of price controls or cost incentives.","206":"It\u2019s not bad... per se. They don\u2019t put money back into the economy, or rarely do. Think of it in terms of neighborhoods. You have poor, upscale, and rich.

Same goes for the upscale to the poor. When you\u2019re rich, everything because a \u201cprivate\u201d. Private planes, cars, healthcare, etc. Services that cater to the rich are only offered to them. Oh... an easier example would be plane sections.

There you go.","207":"Look up \u201cisotopes of helium\u201d, \u201cisotopes of neon\u201d etc. on Wikipedia and there will be a section labelled \u201clist of isotopes\u201d which shows you a lot of information including what isotopes they decay into if they\u2019re radioactive.   No, noble gasses are not turning into a 19th column. what makes you think that?   Yes, hydrogen-1 will _never_ undergo radioactive decay.

So no radon is not at the end. Many radioactive isotopes undergo these sequences where they keep decaying into other isotopes until they get to a stable one.","209":"&gt;Oh cool, so does that mean that, like radon, all of the noble elements will eventually turn into lead?  What makes your ask this question? Helium will never \u201cdecay\u201d into lead, nor will neon etc.   When stars explode a large amount of heavier elements are formed, but again this isn\u2019t the same process.    &gt;Could lead ever decay into something else? Is there a half-life of lead?  I\u2019ve already told you that every single element has radioactive isotopes, see: https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Isotopes_of_lead - note just how many radioactive isotopes lead has, many are decay products from other elements, lead is the heaviest element that still has stable isotopes.   Isotopes are atoms with the same number of protons but different numbers of neutrons. Only specific configurations of protons and neutrons are stable, everything else is unstable and undergoes radioactive decay.   &gt;If lead does decay into something else, it would probably take us billions of years to find out, right?

It took about 70 years for the rest of the elements in the 7th row to be created, that was elements 95-118). The last few discovered decay within fractions of seconds. The faster something decays the harder it is to create and then detect.   We will likely see element 120 within 5 years, but getting to element 169 (which would be the first element on the 9th row) is going to to take a lot longer and will need improvements in technology if it can even be created at all.   Is there a reason you are so obsessed with this?","211":"Is it really important though? None of these elements have real world applications. It\u2019s mostly a dick waving contest.   If it\u2019s boring in school it\u2019s mostly because of boring teachers or boring curricula, or both. Chemistry is an amazing science because it\u2019s so essential to everything around us.   If it takes 5 years to discover element 119, and even if it takes 5 years past that for each other element you\u2019re looking at nearly 50000 years. And that\u2019s a theoretical number pulled out of nowhere with no basis in reality. There\u2019s other problems to overcome, like heavier elements needing electrons to travel at faster than the speed of light and somehow overcoming the repulsion of protons in the nucleus.","212":"Hmm?

The only real value in the world is material resources and labour -- money is an obfuscating game above all that.","215":"You're getting a little technical for me now, I just read where my interest takes me and am not able to follow all the implications of this!  Money in modern society is more or less fictional with limits placed arbitrarily to benefit one or another faction of the ruling class. Debt is the main way money is introduced into the economy and there would be no money circulating if all debts were paid, as far as I understand.  Some books that opened my eyes about this were David Graeber's Debt: The First Five Thousand Years and Kate Raworth's Donut Economics. I also like reading about Modern Monetary Theory which is based on some of these ideas -- although I don't agree with the thinking of all MMTers (and am certainly not smart enough to say that to their faces).","216":"&gt; Why is it political though, shouldn't it be a clear cut science issue cause it has to be built somewhere anyways?

Of those, only Onkalo is getting made because its the only one that hasn't gotten snagged up in local objections to building a nuclear waste dump at their feet. Because unsurprisingly locals dont particularly like the idea, they recognize that long-term disposal is necessary, but just *not here*.  You are dealing with people and you are dealing with distributing resources (in this case, nuclear waste), its political.","218":"That is one way to look at it, yes. That's why dividends exist. It's not the only way to look at it though. Because without the business keeping that profit to invest back into the business, it could never grow, giving up increasing value in the future.  Take manufacturing, say that you build widgets, each widget nets x profit. That x value can be given out as dividends or it can be used to increase the number of widgets we make and sell. So, by giving up x now and letting the company build another production line of widgets, next year, i get 3x (2x for 2 years of profits, plus x for the new production line of widgets they made)","219":"Why would there need to be another purpose other than selling it?

Digital isn't \"better\" than analog, they just do completely different things. You use analog to handle real-world signals that can take a range of values, you use digital to do math and process information. Ultimately, you translate back and forth as needed, like in the case of a monitor taking a digital signal to produce an analog image.","223":"Take any example of a company share. I'll use Apple. You purchased some of their shares in 2005. Their employees designed a product called an Iphone, marketed it, made it and sold millions of it and continued to innovate making their company valued at hundreds of billions of dollars because of the money it makes. You own a part of the effort the company put into this. How is this different from you buying a chicken, cooking it and selling it for more? If you sold someone a 25% share of your chicken company, then that person is entitled to 25% of the value of the company. You no longer own 100% of that company. If all you did was sell one chicken, then you need to give that person 25% of the profits from that chicken. A share isn't an IOU - it means that the owner of the share is part-owner of the company.","224":"There are issues with corporate governance, but if someone owned 25% of the shares of a large public company (unrealistic mostly) they'd almost certainly be on the Board of Directors (BOD) and very likely the Chairman of the Board. The BOD (representatives of the shareholders - mostly large shareholders themselves) decide on the dividend policy. It is, in theory, the shareholders that decide whether or not the company pays a dividend, management can advise but the board decides.   So if a company doesn't pay dividends it is usually a joint consensus of the management and the owners (shareholders) of the company. Of course, if someone owns 0.00001% of the shares of the company, they probably cannot expect to have much say (other than voting at the AGM) in the major strategic decisions of the company.","225":"The beauty of the free market is that you can make any investment decision based on any set of beliefs you have. All I can attempt is to explain how it works. If your conclusion is that A is better than B, then so be it.   It is simply odd that you make such a huge distinction between dividend and non-dividend paying shares. But you are free to do so. Hopefully if you ever intend to invest, you research the return history of various companies in recent history and validate your belief (dividend etc) against empirical performance.   At the end of the day, investing is mostly about making as much money as you can at an acceptable risk in a timeframe that fits you.","226":"CC: u\/covalick  &gt;We are not even sure what the smallest unit of time is, though many suspect it is planck time.   This is false. The majority think that time is continuous, not chopped up into moments of Planck time.  &gt;Time as we experience it must have existed after the big bang, but at those early moments, only a few Planck time units after the big bang, space was not yet space. It was a massive ball of unimaginable amounts of energy,  This is also false. I'm not even sure what this is supposed to mean.  When you rewind the clock, things get closer and closer together until at some point, the energy is packed together so tightly that spacetime has to be described with quantum mechanics, but there are numerous problems with formulating such a theory.  &gt;I am hope full that when a nuclear clock is finally created (much more accurate than an atomic clock) we may start to unwrap some of the mysteries of time.  A nuclear clock also has nothing to do with the nature of time. It simply allows us to measure time more accurately, though its error will still be many times greater than a Planck time.","227":"This is complicated. It's easiest to think of them as waves, but more accurately, they are waves of points.  The energy is proportional to the frequency of the wave, and resolution is also proportional to the frequency, and so we define the Planck length as the length at which the energy of a photon is high enough to make a black hole.","228":"Now that is a good question... I know I had some sex education in school but it wasn't very good. It's a common problem in schools because people are scared to talk about it. Some of the fear is that it will encourage kids to start having sex early but I think it's important for everyone to know how the body works. Everyone has one, so why hide it?  Kids need to know what is normal and what is not normal, so if there is a problem, they can talk to a doctor. Puberty is scary with everything changing and a lot of people feel shame about it when they shouldn't. I'm glad you're asking questions ahead of time so you're a little more prepared.","229":"It's just how the human body is. \u00af\\_(\u30c4)_\/\u00af Can't do much about it.

Up and down only mean \"pointed toward the earth\" and \"not pointed toward the earth.\" No matter how far south you fly, gravity keeps everything oriented so that \"down\" is toward the earth.

So in order to have the government provide the same level of healthcare, it likely will end up costing the government *more* because of how inefficient the government is at these kinds of things, in major part because the government isn't interested in a profit motive, and as a result isn't as interested in cost-savings measures.","234":"&gt;What is the evidence that government inefficiency would make the costs increase.  Government procurement is historically prone to cost overruns, bloat, and inefficiency. You can look at military spending for an example of this.  &gt;It would seem that taking out all of the private insurance middlemen would result in much lower costs.  But in the process, you get rid of the negotiators involved in drug\/treatment cost negotiations, and instead the government will just pay whatever the cost is without thinking about it, again because the government doesn't have significant means to fight for cost savings.  We already have a very similar problem with respect to student loans; the increased cost of college education in the US is largely due to the US government being so willing to pump money into higher education through student loans without any form of price controls or cost incentives.","235":"By that definition of mlm, then every wholesaler that sells to walmart, target etc is a mlm.

Alcoholism actually remaps the brain and causes dependency. Meaning you may actually die if you abruptly stop  drinking. It creates a response system similar to narcotics or nicotine: it needs it to function properly.","239":"It is both. Addiction IS a disease process. That's what I'm saying. You are reliant on a substance to  function that you don't actually need to function. That's a disease state. Who cares if you can blame them or not? Treat it and move on. People only get bent out of shape on addiction because they want to. Do you get mad at COPD patients even though the number 1 cause is smoking? What about type 2 diabetics from being overweight? That's their fault too.","240":"Smoking isn't a disease. Being addicted to nicotine is a disease. Drinking isn't a disease. Being addicted to alcohol is a disease. It's when you cross into dependence or when it impacts your life is when you are now part of a disease process. I have a drink or two during the month, but I'm not an addict. That's the key point.

Or are you looking for why people put such significance on the \u201ccollege\/school\u201d experience (some of which I touched on).","246":"Just to be clear, I trust you don't consider your question relevant to actually money as it's used in 2020 -- Ben Bernanke has long since made clear that modern money is a question of editing numbers on a computer and not any resource found lying around.","247":"How do you think money comes into being? Only about 3% of money is printed. As the Bank of England explains here, money mostly comes about through the issuance of loans (https:\/\/www.bankofengland.co.uk\/quarterly-bulletin\/2014\/q1\/money-creation-in-the-modern-economy) and those loans come about by editing a spreadsheet.","248":"When the government takes the issuance of the central bank, no real debt is incurred in the sense of household debt, but it is politically expedient to act as though that is the case.

This combination makes up the genes.   It wasn't predetermined that this is what would happen.   It evolved that way.  So when the proteins form it does so based on the genes.  This is not the same thing as having it predetermined.  Which is why its not great to call it a code.  A code has an intended purpose.   Additionally the offspring of species don't always copy the DNA correctly from the parents and there is a mutation,  which is how we ultimately get new genes, then new species etc.  In the end it is just chemicals reactions happening.  Physics and the laws of the universe  will just cause this to happen.","250":"I can only recall people making the fallacy in question a few times, but in all cases, it was to put somebody else down, or prop themselves up (by making themselves seem superior, or by clinging to their beliefs in the face of reasoning); never was it to benefit others.","251":"People buying shares can drive the price up. But, that buying is an effect, not the cause. The prices goes up because people believe that the company is worth more than what it is selling for. If a company has 100 shares (each stock is 1% ownership, and the stocks are a dollar each, then on the stock market, the company is worth 100$. If the company's balance sheet (net worth in actual assets) is worth 120$, then people will buy it (assuming no other variables) because by buying it, you get 1.20$ for 1$. As more people buy it, the availability of the stock decreases, which makes each share sell for more.   Never ever buy stock just because someone else did or that it is expensive. The value of the stock is based on the company it represents.","252":"The inherent value comes from the owned assets of the company. The company owns physical goods (land, equipment, cash, etc) stock is ownership of that company and thus ownership of the goods owned by the company.","253":"Because the company can either reinvest that money into the company, ideally so the company becomes more valuable. Or, it can pay out dividends. The decision comes from whether the stockholders (in aggregate) think the company can use that money to make the company more valuable than what the stockholder can normally do.   Using you example earlier, if you made hundreds of your blood paintings, you wouldn't be rich, because no one would buy them. It's basic economics at that point, partial ownership of Amazon is more valued than your paintings are.   Amazon continues to expand its services and logistics network with the money it could spend on dividends. If it paid out dividends, it wouldn't be building as many new distribution centers and becoming more valuable to its customers who buy things from amazon. By doing so, it makes amazon ownership more valuable.","254":"Again, I'm saying that I haven't seen it as a hindrance to employment today like it was 25-35 years ago. People were more formal all the way around in their employment back then. Men wore suits or ties at least, women wore blouses and slacks or even skirts and dresses. Today, all of that is rare. Very rare. That's mainly why afros aren't frowned upon like they were back then. But also like I said, PC sort of prevents people from even discussing it.  As far as the prejudice goes - it's just a guess, but the few people I know that have commented on giant afros see a connection between them and protestors. So, people likely view huge afros as a form of protest. Employers don't like to even consider hiring people that they consider to be agitators, generally speaking.   Note: I'm limited on how often I can post, so I'm having to go back and edit other comments instead of replying directly.","255":"Employers don't typically look at skills alone. It's cheaper to retain an employee than replace one, so they would rather hire someone that will get along with everyone else rather than quitting shortly after being hired, or running off other employees instead.  If a person seems like they might be a problem case during an interview, it's probably a sign that they won't fit in.","256":"As a header, life doesn't want anything. All systems will tend towards an equilibrium. Imagine you're hitting a golfball around a field for a million years, and there's a single rabbit hole somewhere in that field. Odds are the ball will eventually wind up in that hole, and once it does it is going to stay there.  The ball being in that hole is loosely analogous to life - it is something that is very unlikely but given enough time and the right circumstances it will eventually happen.  As for why life is stable, that's sort of by definition. If it weren't stable, then it wouldn't be life. Plenty of little bits of molecules stuck together in the ocean over several million or billion or trillion years, but they all fell apart. The one that didn't fall apart and instead replicated itself by complete accident was the one that survived long enough to evolve into humans, who promptly named this self-sustaining process \"life\".","257":"Stability and complexity are unrelated. The added complexity *in some contexts* clearly makes life more able to sustain itself, otherwise it wouldn't evolve. In places where it is not useful, it does not evolve. This is why viruses are simple - they don't benefit from added complexity.  As for exactly how they work, they take advantage of the complexity in their hosts. The complicated things like growing and protecting oneself and getting food and reproducing are all handled by the host cell. *Somebody* has to do those things, and the virus simply allows the host cell to do them. Viruses don't even really understand how to make more viruses - they simply turn themselves over to the advanced machinery of the host and allow the host to use its own 'knowledge' of replication to make more virus.","258":"Oop - I slipped into nerdspeak. A von Neumann machine is a machine that can replicate itself by first building a body and 'downloading' the blueprint for that body into it allowing the new body to then replicate again.  As for the exact chemistry of it all, that is unfortunately beyond my knowledge. Organic chem is hell.","259":"&gt;Feel free to google whether it's ok to skip gears and you will get article after article saying   Whatever you want it to.   \"There are websites on the internet that agree with my preconceived notions\" also applies to whether vaccines cause autism and if the Earth is flat.","260":"Hmm?

Also if you would draw out the Nazi party's separate beliefs and policies you get more like a shotgun blast at various parts of the spectrum. Some policies could be seen as extreme left, some centrist-left, a lot far right obviously etc. So that way you can't 'fit' the party into a specific part of the spectrum. This is a key feature of this kind of parties that transcend the classical political classification that is left\/right wing. Nowadays it's more common for populist parties in Europe (don't know much about other parts of the world) where you see a combination of popular policies on both the left and right wing to 'attract' more followers if you call it that, but then also joined with a lot of far right policies, often played down to not be classified as such that easily.","281":"&gt;The main thing that makes money is selling tickets  Not true.  100% incorrect.  &gt;But if the plane is underweight they can also make more by shipping cargo  Weight is weight.

What makes your ask this question? Helium will never \u201cdecay\u201d into lead, nor will neon etc.   When stars explode a large amount of heavier elements are formed, but again this isn\u2019t the same process.    &gt;Could lead ever decay into something else? Is there a half-life of lead?  I\u2019ve already told you that every single element has radioactive isotopes, see: https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Isotopes_of_lead - note just how many radioactive isotopes lead has, many are decay products from other elements, lead is the heaviest element that still has stable isotopes.   Isotopes are atoms with the same number of protons but different numbers of neutrons.

We will likely see element 120 within 5 years, but getting to element 169 (which would be the first element on the 9th row) is going to to take a lot longer and will need improvements in technology if it can even be created at all.

These people rely on an effect called \"herd immunity\".  Basically you die if you get infected but you never get infected because everyone around you is vaccinated. This prevents a disease from spreading.  Unfortunately to achieve herd immunity roughly 98% of the population have to be vaccinated.  So for me personally as a vaccinated, healthy adult it makes no difference if you are vaccinated or not. For my little daughter or my cancer stricken relative it is a life or death situation (unfortunately quite literally).  Therefore if you are healthy and able to get a shot, go get a shot.

Just because the average cost of a car is high doesn\u2019t mean someone poor has to buy an expensive car, it just means people who have money like to spend it on cars.  I have the income to do so, so I spend a lot of money on my daughter because it makes me happy.  And that increases the average but others don\u2019t have to.  Basically the number is high because people want to spend money on their kids.  Nobody needs a $1000 crib.","333":"Sort of.  Since people are having fewer kids they have the ability to do more for the kids they do have.  Also having kids at an older age means they have more money.  Also, it inflates the cost when both parents work so they have to pay child care, but rarely does someone work if they can\u2019t make more than childcare costs.  So instead of staying home with their children, they earn $40,000 per year and pay $20,000 per year in child care.  In the end they have more money than if they stayed home with their kids, but studies like these make it look like it is costing the family $20,000 more than previous generations.

So in order to have the government provide the same level of healthcare, it likely will end up costing the government *more* because of how inefficient the government is at these kinds of things, in major part because the government isn't interested in a profit motive, and as a result isn't as interested in cost-savings measures.","364":"&gt;What is the evidence that government inefficiency would make the costs increase.  Government procurement is historically prone to cost overruns, bloat, and inefficiency. You can look at military spending for an example of this.  &gt;It would seem that taking out all of the private insurance middlemen would result in much lower costs.  But in the process, you get rid of the negotiators involved in drug\/treatment cost negotiations, and instead the government will just pay whatever the cost is without thinking about it, again because the government doesn't have significant means to fight for cost savings.  We already have a very similar problem with respect to student loans; the increased cost of college education in the US is largely due to the US government being so willing to pump money into higher education through student loans without any form of price controls or cost incentives.","365":"It's not a fallacy if you are arguing something subjective because if it is subjective then it is illogical.

It's cost is from physical ingredients.  It is a **product**.  It has value because it is a physical thing.  That seat is a **service**.  It has value because it is providing a opportunity.   An opportunity which you've taken from the airline by lying.  They can't resell it.   They *don't* have an extra dessert, they've got an empty seat.   They can't put that seat back on the shelf, and they can't sell it to someone else because you said you were going to be in it.  How about this: The more full a plane is, the less per seat it costs to operate.   Very simple.   More people to share the fixed hourly cost of fuel, crew, maintenance.....

Cost per *Available* Seat Mile and Revenue per *Available* Seat Mile.  How much is produced\/consumed for every seat, every mile.  Here's the thing.   Available is extremely important.  When passengers do the Hidden City, they remove the Available.       With a large airline like Lufthansa or Delta (who operates 4800 flights every day), it aggregates big time.  If *one* person on each flight does a hidden city, that's the equivalent of running 16 empty Boeing 777 flights every day.","371":"And why do you think that has an effect on me?

Some of those operations expect additional numbers to be input as part of the instruction (usually, addresses of memory that contain the data). This is all just based on the complex physical arrangement of the transistors and other components within the CPU.  We have a lookup table of what numbers represent what instructions. It's called an **instruction set**. A popular one is x86, which you can read about [here](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/X86_instruction_listings#Original_8086\/8088_instructions).","373":"The CPU is designed that way based on the arrangement of transistors and other components.

If you want to see what it looks like inside a CPU you can watch [this video](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=Fxv3JoS1uY8).  The best I can do for ELI5: using transistors you can build logic gates. Using logic gates you can build logical functions. Transistors can also control which logic gates get activated based on a given input. You change which transistors are activated by sending signals to certain CPU pins in a certain order. The CPU is designed such that it would automatically read instructions from certain pins when powered on (which is where the BIOs\/boot process comes in). [Transistors to gates](https:\/\/www.cs.bu.edu\/~best\/courses\/modules\/Transistors2Gates\/).

You seem to be under the assumption that every result calculated by the CPU is literally turned into pixels. That's clearly not the case, computers calculate all sorts of things for different purposes. The software needs to determine what to do with the result. In the case that the result needs to be displayed on screen, the software will tell the monitor how to do so (via the graphics processor).","375":"The title of your post was \"Why is the No True Scotsman considered a fallacy\" and that's been repeatedly answered.

We both had \"labs\" at home, and we would do various \"experiments.\" One time, we were discussing something - we must have been 11 or 12 at the time - and I  said, \"But thinking is nothing but talking to yourself inside.\"       &gt;   &gt;\"Oh yeah?\" Bernie said. \"Do you know the crazy shape of the crankshaft in car?\"      &gt;   &gt;\"Yeah, what of it?\"      &gt;   &gt;\"Good.

Goes on to describe how Feynman then tried to learn to do both (as have I since reading this. And like Feynman, have failed).

Influenza isn't usually a big deal, so we never go to great lengths to stop it. While Covid is very contagious, and Can result in hospitalization (influenza can too). The reason that we have been so precautious with Covid is because so many hospitals are at above 100% capacity.

The added complexity *in some contexts* clearly makes life more able to sustain itself, otherwise it wouldn't evolve. In places where it is not useful, it does not evolve. This is why viruses are simple - they don't benefit from added complexity.  As for exactly how they work, they take advantage of the complexity in their hosts. The complicated things like growing and protecting oneself and getting food and reproducing are all handled by the host cell. *Somebody* has to do those things, and the virus simply allows the host cell to do them. Viruses don't even really understand how to make more viruses - they simply turn themselves over to the advanced machinery of the host and allow the host to use its own 'knowledge' of replication to make more virus.","391":"Many systems can be self-sustaining so long as they have 'food'.

The turbine speed and torque is going to be based on super complicated fluid mechanics stuff that I don't know to well.    No, it won't have the same energy output.  Lets say that substance 1 has a boiling point of 50 degrees Celsius and substance 2 has a boiling point of 100 degrees Celsius.  Lets also say that they require the same amount of energy to heat up 1 degree Celsius (1 kj).  Substance 1 absorbs 50 kj of energy but substance 2 absorbs 100 kj.  This means that substance 2 can have more energy extracted by the turbine.    The pressure doesn't actually have much to do with it, it's actually held constant during the boiling process and a pump is used to get the liquid to the right pressure.\nExplainee: Right, this explanation is all compatible with thermodynamics (more energy in=more energy out), but why? Why doesn't a gas molecule at the same pressure affecting the same surface area and moving at the same speed, just at a different temperature, not move the turbine the same amount? The turbine extracts energy by spinning.

Too much damage to cellular structures can cause the cell to destroy itself, as can too much damage to DNA. This is why bad sunburn causes skin to peel off, the epidermal and dermal layers received enough damage to decide they need to kill themselves for the greater good. However, if DNA is damaged in certain ways, it can lead to cancer. It's not that DNA can't be repaired at all, it's that it is the \"master program\" for the cell and can be modified in ways that make the cell do things that it isn't supposed to.   You can also receive too much damage to important cells like in organs. It's actually therapeutic in some situations, such as using radioactive iodine to destroy some of a large thyroid, but many organs are not good at regenerating so the damage can hamper their functionality.\nExplainee: Never really thought about it that way. So skin cells \"voluntarily\" end it because probably evolutionarily speaking, the ones who didn't, developed cancer more often, limiting their own baby production.

This isn't the easiest example of a proof by contradiction, so trying to figure out the logic of the argument as well as the programs might be what's confusing you\nExplainee: The overarching logic makes sense to me--we posit that there's a program (call it the \"Perfect Decider\") that can correctly determine whether, for **any** **possible program that could ever exist**, halts or instead runs indefinitely.  Then we invent another program (the \"Nasty Trickster\")--deliberately designing it to fool the Perfect Decider--and show that, when the Perfect Decider is fed to the Nasty Trickster (or perhaps vice versa - that's something that I don't understand and seems convoluted to me), the Perfect Decider doesn't work as advertised.    Thus, because of the existence of at least one counterexample, there can't be such a thing as the Perfect Decider (i.e., there can't be a program that can correctly determine, for any possible program that could ever exist, halts or instead runs forever).  That does not rule out the possibility of Very, Very Good Deciders, but it does show that a Perfect Decider is a logical impossibility.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","128":"Explainer: I think what you're misunderstanding is that P is not cheating M. If a perfect decider was possible, it would be able to deal with *any* program, even one where P 'moved last', but clearly this is impossible, so it cannot exist\nExplainee: There is still something unsatisfying with permitting P to evaluate M and then change its answer.

The alpha\/beta\/gamma particles coming out might crash around and damage other atoms, but this is a result of the decay and doesn't precipitate more decay in most cases (fission can be an exception).  &amp;#x200B;  For fission, you can imagine the nucleus like a deformed ball. Unstable nuclei will \"oscillate\" such that the ball will get more spherical and more elongated repeatedly. If it manages to stretch to far, it'll break apart. This is a decent analogy, though being somewhat quantum mechanical it isn't quite that simple.\nExplainee:  So when a Uranium atom decays into \"stable\" Thorium, is it possible that another alpha\/beta\/gamma particles can knock into it, turning it back into Uranium or has the particles lost just enough energy in it's initial emission to not be able to return, \"upgrading\" the atom again?

If the nucleus is unstable enough and gets run into, it can cause it to break apart, which is exploited by nuclear reactors to sustain the controlled fission reactions.\nExplainee: As far as suoernovae, it's because there's a ton of high energy+high gravity\/pressure keeping them together to fuse if I have that correct? \nExplainer: {missing part}\n","156":"Explainee: ELI5 - Halting Problem and the Self-Referential Proof\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","157":"Explainer: &gt; The actual proof, I imagine, involves a whole bunch of symbols  It's not super hard to understand.

There are too many background principles with which I have no familiarity (I'm one of those people who'd say \"just add the number you've created to the list\"; I know that rejoinder is incorrect but I don't know why it is incorrect) for me to understand why diagonalization works as a proof.  I do think I understand what a proof by contradiction is supposed to do.  You start with an assumption:  \"P.\"  Then, through reasoning, you show that \"P\" leads to something that cannot be true (e.g., 2 + 2 = 0), therefore (assuming the steps hold) the initial assumption is the thing that cannot be true.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","158":"Explainer: &gt; (I'm one of those people who'd say \"just add the number you've created to the list\"  The assumption initially made was \"this list contains all the numbers\".

Radon is a noble gas but it's radioactive with a half life of 3.8 days decaying into Polonium.   Most elements lighter than lead (have isotopes that) are stable and won't change while pretty much all element heavier than lead will decay over time into lead.

Exotic isotopes that don't fit the general pattern are extremely short-lived, so they basically don't exist.  Also, 2 billion years is not very long, the most stable isotope of Bismuth for example has a half-life of 19 billion billion years to decay into Thallium, and over the 14 billion years the universe has existed stars have only managed to transmute about 2% of mass into anything else than hydrogen and helium.\nExplainee: Also, do you think it's possible that either naturally or \"artificially\" that new elements will be made?

Take manufacturing, say that you build widgets, each widget nets x profit. That x value can be given out as dividends or it can be used to increase the number of widgets we make and sell.

In that case, mlms make the world function......  A ponzi scheme requires there to be an exaggerated or novalue behind the product being bought or sold.

Either way, there is value behind the product (ownership) being exchanged...  And yes, companies do typically buy back stock during recession (the opposite of dilluting) to manage stock prices, which is based on the majority of stock holders decision.\nExplainee: The difference with wholesalers, is that there is intrinsic value, i.e. Food, water, etc. Stocks don't have intrinsic value. And there's competition for the same objecrlt, e.g. Tomatoes. MLMs don't have competition, because you buy it from the company only.

You own a part of the effort the company put into this. How is this different from you buying a chicken, cooking it and selling it for more? If you sold someone a 25% share of your chicken company, then that person is entitled to 25% of the value of the company. You no longer own 100% of that company. If all you did was sell one chicken, then you need to give that person 25% of the profits from that chicken.

It is, in theory, the shareholders that decide whether or not the company pays a dividend, management can advise but the board decides.   So if a company doesn't pay dividends it is usually a joint consensus of the management and the owners (shareholders) of the company. Of course, if someone owns 0.00001% of the shares of the company, they probably cannot expect to have much say (other than voting at the AGM) in the major strategic decisions of the company.\nExplainee: yeah, so I feel like buying non-dividend shares is more of a winner takes all system.

If I decide to draw a random squiggle with my blood on a piece of paper, that would be a very scarce object, yet I do not think that people would be paying millions for it.

Very rare. That's mainly why afros aren't frowned upon like they were back then. But also like I said, PC sort of prevents people from even discussing it.  As far as the prejudice goes - it's just a guess, but the few people I know that have commented on giant afros see a connection between them and protestors. So, people likely view huge afros as a form of protest. Employers don't like to even consider hiring people that they consider to be agitators, generally speaking.

All systems will tend towards an equilibrium. Imagine you're hitting a golfball around a field for a million years, and there's a single rabbit hole somewhere in that field. Odds are the ball will eventually wind up in that hole, and once it does it is going to stay there.  The ball being in that hole is loosely analogous to life - it is something that is very unlikely but given enough time and the right circumstances it will eventually happen.  As for why life is stable, that's sort of by definition. If it weren't stable, then it wouldn't be life. Plenty of little bits of molecules stuck together in the ocean over several million or billion or trillion years, but they all fell apart. The one that didn't fall apart and instead replicated itself by complete accident was the one that survived long enough to evolve into humans, who promptly named this self-sustaining process \"life\".\nExplainee: Thanks for the answer.  I understand that life dosent want anything, but Im wondering more what are the laws and mechanisms that makes it so that for an example viruses have the tendency to self replicate?

While we don't know the exact path that life followed as it formed, it seems safe to say that a very rudimentary von Neumann 'machine' molecule or arrangement of molecules came to be which then developed more and more complex 'programs' that eventually became DNA.  Again, such developments are very unlikely, but given the sheer number of molecules forming and breaking in the oceans even now, on the order of quintillions or more every second, over the course of trillions of years, it shouldn't be too shocking that it happened *once*.\nExplainee: Im sorry a rudimentary what? Remember Im five years old.  What was the mechanism for the development into more and more complex programs? Simply sheer chance?

I\u2019ve already told you that every single element has radioactive isotopes, see: https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Isotopes_of_lead - note just how many radioactive isotopes lead has, many are decay products from other elements, lead is the heaviest element that still has stable isotopes.   Isotopes are atoms with the same number of protons but different numbers of neutrons. Only specific configurations of protons and neutrons are stable, everything else is unstable and undergoes radioactive decay.   &gt;If lead does decay into something else, it would probably take us billions of years to find out, right?

The last few discovered decay within fractions of seconds. The faster something decays the harder it is to create and then detect.   We will likely see element 120 within 5 years, but getting to element 169 (which would be the first element on the 9th row) is going to to take a lot longer and will need improvements in technology if it can even be created at all.

Just because the average cost of a car is high doesn\u2019t mean someone poor has to buy an expensive car, it just means people who have money like to spend it on cars.  I have the income to do so, so I spend a lot of money on my daughter because it makes me happy.  And that increases the average but others don\u2019t have to.  Basically the number is high because people want to spend money on their kids.  Nobody needs a $1000 crib.\nExplainee: Not saying you are wrong, but is your idea that the cost to raise a child has not increased over the years, but parent's desire to spend more on them has?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","334":"Explainer: Sort of.  Since people are having fewer kids they have the ability to do more for the kids they do have.  Also having kids at an older age means they have more money.  Also, it inflates the cost when both parents work so they have to pay child care, but rarely does someone work if they can\u2019t make more than childcare costs.  So instead of staying home with their children, they earn $40,000 per year and pay $20,000 per year in child care.  In the end they have more money than if they stayed home with their kids, but studies like these make it look like it is costing the family $20,000 more than previous generations.    I buy a lot of stuff that would be considered for my daughter because it makes my life easier or because I get more enjoyment buying something for her than something for myself.  But all those costs go into looking like it is just expensive to have kids.\nExplainee: Interesting. So, slightly different question. Do you think that the buying of these \"luxury\" items, things that make the parents happy but of course the kids don't know any different at first (like your example of a fancy onesie)...do you think that parents buying these things influences their kids to want\/need more when they grow up?  I get the feeling that the typical millennial doesn't want to want the fancy things our generation bought like mortgages and marriages, fancy clothes and big cars, etc but when they grow up with it, they don't know any better. Then they feel pressure to get the corporate job they never wanted, rather than the non college profession that makes them happy, but won't buy these things.  I wonder if this generation's parents are giving their kids the best, while sentencing them to want an unaffordable lifestyle later on.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","335":"Explainee: ELI5: What's the point of buying non-dividend shares?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","336":"Explainer: That is one way to look at it, yes. That's why dividends exist. It's not the only way to look at it though. Because without the business keeping that profit to invest back into the business, it could never grow, giving up increasing value in the future.  Take manufacturing, say that you build widgets, each widget nets x profit. That x value can be given out as dividends or it can be used to increase the number of widgets we make and sell. So, by giving up x now and letting the company build another production line of widgets, next year, i get 3x (2x for 2 years of profits, plus x for the new production line of widgets they made)\nExplainee: so that's fine, but what if the company never hands out dividends? The company grows and grows, but what is the purpose of your shares besides selling? Because if you own something that in reality doesn't do anything until you sell it, then where is the value?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","337":"Explainer: \"Because you need to\".... then only buy stocks that give our regular dividends.   I understand why you want dividends, but the conversation has moved from you don't understand why some stocks don't do dividends to crying that some don't, those are fundamentally different concepts.   Your way of viewing stocks is valid and some stocks share your point of view, but it isn't the ONLY valid way to view stocks. In the end, the decision to pay dividends is based on the board of directors, which the stockholders can vote on...\nExplainee: But why should it be the board's decision of whether it pays stockholders or not?   Why isn't it that if you decide to not take dividends, you would gain more stocks (based on company performance) because you're technically \"reinvesting\" your dividends?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","338":"Explainee: ELI5: What happens to the common cold during the off season, where does it reside and why\/how does it come back?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","339":"Explainee: ELI5: Why are we expected to have super complex passwords, but then very simple security questions which are often public information which can be used to access an account?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","340":"Explainer: Did OP edit the original post somehow?

The thing is that in most of them, the mayority of the land mass will be found in the northern hemisphere (for example, in the Amasia hypothesis, all the land mass is on the northern hemisphere except for the Antarctica).

Too much damage to cellular structures can cause the cell to destroy itself, as can too much damage to DNA. This is why bad sunburn causes skin to peel off, the epidermal and dermal layers received enough damage to decide they need to kill themselves for the greater good. However, if DNA is damaged in certain ways, it can lead to cancer. It's not that DNA can't be repaired at all, it's that it is the \"master program\" for the cell and can be modified in ways that make the cell do things that it isn't supposed to.   You can also receive too much damage to important cells like in organs. It's actually therapeutic in some situations, such as using radioactive iodine to destroy some of a large thyroid, but many organs are not good at regenerating so the damage can hamper their functionality.\nExplainee: Never really thought about it that way. So skin cells \"voluntarily\" end it because probably evolutionarily speaking, the ones who didn't, developed cancer more often, limiting their own baby production.

Every time you go to the kitchen, you pick up stuff for more than one of your tables because it's far more efficient than making point to point trips back and forth between single tables.\nExplainee: In the table waiting example, it's as though someone bought a full meal with a dessert (a mean that just happens to be cheaper than the entree alone).

But if I buy a seat, presumably I'm doing it at market value (more on this later). At that point the airline shouldn't care what I do with it. Taken to the extreme example, if I buy a flight and then miss the plane, the airline has just made exactly the same profit as it would have if I'd flown (actually _slightly_ more because their operation costs will drop slightly from the missing weight).  Now what is \"market value\"? In a perfectly competitive market it's just enough to cover operation costs + additional airline overhead.

This includes initialising all the connected hardware, and eventually telling the CPU to start loading instructions from some storage media (which ideally contains an operating system). We call this process *booting*. The CPU is already hard-wired as part of its design, to load this BIOS program from the motherboard it's plugged in to.\nExplainee: How do the instructions make it do something, though. How do we get from 1s and 0s becoming 6 through math to \"computer do this\"? How does the transition work?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","373":"Explainer: The CPU is designed so that if you feed it certain \"numbers\" (the binary numbers are just for human usability - it's all just a series of electrical signals to the CPU) it will perform certain operations. Some of those operations expect additional numbers to be input as part of the instruction (usually, addresses of memory that contain the data). This is all just based on the complex physical arrangement of the transistors and other components within the CPU.  We have a lookup table of what numbers represent what instructions. It's called an **instruction set**. A popular one is x86, which you can read about [here](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/X86_instruction_listings#Original_8086\/8088_instructions).\nExplainee: &gt;it will perform certain operations  How does it do that?

The highest month is usually February) is lower than 2019-20.  Again, the reason is because of our precautions to covid are very effective at keeping flu number down. Influenza isn't usually a big deal, so we never go to great lengths to stop it. While Covid is very contagious, and Can result in hospitalization (influenza can too). The reason that we have been so precautious with Covid is because so many hospitals are at above 100% capacity. That was the entire point of flattening the curve, to keep the numbers at a more manageable rate for a long period of time. But people have let up on the precautions because everyone is understandably sick of the isolation\nExplainee: I am comparing the 2019 - 2020 flu season which ended about a month ago according to Canada.ca, to the 2018 - 2019 flu season.

Australia, South Africa, and Argentina and Chile aren't as cold as Canada or Russia).   Anyway, no, I don't think it would just go away like that. You say there's 47 reported cases in Canada, but that doesn't mean it's not in other countries, and it doesn't mean that people aren't slightly sick or asymptomatic and not going to doctors.\nExplainee: How does it travel with the winter?

The added complexity *in some contexts* clearly makes life more able to sustain itself, otherwise it wouldn't evolve. In places where it is not useful, it does not evolve. This is why viruses are simple - they don't benefit from added complexity.  As for exactly how they work, they take advantage of the complexity in their hosts. The complicated things like growing and protecting oneself and getting food and reproducing are all handled by the host cell. *Somebody* has to do those things, and the virus simply allows the host cell to do them. Viruses don't even really understand how to make more viruses - they simply turn themselves over to the advanced machinery of the host and allow the host to use its own 'knowledge' of replication to make more virus.\nExplainee: I get that viruses are simple because they dont benefit from added complexity, but I mean in terms of chemistry even viruses are incredibly complex compared to the elements on the periodic table.

Too much damage to cellular structures can cause the cell to destroy itself, as can too much damage to DNA. This is why bad sunburn causes skin to peel off, the epidermal and dermal layers received enough damage to decide they need to kill themselves for the greater good. However, if DNA is damaged in certain ways, it can lead to cancer. It's not that DNA can't be repaired at all, it's that it is the \"master program\" for the cell and can be modified in ways that make the cell do things that it isn't supposed to.   You can also receive too much damage to important cells like in organs. It's actually therapeutic in some situations, such as using radioactive iodine to destroy some of a large thyroid, but many organs are not good at regenerating so the damage can hamper their functionality.\nExplainee: Never really thought about it that way.

tachometer is a gauge in a vehicle that measures engine speed, typically in revolutions per minute (RPM). It's useful for drivers, especially during high-performance driving or when tuning engines. Knowing the RPMs helps maintain the engine at an optimal range for efficiency and longevity, preventing unnecessary wear and promoting smooth operation. It's essential for manual transmission vehicles because shifting timing depends on RPMs, but even automatic vehicles can benefit from having RPM visibility.","1":"Well, your instructor might have a different approach to engine braking compared to what I was taught. I was advised to avoid skipping gears as it can cause damage to the transmission if not done properly. It's good to research and learn from multiple sources to have a well-rounded understanding.","2":"Skipping gears is not technically wrong, and it's unlikely to cause significant damage to your car. However, it can lead to inefficient driving and increased wear on components over time. But the primary concerns arise when you are in the wrong gear while driving at high speeds or when you are not smooth about it.","3":"It's not about personal validation for me.","4":"Water gets wasted when it is used more than necessary for its intended use or when it is misused. For example, leaving a tap running unnecessarily, watering plants during rainy season, or over-irrigation in agriculture can be considered wastage of water.","5":"Yes, there is space around all your organs. This space is called the 'body cavity' (or 'body cavities', plural) and they are filled with a fluid called 'cavitary fluid' (or 'peritoneal fluid' if it's the abdomen cavity in particular). This fluid helps in reducing friction between organs, and also acts as a cushion against shocks. There might also be air present in some cavities, especially in the lungs and the gastrointestinal tract.","6":"It's not a rule set in stone, but cultural norms and traditional expectations often play a role in professional settings. Afros may be seen as less conventional or formal, which can potentially affect perceptions about a person's work ethic, seriousness, or level of professionalism. Additionally, it's essential to consider the specific industry and company culture that one is working in.","7":"No, it doesn't mean business isn't the right career for you. It just means that you might need to find a balance between the dependable demeanor that is often expected in business and your bold and innovative personality. You can still show authenticity and originality while maintaining professionalism.","8":"Tachometers, also called rev counters, show the engine's RPM (revolutions per minute). The RPM is a measure of how fast an engine is running during acceleration. A tachometer helps drivers avoid over-revving the engine, which can cause damage. It's especially useful when driving manual cars to maintain speed without over straining the engine.","9":"Well, looking at the RPM can help avoid stalling the engine, over or under-revving, and ensure a smooth transition between gears. It's a good practice, especially for beginners, to develop a sense of how the engine behaves at different RPMs. However, it's great to hear that you've gained such proficiency in driving manual transmissions and maintaining your cars. Nonetheless, having an awareness of the RPM can still be beneficial for consistent and efficient driving.","10":"Well, human puberty is a complex process, involving not just physical but also social and psychological changes. One of the reasons is that human offspring have a long gestation period and high dependency on parents. This delayed onset of reproduction gives the human brain more time to develop, which is crucial for complex decision-making and social interactions. For other mammals, where offspring are less dependent, early reproduction can be beneficial.","11":"Your explanation is correct. However, when you used the term 'biology', I was expecting to hear more about the scientific study of living organisms. In your explanation, you included definitions that are related to the field of biology but not directly the scientific study of it. For example, 'the plants and animals of a particular area' or 'the physiology, behavior, and other qualities of a particular organism or class of organisms' are more specific biological domains rather than biology itself.","12":"I agree that your question is still rooted in biology, but the reason that humans don't have children immediately after reaching puberty is not solely a biological one. It also involves social and cultural factors, which contribute to the delay. For instance, societal norms, education, and economic stability play a significant role in when people decide to start a family.","13":"So you're suggesting that the answers you received, which were primarily based on social factors, were the ones you found most convincing? I'm sorry, but that seems counterintuitive. A question about biological maturity in humans and animals should primarily focus on biological factors, not social ones. Even if the question was framed non-biologically, the core of the question was still rooted in biology. If I may use an analogy, it's like asking the economic reasons for the earth rotating around the sun. The earth's rotation is a physical phenomenon, not an economic one, and the economic factors are irrelevant in this case. It sounds like your focus shifted away from the biological aspect during the discussion. Regardless, I'm done repeating the same points. I hope this helps you understand the issue.","14":"Universal income is a form of social security in which all citizens receive a certain amount of money regularly, regardless of whether they have a job or not. This is intended to cover their basic needs. As for your question about preventing companies from raising prices, it's a complex issue. Generally, governments can enforce price controls or regulations to prevent excessive price increases, but these can have unintended consequences such as limiting economic growth. Often, competition within industries also helps prevent price gouging. If one company raises its prices too high, customers may choose to go to another company, which keeps prices in check.","15":"Because substances with lower boiling points are gases or liquids at room temperature. To use them efficiently, we would need to compress them, which requires energy. Moreover, once the gas is expanded, it cools down quickly, reducing its efficiency. This is why we often use liquids with higher boiling points, like water, for large-scale power generation, as they can be heated and expanded efficiently.","16":"I apologize for any confusion, but you're correct in a sense. The turbine does extract kinetic energy from the moving gas, but the kinetic energy of the gas molecules is directly related to their temperature. Hotter gases move faster, as per the ideal gas law. So, even though the pressure is held constant, the faster moving hotter gas molecules can impart more kinetic energy to the turbine blades, meaning more energy can be extracted through the process of converting kinetic energy to electricity.","17":"The nickname 'Noble Gases' originates from the fact that these elements are the most stable and unreactive in the periodic table. They are reluctant to enter into chemical reactions, much like the nobility in the olden days who wouldn't perform physical labor. They were considered 'above' participating in everyday reactions.","18":"Protons in the nucleus are quite packed and they follow the pattern of filling electron energy levels as they increase. The nucleus becomes more unstable as it takes more protons and it's not very likely for a new row of 98 protons to be discovered or created. So, it's not expected there would be a 9th row in the periodic table.","19":"My statement is based on the current understanding and observations of the periodic table. As elements in a row are added, the atomic mass and decay rate are expected to increase. The last elements in the 7th row have already decayed within fractions of seconds. Since the 8th row has 50 elements to fill up, and no new element of the 8th row has been discovered, it's highly likely that the properties of elements in the 8th and 9th row would be too unstable for practical applications or existence.","20":"I mean, if you want to live in a conspiracy theory world, go ahead. I'm just trying to say that it's important to rely on facts and evidence, not fear and sensationalism.","21":"For reference, 'influenza' refers to the common flu. In the earlier months of 2020, there were reports of a new coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, that led to a pandemic. Due to this pandemic, governments and public health organizations worldwide implemented lockdowns and other social distancing measures. These measures significantly reduced the spread of viruses like influenza because people were more isolated and less inclined to catch or transmit the flu.","22":"Unfortunately, no, even if there are only 47 sick with it now, we cannot make the flu disappear forever. It's a virus that occurs in birds and animals, and it is carried from them to humans. The flu is easily spread from person to person, and it's difficult to completely eradicate it. We can only reduce its transmission and lessen its impact on the population through vaccination, hygiene and other preventive measures.","23":"The term influenza does not refer to a specific location. Instead, it is a type of viral infection. In 2020, the world was mainly focused on the COVID-19 pandemic, but influenza continued to circulate as it usually does seasonally. However, due to mitigation measures put in place to combat COVID-19, such as social distancing and wearing masks, influenza cases were significantly lower than in previous years.","24":"The reason we are seeing fewer influenza cases is likely because of a combination of factors. First, the measures we're taking to slow the spread of COVID-19, such as social distancing and mask wearing, also reduce the likelihood of influenza transmission. Second, we're more aware and vigilant about cleaning and hand washing these days, which provides additional protection against the flu. However, it is important to note that while these measures help limit the spread of respiratory illnesses, the transmission mechanisms, virulence, and preventive measures are different between influenza and COVID-19.","25":"Sure, I will answer your question now.  Coronaviruses and Influenza viruses have different reproductive rates. The basic reproductive number (R0) of coronaviruses can range from 2 to 6, while the R0 of Influenza viruses is generally estimated to be between 1 to 3. This means that on average, each person infected with coronavirus can infect 2 to 6 others within the same time period, while each person infected with Influenza can infect 1 to 3 others.","26":null,"27":"A hypothetical example would be the presence of gravitational waves that were initially only observed through their impact on more easily perceivable phenomena like light, but not directly perceived themselves. They were inferred to exist based on the scientific predictions and subsequent evidence gathered.","28":"Agreed. However, it's crucial to understand that trust in science means acknowledging its fallibility and willingness to revise or correct findings based on new evidence. Believing in scientific theories doesn't mean disregarding common sense or questioning the potential for unexpected findings. Rather, it's accepting the consensus of the scientific community till a new finding is presented and evaluated through the scientific method. This distinction is important when dealing with anti-science movements that aim to discredit science or promote falsehoods as a result of a fundamental misunderstanding of its nature.","29":"and I donate to a LGBT+ charity on your behalf as well.","30":"Exactly. DNA molecules are made up of a long chain of nucleotides, and when a high-energy photon or particle from radiation strikes these molecules, it can cause breaks in the chain or changes in the structure of the nucleotides. These damages can lead to errors during cell division, potentially causing mutations in the DNA that can disrupt the normal functions of the cell or even lead to cancer if not repaired correctly.","31":"Exactly! By sacrificing themselves, the affected skin cells are preventing potential damage that could ultimately lead to cancerous growths. This is an example of programmed cell death, or apoptosis, which is an essential mechanism for maintaining tissue health and preventing uncontrolled cell growth.","32":"Well, technically it is a game, but it is called a sport due to its competitive nature, physical requirements and organized structure.","33":"A game, however, isn't just about physical exertion and skill, but it also includes elements of strategy, rules, and scoring. Hockey, like other team sports, combines all these aspects and hence, it indeed falls under the category of sports. While there may be instances where points are scored, the primary focus of the game remains the application of skill and physical strength to outplay the opponent, which aligns with the essence of a sport.","34":"In music, 'off'ness' is an term used to describe notes that are not perfectly in sync or in tune with each other. In the case of triplets, since they are played closer together than regular notes, any deviation from perfect synchronicity is more noticeable. This 'off'ness can be caused by a variety of factors such as human error, instrument tuning, or timing issues.","35":"Well, puberty can be an intimidating phase, and the reason schools might not cover every aspect is that they want to focus on the biology and physiology rather than the cosmetic aspects. Each person develops differently and at their own pace. As for the hair growth, it's primarily influenced by hormones like testosterone. Some boys might have a lot of hair, while others might not have much. It's perfectly normal for both situations. You don't need to worry about it. If you have any specific questions, feel free to ask.","36":"Girls start puberty earlier than boys, which means they have more time to experience changes such as menstruation, breast development, and changes in their hips. Boys also go through changes like voice deepening and facial hair growth, but these tend to be more gradual. Additionally, there are hormonal differences between men and women that affect how the body develops during puberty. Even though boys may not face as many physical changes, it doesn't mean that their experiences during puberty are any less complicated. Everyone's body reacts differently, and it's important for both boys and girls to understand their bodies and what to expect as they grow.","37":"Oversleeping or getting poor quality sleep can lead to feelings of grogginess and fatigue. This is due to the disruption of your body's natural sleep cycle, also known as the circadian rhythm. If you sleep for extended periods, your body may not complete all the stages of sleep properly. This can result in a lack of REM (Rapid Eye Movement) sleep, which is important for feeling rested. Additionally, oversleeping can cause daytime sleepiness, making it difficult to feel fully awake and alert even after extended periods of sleep.","38":"It's a very common concern, don't worry. You can start by talking to your primary care physician about your concerns. They can refer you to a mental health professional if necessary. Remember, it's important to take care of your mind just as much as your body.","39":"Boiling a sponge doesn't work because it's made of cellulose which is a natural material that can't be completely sterilized by boiling water. Although it might kill some bacteria, it won't kill all of them. The fibers of the sponge trap water, which creates the perfect environment for bacteria to thrive once the sponge cools down.","40":"I'm not sure I follow your logic here. I was simply expressing my opinion based on my personal beliefs, and you're accusing me of hypocrisy. If you have evidence that I've spent extra money, I'd be glad to hear it.","41":"Because of their stable electron configuration (helium, neon, argon, krypton, xenon, radon) - they do not form chemical compounds easily. The name 'Noble Gases' was given to reflect this and not to make any direct reference to the nobility (aristocrats). They were historically considered lesser known than other gases (a reference to the rarity) and thus the name arose from there as well.","42":null,"43":"I understand your question. It's true that it's theoretically possible they did get the quantities right, but there are reasons to believe they didn't. Firstly, the fact that Heisenberg himself admitted his mistake in the calculations. Secondly, Heisenberg admitted that they lacked the essential theoretical understanding for a bomb and didn't fully comprehend the necessary critical mass. Thirdly, they didn't have the resources or the infrastructure to produce enough uranium or plutonium for a bomb. Lastly, the uranium they had was of lower purity than what was needed, making it even more unlikely that they could have created a bomb with the quantities they had.","44":"Walmart is a private company, and as such, it has the legal right to determine whether or not it will recognize a union. The decision to recognize a union is up to the company, and it is not required to do so by law. Additionally, Walmart has a history of actively opposing unionization efforts by its employees.","45":"but if it was a song that bothers me, I'd have to sing it multiple times to make sure it gets unstuck from my mind, sometimes it works sometimes it doesn't.","46":"Explainer: I just use a streaming service like Spotify or Deezer to play the song, but if you don't have an account, just search for the song on YouTube and make sure to play it until it gets out of your head.","47":"Investment banking is a specific type of financial service providing services to companies, governments and other institutions in regard to their financial situation. It encompasses underwriting or acting as the client's agent in the sale or purchase of securities or other financial instruments, as well as giving advice on mergers and acquisitions, capital structure, corporate finance, and public and private financings.","48":"The Earth's rotational axis is tilted approximately 23.5 degrees relative to its orbital plane around the sun. This tilt causes the Sun to be more directly overhead during the summer solstice in the Northern Hemisphere, leading to longer days and a more intense summer sun. Conversely, during the southern hemisphere's winter solstice, the Sun is more directly overhead in the Antarctic circle, which is permanently covered in ice and inhospitable to human habitation. This explains why more land (and therefore more opportunities for human settlement and development) is found in the Northern Hemisphere.","49":"Most theories about supercontinents suggest that Pangea was not a one-off event, but just part of a repeating cycle. In fact, the cycle is thought to have happened several times in the Earth's history. These supercontinents are given names like Rodinia, Gondwana, and the hypothesised future supercontinents you mentioned - Novopangea, Pangea Proxima\/Ultima, Aurica, and Amasia.","50":"But the continents have moved a lot more than people think. For example, the Atlantic ocean is still widening today at around 2.5 cm a year, and the continents are moving around a couple of centimeters every year.","51":null,"52":"Yes, that's correct. Historically, regulations can be imposed by governments for various reasons, some of which may not align with a traditional left-wing ideology. For instance, deregulation might favor business interests over workers' rights, as in the case you mentioned with labor unions. However, it's important to remember that ideologies often evolve and shift, and current-day left-wing ideologies might approach regulation differently.","53":"It seems like your experience is subjective and unique to you. While it's true that most people feel their thoughts and consciousness are tied to their brain, it's important to remember that everyone's perception and interpretation of their own consciousness can vary. In the context of the conversation, one possible response could be: 'Interesting perspective. It's possible that the experience you're describing may be related to a sense of the self that transcends the physical realm, as you mentioned. However, from a scientific perspective, it's challenging to study or explain such experiences since they don't conform to our current understanding of the relationship between the mind and the brain.'","54":"The changes happen because different parts of the brain are responsible for different aspects of consciousness. When a surgery or any other intervention alters the physical structure of the brain, it affects these areas and, as a result, changes how consciousness feels.","55":"A tachometer measures the rotational speed of an engine's crankshaft in revolutions per minute (RPM). It helps drivers to understand the engine's power output and to avoid damaging the engine by running at dangerously high RPMs. By watching the tachometer, a driver can ensure the engine is running at an optimal speed for the conditions, such as when accelerating, cruising, or decelerating.","56":" Corporations can produce these 'house brands' as they often have manufacturing relationships with other companies. The key ingredients and formula are often identical, or very similar, to more expensive brands. However, they can be cheaper because they don't spend as much on marketing and advertising as big brand names. Also, Walmart, for example, can sell their own brand (Equate in this case) when the demand for Head & Shoulders is there, but at a lower price because Walmart isn't paying for Head & Shoulders' branding.","57":"Evolutionary biologists believe that this is due to a process called 'delayed maturity.' This is a survival strategy that allows humans to accumulate resources before starting a family. It allows for better care of offspring, improving their chances of survival in the face of challenges like predators, harsh weather, and competition for food. Other animals may have different evolutionary pressures that lead to different reproductive strategies.","58":"You're correct that the biological aspect is important, but the question was asking about societal reasons, not biological reasons as to why humans don't have children right after puberty. The six or seven people you know who've told you 'yes' were likely referring to societal norms, not biological factors.","59":"Selenelion eclipse occurs when the Earth, Moon, and Sun are perfectly aligned, with the Earth in between. When the Moon is setting in the west, it is actually moving below the Earth's shadow (umbra). However, the sunlight refracting through the Earth's atmosphere can bend and illuminate the top of the Moon, creating the appearance of a shadow on the topside of the Moon.","60":"It was initially considered immoral and against societal norms, contributing to the stigmatization of sex work.","61":null,"62":"For each pixel, the RGB values are usually stored in a 32-bit word format, where each of the 8 bits in the word corresponds to the red, green, and blue components, respectively. When the video card sends a frame to the monitor, it divides each frame into tens of thousands of such 32-bit words. The number of transistors required for this would depend on the architecture of the video card and the monitor, but it would likely be in the millions since each pixel would require at least 3 transistors (one for each RGB component) and there are usually millions to billions of pixels in a single frame.","63":"In analog systems, the output signal of a transistor is continuous and has a range of values, including small or zero values. However, in digital systems, the output of a transistor is in two discrete states, on and off. The on state, also known as saturation, is a strong state where the transistor is almost fully conducting. So, unlike in analog systems where the output signal might not be able to max out the gate of another transistor due to the continuous and often lower values, in digital systems the on state of a transistor can potentially provide enough charge to fully turn on the gate of another, if the transistors are connected properly.","64":"Analog signals can represent a continuous range of values instead of just binary 1s and 0s. This is achieved through the use of varying voltage levels or other physical quantities like position, pressure, temperature, etc. For example, in audio, an analog signal might represent vibrations of a diaphragm in a microphone, and this continuous waveform can be varied based on the intensity and frequency of the sound. These signals can then be amplified, filtered, or otherwise processed before being transformed into a digital signal for further processing or transmission.","65":"The sun emits light in all directions, and the Earth blocks most of the light from reaching areas beyond it. When we send a shuttle into space, it is moving away from the Earth and the light emitted by the sun that reaches the Earth cannot reach the shuttle directly. Also, space is a vacuum, so there isn't any atmosphere or particles to scatter the light like on Earth, making it appear dark.","66":"Yes, exactly. It is both very dark (a) because it absorbs almost all the light (b) that falls on it, which means that it does not reflect or transmit any significant amount of light back, hence our eyes and brain perceive it as black, but it is not actually emitting any black light. This is how vantablack appears 'blacker than black' to our eyes.","67":"While it is true that gold can be synthesized in a particle accelerator or nuclear reactor, the methods alchemists were using were not based on scientific knowledge at the time and were not practical. The gold created in these processes is not the same as the gold we know and the methods are costly and require sophisticated equipment. The gold alchemists were trying to create was a symbolic representation of spiritual and philosophical transmutation, not the physical transmutation that modern science can now achieve.","68":"Well, using counterfeit currency for profit is indeed illegal and severely punishable. But, the argument for gold-backed currency sometimes goes beyond just profit. Some people argue that it provides a stable value for money, unlike fiat currency, which can be subject to inflation. That's because the supply of gold is relatively fixed, unlike the supply of fiat currency which can be increased as needed by a central bank. A return to the gold standard would also eliminate the need for central banks and hence, reduce the possibility of politicization of monetary policy. As for your historical reference, the Free Silver Party was indeed a political party in the late 19th century United States that advocated for the resumption of silver coinage at a ratio of 16:1 with gold, in effect expanding the money supply and promoting inflation. Lastly, counterfeiting can indeed be challenging and risky, especially with the advancement of technology. However, it's important to remember that such activities are unethical and illegal.","69":"Your proposal to flood the world with gold would actually increase its value due to supply and demand. If gold is abundant, people would not view it as scarce or valuable, and it would be devalued. On the other hand, flooding the world with useful and pleasing materials such as food, medicine, clothing, construction materials, shelter, etc. would lead to a 'post-scarcity' society where these items become common and lose value.","70":"You can obtain a doctor by registering with a local healthcare provider. They provide regular check-ups and can give you advice on immunizations for diseases such as measles and chicken pox.","71":"Because it is said to be associated with electromagnetic phenomena that are beyond the range of human perception, which have been reported to cause strange feelings or sensations. The term 'Ghost Frequency' comes from the idea that these phenomena are similar to or associated with paranormal activities, giving it a spooky or mysterious connotation.","72":"There's actually more water on Earth than we might think, but most of it is saltwater in the oceans, which we can't drink. However, human activities like using more water than we need for everyday purposes or not properly managing our agriculture and industry can lead to wasting fresh water, which is essential for life. This can also lead to water scarcity in some regions.","73":"They are making money because even though the plane is empty, they are still covering essential operating costs like fuel and salaries for the crew, which they are recovering from other full flights. In addition, they have already made money from the passengers who bought tickets for the original flight that would have flown with the plane from its origin to ATL. After dropping off passengers in ATL, the plane would likely pick up new passengers for the next leg of its journey to MCN, hence generating more revenue.","74":"The way you've described it, they might be making money according to the tickets they've already sold. However, when they sell tickets below operational costs, they are losing money in the long run. Failing to maximize earning opportunities can still be detrimental to the overall financial health of the airline.","75":"Basically, a period, in a general context, refers to a full cycle of fluctuation in a variable, typically representing a complete stage in a recurring event or process. For instance, the menstrual cycle in females is a periodic phenomenon. In the context of waves, the period refers to the time taken for one complete cycle of the wave to come and go. Specifically, in physics, the period is the time interval from the crest of one wave to the crest of the next or from the trough of one wave to the trough of the next. For oscillations, it's the time taken for the oscillating object to complete one full cycle.","76":"It's actually not part of the urinary system. The female reproductive system includes the uterus, ovaries, fallopian tubes, vagina and external sex organs. The vagina serves as a birth canal during childbirth and receives the sperm during sexual intercourse. During pregnancy, the growing fetus resides in the uterus, and the expanding uterus puts increasing pressure on the bladder, causing frequent urination. The link I provided earlier explains this in detail.","77":"Fortunately, most communities have health clinics for people who don't have personal doctors. You could also check with local health centers or online telemedicine platforms.","78":"The 'off'ness refers to the slight discrepancies in the timing of the notes played by the triplets. While the notes are indicated in the score to be played together, due to the biological quirks in the brain and nervous system, each triplet generally doesn't start playing the notes exactly at the same time. This minor mismatch in timing is what we perceive as the 'off'ness.","79":"But maintaining the pasture, fending off predators, milking them, and producing milk products like cheese and yogurt is also a significant effort.","80":"Tanning is often seen as a way for white people to enhance their natural complexion, to look more 'healthy', or to appear more attractive, while skin bleaching or lightening by non-white individuals is often associated with wanting to look more like the dominant white culture, which can be seen as devaluing one's own culture and heritage and promoting a harmful beauty standard.","81":"While it's understandable to feel inclined towards choosing certain aesthetic decisions, it's important to understand the historical and cultural connotations associated with it, especially when it comes to skin color. Ascribing light skin as more desirable has roots deeply embedded in the history of racism, especially in contexts like the fashion industry. This historical background is vital to consider when making personal decisions about appearance, as it helps one avoid unintentionally perpetuating biases and stereotypes. As such, I would encourage a thoughtful examination of these issues and a considerate approach to one's self-expression.","82":"A computer doesn't learn in the same way humans do. It's programmed with instructions written in a programming language. These instructions tell the computer what to do. In the context of learning computing steps, we're typically talking about machine learning algorithms. These algorithms use data to help the computer make predictions, classifications, or decisions without being explicitly programmed for each specific output. For example, a computer might learn to recognize cats in pictures by being shown thousands of pictures and being taught what a cat looks like. This process is called training.","83":"After receiving an instruction, the CPU fetches the next instruction and decodes it. This tells it what operation to perform and where to perform it (by using addresses in memory). This decoding and address calculation happens in a unit called the instruction decoder. The operation code and operand addresses are used to manipulate the data as required. In the case of the number 6, it might be used to do a simple arithmetic operation or be used as an address to load data or store data.","84":"The transistor changes its state (ON\/OFF) based on the input it receives. The change in state will change the output of the logical function the transistor is a part of, which will in turn dictate what the CPU does next.","85":"A program (or specific part of a program) instructs the computer to draw a certain amount of pixels, based on the output (8 in this case). For example, the program might say to draw 8 small squares, or 8 large ones, or one large square and 7 small ones. The number doesn't have to represent pixels directly, it's just a value that the program uses to control how many pixels are drawn.","86":null,"87":"However, if we look at it from the perspective of an attacker, it might still be an effective strategy. They can use automation and AI to targeted attacks, reducing the effort required to a manageable level. From a security standpoint, it's important to be prepared for such targeted attacks, even if they seem unlikely.","88":"But harvesting every single square foot of land would require tremendous resources and infrastructure, and it would likely be more harmful to the environment than the methane emissions from the cows. Furthermore, vacuuming up methane as it's released isn't a practical solution, as it would require constant monitoring and could be expensive and energy intensive. Additionally, cows produce more than just methane, and eliminating them would have other environmental consequences. This is why many experts are focusing on mitigation strategies rather than elimination.","89":"Cleaning water to make it safe for consumption is a costly and energy-intensive process. The methods used to clean water require extensive infrastructure such as treatment plants, and a significant amount of energy, which in turn generates greenhouse gas emissions. It's also important to note that not all water can be cleaned and made safe for consumption. Some contaminants like heavy metals can't be removed through conventional methods. Moreover, the water we clean and use is eventually returned to the environment, where it may pollute rivers, lakes, and groundwater if not properly treated.","90":"Yes, you make a good point. It is a challenge, but investing in water infrastructure could potentially save more lives in the long run. It is a matter of prioritizing resources and recognizing the importance of clean water access for everyone.","91":"But Sean Carroll is a contemporary physicist. His work on cosmology and the theory of dark matter and dark energy is based on observational evidence and modern physics. Unlike Newton, he didn't rely on empirical observations and theories that were widely accepted in his time but have since been proven incorrect. It is indeed important to question assumptions and theories, but let's not dismiss credible scientific work without solid evidence or a better alternative theory.","92":"When you book a round-trip flight with multiple legs, you are typically purchasing a ticket for each individual segment. However, in a hidden city ticketing strategy, you deliberately choose a layover city as your final destination, instead of your intended city. This is because the layover city's ticket might be cheaper than the ticket for the direct flight to your destination. The idea is that you discard the return flight portion and travel from your final destination (the layover city) back home at your own expense, using a different airline or mode of transportation.","93":"Meanwhile, a plane full of people that actually wanted to go to Macon weren't able to buy tickets because it said the plane was full, so they've also lost all of that revenue.","94":"It didn't go anywhere. However, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, a lot of precautions were taken worldwide, leading to significantly reduced seasonal flu activity.","95":"I apologize for the confusion. Let me clarify that Coronaviruses and Influenza viruses have different structures, gene sequences, and transmission modes, so misinformation about one doesn't necessarily apply to the other. Now, let's proceed with your question.","96":"In the United States Constitution, there is no maximum age limit for presidential candidates, as it doesn't specify an upper age limit. However, the minimum age for presidential candidates is 35 years old, as per the 22nd Amendment which limits the number of terms a president can serve to two.","97":"Yes, according to US federal law, Walmart can hold anti-union meetings, present false information about unions, and use the vote count to challenge the union even after a majority vote of employees has been secured.","98":"They could still review and deny it if they determine it to be a union in all but name. In such a case, they may argue that the proposed 'pro-associate benefits group' is functionally equivalent to a union and falls under the same labor laws. If they do so, and if you and your co-workers continue pushing forward with this proposal, the company may take similar actions to those they would take if you were organizing a union, including discouraging or preventing the formation of such a group during work hours and on their property.","99":"A single store can unionize. However, it's common for unions to organize multiple stores under a single umbrella. In addition, your statement about needing people equal to the population of New Hampshire and Vermonia to sign is not accurate. The number of signatures required varies based on the number of employees, among other factors.","100":"But the equal pay demand is made for equal jobs, not for unequal outcomes.","101":"The sun, Earth, and moon are aligned in such a way that the Earth's umbra (the darkest part of its shadow) is casting its shadow onto the moon, even though the moon is setting. This rare alignment creates a selenelion eclipse, where the Earth's shadow appears on the topside of the moon as it sets over the horizon.","102":"However, the moon is about 400 times smaller than the Earth and it orbits the Earth from a distance of approximately 385,000 kilometers. This means that the Moon doesn't have a full circular shadow, but instead a partial one. The part of the Moon that we see is illuminated by the sun, while the part in shadow is dark. Since the Moon is not on an exact line with the Earth and Sun, the sun and the lunar shadow do not necessarily fall on opposite sides of the Moon, but can appear on the same side. This is what is referred to as a crescent moon.","103":"No, you cannot see the moon from any point on the sunset ring at this time. When the sun is below the horizon, the sky is too dark to see the moon. Since the sun and the moon are almost always on the same hemisphere at any given point in time, they cannot be seen simultaneously from the sunset ring.","104":"because it is often considered as informal and not suitable for a professional image, as it may send a message that the individual is not serious or not willing to adapt to the corporate norms.","105":"Perhaps not, but it is important to remember that being reliable and trustworthy doesn't mean you can't be innovative. You can find a way to communicate your unique qualities while also demonstrating reliability.","106":"Neurons communicate using electrical signals (actions potentials) that spread from one neuron to another. This forms a neural network. When an action potential reaches a neuron's dendrites, if it crosses a specific threshold, it triggers an impulse in the neuron's axon and sends a new action potential along the axon towards other neurons. This forms a chain of impulses, or a neural pathway. These pathways connect various regions of the brain, each responsible for certain functions like sensory processing, motor control, emotions, etc. When multiple neural pathways are activated, we experience a conscious thought. This is a complex process we are still trying to understand fully.","107":"Well, while we may not have a definitive explanation for the origin of thoughts, we do have a number of theories based on empirical evidence that suggest they originate from the interactions of neurons in the brain. These theories can't fully explain everything we observe, but they provide a solid foundation for understanding thought processes. As for spiritual realms or non-physical existence, there's currently no empirical evidence to support their role in the formation of thoughts.","108":null,"109":"It follows the instruction set and the instruction it received is associated with the action of performing an operation on the received number.

Selling them over-the-counter would make it more accessible, and more likely that they will be misused. Thus, to minimize such potential problems, they are only available with a prescription from a doctor.","112":"Bacteriophages can be isolated from a variety of environments, such as soil, water, or even from an infected patient. The process involves enrichment, which means growing the specific bacteria and collecting the phages that are able to infect them. As for the question why we aren't investing more time and resources into bacteriophages, there are several reasons. One reason is that antibiotics have been a quicker and more practical solution for treating bacterial infections in the past. Another reason is that the regulatory process for approving bacteriophages as a medicine is complex and expensive. Additionally, while bacteriophages are effective against many strains of bacteria, they can become less effective as resistance can develop in the bacteria, similar to how bacteria can become resistant to antibiotics.","113":"They offer the potential for long-term capital appreciation, as opposed to immediate income from dividends. Owners of non-dividend shares can sell their shares for a profit if the company grows in value.","114":"That's true. Wholesalers, unlike stocks, represent tangible assets. You buy a product, for example, and own it, unlike stocks where you own a piece of the company's future profits. The difference can be significant, especially in terms of control and financial management.","115":"For example, if you have a length of 5 meters and you want to find out how long a side of a square would be if all the sides were the same length as your 5 meters, you would take the length (5), square it (5*5), and you get 25 square meters. This gives you the area of a square with a side length of 5 meters. Inversely, if you know the area of a square (like a piece of paper) and want to find out the side length, you find the square root of the area (sqrt(25)) to get 5.","116":"In computing, the Halting Problem is a problem introduced by computer scientist Alan Turing to demonstrate that certain computational problems cannot be solved by a Turing machine or any other algorithmic method. The Halting Problem states that there can be no effective algorithm to determine whether a given Turing machine or program will halt or run infinitely for a given input. The Self-Referential Proof is a way to show the existence of a diagonal halting problem to prove that the Halting Problem is unsolvable. This means that for every algorithm we try to solve the Halting Problem, we can construct another example that fools it.","117":"I didn't realize I was being so harsh. I apologize if I came off that way.","118":"The deleterious effects of desalination on the environment are numerous. The process consumes a large amount of energy, which contributes to greenhouse gas emissions. This is due to the high pressure needed to separate salt water molecules, and the use of thermal or mechanical means for desalination. Furthermore, desalination plants discharge the brine, which is a highly concentrated solution, back into the ocean. This can have harmful effects on marine life, as the high salt content is detrimental to many organisms. Additionally, the construction of desalination plants can disrupt coastal ecosystems and cause sedimentation issues. Lastly, desalination is an expensive process, which makes it inaccessible to many places, especially developing countries, where access to clean water is a pressing issue.","119":"You seem to be having a personal vendetta against them. If you have a problem with someone's argument, argue with them logically instead of making personal attacks. Let's keep this conversation professional and focused on finding solutions.","120":"Abortion is a controversial topic, primarily revolving around the question of when a fetus becomes a 'person' with rights and when a woman's right to control her own body should take precedence. Pro-choice advocates argue that a woman should have the right to choose whether to terminate a pregnancy, citing reasons like rape, incest, fetal abnormalities, or for health reasons. On the other hand, pro-life advocates argue that a fetus is a human life from the moment of conception, and that it should be protected regardless of the circumstances. The debate is complex, with arguments on both sides drawing on moral, ethical, religious, and legal considerations.","121":"No, I'm referring to your behavior in this situation.","122":"It means to argue for or suggest an opposing view, often as a way to critically evaluate an idea or to look at all perspectives before making a decision.","123":"No, it doesn't mean that the Devil's point is always wrong or that the Devil's advocate is arguing for the Devil's point of view. The Devil's advocate's role is to question and challenge the validity of the proposal, so the decision makers can ensure they are making an informed, well-balanced decision.","124":"Yes, exactly. Analog is a continuous signal, unlike digital, where the signal levels can only be discrete (1 or 0). In an analog signal, you can have any voltage level between a maximum and minimum value, representing a range of values, not just binary (1 or 0).","125":"The Halting Problem states that there can be no algorithm that takes any program or function as an input and determines with certainty whether the program will eventually halt. This is because a self-referential program can be designed that, when given as its own input, will only halt if it doesn't halt when given its own input (hence, it doesn't halt), and will never halt if it does halt when given its own input (hence, it halts). This paradox is known as the Self-Referential Proof.","126":"P is a recursive program, defined as follows: P(x) = M(P, x, x-1) if x > 0, and P(0) = M(P, 0, 1). Given a program Q and a natural number n, P(n) tells us whether or not Q halts on input n. The layers you're referring to are because P is recursively calling itself. To determine P(n), P calls M with itself as the program, n as the input, and n - 1 as the second input (if n > 0). If n = 0, P(0) calls M with itself as the program, 0 as the input, and 1 as the second input. This recursive nature makes P a bit more complex than M, but understanding it is essential for understanding S, the halting problem.","127":null,"128":"I understand your concerns, but it's important to note that in this scenario, the perfect decider doesn't 'change its answer' in the traditional sense. It's a hypothetical construct that evaluates both programs simultaneously. So, it doesn't have a previous answer to change. Rather, it produces an outcome that is consistent with the actions of both programs, regardless of which one 'moves last'.","129":"The 'no true Scotsman' is considered a fallacy because it's an attempt to withdraw a general comment from a class, based on the characteristics of a member of that class, by invoking stereotypical properties of the class and then denying that the actual member in question belongs to it.","130":"Interpersonal communication requires at least two individuals exchanging ideas, opinions, or information. In debate, this exchange is characterized by a clear purpose, often to persuade the other party, and the structure of logical reasoning is crucial. Here, even though your conception is personal, you engage in communication with others to potentially influence their perspective and provide them with your insights.","131":" Walmart, as a private company, has the right to decide whether or not to form a union. They can deny unionization by convincing their employees not to unionize, contesting union elections, or negotiating in a way that is unfavorable to the union.","132":"They could still deny it, as the intention and purpose of such a proposal is essentially the same as a union, which they may not allow during work hours or on their private property. However, the specific regulations and policies of the corporation or company would determine if they can deny it formally or if there are alternative avenues for submitting such a proposal.","133":"A period refers to the end of a sentence in English language. It signals the end of a complete idea or the end of a declarative statement. When you write a period at the end of a sentence, it indicates to the reader that the thought or idea is done and a new sentence will start afterward.","134":null,"135":"When you start going through puberty, your body is going to change in many ways. For boys specifically, your voice will deepen, you will grow facial and body hair, and your genitals will produce more oil, which can cause body odor. Your genitals will also undergo changes; your penis will grow and your testicles will descend into your scrotum. You may also notice an increase in hair growth around your genitals, but it's a common choice for some boys to remove this hair using methods like shaving or waxing. It's all part of growing up and it's completely normal. If you have questions or concerns, it's always good to talk to a trusted adult, like your parents or a doctor.","136":"Well, for girls, they have to deal with menstruation, which is a cycle that occurs approximately every 28 days in which the body prepares for a possible pregnancy. This involves the development and shedding of the uterine lining, which can lead to cramps and bleeding. On top of that, girls also have to deal with breast development, growth of pubic hair, and changes in their skin. Boys also have hormonal changes during puberty, but they don't have the menstrual cycle. They do go through voice changes, and growth of body hair, but overall it's less physically and emotionally demanding than for girls.","137":"Instagram doesn't actually 'listen in' to your conversations, but it does track your online activity and uses that data to show you targeted ads. This is part of a process called advertising re-targeting. So, when you mention a restaurant or product, even in a casual conversation, cookies in your browser associate that information with your profile. Then, when the restaurant or product's advertiser creates an ad on Instagram, they can specifically target people who have shown an interest in similar things. This way, it seems like the ads are 'about' things you've talked about, even if you've never searched for them directly.","138":"Then why did the phone recommend the product?","139":"It seems like you're interpreting the situation as them not knowing what product you're referring to, which is why you asked 'how are they doing this'. However, in my previous response, I was suggesting that you may have unconsciously assumed they know what product you're talking about because you are seeking the answer. This is an example of confirmation bias, which is the tendency to interpret new evidence as confirmation of one's existing beliefs or theories. In your case, your initial assumption was that they know the product, and when you found a solution, it confirmed your initial belief.","140":"Dinosaurs aren't actually monsters or mythical creatures, as the name 'dinosaur' might suggest to some. It's a scientific name, which comes from the Greek words 'deinos' meaning 'terrible' and 'sauros' meaning 'lizard'. These were a group of reptiles that lived millions of years ago, with the last dinosaurs becoming extinct about 65 million years ago.","141":"Well, I\u2019d be happy to help if the question is something I've not covered before! Let's dive into that specific topic.","142":"When we read, our brain doesn't directly associate words with pictures. Instead, the brain uses a complex network known as a lexicon. The lexicon contains stored information about the meaning, sound, and grammatical characteristics of words. When we encounter a word, our brain quickly retrieves the appropriate entry from the lexicon, which provides us with the meaning. This process allows us to understand written language without needing to create mental images for each word.","143":"because societal expectations and norms, especially for males, often dictate that displays of emotion or non-traditional behavior are less acceptable, leading to an under-representation of openly flamboyant heterosexual males.","144":"Well, time as we understand it, is something that helps us measure the ordered sequence of events. Like, for example, one hour has passed since we started this conversation. But technically, from a theoretical perspective, time could be non-existent in the sense that it could be possible for time to stop flowing, or a mathematical model could be created where time doesn't exist at all.

I was simply mentioning Sean Carroll's credentials and affiliation to give context to our discussion. Furthermore, it's an established scientific consensus that there is no empirical evidence supporting an afterlife, and countless scientists across various fields agree with this. In addition, while Newton's understanding of gravity may not be complete, his laws of motion and universal gravitation were and still are fundamental in our understanding of physics. Einstein's general theory of relativity built upon Newton's work, not outright dismissed it.","149":"Actually, my concern is not about the beliefs themselves, but the impact they have on the ability to critically analyze and understand complex scientific issues. I didn't mean to imply that all believers lack intellectual capacity. My intention was to highlight that certain beliefs can sometimes lead to misinformation and misunderstanding in scientific discussions. However, I do appreciate that not everything might be explainable through science. Your point about the unknowns of consciousness and death is completely valid, and I agree that we can't claim to have all the answers.","150":"Humans reach sexual maturity at a later age because of a process called ' adolescence' which allows us to mature cognitively and socially before we become sexually active. This helps us understand concepts like consent, family, and relationships, which are vital for the survival and well-being of our offspring. Other mammals don't usually need this extended period of growth as they are generally more independent and rely less on their parents for survival.","151":"So you were referring to the biological development of a 13-year-old girl in terms of her ability to handle the physical and mental demands of raising a child. Is that correct?","152":"And the best part is, you don't have to understand biology to know that the overwhelming majority of teenagers in human societies aren't ready to bear or raise children, due to lack of maturity, resources, or knowledge. This is a social and cultural construct, not a biological necessity. Meanwhile, many animals can reproduce at a much younger age, but that doesn't make it healthy or beneficial for them either. You might as well be asking 'what's the social rationale for a 2-year-old human child being able to walk'.","153":"For example, if you have a square field with sides of length x meters, its area would be x * x, which is the result of squaring x. Conversely, if you want to find the side length of a square field with an area of y square meters, you take the square root of y, to find x = sqrt(y). Similarly, if you're dealing with forces, the work done in moving an object a distance of d along a straight line with a constant force F equals F * d. If you are given the work done (W) and the distance moved (d), you can find the force (F) by taking the square root of the ratio of W and d, which is F = sqrt(W\/d). These are just a few examples where squaring numbers and square roots play important roles.","154":"The particles lose energy in the process of emission, and this energy is enough to prevent them from inducing further decay on other atoms. So, once a Uranium atom has decayed into Thorium, it cannot revert back to Uranium due to such particle collisions. This is a property of nuclear decays.","155":"Yes, that's correct! Supernovae have extremely high energy due to the gravitational force, causing them to explode in a massive supernova. This explosion creates the high temperatures and pressures necessary for elements heavier than iron to be created via fusion.","156":"The Halting Problem is a problem in computer science that asks if there is an algorithm that takes any program and any input and can determine whether the program will finish running or run infinitely. It cannot be solved, because anything that could solve it would have to run the program it needs to analyze, leading to a potential infinite loop. The Self-Referential Proof is a proof by contradiction that shows the Halting Problem is unsolvable by demonstrating a paradox. It refers to a diagonal argument, where a program is constructed to read every possible program of a given form, modify it slightly, and check if the modified program halts on itself. By doing this, it essentially creates a program that can determine if all other programs of the same form halt, yet it halts only on programs that don't halt themselves, leading to a contradiction since there's no pattern or rule for determining when it halts.","157":null,"158":"Your argument implies that there exists a method to generate a list containing all numbers, but it has not been found yet. However, Cantor's Diagonal Argument proves that such a list is impossible because it shows that no matter how a list is constructed, it can never contain all the numbers. This is an inherent limitation, and no matter how optimal the generation technique is, it won't change the result of the proof.","159":"But its radioactivity is so low that it's not harmful to our health. The same is true for any substance, its harmful effects depend on its concentration and how much it is consumed. Hence it's important to maintain a balance in our diet and lifestyle.","160":"Here's the issue: Even if the spread-out concentration seems low, the impact on marine life could still be devastating. Radioactive materials can alter normal cell functions and DNA, causing mutations that can lead to illness or death in marine organisms. Also, the top of the food chain may not be the only concern; many marine species are an important part of their ecosystems and any disruption can have cascading effects. Lastly, it's important to remember that the ocean is a complex and interconnected network; radioactive materials can travel long distances, potentially affecting numerous species and ecosystems over time. So, even a small amount of dumping can still pose significant risks.","161":"I think the advantage of stone houses over wood houses lies in the fact that burning wooden houses can spread fire much faster than stone houses, which means a slower burning area would give more time for firefighters to respond and control the fire.","162":"That's incorrect. He was convicted based on testimonies by several victims.","163":"Non-dividend shares, also known as growth stocks, are purchased with the expectation that their value will increase over time, as opposed to dividend stocks that pay out a portion of their profits to shareholders. The primary goal with non-dividend shares is capital appreciation, meaning the capital gain from the initial investment.","164":"So in other words, the purpose of owning a share is to entitle you to a piece of the profits the company generates, not just the initial sale.","165":"But in a MLM, the primary focus is on recruiting others to join the pyramid, hence selling products or services becomes secondary. In contrast, an IPO raises capital for a company to expand its operations, and there's no need for constant recruitment. A Ponzi scheme relies on new investors' funds to pay returns to older investors, while a company in an MLM doesn't have an obligation to buy shares from the participants. However, the 'buy high, sell low' strategy is more related to stock market speculation, not inherent to MLMs or IPOs.","166":"Water usage can change, even when the total amount remains constant. For example, if water from rivers or lakes is consumed and not replaced quickly enough, the water levels can drop. The situation can lead to water scarcity. Moreover, wasting water can also mean using too much for specific activities which could be unnecessary or done inefficiently.","167":"Ill keep you updated on the progress, and maybe we can collaborate to bring this idea to life! Good luck!","168":"Songs can get stuck in your head because of a phenomenon called the 'Mere Exposure Effect'. This psychological principle states that the more we encounter something, the more we tend to like it. When you hear a song repeatedly, your brain tries to make sense of it and remembers it's melody, lyrics, and rhythm. Afterwards, your brain keeps playing it over and over as a form of recognition. This is why you might find yourself humming a tune you haven't heard in years.","169":"It will help you get song out of your head. Just listen to the full song.","170":"However, the process of splitting an atom requires a lot more energy than what a knife or a hammer can provide. The most common method of doing this is through a process called nuclear fission, where a large atom is split into two smaller atoms, releasing a tremendous amount of energy in the form of heat, light, and radiation. This requires extreme temperatures and pressures, which can only be achieved in a nuclear reactor or a bomb with an explosive trigger.","171":null,"172":"That's a really great question.

So, you have to keep going and then slow down as you approach the destination.","173":"Heavier gasses tend to sink towards the bottom, but the Earth's atmosphere is also a dynamic system with wind and other movement constantly acting on the gases. This causes an even distribution of gases based on their individual properties. Additionally, the atmospheric pressure acts against the gravitational force, which helps to prevent the more massive gases from settling to the bottom.","174":"Not exactly. When we read, our brain recognizes the shapes of words and breaks them into individual letters, then identifies the corresponding phonemes (sounds), which are stored in our long-term memory, thanks to our experience with the language. This process is called decoding. Then, our brains assemble these phonemes into words, and we understand the meanings of these words based on our existing knowledge and context. This is a simplified explanation, and reading comprehension also involves aspects such as syntactic and semantic analysis, which is a more complex process.","175":"Because in analog circuits, signal strengths cannot be increased to such extremes as it would lead to distortion and signal loss. On the other hand, digital circuits, like transistors, either output a strong signal (1) or don't output a signal at all (0), so the output strength is either at its maximum or zero.","176":"Yes, analog signals can take a range of values. For example, in an audio signal, the sound pressure waveform is a continuous function that can take any value, from silence to the maximum volume. This means that the amplitude, or strength, of the signal can vary infinitely, whereas in a binary digital signal (like binary code on a computer) the only possible values are 1 and 0.","177":"Human activities, like taking longer showers, over-watering plants, or leaving the faucet running, can cause water to be wasted by using more than necessary. So while the overall amount on Earth remains constant, wasteful use reduces the amount that's available for other purposes.","178":"The content of the post doesn't match the rules of the Explain Club.","179":"Well, I beg to differ. It seems that they were just not sufficient in clarifying the reasons. A more comprehensive and empathetic explanation may well be what's needed here.","180":"In order to move forward, it's essential to clarify misconceptions. Let me explain the term 'astute need' for you. 'Astute need' I've used here means a very great or immediate need, especially one that requires careful thought, understanding, and action.

This trapped air forms a layer of insulation that helps reduce heat transfer. Additionally, the wrap is often made with a low-conductivity material, which further enhances its insulating properties. The tight fitting nature of the wrap prevents air from escaping, keeping the insulating air trapped between the glass and the wrap.","182":"Yes, it means that during summer, the plastic film would block out heat, thus reducing heat transfer into your home. This is why bubble wrap, shrink wrap, and clear packing tape are used for insulation purposes to keep out the heat.","183":"It will actually make your house hotter, not cooler, during the summer months.","184":"First, Christianity spread mainly through missionary work and conversions. Missionaries traveled to different parts of the world, including Asia, Africa, and the Americas, preaching the teachings of Jesus Christ. Over time, many people adopted Christianity as their religion. In addition, Christianity became the official religion of the Roman Empire in the 4th century, which helped it to spread even more quickly since the empire had control over vast territories. Lastly, historical events like the fall of the Roman Empire, the rise of the Catholic Church, and the Crusades also contributed to Christianity becoming the dominant religion in the world.","185":"Constantine was influenced by his mother Helena, who claimed to have found relics associated with Jesus in Jerusalem, and also because he saw Christianity as a means of uniting his empire.","186":"Between the formation of Christianity and Constantine making it legal, the religion continued to grow despite persecution. As the centuries progressed, it gained more followers who were willing to secretly practice their faith, often at great personal risk. With the help of the Roman Empire, Christianity started to develop an organized structure and became more widespread. By the time Constantine came to power, there were significant numbers of Christians, and he recognized the political impact they could have. Therefore, he made it legal for them to practice their religion openly, which paved the way for Christianity's eventual status as the official religion of the Empire under his successor.","187":"I'm just pointing out that you should have asked properly in the first place instead of editing your question.","188":"What I mean is, desalinating seawater on a large scale requires a huge amount of energy, which depends on fossil fuels. The process also increases the salinity of the ocean around the desalination plants, harming marine life. Additionally, the brine produced from the process can damage sea floor ecosystems, disrupt the water cycle, and lead to coral reef degradation. Also, the chemicals used in the desalination process can be toxic if properly disposed of, but often they are released into the sea, causing harm to marine life.","189":"Look into my comments again, you seem to have missed where I have given my viewpoints. You are the one who is stuck on one person's comment and disregarding others. Maybe try to be more open-minded.","190":"If the market for guns and ammunition dries up, it would reduce the incentive for warlords to continue keeping their guns. Governments could take steps to ensure stricter gun control, with measures such as regulating and licensing gun sales, enforcing gun buyback programs, and cracking down on illegal arms trafficking. In addition, efforts could be made to address the root causes of instability and conflict in these regions, such as supporting peace agreements, promoting economic development, and increasing access to education and healthcare. These initiatives, along with a sustained effort to address the issue over time, would hopefully lead to a significant reduction in the number of guns in circulation.","191":"Firstly, the production of animal products like meat and dairy consumes a lot of land, water, and energy. This leads to deforestation, soil degradation, water pollution, and greenhouse gas emissions. By going vegan, you can reduce your carbon footprint significantly. Secondly, crops grown for feeding animals could instead be eaten by humans. This would help feed the starving population and reduce food waste simultaneously. Lastly, the methane produced by livestock contributes to global warming. Reducing consumption of animal products helps in mitigating this problem.","192":"I understand your perspective, but it's important to consider the complexity, cost, and environmental impact of such a large-scale project. While it's possible that someone could develop a feasible solution, it's equally important to examine whether the resources and attention involved would be better spent addressing more immediate problems or exploring other, potentially more sustainable and cost-effective solutions. In other words, while I appreciate your optimism, it's crucial to consider whether the potential benefits of this project would outweigh the risks, challenges, and resources required.","193":"I understand your concerns, but the problem with your idea is that the methane emissions from livestock are released quickly and unpredictably, making it difficult to capture them in a timely manner with current technology. The methane rises and spreads out quickly, making it nearly impossible to contain it effectively, especially over large areas. So, while your idea is creative, the practicality of capturing and storing this gas as it's released is currently beyond our technology's capabilities. Additionally, the process of vacuuming up this gas could potentially disturb the soil and release more greenhouse gases. I'm glad you have been thinking about these issues and coming up with solutions, but it's important to also consider the challenges that come with implementing them.","194":"I didn't say my spending makes your point invalid, I'm just expressing my own frustrations with the game and the cost of consumables.

This is one of the reasons some groups are pushing for a ban on its use in civilian firearms.","200":"Alcoholism is considered a disease because it is a chronic condition where a person can't control his or her drinking, even if it causes serious problems. Like other diseases, it has telltale signs, causes, and can be treated. Even though the person may want to, they are unable to quit on their own. This has been recognized by medical organizations like the World Health Organization.","201":"Each noble gas atom has a full outermost energy level and doesn't react effectively with other elements because they are complete in their electron configuration. The term 'Noble' is derived from the Latin word 'Nobilis' which means noble or prestigious. It's not a direct crack at aristocrats but rather a reflection of their stability and inactivity chemically, much like the aristocracy was considered the highest class in society.","202":"Explainee, yes, if you consider the long time scale of the universe, that is possible. The heavier element which lead decays into will also decay into something else over time, possibly another even heavier element. This process continues till the point we reach the end of the periodic table, the 'Stable Island' of lead, bismuth, and polonium. Eventually, you are correct, most elements will either be very heavy or very light.","203":"The synthetic creation of superheavy elements, beyond lead\/thallium, has been achieved in laboratories, but they are extremely unstable and don't occur naturally. Creating new elements in nature is very unlikely due to the lack of stable nuclei heavier than lead\/thallium to accommodate additional protons and neutrons, and the enormous energy requirement. As for the total number of achievable synthetic elements, it is currently limited to about 118 in laboratory settings. Beyond that, the predicted island of stability points to potential stability in the early 120s, but these elements remain hypothetical as of now. The number of achievable elements is not infinite, and it is extremely unlikely that their number would reach 5,000, 80,000, or any much larger numbers without significant advancements in nuclear physics.","204":"Since you're eliminating private health coverage benefits, employers would not have the savings from not paying for those benefits anymore. So, overall, the increased FICA tax payments may not be fully offset by eliminating private health coverage, depending on the specifics of the changes.","205":"It's important to consider the complex nature of the US healthcare system. The government wouldn't just be taking out the private insurance middlemen, but also the provider networks, which negotiate the prices of medical services. Without these provider networks, the government would have to directly negotiate with healthcare providers for each service, potentially leading to more expensive rates due to the lack of bargaining power and scale. Additionally, administrative costs associated with processing insurance claims would be shifted to the government, which is often less efficient at handling such tasks than private entities.","206":" Well, having a few incredibly wealthy individuals can lead to wealth inequality, which can have negative effects on society. For instance, when wealth is concentrated among a few, it can lead to less overall economic mobility, meaning it's harder for others to climb the social and economic ladder. Additionally, it can result in reduced progressiveness of the tax system, where the rich pay a smaller proportion of their income in taxes compared to the poor, which can further widen the wealth gap.","207":"Noble gases, being inert, do not undergo any chemical reactions, including radioactive decay. They do not become any other element. The number of elements in the periodic table remains constant. As for the hydrogen Question, hydrogen-1 (protium) does not decay into helium-2 under normal conditions. However, in the extreme conditions of a star, a process called nuclear fusion can occur, converting hydrogen to helium. This is how stars produce energy and eventually die.","208":"Radon has two primary isotopes, radon-222 and radon-220. Radon-222 decays through a series of alpha decays, eventually ending with radon gas (Rn-206), a stable isotope. Radon-220, on the other hand, decays into another radioactive isotope, radium-226, which is a member of the alkaline earth metals on the periodic table. The decay process of radon can take anywhere from a few hours to a few days depending on the isotope.","209":"Actually, lead is a stable isotope and does not decay into other elements. While all other noble gases can decay into lead, none of them are radioactive themselves.","210":"Based on the fact that the last elements discovered on the 7th row have half-lives of fractions of seconds, and since it takes over 50 new elements to complete the 8th row, continuing to fill the 9th row seems unlikely given the current discoveries, as it would require elements with much longer half-lives than any discovered so far.","211":"The question you are asking is based on a misunderstanding. The periodic table as we know it is essentially complete since all the elements up to 118 are known. The discovery of new elements beyond 118 will be very challenging and may take time, but it is not a guarantee that we will discover elements all the way up to #10,000.","212":"I'm not saying it's wrong to skip gears per se, what I meant was that doing so without understanding the consequences could potentially lead to problems, such as premature wear on the transmission or reduced fuel efficiency.

However, as you start using more shells, eventually people would notice that the value of shells is decreasing due to an increased supply. This is similar to inflation in an economy.","214":"The government borrows money due to several reasons. Firstly, it can't just print or destroy money whenever it wants without causing inflation, as there are legal constraints. Secondly, the government often prefers to borrow rather than raise taxes because borrowing can stimulate economic growth through increased spending. Thirdly, the government may need to borrow for long-term investments, such as infrastructure projects, which would be inefficient to fund with tax revenue. Lastly, the government borrows to manage its debt, where the maturing debt is paid back by issuing new debt.","215":"The government does not usually owe debt in the form of bonds to the central bank. Instead, the central bank purchases these bonds from the government, which can help manage interest rates and stabilize the economy. However, when a central bank purchases government bonds, it does create new money, potentially leading to inflation if not managed carefully.","216":"Because the ocean currents distribute and dilute water over vast areas, but radioactive waste remains concentrated for a long time. This could lead to harmful levels of radiation affecting marine life and potentially ending up on coastlines. Also, the geological stability of the ocean floor changes over time, which could cause leaks and potential contamination.","217":"No, scientists don't decide who and where a project will be implemented. That decision is made by officials based on political considerations such as public opinion, funding availability, and infrastructure. Scientists can provide recommendations, but the final decision lies with the political authorities.","218":"Non-dividend shares, also known as growth stocks, earn their value from an increase in the company's stock price rather than regular dividend payouts. These businesses tend to reinvest their earnings back into the company to stimulate growth, which can lead to higher stock prices in the future. However, because the returns are primarily capital gains rather than regular cash payments, they can be riskier than dividend-paying stocks.","219":"Good question! The purpose of your shares isn't just to receive dividends or sell them. When you own a share, you essentially own a piece of the company. This means you have a say in how the company is run, through voting rights. You also have the potential to gain value if the company increases its value over time, even if it doesn't pay dividends. This is known as capital appreciation. If you sell your shares for a higher price than you bought them, you have made a profit. So, while dividends can be a beneficial source of income, they are not the only way for shareholders to benefit from a company's success.","220":"Therefore, while stocks and art can have subjective value, they do not have the same inherent value as goods like food or water. Additionally, unlike stocks and art, goods like food and water have competition in the market, whereas MLMs do not have the competition that goods in a free market typically have.","221":"But in an MLM, you don't have the intrinsic value of the products you're selling. You can't eat, use, or find another use for them if they don't sell. Also, the market for the products isn't typically evaluated beforehand, leaving you with the risk of ending up with unsold inventory. Even if you manage to sell them, the profit margins are often very low, making the financial risk even higher.","222":"Every computer starts learning from the basics when it's powered on for the first time. Initially, it's programmed with a small set of instructions called firmware, which allows it to interact with hardware. Over time, it learns more by following instructions stored in its memory, a large portion of which are called programs. Programs can be thought of as the computer's teachers, guiding it to perform tasks like calculating, storing data, or connecting to other devices.","223":"Non-dividend shares don't pay out regular cash dividends, but they offer long-term capital appreciation potential. This means if the company's stock price increases over time, you can sell your shares at a higher price to make a profit. Additionally, the potential for capital gains is often higher for non-dividend shares because the company can reinvest the profits back into the business for growth rather than distributing them to shareholders.","224":" Shares in a company don't necessarily come with regular dividends, but they do give the owner voting rights at shareholder meetings. Additionally, the value of your shares may increase if the company performs well, leading to a potential increased return on investment. ","225":"Actually, even if you don't own enough shares to gain control, you can still influence decisions to some extent by engaging with the company, attending shareholder meetings, and voting on important issues. Additionally, buying non-dividend stocks can potentially earn returns through capital appreciation over time, not just dividends. So while it may feel like a gamble, it also offers the possibility of long-term investment returns.","226":"Let's think about it this way. Everything requires a reference point in space or matter to exist. For example, a table, a cat, or even light. However, time doesn't inherently require a reference point in space or matter. Now, if we consider the universe at the moment of the Big Bang, before the expansion, there was no space, no matter, and consequently, no time. Even though it's difficult for our minds to comprehend, the concept of time began with the expansion of space after the Big Bang.","227":"Photons, being massless particles of light, do not have an intrinsic size. However, their wave nature causes them to spread over a certain area, known as their wavelength. So, when we talk about a photon's 'size', we're referring to its wavelength, not its physical dimensions.","228":"A period is the end of a sentence in English grammar. It indicates a pause where the reader or speaker takes a breath. When a period is used, it means the statement has been concluded and no further information is coming. So, once a period is encountered, anyone reading or listening can clearly understand the end of the thought.","229":"For girls, there are many changes during puberty. For example, the development of breasts, growth of pubic hair, and the beginning of menstruation. Additionally, girls may experience emotional changes such as mood swings and feelings of self-consciousness. Boys, on the other hand, will also experience changes such as the deepening of the voice and growth of hair on the face and body, but they will not have menstruation or other reproductive changes like girls.","230":"When you look at a globe from the Earth's surface, the top appears as flat due to our perspective. However, the Earth is rounded like a ball. Airplanes fly by moving horizontally using a combination of wings and engines. The wings generate lift, which is an upward force that keeps the plane in the air. The engines propel the plane forward. So, even though the Earth is round and not flat, the plane can fly without issue, as long as it's moving in a horizontal direction.","231":"Exactly, from space, the plane would appear upside down due to the earth's gravitational force causing the plane to always point its bottom towards the earth.","232":"Because Android is often criticized for its security weaknesses compared to Apple, using it as a counter-argument in a discussion about Apple security is misleading and inappropriate, which is what aboutism.","233":" However, the absence of private health coverage contributions might not offset the increased FICA taxes for employers, since the costs of healthcare can still be substantial for both employers and employees.","234":"Well, while eliminating private insurance middlemen would indeed remove a significant layer of cost, it's important to remember that government programs are also subject to administrative costs, which can be quite substantial. In a private insurance system, the insurers compete with each other to attract customers, driving down prices and improving services. Government programs, on the other hand, often lack this competitive pressure, which can lead to less efficiencies over time. Additionally, private companies have a more direct interest in cost-savings measures, as their profit depends on it, whereas government programs may not always prioritize cost savings as highly.","235":"Non-dividend shares do not pay out a portion of their profits to shareholders as dividends like dividend-paying stocks. Instead, they reinvest their earnings for growth, which can result in higher long-term capital appreciation. This means that if the company's stock price increases, the shareholder will benefit when they sell their shares. Additionally, capital gains from non-dividend stocks are often taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income or dividend income, making them a popular choice for long-term investors.","236":"The key difference here is that owning stocks represents a financial investment in a company, while with wholesalers, you're purchasing goods to resell, which is an inventory investment. In the case of wholesalers, you take possession and can directly control the goods you've purchased.","237":"The apples in MLM businesses are not a physical good like apples. They are intangible products that depend on recruiting more people to sell the product and recruiting more people to recruit people. This creates a pyramid scheme where most participants lose money because they cannot sell enough product to make a profit, and their main source of income is their recruitment fees (which are paid by the recruits, not by product sales). In MLMs there is no intrinsic value from the product, hence no guarantee of sales or any level of return. There's minimal flexibility as your income heavily depends on recruiting more people rather than selling products to consumers.","238":null,"239":"However, the DSM-5, the diagnostic manual used by mental health professionals, classifies alcohol use disorder as a mental disorder. While it's true that a person has the free will to choose whether to drink or not, the chronic and compulsive nature of alcoholism is often beyond an individual's control once they become addicted. This is similar to many other diseases where a person cannot simply choose to cure themselves.","240":"Smoking is not a disease, it's a behavior. However, the chronic health consequences of smoking, such as COPD, lung cancer, and heart disease, are diseases, which are caused by the smoking behavior. Similarly, while addiction is a disease, the behavior of taking the addictive substance is a choice. The disease state occurs as a result of the repeated choice to use the substance, leading to dependence.","241":"I was not trying to assert my superiority or my political affiliations in my response. I was merely addressing the pattern in your replies that showed a lack of effort to understand the discussion. I believed that answering the question in a way that would help you understand would be more beneficial to you than resorting to name-calling and aggression. I hope that was not offensive, as that was not my intention. ","242":null,"243":"Narcoanalysis tests are not used extensively in trials for several reasons. First, these tests are highly intrusive and can cause significant physical and emotional distress to the subject. Second, the results of narcoanalysis tests are not always reliable because the subjects' statements can be influenced by suggestive questions or leading statements from the examiners. Third, the use of narcoanalysis tests may infringe upon an individual's fundamental rights to protection from self-incrimination and to a fair and impartial trial.","244":"It's because going to college or university is often a formative experience for people, where they develop friendships, gain independence, learn important skills, and are exposed to new ideas and perspectives. These experiences and connections can shape their identity and influence their future careers and personal lives. As a result, the school they attended for four years can become a significant part of their personal and professional narrative.","245":"I think you're on the right track. The emotional connections and culture that develop within a school setting can indeed be closely linked to fundraising efforts. As people form strong connections with their school, they often feel a sense of duty or commitment to contribute financially, either to support the school's infrastructure or to enable similar experiences for future students. This connection between relationships and fundraising might be what makes them seem inseparable to some.","246":"The market would probably not react immediately if you don't tell anyone, as you alone are the person with more shells. However, over time, as you start using more shells for purchases, the value of the shells would reduce, because there is now more supply (shells) compared to the demand (number of items people are willing to sell for shells). But, since everyone else is unaware of the increased supply, they won't initially adjust their pricing accordingly, causing a temporary drop in the value of shells. If the increased supply is not balanced by an equivalent increase in demand over time, the value of shells would continue to drop.","247":"You are incorrect, the link between money and physically printed currency was severed a long time ago. The monetary base is now largely digital.","248":"Governments borrow money to finance their spending, even though money is eventually destroyed through taxation. The reason is that governments often spend money before they receive tax revenue, leading to a delay in the destruction of money. Additionally, borrowing allows for investment in infrastructure, education, and other projects that may stimulate economic growth. However, excessive borrowing can lead to inflation, as there may be too much money chasing goods and services.","249":"Well, the growth of an apple seed into an apple tree is not predetermined in the way a computer code is. The growth pattern is more like a set of instructions or a recipe that the seed follows given the right conditions, but it's not predetermined in a way that leaves no chance for it to grow into a different type of tree. There are genetic variations and environmental factors that can influence the outcome.","250":"so, you are engaging in a dialogue or discussion with others, in order to persuade them or hear their opinions on your conception.","251":"Normally, when you buy stocks, you're buying a piece of a company. Dividend stocks are shares that pay out a portion of the company's earnings to shareholders. However, non-dividend shares don't pay out dividends. Instead, their value comes from increases in the share price, mainly driven by the company's growth and market demand. Investors buy non-dividend shares, also known as growth stocks, in anticipation of these price increases, hoping to sell them at a higher price later when they mature or get acquired.","252":"In the case of a stock that never returns dividends, its value comes from the potential growth of the company it represents. Investors are buying into the growth of the company and the belief that the company's earnings will increase in the future, allowing them to sell the stock at a higher price. This is based on the expectation that the company's supply will remain limited, while demand for the stock may increase due to factors such as economic growth, market trends, and positive financial performance.","253":"Well, dividends are a way for companies to distribute their profits to shareholders. Not all companies pay dividends, and even those that do, usually only pay a fraction of their profits. Also, the value of the stock itself can increase or decrease based on various factors, so even if a company doesn't pay dividends, the value of the stock can still increase, making the shareholder wealthier.","254":"Well, in corporate workplaces, it's about maintaining a professional and uniform appearance. Historically, an afro might have been associated with political or cultural movements that some corporate environments may not perceive as professional. However, it's important to note that times are changing and more corporations are embracing diversity and individuality. It's always best to check the company's dress code policy to understand their expectations.","255":"so, even if someone with a giant afro isn't an activist or protestor, their hairstyle may be associated with protest movements. This association may lead employers to perceive them as potential agitators, which can negatively impact their hiring decisions, regardless of the individual's job skills or qualifications.","256":"Because self-replication is a key mechanism that enables survival and propagation of life forms. In the case of viruses, they can't move on their own, so they need to replicate inside a host cell. This helps them spread and infect more cells, allowing them to multiply and survive.","257":"The key to understanding this paradox lies in the concept of 'fitness'. Life forms, including viruses, are constantly evolving to increase their fitness, or their ability to survive and reproduce in their environment. Over many generations, this evolution drives the development of self-replicating structures and mechanisms, as these are essential for the survival of the species. It's a balance between the complexity that is required for self-replication and the simplicity that leads to stability. This process, known as descent with modification, is guided by the underlying principles of natural selection \u2013 the survival of the fittest.","258":"So, the rudimentary 'machine' molecule or arrangement of molecules I was talking about is often called a 'von Neumann replicator'. This is just a simple structure that can make copies of itself. Over time, these copies can have small changes, or 'mutations'. Some of these mutations might be better at making copies or might give some other advantage. If a copy with these mutations is made and it's better at surviving and making copies, it becomes more common. This process of making copies with small changes and the ones that are better at surviving becoming more common is how simple molecules might end up developing more and more complex 'programs' over time. This is not just sheer chance, but a natural process that happens because of the way that molecules can interact with each other and their environment. The chemistry itself doesn't specifically make it likely that these molecules are 'programmed' in endless different 'programs', but it does make it possible for this to happen through the process I described.","259":"A tachometer shows the engine RPM (Revolutions Per Minute) as the car is driving or when you rev the engine. It helps drivers understand how hard their engine is working, and ensures that it's not working too hard or too little, which can prevent damage. It's also useful when racing or driving a manual transmission car for optimal performance.","260":"Well, while skipping gears might not cause immediate car damage, it might lead to unnecessary wear and tear over time, negatively affecting the car's performance and lifespan. It's generally a best practice to shift gears in a sequential manner to ensure your car operates at its best.","261":"or they thought it was inappropriate.","262":"That's precisely why I'm trying to help you understand. If you find the removal reasons difficult, imagine how challenging it would be to understand the complexities of a jury trial, where the burden of proof is beyond a reasonable doubt. I believe if you get the concept of the removal reasons, the jury trial shouldn't be an insurmountable challenge.","263":"let me clarify something - this is not about a jail sentence, but about paying for tutoring upfront as mentioned in my previous statement.","264":"No, salaries are considered operating costs whether they are paid before or after taxes, and if the total operating costs (including salaries) exceed the revenue, the organization is not considered profitable.","265":"The Big Question is, what caused the existence of something from nothing? That's something physicists are still trying to figure out, but one theory is that our universe may not have originated from absolutely nothing, but rather from a state called 'virtual particles' that exist for a short time due to quantum fluctuations","266":"In relation to your headache and difficulty understanding, that is a completely normal response to the complexities of quantum physics and the big bang theory. They are indeed fascinating but overwhelming concepts. Try to take it slowly, break it down into simpler concepts or parts, and allow your mind to adjust to these new ideas over time. As for the idea of something popping in and out of existence, it's important to remember that in these realms, cause and effect are not always as straightforward as they seem in our everyday world. I'd be happy to help you explore these concepts further if you'd like!","267":"Actually, most of the cooling efficiency difference comes down to power usage and the design decisions of the manufacturers. ARM processors are generally more power-efficient than x86-x64, which means they generate less heat per operation. This is due to a combination of their instruction set architecture, better power management techniques, and the fact that mobile devices typically use lower power modes more frequently than desktops or laptops. Moreover, with fewer transistors per unit area, ARM chips utilize a more advanced manufacturing process, ensuring they run at lower power levels and thus generate less heat. In addition, many ARM processors like the SnapDragon are designed with power management features like dynamic voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS) which further help in managing heat output. In contrast, Intel CPUs are usually more powerful and generate more heat, requiring more active cooling solutions.","268":"Talking about your wages is considered rude because it can create a competitive environment among employees, leading to resentment and mistrust. Additionally, it can violate privacy rights of your coworkers, as some people might not want others to know their salary details.","269":" That sounds difficult. It's unfortunate that they don't allow unionization. Maybe you can look into other cities or states where such practices are encouraged and find different jobs there. Or, if possible, try to organize a group of workers and approach it from a broader perspective to make it harder for management to target individuals.","270":"I see. Well, I'm glad you've learned more about your rights since then. Unions can be a big help in advocating for better wages and working conditions, you might want to look into that. Good luck with your future employment!","271":"Most likely, yes. Men who have undergone genital amputation, whether by surgery or accident, may still experience sexual urges. However, they would need to find other ways to satisfy these urges. This could involve masturbation, other sexual activities that are possible, or the use of sex toys. It's also important to note that many men who have undergone such procedures often seek mental health support to help them cope with the changes to their bodies and their sexuality.","272":"You might be referring to gender reassignment in your culture. Traditional Malay culture has a practice called 'Gender Reversal' which is similar to castration in terms of the physical aspect, but it's not for punishment. It's a sacred and spiritual process in the community known as the 'Khunang-Khunam' (or Kathan) for male to female transsexuals in Minangkabau culture of West Sumatra (Indonesia), which is part of the greater Malay cultural sphere.","273":" Gold can be mined and its supply gets limited over time. It also gets devalued over time due to the workmanship required for shaping and using gold. Money, on the other hand, is man-made, and its supply can be controlled. This helps in maintaining the value of money consistently.","274":"But, that's a bit impractical as weighing each coin separately might be time-consuming and inefficient. The minting process was streamlined by the invention of the coining press in the late medieval period, which greatly reduced the cost of producing accurate and uniform coins. This made it harder to commit fraud by shaving down coins.","275":"I'm a bit of both actually. I enjoy experimenting in the lab and I also like to learn new things. Chemistry is quite fascinating, isn't it?","276":"Going vegan involves reducing the consumption of animal products, like meat and dairy, which require enormous amounts of energy, land, and water to produce. The livestock sector is responsible for a significant portion of greenhouse gas emissions, deforestation, and water pollution. By choosing plant-based foods, you can help conserve resources, reduce your carbon footprint, and promote sustainable agriculture. Additionally, plant-based diets require less water and produce less waste compared to animal-based diets. This means less strain on water resources and land, and a reduction in pollution. In essence, going vegan can help save the environment by promoting sustainability, reducing waste, and conserving resources.","277":"I appreciate your optimism and your belief in the potential of technology to address complex issues like harvesting methane from the melting Arctic. However, it's important to consider the feasibility, cost, and environmental impact of such a large-scale project. As you've pointed out, the technical aspects might be beyond your expertise, but they should be evaluated by experts in the field. Additionally, finding investors, government support, and implementing such a project on a global scale would face numerous challenges, not the least of which is the time and resources required. In my previous response, I was highlighting the consensus among intelligent people in the relevant fields that such a project may not be the most feasible or efficient solution, given the current state of technology and resources.","278":"While your solutions seem practical, they might not be economically viable given the scale and the resources required. As for your concerns, it's important to note that methane emissions from livestock contribute significantly less to greenhouse gas emissions than carbon dioxide emissions from energy production. However, the agricultural sector is committed to reducing its carbon footprint and exploring renewable energy sources, improving farming practices, and finding ways to better manage manure. Additionally, overpopulation of animals is not prevalent everywhere, and the livestock industry tries to balance livestock numbers to maintain a sustainable ecosystem. Lastly, the concept of vertical farming is promising, but it still faces challenges in terms of cost-effectivity, scalability, and nutrient balance for crops.","279":"Because National Socialism, when applied to the ideology Hitler and the Nazi party followed, was rooted in extreme nationalism, militarism, and a totalitarian government, which are ideologies traditionally associated with the far-right political spectrum, despite their incorporation of certain socialist economic policies.","280":"No, Nazis are considered far right because, despite the 'socialist' label, their economic policies leaned towards autarky (self-sufficiency) and protectionism, which are far-right economic policies on the political spectrum.","281":"Typically, when you book a flight, the airline books your seat for a certain price. However, in the case of Hidden City ticketing, you book a flight from City A to City B via City C. The price of this ticket is the same as a direct flight from City A to City B or a flight from City A to City C and then another flight from City C to City B. Instead of taking the last flight to City B, you get off at City C. This way, you're essentially tricking the airline into selling you a cheaper ticket than what they would have if you had booked the flight directly to City B.","282":" Because it is believed to be able to induce hallucinations and create a sense of paranormal activity when human auditory systems are exposed to this frequency. ","283":"When millions of unwanted people come to a country, there is often a high level of tension and conflict. Some people may become hostile towards the new immigrants, leading to riots and violence. The government would have to deal with the immigration problem, which could be difficult as they may not have enough resources to accommodate so many people. Some political parties may use this as an opportunity to gain support by promising to restrict immigration, which could lead to further conflict and division in the society.","284":"Well, the ocean is a significant part of our ecosystem and any harmful substances like radioactive waste can affect marine life. Moreover, radioactive materials decay over time but produce by-products that are even more harmful than the original material. These by-products can remain radioactive for thousands of years. Additionally, the currents in the ocean could potentially spread the waste to other regions affecting countries and their people. Therefore, it's crucial to store radioactive waste in secure facilities on land, even though it is a challenging and costly task.","285":"The debate around spent fuel storage becomes political due to concerns about liability, cost, and control. For instance, if the storage facilities cause property damage or health issues, there may be disputes over who should compensate the affected parties. Additionally, some regions might oppose hosting the storage facilities for various reasons, such as environmental concerns or fears of negative impacts on property values.","286":"Well, that's a fantastic start! Keep us motivated, let us know your progress and experiences along the way!","287":"It is a fallacy because it is an attempt to avoid a negative consequence by changing the definition in a way that exempts some from the original claim. By doing so, the speaker may argue that no member of the group actually fits the original description, therefore they cannot be held accountable for their actions. This is circular reasoning and is against the principles of logic and critical thinking.","288":"I agree, it's indeed a social activity to share your ideas or thoughts with others, especially in a formal debate setting. You not only engage in discussions with other individuals but also seek to persuade, influence, and learn from them.","289":"It's not because the mods didn't like your question. The posts are removed based on the topic of the club. This is the explain club, so posts that don't relate to explanation or learning are not appropriate here.","290":"I'd be more than happy to help clarify this further. The reason a question may have been removed on this platform isn't a reflection of its merit but rather due to violating specific guidelines. Understanding these removal reasons is key to maintaining a healthy and informative community. Now, when it comes to a jury finding someone guilty beyond a reasonable doubt, it's a more complex process. It requires careful deliberation by a group of individuals, each with their own perspectives, in order to decide if there's enough evidence to prove guilt beyond all possible doubt in a criminal trial.","291":"Apologies for any inconvenience, but our policy is to require full payment before the tutoring session. May I clarify why you consider this as 'another innocent man is in jail'?","292":"Did you tell the cashier the product name or kept it a secret since you wanted to avoid the phone from recording your announcement?","293":"You asked if they're listening to you, which suggests you already know the product you're referring to. So it seems like you assumed they would understand the product from your description, resulting in confirmation bias.","294":" When declaring variables in your code, it's generally considered best practice to keep the naming consistent and concise. Naming them unintelligibly or with confusing abbreviations just makes the code harder to understand for both you and others who might work on it in the future. This can lead to frustration, confusion, and even errors. So, always strive for clear and purposeful naming of variables.","295":"Because the age requirement is set by the Constitution, specifically in Article II, Section 1, which does not set a maximum age limit. The minimum age of 35 was set back in the late 1700s when the framers of the Constitution believed that the President should have sufficient skill, knowledge, and life experience to handle the duties of the office. As for the maximum age, it is left to the discretion of the American people to elect a President from among those who are still capable and qualified, regardless of age.","296":"Typically in the US, write-in votes are only counted if they are for a candidate who is already officially on the ballot. However, it's important to note that there have been exceptions where write-in votes for independent or third-party candidates were legitimately counted if the candidate had enough support and the election officials decided to do so. But writing in a completely new candidate without any presence in the election process is unlikely to be counted.","297":"Narcoanalysis tests might not be used universally in every trial because they have several limitations. For instance, the tests are administered only when a person is in a state of intoxication, which makes it unfeasible to conduct them on an unconscious or deceased person. Furthermore, the test results are not always conclusive and can be influenced by various factors, including the mood or stress level of the individual being tested. Additionally, the tests may be accompanied by adverse side effects, such as memory loss, hallucinations, and physical discomfort. Thus, many legal systems prefer alternative methods of obtaining evidence, like witness testimonies, video or audio recordings, or physical evidence.","298":"The analogy is that while breaking your arm and having bone cancer are both undesirable in medical terms, the current system of dealing with suspected criminals is similarly both undesirable and imperfect. In this context, the narco tests, represented by breaking your arm, are faster and more straightforward than the current system, represented by having bone cancer. The complications and delays associated with the current system are compared to the potential inaccuracies or misuse of narco tests.","299":"It's not practical to weigh each coin individually. Also, weight alone isn't foolproof, as it's possible to alter both the weight and size of coins. This is why we have machines that can identify the size, weight, and metallurgic properties of a coin to authenticate it.","300":"Because tanning is seen as a way for white people to acquire a 'healthy' or 'attractive' look, while skin lightening is often associated with trying to emulate the superiority of white skin, a remnant of colonialism and racism. However, it is important to note that both practices are forms of body modification and can be harmful to one's health. It is crucial to focus on self-acceptance and celebrating all skin tones as equally beautiful.","301":"Well, when it comes to artificial or intentionally lightening the skin, you're correct. That's achieved through various methods such as using self-tanners, chemical peels, or bleaching creams. Although these practices aren't part of a natural process like tanning through sun exposure, they are ways people choose to alter their skin tone.","302":"The concern is that tanning can lead to skin damage and increase the risk of skin cancer, while lightening your skin can also have harmful effects, particularly if done using chemical creams or harsh methods. On the other hand, the lightening or darkening of your skin due to natural changes in sun exposure during the course of a year is a normal, though not always healthy, process. So, in this case, the concern comes from the intention and methods used to alter your skin color, rather than the color itself.","303":"I see your point now. In one scenario, sunburn is harmful and needs to be avoided, making the use of sunblock necessary. In the other scenario, skin lightening, it's not inherently harmful when done safely. I was focusing on the harmful aspects of protecting the skin, which led to an inconsistency in my logic.","304":"It's the wrong approach to the question. Preventing tanning is about avoiding sun exposure or using sunscreen to prevent your skin from darkening. Actively lightening your skin, on the other hand, is about using certain products or treatments to lighten existing pigmentation.","305":"Well, the 'trucker tan' is mostly a reference to the tan lines usually appearing on the arms and neck of, you guessed it, truck drivers. But in terms of a full body 'clothe tan', it's not quite the same as a traditional tan. The texture of the cloth may block some UV rays, but it doesn't necessarily prevent all of them, especially those longer wavelengths that are responsible for tanning. Therefore, while you may not get a deeper tan as easily as if you were in minimal clothing or no clothes at all, you're still being exposed to sunlight and tanning to some extent. As for your second question, I mentioned the distinction to emphasize that while avoiding direct sunlight can help prevent tanning, intentional skin lightening involves more than just avoiding the sun - it typically involves the use of harmful substances or medical procedures.","306":null,"307":"I have been discussing the usage of skin care products like sunscreens and creams that are meant for preventing tanning and lightening the skin tone. You asked me about their difference, but they are related because both types of products help to maintain or improve the skin's health and appearance by either preventing tanning or lightening the skin.","308":"Actually, clothing does provide some protection against tanning, but not enough to completely prevent it. As for the risk of tanning and skin lightening, they're related in the sense that both are responses to exposure to harmful UV rays from the sun. However, the question was about intentionally lightening your skin, which is a different issue altogether. Regular sun exposure can lead to premature aging, increased risk of skin cancers, and even skin discoloration, which is why it's important to protect your skin from the sun.","309":"Well, if you rely on clothes to protect you from the sun's harmful rays, then you might be setting yourself up for a potential sunburn. Clothes can provide some protection, but their effectiveness depends on the material, the thickness, and how loose they fit. However, simply relying on them alone is not a smart decision. It's always better to use sunscreen, seek shade, and cover up when possible for comprehensive sun protection.","310":"Noble gases are called so because they are very stable and do not readily form compounds with other elements. This is unlike other gases that can easily share or exchange electrons to form compounds. The term 'Noble' isn't a direct reference to aristocrats or Buddhism, but it does convey a sense of nobility or high status due to their exceptional stability.","311":null,"312":"No, because the 7th or 8th or 9th or 10th periodic row (or groups) would contain elements that have similar properties due to their electron configuration but with more electrons than what we see in the current periodic table. This means those elements don't exist in nature currently, as our chemistry labs and technology has not yet been able to synthesize them. Also, lead is the heaviest stable element, and as you observed in the provided link, it has many radioactive isotopes but no stable isotopes heavier than it, hence it cannot decay into another element.","313":"I base this on the fact that elements beyond lead, the 82nd element in the Periodic Table, have not yet been discovered. The heavier elements are predicted to be unstable and have extremely short lifespans, making it difficult to observe them.","314":"You're right, the pace of discovery has indeed accelerated. However, predicting the exact timeline for discovering elements far into the periodic table is quite challenging. The resources and technology required increase exponentially. For instance, it took thousands of years to discover elements up to uranium (92), then approximately 70 years for the 7th row elements. But the gap between discoveries of the 8th row elements and the one you mentioned, element 169, might be significantly longer. It could take hundreds of years to reach element 10,000, but it's hard to say for certain. The field is constantly evolving, and new techniques are being developed to make such discoveries possible. But, as of now, reaching elements far into the periodic table remains a daunting task.","315":"Well, we have evidence that the universe is not at it's center. Galileo's findings with his telescope, Edwin Hubble's discovery of redshifts in distant galaxies, and Albert Einstein's General Theory of Relativity all serve as proof that the Earth and the solar system are not at the center of the universe.","316":"No, actually it doesn't. In terms of general relativity, light being affected by gravity isn't a contradiction. It's a confirmation of the theory's accuracy. The theory predicts that light will bend around massive objects, and that's exactly what we observe.","317":"What I meant was, if we were at the center of the universe, galaxies wouldn't be moving 'towards' us due to their accelerating expansion, but rather moving away from us. The universe is not static, and doesn't have an edge for galaxies to rebound off of. So, the concept of galaxies moving 'towards' us only makes sense when we observe ourselves as one of the galaxies in the universe, not the center. And yes, you're right, the physics would still work in the sense that gravity can account for things moving 'toward' us if they're pulled by some other mass, but in the context of the universe as a whole, galaxies are moving away from each other due to accelerating expansion, not towards any specific point.","318":"When our body's temperature drops unexpectedly, our muscles contract in a rapid sequence causing 'goosebumps'. This is a natural response to conserve heat. However, when the shivering involves the entire body, it's often due to an abrupt drop in temperature or a strong emotional response, such as fear or excitement, that triggers this response. Even though people might get full body shivers without other obvious symptoms, it's generally harmless. However, consistent and unexplained shivering could indicate health issues, such as low blood sugar, anemia, or hypothyroidism. It's always a good idea to consult a healthcare professional if the shivering persists.","319":"But please take their responses with a grain of salt. I do recommend consulting a doctor especially if your symptoms persist or worsen.","320":"Sounds like you're looking for an explanation rather than a diagnosis. While it's not uncommon for our bodies to have what seems like a misfire from time to time, it's important to note that these can often have various causes. Without knowing the specific symptoms you're experiencing, I'm unable to provide a detailed explanation. It would be a good idea to consult a medical professional if you're concerned about these incidents. They can give you a definitive answer regarding the potential causes.","321":"It sounds like you have a good mental recall of the object or image, but you're unable to visually picturize it in your mind. This is known as aphantasia, a condition where individuals cannot intentionally generate mental imagery. It's not a major problem, but it can make certain activities like reading or visualizing complex concepts more challenging.","322":"The flu shot helps protect you from getting the flu by creating an immune response. It reduces the risk of contracting the flu, and if you do get it, it usually lessens the severity of the symptoms.","323":"In most countries, you should be able to find a general practitioner or a family doctor whom you can consult for non-emergency health-related issues. They can advise you on preventive measures for diseases, offer routine check-ups, prescribe medication when needed, and refer you to specialists if necessary. If you don't already have a primary care provider, searching for one in your area or consulting with a local health department can be helpful.","324":"Period refers to the end of a declarative sentence in English language, marking its completion in a written text. In speech, we might pause at the end of a sentence. In writing, we often add a period (.) at the end of sentences to indicate their end.","325":null,"326":"Well, when we talk about 'first few steps of computing', it usually refers to machine learning. Here's a simplified explanation: Initially, a computer doesn't know anything, it's like a blank slate. However, we can teach a computer to recognize patterns or make decisions by showing it lots of examples, also known as training data. For instance, if we want to teach a computer to recognize images of cats, we would show it thousands of pictures of cats and tell the computer 'this is a cat'. After enough training, the computer starts to recognize patterns in the images that help it make a decision about whether a new image is a cat or not. This process is like a child learning to recognize a cat by being shown many pictures. After enough practice, the child can eventually recognize a cat on their own.","327":"While migrants may be many in number, they are already a significant burden on many European countries' resources, particularly when it comes to housing, employment, and healthcare. If Erdogan were to release more migrants into Europe, the already strained resources could become overwhelmed, leading to worsening living conditions, increased competition for jobs, and delays in healthcare for both citizens and existing migrants.","328":"It must be really important to you to get upvotes that you feel the need to mention it being only 1 in 4.","329":"Blood vessels in your hands constrict in cold weather, reducing blood flow in your fingers. When you smash your finger at a lower temperature, there's less blood to act as a cushion, and the pain impulses can reach your brain at a higher intensity, making it feel more severe.","330":"Gosh, that sounds terrible. It must be a struggle for you to do things outdoors during the winter season. Maybe investing in some high-quality gloves could help alleviate the issue, or perhaps even gloves with heating elements that are designed for extreme cold conditions.","331":"Well, it's an interesting idea, but I'm not really sure if I can secure a hair dryer to my head while working.","332":"Because of inflation and cost of living increases, the same amount of income that a parent had before now buys fewer goods and services than before, making it more expensive to provide for a child's needs, which include increased education and healthcare costs.","333":"Yes, that is my point. The cost of raising a child overall has likely increased over the years as prices rise for various goods and services, but the amount that parents are willing to spend on their children - the disposable income - has also increased, leading to a higher average expenditure on children.","334":"Perhaps they are influencing their kids to desire certain things based on their own preferences and lifestyle. However, it's also important to consider the self-realization aspect, as children grow up and develop their own values and aspirations. While they might be exposed to a certain lifestyle, they may not necessarily feel pressured to replicate it if they find satisfaction in other areas. Ultimately, it's a combination of factors that shape an individual's desires and life choices.","335":null,"336":"Investing back into the business allows the company to increase its value over time. If the value of the company increases, the value of your shares should also increase. So while you may not directly receive dividends, the increase in the value of your shares can provide a return on your investment. Additionally, there is the potential for capital gains when you sell your shares. The ultimate goal is to eventually sell your shares for a higher price than what you purchased them for.","337":"Because, by reinvesting dividends back into the company, you're essentially buying more shares. The board of directors, however, chooses whether to pay out dividends or reinvest the profits in the company for potential growth. This decision is often made based on the company's financial needs, future growth plans, and the belief that the stock will appreciate over time. By doing so, they hope to offer shareholders long-term growth rather than immediate returns in the form of dividends.","338":"The common cold is caused by a virus, specifically rhinoviruses. These viruses survive in the environment (like on surfaces) for a few hours to a few days, depending on factors such as temperature and humidity. During the off-season, when the number of people susceptible to infection decreases, the likelihood of transmission also decreases. However, the virus doesn't disappear entirely, continuing to exist in the environment. When the weather gets colder again and people spend more time indoors, close contact increases, allowing the virus to spread again and causing an uptick in cold cases","339":"You are correct that it can seem contradictory to have complex passwords and simple security questions. The rationale behind this is that complex passwords help to protect your account from brute-force attacks and automated bots that try to guess your password through trial and error. On the other hand, security questions are designed to provide an additional level of authentication, often serving as a backup method when you forget your password. However, these questions are meant to be easy to remember for you as the account holder, not to be overly secure, because the answers are often easily found or guessed based on public information. The idea is that the security questions serve as a second layer of verification, in addition to the complex password, to ensure that only you can access your account.","340":"Yes, while it's true some of that information could be found through various means, it's important to note that the likelihood of a random stranger having access to all this detailed personal information is quite low. Additionally, banks and credit card companies use information from public sources for their applications as you mentioned, but there are millions of people with similar details, so the specific combination of your first dog's name, street you grew up on, and high school mascot makes it much harder to impersonate you even if some information is publicly available. The question becomes more secure when combined with a strong password.","341":"However, having a security system in place could make it much harder for the attacker, potentially increasing the effort required exponentially. This way, the attacker would have to put in much more time and resources, making the attack less feasible.","342":"Harvey Weinstein was convicted on charges of sexual assault and rape. He was sentenced to 23 years in prison because a jury found him guilty of committing non-consensual sex with multiple women over a number of years.","343":"I'm sorry to hear that you feel that way about the course of our conversation so far. However, the topic at hand is about the payment terms for astute tutoring sessions. In order to schedule a session, it's necessary to pay the full hour upfront. I apologize for any confusion, and if you have concerns or questions about the material we'll be covering in the session, feel free to ask for clarification.","344":"Most corporate workplaces follow a certain dress code to maintain a professional and unified appearance. Though natural hairstyles are increasingly being accepted, traditionally, short, neat, and conservative haircuts were more common in such settings. Afros tend to be large in volume and can come in various natural textures, which may be less common in corporate settings and thus be considered less fitting for the workplace.","345":"I don't think that's necessarily the case. But in a corporate setting, you might want to present a more conventional image to your colleagues and clients. However, it's important to be true to yourself. If you feel comfortable expressing your individuality, then go for it. Just keep in mind that some organizations may have dress codes or guidelines regarding personal appearances.","346":"In terms of the business career, it's important to remember that most industries are becoming more accepting and diverse. However, some industries like corporate banking or consulting might have stricter expectations on appearance due to their traditional norms. It's not that a person who believes in self-expression is unsuitable for the business career, but their unique expression might create certain challenges or misperceptions that they'll have to navigate. It's essential to research the specific industry, company culture, and position you're interested in to determine if it aligns with your personal values and style.","347":"There have been several such supercontinents in Earth's history, with Pangea being one of them. The formation of a supercontinent is a part of the supercontinent cycle, where Earth's plates drift and eventually form a large land mass, then break apart, and reform again after a few hundred million years.","348":"Indeed, future scientists could potentially learn about past plate tectonic movements from the geological evidence left behind and apply that knowledge to making projections about future movements. However, the complexity of the Earth's processes makes it impossible to predict with absolute certainty how the continents will shift over the extremely long timescales involved.","349":"That's correct. When radiation interacts with DNA, it can cause the structure to be altered, creating mutations. These mutations can disrupt the normal functioning of cells and potentially lead to cancer or other harmful effects.","350":"That's essentially correct. Cells have mechanisms to detect and repair damage, but if the damage is too severe, they undergo a process called apoptosis, or programmed cell death, to prevent the propagation of potentially harmful or non-functional cells. This is indeed a survival strategy that minimizes the risk of cancer and other diseases. In the case of skin cells, they are constantly exposed to potentially harmful UV radiation, so this mechanism serves as a protective measure.","351":"By going vegan, you can significantly reduce your carbon footprint. Agriculture, especially meat and dairy production, is a major contributor to greenhouse gas emissions. According to the United Nations' Food and Agriculture Organization, the meat industry generates more greenhouse gases than the entire transportation sector. This is because livestock produce methane, a potent greenhouse gas. Also, land used for livestock grazing and feed crops could be used to grow plants that absorb carbon dioxide instead. In addition, the water consumption for meat production is much higher than that for plant-based foods. For example, it takes about 1,800 gallons of water to produce a pound of beef compared to just 39 gallons for a pound of vegetables. Finally, deforestation for livestock farming is a major cause of habitat loss for many species. By choosing a vegan lifestyle, you can help reduce the demand for animal products, save water, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and preserve precious habitats.","352":"Walmart, as a private company, has the legal right to decide whether or not to allow unions. They can deny unions by actively opposing unionization efforts, through various tactics such as intimidating employees, providing incentives to workers to vote against unions, or manipulating elections to tip in their favor.","353":"Unionization is a rights issue, and a majority vote of employees would have to be met for the union to be recognized by law. However, the employer can challenge the unionization in court, or engage in various strategies to discourage unionization, but they cannot outright deny the vote.","354":null,"355":"The term 'Noble Gases' originates from the latin word 'Nobilis', which means 'Precious'. These gases are chemically inert and unreactive, and were considered rare or precious during the discovery period as compared to other elements. They are called 'Noble' because of their stability and unreactivity, not as a reference to aristocrats or Buddhism.","356":null,"357":null,"358":"Historically, sub-Saharan Africa has faced various challenges such as colonialism, slavery, and political instability, which have hindered its technological development. Additionally, many African countries were primarily export-driven economies, focusing on raw materials like rubber, coffee, and diamonds, with little investment in infrastructure and education. Lastly, many African countries lack access to resources, funding, and internet connectivity, making it difficult for them to catch up with more developed regions.","359":"Diseases were indeed prevalent in Africa for a long time, but what you might not realize is that many of these diseases were brought to Africa by European explorers and colonialists. These diseases had a devastating impact on the African populations and destabilized many African societies. Furthermore, many of the diseases that are still prevalent today are not unique to Africa and can be found in many other parts of the world. So, while diseases are a current issue in Africa, they are not necessarily the primary reason for the lack of development in many African nations.","360":"So, while the Black Death was indeed devastating, it's interesting to compare it to ongoing global health issues like smallpox, tuberculosis, polio, tetanus, etc. The major difference is that, unlike the Black Death, many of these diseases have vaccines developed for them.","361":"Your argument fails to recognize that a single scientist's validation does not make a theory or belief true, but it adds significant credibility. Newton\u2019s theory of gravity was a substantial leap forward in our understanding of the physical world, and it was later built upon by Einstein. However, the existence or non-existence of an afterlife falls outside the scope of empirical science, which requires evidence that can be tested and repeated. Therefore, beliefs about an afterlife are more commonly held based on personal faith and not on empirical evidence. Furthermore, the fact that some people believe in an afterlife does not disprove its existence any more than the fact that others don't believe in it proves it doesn't exist.","362":"It's not about the belief in a higher power itself, it's about the potential impact of personal beliefs on one's scientific approach. I'm not suggesting that all believers are ill-equipped to do science, but it's possible that beliefs could potentially influence the way one interprets scientific data or approaches a research question. As for consciousness and death, I didn't claim to know for sure, but many scientists base their understanding on empirical evidence and scientific inquiry, rather than personal beliefs or faith.","363":"Not necessarily. This is because the reduction or elimination of private health coverage costs could vary significantly depending on numerous factors, including the specifics of the healthcare plan, the employee's health status, and current market conditions. Consequently, the overall financial impact might not balance out for every individual.","364":"Companies do have incentives to cut costs and increase efficiency to stay profitable, whereas government agencies do not have such incentives. This lack of a profit motive often leads to inefficiencies.","365":"Scotsman is considered a fallacy because it allows someone to avoid a counter example to their argument by redefining who counts as a member of the group. For example, if one argues that all Scotsman are honest, but when someone presents a dishonest Scotsman as a counterexample, the arguer can simply say 'no, that's not a true Scotsman' ","366":"Actually, that's the exact point. When Person 1 says 'All X's are Y's', Person 2 might have a different idea of what X stands for. If X doesn't fit Person 1's definition of X (i.e., an X that is also a Y), then according to Person 1's definition, X1 cannot be an X.","367":"So essentially, when you book a round-trip flight with a stopover city in the middle, the 'Hidden City' tactic allows you to disregard the portion of the flight that involves the stopover city, and only use the first or last leg of the trip. This discrepancy in the used and booked part of the ticket can lead you to save costs as the stopover city ticket can often be pricier than the first or last leg. However, it's important to note that airlines may have penalties for altering the ticket once it is booked, so it's all about weighing the cost savings against the risk of possible penalties.","368":"But when a meal is left behind, the restaurant still has to pay for the full cost of the meal, even though they didn't serve it. In the airline's case, they still need to fly the empty seat to their hub city and back, even if they can't sell it. So, while they can charge more and save on certain costs, they still incur costs for any empty seat that doesn't get filled.","369":"What you are buying is a service. You are paying for a guaranteed seat, which is a physical thing (since the plane is a physical object). That seat can't be sold a second time because it's taken. But the cost of the service that you're paying for, market value, goes beyond just the cost of maintaining that physical seat. It covers various other costs like staff salaries, fuel costs, maintenance costs, overheads and many more. When you miss the flight, the seat is still empty, and the airline still needs to pay for the service you originally bought, but they don't get the income from it. So while they still cover the cost of the empty seat, they lose the income from the service on that seat. It's similar to a restaurant. If they can't serve meals on all tables, even if the empty tables don't cost anything to maintain (since the restaurant itself is already paid for), the restaurant still loses income from those meals that weren't served.","370":null,"371":"I appreciate your commitment to supporting a cause that matters to you, but we are here to discuss the original topic, not to make personal donations or threats.

Assembly Language uses symbols for the computer's hardware components and operations, such as MOV for moving data and JMP for jumping to a different part of the program. These symbols translate to machine code (sequences of 1s and 0s) when compiled. So, when the CPU executes the BIOS program, it's essentially interpreting these symbols as commands to manipulate the hardware (like the storage media, screen, and keyboard), leading to the computer performing operations (like booting up and displaying the login screen).","373":"It follows the instruction set, specifically the corresponding instruction for the binary number it received. For example, if the binary number corresponds to the 'ADD' instruction (which means 'Add'), it will add the number it got from the memory location specified with the instruction to the accumulator (a special memory location in the CPU where it temporarily stores values). This operation is performed automatically since it's hard-coded into the CPU based on the arrangement of its components.","374":"First, the program must decide what 8 represents in the context of the program - such as a specific pixel position. Then, it converts that representation to a set of instructions that the computer can perform to draw the pixel on the screen, based on its position, color, and other attributes.","375":"Actually, the fallacy arises because they have different understandings of the term X, leading to a miscommunication.","376":"Well, consciousness is still a mystery to science, but we do know that when neurons fire, they create electrical waves called action potentials. These waves move through the brain and connect with other neurons, forming complex networks of connections called synapses. These synapses are thought to be the basis of our thoughts and memories. However, we don't yet understand exactly how clusters of neurons firing together create the subjective experience of thought, known as consciousness. This is an active area of research in neuroscience.","377":"Yes, it sounds like you're describing a form of mental representation or visualization, where you can understand the structure and components of an object, but finding it difficult to bring that mental image to a vivid, visual reality.

If my memory serves, the quote you're alluding to may be from neurologist Oliver Sacks, who wrote about topics like this extensively.","378":"It sounds like you discovered the power of visual thinking, just like Richard Feynman did when Bernie Walker challenged him. Imagination is a powerful tool that can help you better understand concepts and think outside the box. So, keep exploring the limitless world of your mind!","379":"No, because time in physics isn't the same as what we perceive as the fourth dimension. Time in the conventional sense is a changing process in our 3-dimensional world, not a static fourth dimension that objects can exist in. Imagine a 2D creature living on a single sheet of paper. They can move around on the paper, but they can't travel up off the paper. Similarly, we can't leave our 3-dimensional world and explore the 4th dimension of time as a static space.","380":"A period is a point in time that marks the end of a certain cycle or event. For example, in a sentence, a period (.) signals the end of a statement or an independent clause. When you type a period at the end of a sentence, it indicates that the sentence has completed and it is finished.","381":"Historically, there were various factors at play. For instance, sub-Saharan Africa was a major hub for ancient trade routes, but it was primarily focused on the exchange of products like gold, salt, ivory, and spices. As a result, the region was not exposed to the technological innovations that were shaping other parts of the world at the time. Additionally, the emergence of the transatlantic slave trade had a profound impact, with millions of individuals forcibly removed from Africa, especially West Africa, taking their skills and knowledge with them. Following liberation from colonial rule, many African countries were left with a weak infrastructure, limited education systems, and a focus on agriculture over manufacturing, making it difficult for technological advancement to take root.","382":null,"383":"Your way of declaring variables can make the code difficult to read and maintain.

It can indeed come back, and the number of people can potentially bring it back if they get infected and spread it. However, it's important to note that getting vaccinated and following public health guidelines like wearing masks, washing hands, and maintaining social distancing can help prevent the resurgence of influenza and manage its spread effectively.","386":"Flu viruses are more stable and survives better in cold and dry environments. So, during winter when the temperature drops, the viruses are more likely to be transmitted from an infected person to others via droplets in the air when they cough, sneeze or talk. Also, people tend to spend more time indoors during winter, which increases the chances of transmission as well.","387":"It's a result of the stress response mechanism in the body. During stressful situations like a breakup, your body releases hormones such as adrenaline and cortisol. These hormones increase your heart rate, blood pressure, and activate the 'fight or flight' response. This can cause physical symptoms like nausea, loss of appetite, and stomach discomfort. Additionally, emotions like sadness and anxiety can also directly affect the gastrointestinal system leading to these symptoms.","388":"I'm really glad that I could share my story with you and hope that it gives you some motivation to face your challenges head on, just like I did.

They don't have desires or intentions in the human sense. However, from a scientific perspective, self-replication is a mechanism that allows survival of the genetic material. In the process of self-replication, living organisms create copies of their DNA, passing it on to the next generation. This ensures the perpetuation of the genetic information and the continued existence of the species. Similarly, viruses need to replicate to spread and infect other cells.","391":"Viruses' complexity comes from the intricate arrangement of chemical components, such as proteins and nucleotides, that make up their genetic material and protein capsule. This complexity is the result of a long evolutionary process. The elements on the periodic table do not have this organic organization; they are simple in terms of their chemical structure and interactions. Over time, the emergence of complex molecules like RNA and DNA, capable of storing and transmitting genetic information, allowed for the development of more complex organisms. These genetic materials underwent numerous mutations and replications, gradually evolving into the complex biological organisms we see today.","392":"Actually, even though bio-fuel does emit greenhouse gasses, they are less in comparison to fossil fuels.

The Milky Way and Andromeda galaxies (for example) are moving away from each other, and we don't observe them moving towards us. The analogy of dropping a rock into a lake and the waves rippling outwards is a good one - the galaxies are expanding away from a 'center-point', with the universe being that point. Objects with lower masses do move faster due to their lower dense matter, but this doesn't imply they are moving towards us.","407":null,"408":"You might be thinking of the Tradang or Tradang Bawong, practices related to castration in some parts of Malay culture. These practices were believed to bestow certain powers or protect the practitioner from evil or bad influences. However, these practices are now frowned upon and considered illegal.","409":"In this context, I was suggesting that you should be careful with how you define biological because it can be used as an adjective to describe something that is related to biology or living organisms. However, when you mentioned that biology is 'the study of living organisms', what you said is an accurate definition. But it's important to note that you can't say 'biological' means 'the study of living organisms'. 'Biological' is the adjective form derived from the noun 'biology', and it's used to describe something related to biology or living organisms. So, although biology is a field of study related to living organisms, it's not the definition of biological. I hope this helps clear up any confusion.","410":"The question of whether or not a 13 year old girl's biological development is sufficient for her to raise a child on her own is unclear without further context and professional evaluation, as it involves both physical and mental aspects of development that may not be fully matured at 13.","411":"However, time is a dynamic dimension that moves forward, not a static property that objects have. A more accurate way to think of it is that the world is a collection of events happening at different points in time, not objects existing at different points in a fixed 4-dimensional space.","412":"Well, think of a square shape like a room. Its length and width determine its area. If the length and width are both the same (i.e., a square), then the area is calculated by multiplying the length by itself, which is known as squaring. In mathematical terms, if the length of the side is 'a', the area would be 'a*a' or 'a^2'. So, the area of a square is the square of its side length. On the other hand, a square root is the inverse operation which gives you the length of a side when you know the area. For example, if the area of a square is 9, its side length (or the square root of 9) is 3, since 3*3 equals 9. This concept is important in many everyday examples, such as calculating the area of a field or the size of a structure.","413":"Yes, that's correct. When radiation interacts with DNA, it can cause changes in the DNA structure, leading to mutations. Unlike regular body cells, cells that reproduce, such as the ones in our bones, skin, and blood, cannot repair these mutations as effectively. Over time, these mutations can lead to the development of cancer and other serious health problems.","414":"Exactly, natural selection would favor those who die prematurely and limit cancer growth over those who don't. This is a simplified explanation, as it's not the only factor at play, but it does provide a basis for understanding why cells have such a powerful mechanism against excessive

The placement and number of elements within the table are determined by the behavior of protons in the nucleus and their corresponding electron energy levels. As the number of protons increases, the nucleus becomes more unstable, which makes it challenging to discover or create elements with a large number of protons. Hence, the addition of a 9th row is not expected.","19":"Based on our current understanding of the periodic table, as we progress from one row to the next, the elements' properties, such as atomic mass and decay rate, tend to increase. The last elements on the 7th row have already decayed in fractions of seconds due to their unstable properties. Since the 8th row, which remains to be fully explored and studied, contains 50 elements to fill, it's sensible to assume that the properties of elements in the 8th and 9th row, if they exist, might be too unstable for practical applications.","20":"While I understand the perspective you're presenting, I'd like to emphasize the significance of relying on facts and evidence over fear and sensationalism.

Schools often focus on the scientific aspects of puberty because they aim to provide a foundation of understanding rather than delve into specific cosmetic changes. Every person undergoes puberty at their own pace, which means that the timeline for physical changes can vary greatly. In terms of hair growth, it tends to be influenced by hormones such as testosterone, leading to differences in the amount and rate of hair growth among boys. Rest assured, both situations are entirely normal. If you have any specific questions or concerns, I'm here to help.","36":"Generally, girls tend to start puberty earlier than boys and experience more physical changes, such as menstruation, breast development, and changes in their hips. However, it's important to note that these physical differences do not make the experiences of boys during puberty any less complicated. Every individual's body reacts differently, and it's crucial for both boys and girls to understand their bodies and what to expect as they mature.","37":"Oversleeping or poor quality sleep can interrupt your body\u2019s natural sleep rhythm, known as the circadian rhythm.

Once the sponge cools down, the trapped water continues to offer a suitable environment for bacteria to proliferate.","40":null,"41":"The name 'Noble Gases' comes from their unique chemical behavior. These gases, including helium, neon, argon, krypton, xenon, and radon, have a full set of electrons in their outermost energy level. This makes them less reactive, meaning they don't easily form chemical compounds. This stability led to them being named 'Noble Gases', which refers to their regal-like nature, as they hold themselves apart from other elements. Unlike the title 'Noble' for aristocrats, it's not a crack or a reference, but simply an acknowledgment of their unique qualities.","42":"That's quite a compelling claim.

Each of these words is assigned to a specific pixel and contains 8 bits dedicated to each of the R, G, and B components respectively. Given that each pixel requires at least 3 transistors (one for each color channel), the number of transistors needed would likely be in the millions, factoring in the hundreds of millions to billions of pixels in a single frame.","63":"In digital systems, where transistors can be 'on' (or fully conducting) or 'off' (not conducting), the strong 'on' state of one transistor can provide enough charge to turn on the gate of another if they are properly connected. However, in the continuous, analog signal system, the output may not be strong enough because it can have small or zero values, which might not be able to max out another transistor's gate.","64":"Analog signals can represent a continuous range of values using varying voltage levels or other physical quantities such as position, pressure, and temperature, for example, in audio, an analog signal might represent the vibrations of a diaphragm in a microphone, and this continuous waveform can be varied based on the intensity and frequency of the sound.","65":"The sun emits light in all directions, but the Earth blocks most of this light from reaching areas beyond it, leaving space dark. As a shuttle moves away from Earth, it moves out of the path of the light the sun emits, which is why it appears dark. Additionally, space has no atmosphere or particles to scatter or reflect this light, making it appear even darker.","66":null,"67":null,"68":"Indeed, the argument for gold-based currency isn't just focused on profit-making, but also on providing stability for the value of money, as the supply of gold is relatively fixed compared to fiat currency. In some cases, gold's stability can help safeguard money from inflation. Also, a return to the gold standard would eliminate the need for central banks, which could potentially reduce the politicization of monetary policy. For historical reference, a political party during the late 19th century in the United States advocated for the resumption of silver coinage at a ratio with gold, effectively promoting inflation - this was the Free Silver Party. Lastly, while counterfeiting can be challenging and risky, it's crucial to remember that such activities are unethical and illegal.","69":null,"70":"You can consult a family doctor or a local healthcare provider for regular check-ups and immunization advice against diseases like measles and chickenpox.

Additionally, mismanagement can aggravate water shortages, particularly in certain geographic areas where freshwater is already scarce.","73":null,"74":null,"75":"A period, in its broad sense, is the full cycle of a repeating event or process; it can be applied to various contexts, such as the menstrual cycle in females or the cycle of waves at the beach. Specifically, in physics, the period denotes the time elapsed between successive high or low points of a wave or an oscillation. It's the duration required for a complete oscillation or wave cycle.","76":"The vagina, while crucial for childbirth and sexual intimacy, isn't part of the urinary system. It's one of the main components of the female reproductive system, which also includes the uterus, ovaries, fallopian tubes, and external sex organs. During pregnancy, the uterus, which is located just above the bladder, expands, putting pressure on the bladder, causing frequent urination.

This discrepancy arises from the tension between two different aspects of security. Complex passwords are used to protect your account from brute force attacks or dictionary attacks, which try to guess your password through a list of common words or phrases. On the other hand, security questions are typically used as a backup mechanism to help you recover your account if you forget your password. They are less secure because the answers are often available to others, such as your friends, family, or even people who know you well. This is why it's essential to use secure answers for security questions, like coming up with unique responses or answering obscure questions that are less likely to be known by others. The ideal situation would be to have both strong passwords and secure answers for security questions, but it can be difficult to strike a balance between usability and security.","87":null,"88":null,"89":"Cleaning water is a costly and energy-intensive process, requiring extensive infrastructure such as treatment plants.

This unusual event shows the Earth's shadow illuminated on the topside of the moon as it dips below the horizon.","102":"The Moon's orbit around the Earth is significantly elliptical, not perfectly circular. This means that its position relative to the sun isn't always directly on the opposite side. It's the combination of the Earth-Moon-Sun alignment, and the Moon's tilted spin that determines where the sun and lunar shadow appear. When the sun, Earth, and Moon align such that the sun and the lunar shadow fall on the same side of the moon, it gives us the appearance of a crescent moon.","103":null,"104":null,"105":null,"106":"Neurons interact through electrical signals, known as action potentials, forming a neural network.

Instead, always aim to name your variables in a way that accurately describes their purpose.","295":"The Constitution sets a minimum age (35 y.o.) for running for US president because the founders believed this age would provide enough experience and maturity for the role. Surprisingly, it doesn't set a maximum age limit, so there's no legal bar for becoming president at a certain age as long as the candidate is still eligible and qualified according to the Constitution.","296":"In the US, typically write-in votes are only counted if they are for a candidate who is already officially on the ballot. However, exceptions do exist, such as when an independent or third-party candidate has sufficient support and a positive impact on the election process. Yet writing in a completely new candidate without any presence in the election is unlikely to be counted.","297":"Narcoanalysis tests are not used in every trial because they have several limitations. For example, they can only be administered when someone is intoxicated, making it impossible to use on unconscious or deceased individuals. Additionally, test results are not always definitive and could be influenced by the test subject's mood, stress level, or other factors. Furthermore, narcoanalysis may cause side effects like memory loss, hallucinations, and discomfort. As such, many legal systems favor other methods of gathering evidence such as witness testimonies, audio or video recordings, or physical evidence, due to their reliability and applicability in a wider range of situations.","298":"The analogy is that while breaking your arm and having bone cancer are both undesirable in medical terms, the current system of handling criminal cases is similarly imperfect and complex. In this context, the proposed use of narco tests, represented by breaking your arm, is faster and more straightforward than the current system, represented by having bone cancer. The complications, delays, and potential for miscarriages of justice associated with the current system are comparable to the potential inaccuracies or misuse of narco tests.","299":null,"300":"Tanning by white people is often associated with achieving a 'healthy' or 'attractive' look, while skin lightening by non-white people is typically seen as an attempt to match the perceived superiority of white skin. Both practices have roots in colonialism and racism. It's essential to recognize that these practices can be damaging to individuals' health and self-esteem, and to instead focus on acceptance and appreciation of all skin tones as naturally beautiful.","301":"However, you're right when speaking about artificial or intentional skin lightening. This is accomplished through different means such as self-tanners, chemical peels, or bleaching creams, which aren't a natural process like tanning from sun exposure. These methods allow people to alter their skin tone at will.","302":null,"303":"I appreciate your clarification. In the tanning scenario, the concern is sunburn, which can be prevented by using sunblock. On the other hand, in the skin-lightening scenario, the goal may not necessarily be to harm the skin, but to achieve a desired appearance. The inconsistency in my earlier response was due to my focus on the harmful potential of skincare practices, without fully considering the context or the purpose of each practice.","304":null,"305":"While a cloth may provide some protection against sunburn, it won't entirely prevent tanning. The texture and weave of the cloth can allow certain UV rays to pass through, particularly the longer wavelength ones that contribute to the tanning process. So, even with clothing, you're still getting some exposure to sunlight and ultimately, some tanning. However, it's different from an intentional tan, which would require prolonged exposure to UV rays. In terms of skin lightening, it's a separate issue that often involves potentially harmful substances or procedures, rather than just avoiding sunlight.","306":"I apologize if my previous response seemed unclear. The link I provided explains that while it is technically possible to tan through some clothes, the tan is not as even and may not be as deep as if you were tanning without clothes. Clothes can also provide some protection against the sun's harmful rays. However, it's always best to wear sunscreen and protect your skin as much as possible when spending time in the sun.","307":"I've been discussing skin care products such as sunscreens and creams that are designed to either prevent tanning or lighten the skin tone. The question was about their differences, but they are connected because both types of products work towards maintaining or enhancing the skin's health and appearance, either by preventing an unwanted tanning process or lightening the current skin tone.","308":"What I mean to convey is that while clothing does provide some shield against sun rays, it is not a definitive barrier against tanning. As for the conundrum of tanning and skin lightening, they indeed share a common thread, both being consequences of excessive UV exposure. Yet, the question here pertains to the deliberate attempt to lighten one's skin, a practice that can have harmful effects on your overall health. Regular sun exposure, despite the occasional lure of a 'trucker' tan, can lead to premature aging, increased skin cancer risks, and potential discoloration, making it essential to protect your skin.","309":null,"310":"The name 'Noble Gases' derives from their unique property of being highly stable and unwilling to share or form complex bonding structures with other atoms, unlike most elements in the periodic table. This inability to form compounds gives them an air of distinction and refinement\u2014much like the nobility of history. However, it's essential to understand that this terminology doesn't carry any direct religious, philosophical, or political connotations despite the connotation of nobility.","311":"Well, contrary to your initial impression, noble elements such as radon do not naturally transform into lead. As members of the noble gas group, they are the most chemically inert elements, so they generally just decay and emit subatomic particles, not undergo transmutation into another element. Lead, on the other hand, is a stable element with an extremely long half-life of about 1.4 billion years which means it doesn't decay at a significant rate under normal conditions.","312":null,"313":null,"314":null,"315":null,"316":null,"317":"What I meant was, if we were at the center of the universe, galaxies wouldn't be moving 'towards' us because they're not moving towards anything due to their accelerating expansion. It's important to remember that the universe is not static and doesn't have an edge for galaxies to rebound off of. Essentially, the idea of galaxies moving 'towards' us only makes sense when we're observing ourselves as one of the galaxies in the cosmos, not the center. However, you're entirely correct that the physics would still allow for things to move 'toward' us if they're pulled by other masses. But in the context of the entire universe, galaxies are moving away from each other due to accelerating expansion, not towards any particular point.","318":"Full-body shivers can occur when our body unexpectedly experiences a drop in temperature or experiences an intense emotional response, such as fear or excitement. This is the body's natural way of attempting to conserve heat. The shivering happens due to the tightening of muscle fibers in a rapid sequence, a process also known as 'goosebumps'. While it's generally harmless in occasional occurrences, persistent and unexplained shivering could signal underlying health issues, such as hypothermia, low blood sugar levels, or hypothyroidism. If you experience consistent and unexplained full-body shivering, it's a good idea to consult a healthcare professional.","319":"While it's encouraging to hear various insights, I strongly urge you to seek professional medical advice.

Earth's seen quite a few supercontinents before, with Pangea being one of them. This massive land joining up is part of a cycle, where the Earth's plates move and eventually come together again. So, if these continental movements don't drastically alter the course, expect a new supercontinent in about 250 million years. There are many theories like Novopangea, Pangea Proxima\/Ultima, Aurica, and Amasia. And interestingly, most theories predict a significant concentration of land in the northern hemisphere. So, keep an eye out in the future for the landmass shifts!","348":"Indeed, future geologists could potentially study the geological evidence left behind and apply that knowledge to making educated guesses about future movements.

However, if the damage is too extensive, they initiate a process called 'apoptosis,' or programmed cell death, to eliminate potentially harmful or non-functional cells. This, as you pointed out, is an evolutionary adaptation that minimizes the risk of diseases such as cancer. In the case of skin cells, their constant exposure to UV radiation necessitates this protective mechanism.","351":"When you opt for a vegan lifestyle, you can greatly decrease your carbon footprint. The United Nations' Food and Agriculture Organization has reported that the meat industry is responsible for more greenhouse gas emissions than the entire transportation sector - this is due to livestock generating methane, a potent greenhouse gas. Moreover, the land used for livestock grazing and feed crops could be better used for growing plants that absorb carbon dioxide. It's also worth noting that water consumption for meat production is significantly higher than for plant-based foods: 1,800 gallons of water are typically used to produce a pound of beef, whereas only 39 gallons are required for a pound of vegetables. Lastly, deforestation for livestock farming is a key cause of habitat loss for numerous species. By adopting a vegan lifestyle, you can help cut down on the demand for animal products, save water, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and preserve habitats, all while making a positive impact on our environment.","352":"Walmart, as a private company, has the right to decide whether or not to allow unions.

The question at hand was about the theoretical possibility, and while it's an interesting thought experiment, it's important to remember that our current understanding of chemistry and physics makes such processes highly unlikely.","357":"In that case, flooding the world with gold might dilute its value, causing it to lose its allure as a precious and scarce resource. This could potentially shift society's focus towards more practical and essential items like you mentioned, such as food, medicine, and shelter. However, the cultural significance and symbolic value of gold may persist even in this scenario, given its historical importance in many societies.","358":"The historical context plays a significant role in the perceived technological gap in sub-Saharan Africa. Centuries of colonialism, slave trade, and political instability have imposed numerous obstacles, impeding the region's progress. During this time, African nations were often reduced to raw material exporters with limited prioritization given to educating their populations or developing infrastructure. This was followed by a period of resource-hungry globalization which, combined with political instability and corruption, often led to mismanagement of resources and economic stagnation. Finally, the digital divide remains an issue in many African countries, with access to resources, funding, and internet connectivity far lower than in developed regions.","359":"That's an interesting point, but it's important to note that many diseases found in Africa were introduced by European explorers and colonialists. These diseases had a devastating impact on African populations and destabilized many African societies. Additionally, while diseases remain a concern in Africa, they are not necessarily the only reason for the lack of development in many African nations. Factors such as political, cultural, and economic instability, as well as historical events like colonization and slavery, have also had significant long-term impacts on Africa's progress.","360":null,"361":"My retort is not intended to disparage Professor Carroll's credibility, but rather, to emphasize the importance of a rigorous, evidence-based approach to scientific inquiry. Newton's theory of gravity was vital in shaping our understanding of the universe, and its subsequent development by Einstein has only strengthened its validity. However, the exploration of philosophical and metaphysical concepts, such as the afterlife, cannot be proved or disproved through empirical means alone. These ideas rely heavily on personal faith, experiences, and cultural norms, for which there is often a wide diversity of opinions. Therefore, the prevalence of various beliefs about the afterlife among individuals does not necessarily equate to their validity or their lack thereof.","362":"It's important to have an open mind when it comes to scientific inquiry, and personal beliefs can sometimes influence one's approach or interpretation of data. However, I didn't mean to imply that all believers are incapable of doing science, and I agree that nobody truly knows the origins of consciousness or what happens after we die.

Instead of using the entire route, you only utilize the first or last leg of the trip. This is because airlines price the stopover city and connecting flights separately, and the stopover city ticket can be more expensive than the initial or final destination legs. However, be aware that airlines may impose penalties for changing a ticket once it's been purchased, so it's crucial to evaluate the cost savings against the potential risks.","368":"However, when a meal isn't sold at the restaurant, the restaurant still bears the costs for that meal, similar to the airline's empty unoccupied seat. The airline still needs to fly an empty seat to their hub city and back, even if they can't sell it, thus incurring costs for any empty seat that remains unsold. Though they can charge more and save on certain costs, the costs associated with empty seats remain a concern.","369":"You're correct that the airline is primarily selling a service, guaranteeing a seat on a flight. However, the seat is a significant part of that service, as it's a physical resource that can't be reused once sold. The cost of the service comprises not just the maintenance of that seat, but also other expenses such as crew salaries, fuel costs, and overheads. When you don't use the seat you've purchased, the airline still needs to cover these costs but doesn't receive the associated revenue. This is akin to a restaurant: if they can't serve meals on every table, they still face the costs of maintaining those tables but don't receive payment for the lost meals.","370":null,"371":"I understand your decision to support Bernie Sanders, and that's commendable.

Pretend a 2D creature living on a sheet of paper; it can move around on the paper but can't go up off it. Similarly, we can't exit our 3D world and explore time as a separate dimension.","380":"A period is a punctuation mark that indicates the end of a thought or sentence in writing. In other words, it signals the conclusion of an idea or an independent clause. When a period is used at the end of a sentence, it means that the sentence has been completed and ended perfectly.","381":"Historically, the development of sub-Saharan Africa was influenced by a variety of factors. Firstly, the region was a significant hub for ancient trade routes primarily focused on the exchange of commodities like gold, salt, ivory, and spices. This limited the exposure of the region to the technological innovations that were shaping other parts of the world at the time.Secondly, the transatlantic slave trade had a profound and lasting impact. The forced removal of millions of individuals, especially from West Africa, took away skilled workers and knowledgeable people from the region. Following liberation from colonial rule, many African countries faced challenges such as weak infrastructure, limited education systems, and a focus on agriculture over manufacturing, which made it difficult for technological advancement to occur.","382":"The rapid spread and high mortality rate of the Black Death are indeed striking, but it's also crucial to note that some modern-day diseases, like West Nile Virus, Ebola, and malaria, have comparable or even higher fatality rates. However, the key difference lies in our ability to develop and distribute vaccines and medical treatments, which has significantly reduced the impact of these modern diseases in many parts of the world.","383":null,"384":"Did you know, in 2020, the flu didn't vanish, but it surely took a step back! Since we focused on preventing COVID-19, measures like social distancing, wearing masks, and boosting hygiene lowered the flu's spread. It's fascinating, isn't it? Let's dive deeper next time to learn more about this intriguing phenomenon! \ud83d\ude0a","385":"Influenza continues to exist, but its spread has been significantly reduced due to the measures taken for COVID-19. It can return, and in fact, a group of people might contribute to its spread if infected. It's crucial to get vaccinated and adhere to public health guidelines like wearing masks, washing hands, and keeping a safe distance to reduce the risk of influenza and its reemergence.","386":"Flu viruses are more likely to survive and be transmitted in cold, dry environments, making them more prevalent during winter months. Cold weather also encourages people to congregate indoors, which increases the overall exposure and transmission chances.","387":"During a breakup or other stressful events, your body responds through a stress response mechanism. This results in the release of hormones like adrenaline and cortisol, which boost your heart rate, blood pressure, and instigate the 'fight or flight' response. Consequently, you might experience physical symptoms like nausea, loss of appetite, and stomach discomfort. Moreover, emotions like sadness and anxiety directly influence the gastrointestinal system, contributing to these symptoms.","388":null,"389":null,"390":null,"391":null,"392":"Noted. In fact, bio-fuel does emit greenhouse gasses but on a lesser scale compared to fossil fuels. While bio-fuel might not be highly efficient in terms of energy yield, it can be a step towards a more sustainable energy future, as opposed to relying on oil that comes from unreliable sources.","393":null,"394":"Most sunscreens don't seep into your skin, instead, they remain on the surface. While a trace amount might enter your bloodstream, it doesn't get stored due to the efficient filtering system in our bodies. Instead, it's usually expelled through sweat or urine.","395":"For a comprehensive list of safe sunscreens, I'd recommend checking out the resources provided by organizations like the FDA and the Environmental Working Group (EWG). They've conducted tests and reviews to ensure the sunscreens they recommend are effective and safe to use.","396":"While it's possible for Walmart to challenge the union's representation, the final decision lies with the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) following a representation election or a hearing to address any unfair labor practice charges.","397":null,"398":null,"399":"Typically speaking, you'd expect the one-in-a-hundred event to fail 99 times out of 100 attempts.","400":"However, if infinite + 1 doesn't equal infinite + 1, then that leads to a paradox, since 1 would be equal to 1 by your reasoning, but not according to the formal definition where infinite + 1 is not equal to infinite.","401":"Alcoholism is categorized as a disease because it can alter the brain's structure and function. When alcohol is consumed frequently, the brain adjusts to this ongoing presence, impacting the way it releases certain chemicals, like dopamine, causing pleasure. This can lead to a reliance on alcohol to experience positive feelings. The brain adapting in this way can potentially result in both physical and mental health issues, much like other chronic illnesses such as diabetes or heart disease, making it a disease.","402":"Sure, non-metals include gases such as Hydrogen, Carbon (diamonds and graphite), Nitrogen, Oxygen, and halogens (Chlorine, Fluorine, Bromine, etc.). Semi-metals or Metalloids like Silicon, Germanium, and Arsenic also have properties that do not typically classify them as metals.","403":null,"404":"The observable universe suggests we are not the center. The Copernican Principle states that the Earth and the Sun are not the center of the universe. Evidence for this includes the redshift of distant galaxies, which indicates that the universe is expanding. Additionally, the discovery of exoplanets orbiting other stars suggests the existence of multiple systems, further indicating that Earth is not the center.","405":"Well, that's a great question. The expansion of the universe and the associated dimming of light from distant galaxies can indeed be complex. According to our current understanding of dark energy, its push causing the universe's accelerated expansion might be stronger than the dimming effect on the light we observe. However, it's important to note that these concepts involve intricate calculations to verify. I'd be happy to delve deeper into this if you're interested!","406":null,"407":"Some individuals who have undergone genital amputation may still experience sexual urges due to their brain's ongoing production of sex hormones. However, these individuals can explore alternative sexual gratification methods, such as masturbation without penetration, or even consider partnered relationships with individuals who are comfortable with their situation. It's important to note that everyone's experiences and coping mechanisms are unique. It's beneficial for these individuals to discuss their sexual needs and concerns with their healthcare providers and mental health professionals.","408":"In Malay and Malaysian culture, there are historical practices resembling castration known as Tradang or Tradang Bawong. Practitioners believed these practices would bestow certain powers or protect them from evil or negative influences. However, these practices are now considered illegal and frowned upon in modern times.","409":null,"410":null,"411":"In the context of your question, time is considered as a dynamic dimension, meaning it moves forward, not a static attribute of objects. A better way to envision it is that the universe's history consists of a myriad of events occurring at various moments in time, rather than objects frozen in a fixed 4-dimensional space.","412":"Imagine a square room. The area of the room, length times width, equals squaring the length of one side. In math terms, if one side is 'a', the area becomes 'a times a', or 'a squared'. So, the area of a square is just the square of its side length. Conversely, a square root is finding the side length when you know the area. Let's say a square has an area of 9, the side length (or the square root of 9) is 3, because 3 times 3 equals 9. The square root concept comes up often, like determining the area of a plot of land or the dimensions of a building.","413":"Yes, you're absolutely right. Radiation's harmful effects on our bodies come from its ability to damage DNA, primarily by altering its structure, resulting in mutations. Unlike regular body cells, rapidly dividing ones such as those in our bones, skin, and blood, aren't as adept at repairing these mutations, which can lead to the development of cancer and a host of
