You relearn whenever you get a new car and has to get used to how it feels - especially if it uses a different engine type, for example switching to diesel (or back) requires you to completely relearn how a car should feel.   Once you've learned how your car (or other motorized transport) feels at all speeds, you don't need any of the instrument panel except maybe a way to estimate how much fuel you have left.","8":"&gt;I'm not sure what I'm supposed to be missing by not looking at the RPM when changing gears?  Well, for starters you're leaving a bunch of acceleration on the table by   &gt; skipping gears  And not using the peak of your power curve as much as you could be.   If you're consistently skipping the same gear that'll sacrifice a bit of longevity, though whether you'll keep the car long enough to need it is another question.

By providing everyone with a basic income you can get people who are living on the streets the money they need to buy a house and join the market. These new people in the economy represent a group that can move into much of the empty property around the country of only they had some money to do so.","13":"You actually want the high boiling point.  We want the fluid to have certain properties when it comes out of the boiler (we don't actually want steam) and when we have a high boiling point, we can put in more energy.  Also, water can store a lot of energy before it actually changes temperature, way more than acetone.    The turbine speed is related to how much fluid you pump through it, not the temperature although the fluid type can effect that.  The thing that varies with the temperature is the torque, how hard the turbine can try to turn stuff.","14":"To start with, I made a mistake in my previous comment.  The turbine speed and torque is going to be based on super complicated fluid mechanics stuff that I don't know to well.    No, it won't have the same energy output.  Lets say that substance 1 has a boiling point of 50 degrees Celsius and substance 2 has a boiling point of 100 degrees Celsius.  Lets also say that they require the same amount of energy to heat up 1 degree Celsius (1 kj).  Substance 1 absorbs 50 kj of energy but substance 2 absorbs 100 kj.  This means that substance 2 can have more energy extracted by the turbine.    The pressure doesn't actually have much to do with it, it's actually held constant during the boiling process and a pump is used to get the liquid to the right pressure.","15":"You know, I almost included this in the last post but I decided not to include it to keep it simple.  The turbine is designed to bring the gas to supersonic speeds.  If we look at the conservation of energy, the gas needs to cool down to actually do this.  So a gas that's hotter can go faster in the turbine and faster velocities allow for more power to be generated.","16":"Look up \u201cisotopes of helium\u201d, \u201cisotopes of neon\u201d etc. on Wikipedia and there will be a section labelled \u201clist of isotopes\u201d which shows you a lot of information including what isotopes they decay into if they\u2019re radioactive.   No, noble gasses are not turning into a 19th column. what makes you think that?   Yes, hydrogen-1 will _never_ undergo radioactive decay.

So no radon is not at the end. Many radioactive isotopes undergo these sequences where they keep decaying into other isotopes until they get to a stable one.","18":"&gt;Oh cool, so does that mean that, like radon, all of the noble elements will eventually turn into lead?  What makes your ask this question? Helium will never \u201cdecay\u201d into lead, nor will neon etc.   When stars explode a large amount of heavier elements are formed, but again this isn\u2019t the same process.    &gt;Could lead ever decay into something else? Is there a half-life of lead?  I\u2019ve already told you that every single element has radioactive isotopes, see: https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Isotopes_of_lead - note just how many radioactive isotopes lead has, many are decay products from other elements, lead is the heaviest element that still has stable isotopes.   Isotopes are atoms with the same number of protons but different numbers of neutrons. Only specific configurations of protons and neutrons are stable, everything else is unstable and undergoes radioactive decay.   &gt;If lead does decay into something else, it would probably take us billions of years to find out, right?

Try this one: https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=fES21E0qebw","19":"There already is a 7th row, and within our lifetimes there likely will be some elements added to the 8th row.   There will never be a 19th group unless IUPAC decides to change the layout of the periodic table (which it won\u2019t do). Just a note on this, the periodic table actually looks like this: https:\/\/encrypted-tbn3.gstatic.com\/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcRJaY9NjvEqGbvN3HSDyyO3GKilL7zoRWTdyTCf-3xYkqXqSvTt0V_onoGqvw (google Wide Periodic Table if that doesn\u2019t work), so technically it has 32 columns but those between groups 2 and 3 aren\u2019t given group numbers.","20":"Why do you think I have any actual firsthand experience in this field? I read journals and understand the science.   It took about 70 years for the rest of the elements in the 7th row to be created, that was elements 95-118). The last few discovered decay within fractions of seconds. The faster something decays the harder it is to create and then detect.   We will likely see element 120 within 5 years, but getting to element 169 (which would be the first element on the 9th row) is going to to take a lot longer and will need improvements in technology if it can even be created at all.   Is there a reason you are so obsessed with this?","21":"Is it really important though? None of these elements have real world applications. It\u2019s mostly a dick waving contest.   If it\u2019s boring in school it\u2019s mostly because of boring teachers or boring curricula, or both. Chemistry is an amazing science because it\u2019s so essential to everything around us.   If it takes 5 years to discover element 119, and even if it takes 5 years past that for each other element you\u2019re looking at nearly 50000 years. And that\u2019s a theoretical number pulled out of nowhere with no basis in reality. There\u2019s other problems to overcome, like heavier elements needing electrons to travel at faster than the speed of light and somehow overcoming the repulsion of protons in the nucleus.","22":"Ha ha ha ha ha!!!

How would any scientific principle ever discover that, given that science is based on observation?","30":"To be clear, I am not advocating for a distrust of science.

But investment banks do not take deposits.   Want to have your company go public and be listed on a stock exchange? The can determine a listing price and distribution. Need to issue $10B in bonds, they can partner with other firms to create the terms and get them sold. Want to merge with another company? They help with due diligence and the terms and the funding (loans, stock conversions, etc.).  Traditionally (at least since the 1933 Glass\u2013Steagall legislation) these were separate institutions.

It is called the \"Ghost Frequency\" because it is theorized that many \"haunted\" areas simply produce tones close to 18.9 Hz (through resonance or other natural quirks) and people associate the fear response with a \"presence\" in the area.","71":"It is actually pretty tough to generate things that low - most speakers can't do it (since there is no point in making a sound no one can hear).  That said, yes, you could make a house \"feel\" haunted by pumping in 18.9 Hz tones - people would feel the room was \"off\".  As for physical reactions, nothing due to the sound itself but there are all sorts of physiological reactions to fear.","72":"You have like 5 people telling you the same thing and all you do is argue. So why did you ask the question at all? Either you're a troll or need to accept the answers you get or look iy up yourself and shut up","73":"There's no disagreements. It's you asking the same question 15 times expecting a different answer. Just because im telling you how it is and how you're acting doesn't mean i have issues.","74":"You think running empty planes makes money?  You think turning customers away when you could've sold them something makes money?  You honestly believe this?  &gt;they sold their ticket too cheap to cover operational costs.  1.

They priced their ticket on your *lies*, so how could it possibly be adequately priced for the market.","75":"&gt;The main thing that makes money is selling tickets  Not true.  100% incorrect.  &gt;But if the plane is underweight they can also make more by shipping cargo  Weight is weight. The plane doesn't care if its you or a box.  They can't sell it to cargo any more than they could sell it to another person because *you lied* to them and told them that that weight was already taken.  &gt;I think that if you sold a service at a profit you sold a service at a profit  They **don't** sell the service at a profit.   They sell it at break even.   The *profit* comes from ancillary streams...Bag fees, credit card sales, snacks, booze....  &gt;Yup. I'd strongly advise against starting an airline.   You'll lose your shirt.

Yes, it is possible to have sex any time during the menstrual cycle *(which usually lasts about 28 days, but can vary several days either way)*. Some women like the freedom of having sex during their period knowing they can't get pregnant *(which is a HUGE worry!)*, while most don't feel interested in sex.        Listen to your partner. Communicate.","77":"Doesn't matter how they look, but there are plenty of diagrams available.

The vagina is the passageway between what can be seen on the outside (labia) and the cervix (mouth of the uterus, which is normally tightly closed). It's a potential space... the walls usually are touching unless there's a tampon, finger, toy, penis, or baby moving through.          The uterus is kind of pear-shaped, about the size of a fist (depending on the person), and the small part connects to the cervix.","79":"Alright, so H(a,b) is when you describe what H does. You have to call them differently because they're different arguments, even if they could be the same.  H(x,x) is then running that routine with *specific* arguments. Essentially, it runs H(a,b), but with a=x and b=x. The cause of the transformation is that we're no longer looking at the definition of H, but at the application of H.","80":"Depends on where you come from. In Germany you have a general practitioner that is \"your doctor\". It gets documented with your health insurance.  In Norway you get a doctor assigned and are not allowed to go to a different one, except for emergencies (afaik).","81":"The rainwater has to be cleaned, the grass only lasts a summer and has to be baled for winter or supplemented with feed that has to be made in factories. They have to be sheltered in lit and heated sheds. They have to be milked and the milk is trucked into factories to make dairy products. And so on. Farming isn't just a matter of throwing a few cows in a field and then leaving them to it till you're ready to kill them.","82":"It doesn't matter where the milking is done, it still has to be done. The cows have to be transported and then so does the milk and the milk has to be processed and the processed milk has to be sent to the stores.","83":"Internationally, skin whitening has received criticism even within the Asian communities because racism towards darker skinned Asians is still extremely prominent in countries like Vietnam or the Philippines, that have more diverse skin tones. There's still an underlying vein that whiteness is equated with attractiveness, and a lot of the motivation behind skin whitening stems from that idea.","84":"No, not really, because for that to be the case, racism would have to be considered a historical past time, and not something that still actively happens in many societies across the globe. There is still a stigma within the fashion industry that lighter skin is better, there's been work done to change this narrative, but we still have a long way to go in that sense.","85":"I am all for anyone doing anything they want with their body, if it makes them feel good, then they should go for it. Your original comment seemed to imply to want an explanation for the stigma behind the ritual, and sadly it happens to be one that is largely tied to a checkered past. I will say, I personally get kind of sad though when someone wants to do something because they feel like they aren't attractive enough as they are, and that would include wishing their skin was lighter or wanting plastic surgery. It makes me feel bad that society has created these beauty norms that make people judge themselves so harshly.","86":"The CPU is designed so that if you feed it certain \"numbers\" (the binary numbers are just for human usability - it's all just a series of electrical signals to the CPU) it will perform certain operations. Some of those operations expect additional numbers to be input as part of the instruction (usually, addresses of memory that contain the data). This is all just based on the complex physical arrangement of the transistors and other components within the CPU.  We have a lookup table of what numbers represent what instructions. It's called an **instruction set**. A popular one is x86, which you can read about [here](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/X86_instruction_listings#Original_8086\/8088_instructions).","87":"The CPU is designed that way based on the arrangement of transistors and other components. Feed it a \"6\" and it will add the next two numbers. Feed it an \"8\" and it will store a number into memory.

If you want to see what it looks like inside a CPU you can watch [this video](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=Fxv3JoS1uY8).  The best I can do for ELI5: using transistors you can build logic gates. Using logic gates you can build logical functions. Transistors can also control which logic gates get activated based on a given input. You change which transistors are activated by sending signals to certain CPU pins in a certain order. The CPU is designed such that it would automatically read instructions from certain pins when powered on (which is where the BIOs\/boot process comes in). [Transistors to gates](https:\/\/www.cs.bu.edu\/~best\/courses\/modules\/Transistors2Gates\/).  If you have the basic building blocks to form transistors and\/or logic gates, you can build a fully functional computer, which is how people have simulated computers inside other software such as Minecraft or Factorio.","88":"That process has already been explained to you in [another comment](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/explainlikeimfive\/comments\/gilmgj\/eli5_how_does_a_computer_learn_those_first_few\/fqgpkp3\/).  You seem to be under the assumption that every result calculated by the CPU is literally turned into pixels. That's clearly not the case, computers calculate all sorts of things for different purposes. The software needs to determine what to do with the result. In the case that the result needs to be displayed on screen, the software will tell the monitor how to do so (via the graphics processor).","89":"They get that info from your credit report\/history, which again, should be obtainable only with private info like your social, full name and signature or electronic equivalent.  If you are being targeted specifically, you'd likely be unable to do anything short of having 2 factor on every account you own. So again, for the vast majority of people, they are not \"simple\" questions.","90":"But again, you'd have to be specifically targeted, which is a lot of work vs large attacks targeting a ton of people.   And if you are being targeted, there is little you will be able to do.","91":"That's the best security model because it works for 99.99% of people. Which is why the system is as it is.

Intelligent people have looked at the task of covering millions of square miles of the planet with a covering to capture some gas and decided that it makes absolutely no sense, and would then also completely ruin the ecosystems that would have to be covered, as well as taking an absurd amount of materials, resources, and energy to complete, and they decided it would be much more feasible to find other solutions that are actually possible.","93":"&gt; It could be as simple as vacuuming it up with big harvesters.  It doesn't just sit there... it ekes out of the ground and floats up into the sky, and if you aren't there right at the second it comes out, you can't get it back. And it's not coming out in like 5 big vents we can just cap. It's leaking through every single square foot of land as the biomass below the frost is thawed.   Nobody is crapping down your neck, they're responding to your belligerent resistance to the answers to your own question. You are being told that you are wrong because you are wrong. You are being told that you don't understand the topic because you are proving that you don't understand the topic.   You can trust in your fantasy all you want, but it's not physically possible. ","94":"&gt; Then we put bases there to capture it as it comes out. Long tubs with vacuum pressure running a grid over acres of land.  So you want to cover millions of square miles of arctic tundra with... vacuum tubes? Running a constant negative pressure in the area to absorb methane gas. And you don't see how insane that sounds?  &gt;You guys are being impatient, rude, and down right threatening.  Act like an idiot who is arguing in bad faith and be treated accordingly. The threats aren't okay, but you're being intentionally frustrating, and people are getting frustrated. Accept the consequences of what you're putting out into the world.  &gt;Here are the \"facts\" I have walked away from this with:  Your facts are correct, yes. They are also just plain facts. Not \"facts\". ","95":"\"Wasting water\" does not mean \"wasting any kind of water\", it usually means \"wasting clean freshwater\". Clean freshwater, depending on *how* you \"waste\" or contaminate it, *is* a precious resource that is very hard to reclaim.","96":"&gt; Why is that? I mean the water is there      That's the other thing. It isn't. For most people on the planet, the water is not there. It's somewhere else.        &gt;so why not clean it and use it?      This is, in a way, what sewage and wastewater treatment plants do. It's a very time-, infrastructure and resource-intensive process that cannot be provided everywhere.","97":"&gt; Well we are providing weapons to war torn nations who don't have resources for food. Surely some infrastructure can be built for ones with no access to water, right?  Any project in the world is limited by the constraints of technology, resources and politics. Any call for \"Let's pool together and solve this problem\" will always incur responses of \"I don't have anything to pool\", \"That isn't even a problem\" or \"I do not care enough about this to dedicate any attention to it\".","98":"&gt;it's just that we don't do it, right?  I certainly don't. Do you? Who is this \"we\"? There is no unified humanity. The world is big and complicated and full of nations, interest groups and individuals.","99":"Half of the planet has an iq under 100, plenty of dumbfuckery around.  A great deal of science is in fields that has nothing to do with the topic, a volcanogist has only his personal beliefs, mostly based on early life brain washing, lots are from places where lack of faith is deemed a detriment so you are not likely to find their true opinion, Saudi Arabia and the USA spring to mind. Despite that, US scientists aren't that church going, even assuming that every single one attending is a believer, very unlikely.  &gt;\tThe majority of scien- tists in the US (60 percent), UK (66 percent), and France (81 percent) are nonattenders; only a small fraction of French scientists attend services once a week or more (3.2 percent).

When you die, you cease to exist, like the 13 billion years before you were born, not that difficult to comprehend. What subatomic particles or physics allows anything different? We don't know where consciousness comes from because we don't fully understand the subject, no need to assume its magic sky fairy's doing it.","101":"No, facts and logic dictates there is nothing there to explain, why would there be, we are a self contained biomechanical unit, nothing more and nothing less. Perhaps if there was even vague evidence of something let alone conclusive proof, then it would be researched seriously as it would be a life changing event for everyone on the planet. How much research is being done?  Close to zero..   We can detect radio signals and have been doing so for over a century, we know the quantum realm behind it, we can smash atoms together and explain the results, all the shrapnel.  There are no mystery physics remaining to explain metaphysical bunkum, just waving your arms around and having a vague opinion that \"something\" happens with no means of explaining it, based on no evidence just a \"perhaps\" is not an easily defendable position. You have nothing.","102":"The price you paid is base on you actually using it.  They don't consolidate basketball games though hubs, it's not the same model.  Apples and Oranges.  Flight to MCN though ATL.  If every single person on the plane got off in Atlanta, now they're operating an empty plane from ATL to MCN.  Are they making money or taking a loss?  Meanwhile, a plane full of people that actually wanted to go to Macon weren't able to buy tickets because it said the plane was full, so they've also lost all of that revenue.

So you'll see far more COVID spread than influenza spread under the same conditions.","105":"I said go talk to a virologist to get answers to your questions about getting rid of the flu.  You said something about talking to someone who you think is a virologist who said something no virologist would ever say.  So whoever you spoke to is somewhere between not a virologist at all and the world's worst virologist.  That said - you want to learn whether we're in a position to eradicate the flu - go talk to a (competent) virologist and stop dicking around on reddit.  And 47 reported cases may mean hundreds or thousands or tens of thousands of unreported (but still potentially contagious) cases.  47 may not mean what you think it means.  Most people who get the flu just deal with it, and many have mild symptoms not worth reporting.","106":"I DON'T KNOW.  Talk to a competent virologist.  Although the flu comes back as a different variation (or a few different variations) year after year, and jumps often between humans and animals, so your plan may not work at all.","107":"The constitutional reason would be \"Then don't vote for them.\" Unlike a minimum age, which is supposed to impose a minimum amount of life experience as a qualification, there's no such thing as \"too much experience\" in this context. You're free to note vote for them if you feel they don't represent you, but being \"representative of the people\" isn't a requirement.","108":"That's not true. People are free to not vote for any candidate if they don't like any of them, they're free to support and vote for a third party or independent candidate, and they're free to vote for a write-in.","109":"If you're staring at a ballot with two names, and you write in a third, that's...three.  If you mean an \\*effective\\* vote, sure, but the person I was replying to was saying you had no choice. You have several choices.

No.  Maybe a single state's stores can, I really don't know.  I'm not a labor lawyer.  &gt; Otherwise I would have to have the same amount of people that live in New Hampshire and Vermont sign because that's how many people work for Walmart.  Exactly.","113":"I'm not demanding anything. I think equal pay for each person doing the same job makes sense.  Are you suggesting all jobs should be paid in a similar scheme to commission based jobs? That would probably be too big an overhaul of the system, too difficult to monitor etc.","114":"Which half of the Earth that is lit only depends on the Earth's rotation, and as the other thread explains in detail, that rotation is independent of the orbit of the planet and the Moon.  The Sun and the Moon are almost always on the same hemisphere of the Earth, this is a situation where they are almost opposite each other.  The sky becomes bright before the Sun is actually visible because the atmosphere scatters light.  That may be confusing your interpretation of the sun's location, thinking it's higher in the sky than it actually is.  The Sunrise\/sunset band is a ring around the Earth. As you go around that ring, your feet rotate relative to the plane of the planets.  On one side the shadow is \"up\" pointing toward the brightening sky.  On this side, the shadow points down.  The direction of the \"bright sky\" also rotates because the atmosphere is held to the Earth by the same gravity that holds your feet to the Earth.","115":"The rules are definitely different for creative people.  :)  Business people want an aura of \"I am reliable and trustworthy and won't do anything to surprise you\".

These concepts are stored without the use of either word or image, but are linked to the separate storages of the words and images, so those systems usually fire together.

A nuclear clock also has nothing to do with the nature of time. It simply allows us to measure time more accurately, though its error will still be many times greater than a Planck time.","156":"Planck time is the time it takes for light to travel one Planck length.  A Planck length is the resolution of a photon energetic enough to create a black hole, which basically means you can't see anything smaller than it.

It's easiest to think of them as waves, but more accurately, they are waves of points.

This is why it is said heavy elements originate in supernovae, normal stars don't have the energy to fuse beyond iron. If the nucleus is unstable enough and gets run into, it can cause it to break apart, which is exploited by nuclear reactors to sustain the controlled fission reactions.","168":"Alright, so H(a,b) is when you describe what H does.

But in the process, you get rid of the negotiators involved in drug\/treatment cost negotiations, and instead the government will just pay whatever the cost is without thinking about it, again because the government doesn't have significant means to fight for cost savings.  We already have a very similar problem with respect to student loans; the increased cost of college education in the US is largely due to the US government being so willing to pump money into higher education through student loans without any form of price controls or cost incentives.","218":"It\u2019s not bad... per se. They don\u2019t put money back into the economy, or rarely do. Think of it in terms of neighborhoods. You have poor, upscale, and rich. When the housing society of the rich neighborhood gets money from the people in it, do you honestly think some of that money makes it down to the upscale neighborhood? Same goes for the upscale to the poor. When you\u2019re rich, everything because a \u201cprivate\u201d. Private planes, cars, healthcare, etc. Services that cater to the rich are only offered to them. Oh... an easier example would be plane sections. Does any food or drink from 1st class make it to coach? Sure... they bought a ticket in the air plain but did it really help the plane go anywhere? What happened if someone from coach tries to sit in 1st? There you go.","219":"Without trying to sound crass you seem to have got the wrong picture of elements here. Hydrogen does not decay into helium, hydrogen-3 (tritium) does decay into helium-3, but hydrogen-1 and hysrogen-2 do not undergo radioactive decay at all, they are stable isotopes of hydrogen.   ALL elements have radioactive isotopes, that includes noble gasses. They will all decay into other elements eventually.","220":"Look up \u201cisotopes of helium\u201d, \u201cisotopes of neon\u201d etc. on Wikipedia and there will be a section labelled \u201clist of isotopes\u201d which shows you a lot of information including what isotopes they decay into if they\u2019re radioactive.   No, noble gasses are not turning into a 19th column. what makes you think that?   Yes, hydrogen-1 will _never_ undergo radioactive decay. Stars are different, they are fusing elements together, it\u2019s a completely different process to radioactive decay.","221":"&gt;Oh cool, so does that mean that, like radon, all of the noble elements will eventually turn into lead?  What makes your ask this question? Helium will never \u201cdecay\u201d into lead, nor will neon etc.   When stars explode a large amount of heavier elements are formed, but again this isn\u2019t the same process.    &gt;Could lead ever decay into something else? Is there a half-life of lead?  I\u2019ve already told you that every single element has radioactive isotopes, see: https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Isotopes_of_lead - note just how many radioactive isotopes lead has, many are decay products from other elements, lead is the heaviest element that still has stable isotopes.   Isotopes are atoms with the same number of protons but different numbers of neutrons. Only specific configurations of protons and neutrons are stable, everything else is unstable and undergoes radioactive decay.   &gt;If lead does decay into something else, it would probably take us billions of years to find out, right?  See the link above    I think checking out some educational YouTube videos would help you. Try this one: https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=fES21E0qebw","222":"Why do you think I have any actual firsthand experience in this field? I read journals and understand the science.   It took about 70 years for the rest of the elements in the 7th row to be created, that was elements 95-118). The last few discovered decay within fractions of seconds. The faster something decays the harder it is to create and then detect.   We will likely see element 120 within 5 years, but getting to element 169 (which would be the first element on the 9th row) is going to to take a lot longer and will need improvements in technology if it can even be created at all.

Of those, only Onkalo is getting made because its the only one that hasn't gotten snagged up in local objections to building a nuclear waste dump at their feet.

It's not the only way to look at it though. Because without the business keeping that profit to invest back into the business, it could never grow, giving up increasing value in the future.  Take manufacturing, say that you build widgets, each widget nets x profit. That x value can be given out as dividends or it can be used to increase the number of widgets we make and sell.

Digital isn't \"better\" than analog, they just do completely different things.

Ultimately, you translate back and forth as needed, like in the case of a monitor taking a digital signal to produce an analog image.","234":"&gt;Analog devices still use transistors, but they allow for many shades of grey between 0 current an maximum current. Transistors work like switches, with current flowing from the Source to the Drain, controlled by the Gate. This lets a tiny voltage at the Gate control a much larger current, like how a tiny valve can completely shut off a pipe. Analog devices can take a range of voltages through the gate that gradually turns on the current flowing through the device.   Remember, 1 and 0 are just what we call ON and OFF. Its all a matter of how much current is flowing. We get to choose how to interpret that.","235":"Take any example of a company share. I'll use Apple. You purchased some of their shares in 2005. Their employees designed a product called an Iphone, marketed it, made it and sold millions of it and continued to innovate making their company valued at hundreds of billions of dollars because of the money it makes. You own a part of the effort the company put into this. How is this different from you buying a chicken, cooking it and selling it for more? If you sold someone a 25% share of your chicken company, then that person is entitled to 25% of the value of the company. You no longer own 100% of that company. If all you did was sell one chicken, then you need to give that person 25% of the profits from that chicken. A share isn't an IOU - it means that the owner of the share is part-owner of the company.","236":"There are issues with corporate governance, but if someone owned 25% of the shares of a large public company (unrealistic mostly) they'd almost certainly be on the Board of Directors (BOD) and very likely the Chairman of the Board. The BOD (representatives of the shareholders - mostly large shareholders themselves) decide on the dividend policy. It is, in theory, the shareholders that decide whether or not the company pays a dividend, management can advise but the board decides.   So if a company doesn't pay dividends it is usually a joint consensus of the management and the owners (shareholders) of the company. Of course, if someone owns 0.00001% of the shares of the company, they probably cannot expect to have much say (other than voting at the AGM) in the major strategic decisions of the company.","237":"The beauty of the free market is that you can make any investment decision based on any set of beliefs you have. All I can attempt is to explain how it works. If your conclusion is that A is better than B, then so be it.   It is simply odd that you make such a huge distinction between dividend and non-dividend paying shares. But you are free to do so. Hopefully if you ever intend to invest, you research the return history of various companies in recent history and validate your belief (dividend etc) against empirical performance.   At the end of the day, investing is mostly about making as much money as you can at an acceptable risk in a timeframe that fits you.","238":"CC: u\/covalick  &gt;We are not even sure what the smallest unit of time is, though many suspect it is planck time.   This is false. The majority think that time is continuous, not chopped up into moments of Planck time.  &gt;Time as we experience it must have existed after the big bang, but at those early moments, only a few Planck time units after the big bang, space was not yet space. It was a massive ball of unimaginable amounts of energy,  This is also false. I'm not even sure what this is supposed to mean.  When you rewind the clock, things get closer and closer together until at some point, the energy is packed together so tightly that spacetime has to be described with quantum mechanics, but there are numerous problems with formulating such a theory.  &gt;I am hope full that when a nuclear clock is finally created (much more accurate than an atomic clock) we may start to unwrap some of the mysteries of time.  A nuclear clock also has nothing to do with the nature of time. It simply allows us to measure time more accurately, though its error will still be many times greater than a Planck time.","239":"Planck time is the time it takes for light to travel one Planck length.  A Planck length is the resolution of a photon energetic enough to create a black hole, which basically means you can't see anything smaller than it.  None of this means they are the smallest possible length scales, just that they are scales at which quantum gravity becomes important.","240":"This is complicated. It's easiest to think of them as waves, but more accurately, they are waves of points.  The energy is proportional to the frequency of the wave, and resolution is also proportional to the frequency, and so we define the Planck length as the length at which the energy of a photon is high enough to make a black hole.","241":"Now that is a good question... I know I had some sex education in school but it wasn't very good. It's a common problem in schools because people are scared to talk about it. Some of the fear is that it will encourage kids to start having sex early but I think it's important for everyone to know how the body works. Everyone has one, so why hide it?  Kids need to know what is normal and what is not normal, so if there is a problem, they can talk to a doctor. Puberty is scary with everything changing and a lot of people feel shame about it when they shouldn't.

Using you example earlier, if you made hundreds of your blood paintings, you wouldn't be rich, because no one would buy them. It's basic economics at that point, partial ownership of Amazon is more valued than your paintings are.   Amazon continues to expand its services and logistics network with the money it could spend on dividends. If it paid out dividends, it wouldn't be building as many new distribution centers and becoming more valuable to its customers who buy things from amazon. By doing so, it makes amazon ownership more valuable.","265":"Again, I'm saying that I haven't seen it as a hindrance to employment today like it was 25-35 years ago.

Very rare. That's mainly why afros aren't frowned upon like they were back then. But also like I said, PC sort of prevents people from even discussing it.  As far as the prejudice goes - it's just a guess, but the few people I know that have commented on giant afros see a connection between them and protestors. So, people likely view huge afros as a form of protest. Employers don't like to even consider hiring people that they consider to be agitators, generally speaking.   Note: I'm limited on how often I can post, so I'm having to go back and edit other comments instead of replying directly.","266":"By definition, protesters and agitators don't conform and try to be agents of change.

That also could explain why there tends to be prejudice against afros by others - they're not interested in any change in the status quo.","267":"As a header, life doesn't want anything. All systems will tend towards an equilibrium. Imagine you're hitting a golfball around a field for a million years, and there's a single rabbit hole somewhere in that field. Odds are the ball will eventually wind up in that hole, and once it does it is going to stay there.  The ball being in that hole is loosely analogous to life - it is something that is very unlikely but given enough time and the right circumstances it will eventually happen.  As for why life is stable, that's sort of by definition. If it weren't stable, then it wouldn't be life. Plenty of little bits of molecules stuck together in the ocean over several million or billion or trillion years, but they all fell apart. The one that didn't fall apart and instead replicated itself by complete accident was the one that survived long enough to evolve into humans, who promptly named this self-sustaining process \"life\".","268":"Stability and complexity are unrelated. The added complexity *in some contexts* clearly makes life more able to sustain itself, otherwise it wouldn't evolve. In places where it is not useful, it does not evolve. This is why viruses are simple - they don't benefit from added complexity.  As for exactly how they work, they take advantage of the complexity in their hosts. The complicated things like growing and protecting oneself and getting food and reproducing are all handled by the host cell. *Somebody* has to do those things, and the virus simply allows the host cell to do them. Viruses don't even really understand how to make more viruses - they simply turn themselves over to the advanced machinery of the host and allow the host to use its own 'knowledge' of replication to make more virus.","269":"Many systems can be self-sustaining so long as they have 'food'. While we don't know the exact path that life followed as it formed, it seems safe to say that a very rudimentary von Neumann 'machine' molecule or arrangement of molecules came to be which then developed more and more complex 'programs' that eventually became DNA.  Again, such developments are very unlikely, but given the sheer number of molecules forming and breaking in the oceans even now, on the order of quintillions or more every second, over the course of trillions of years, it shouldn't be too shocking that it happened *once*.","270":"&gt;Feel free to google whether it's ok to skip gears and you will get article after article saying   Whatever you want it to.   \"There are websites on the internet that agree with my preconceived notions\" also applies to whether vaccines cause autism and if the Earth is flat.","271":"Hmm?

It doesn't just sit there... it ekes out of the ground and floats up into the sky, and if you aren't there right at the second it comes out, you can't get it back. And it's not coming out in like 5 big vents we can just cap. It's leaking through every single square foot of land as the biomass below the frost is thawed.   Nobody is crapping down your neck, they're responding to your belligerent resistance to the answers to your own question. You are being told that you are wrong because you are wrong.

","286":"&gt; Then we put bases there to capture it as it comes out. Long tubs with vacuum pressure running a grid over acres of land.

NaZi = National Socialist and socialism is not right wing let alone far right. It's just that the term 'nazi' and 'national socialist' has become an *example* of far right ideology. It didn't change the meaning of socialism.","289":"I'm not sure what the answer would tell you, because left\/right wing is based on more than economy oriented properties and in contrast to regular parties the Nazi party didn't follow a single ideology even in that regard.  Also if you would draw out the Nazi party's separate beliefs and policies you get more like a shotgun blast at various parts of the spectrum. Some policies could be seen as extreme left, some centrist-left, a lot far right obviously etc. So that way you can't 'fit' the party into a specific part of the spectrum. This is a key feature of this kind of parties that transcend the classical political classification that is left\/right wing. Nowadays it's more common for populist parties in Europe (don't know much about other parts of the world) where you see a combination of popular policies on both the left and right wing to 'attract' more followers if you call it that, but then also joined with a lot of far right policies, often played down to not be classified as such that easily.","290":"Human hearing ranges from (about) 20 Hz to 20,000 Hz.  If a sound wave falls outside of that range, you are not going to be able to hear it.  However, that doesn't mean that you aren't able to perceive it in other ways.  We can \"feel\" sound waves outside of our normal range of hearing - both above and below the 20\/20,000 thresholds.  The 18.9 Hz wave is no different - you can't hear it, but you can feel it is there.  In many people, this feeling manifests itself as fear or paranoia.  You can \"feel\" something in the room, but none of your other senses register anything consciously.  This incongruence greats discomfort,t which manifests as fear.  It is called the \"Ghost Frequency\" because it is theorized that many \"haunted\" areas simply produce tones close to 18.9 Hz (through resonance or other natural quirks) and people associate the fear response with a \"presence\" in the area.","291":"It is actually pretty tough to generate things that low - most speakers can't do it (since there is no point in making a sound no one can hear).

As for physical reactions, nothing due to the sound itself but there are all sorts of physiological reactions to fear.","292":"Leakage on land is basically a non-issue.

People don't like the idea of storing waste in their area, despite it being generally a very safe proposition.

No, noble gasses are not turning into a 19th column. what makes you think that?   Yes, hydrogen-1 will _never_ undergo radioactive decay.

Many radioactive isotopes undergo these sequences where they keep decaying into other isotopes until they get to a stable one.","322":"&gt;Oh cool, so does that mean that, like radon, all of the noble elements will eventually turn into lead?

Helium will never \u201cdecay\u201d into lead, nor will neon etc.   When stars explode a large amount of heavier elements are formed, but again this isn\u2019t the same process.    &gt;Could lead ever decay into something else? Is there a half-life of lead?  I\u2019ve already told you that every single element has radioactive isotopes, see: https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Isotopes_of_lead - note just how many radioactive isotopes lead has, many are decay products from other elements, lead is the heaviest element that still has stable isotopes.   Isotopes are atoms with the same number of protons but different numbers of neutrons. Only specific configurations of protons and neutrons are stable, everything else is unstable and undergoes radioactive decay.   &gt;If lead does decay into something else, it would probably take us billions of years to find out, right?

I read journals and understand the science.   It took about 70 years for the rest of the elements in the 7th row to be created, that was elements 95-118). The last few discovered decay within fractions of seconds. The faster something decays the harder it is to create and then detect.   We will likely see element 120 within 5 years, but getting to element 169 (which would be the first element on the 9th row) is going to to take a lot longer and will need improvements in technology if it can even be created at all.

There are certain conditions under which you cannot receive vaccines (you are very young, your immune system is gone due to birth defects or cancer treatment,. ..).  These people rely on an effect called \"herd immunity\".  Basically you die if you get infected but you never get infected because everyone around you is vaccinated. This prevents a disease from spreading.  Unfortunately to achieve herd immunity roughly 98% of the population have to be vaccinated.  So for me personally as a vaccinated, healthy adult it makes no difference if you are vaccinated or not. For my little daughter or my cancer stricken relative it is a life or death situation (unfortunately quite literally).  Therefore if you are healthy and able to get a shot, go get a shot.

If you send 5 volts to the digital processor in my example above, it would be interpreted as a 1\/On\/True however you want to represent that. A string of those might represent an instruction or something.  If you send the same 5 volts to a 12 volt analog LED, it might light up with about 40% brightness. Analog doesn't have \"positions\", that's the point.

This is less Computer Science and more Electrical Engineering.  An analog circuit is either \"on\" or \"off\", but its operation can also change based on the energy level. Usually we design the circuit for a specific voltage level (eg. 110V in a US household), and change the current draw to change its operation. Eg. to make a toaster coil hotter or a fan spin faster.  A digital circuit always just \"exists\", with its operation determined by the sequence of on\/off electrical signals transmitted through it. Note that it's the circuit as a whole that is designed to be \"digital\". Individual components like transistors or capacitors are inherently \"analog\", we just use them in different ways.  The concept of \"1s and 0s\" is just something we humans use to help work with digital circuits because of the constant stream of on\/off data going through the circuit - it's useful to represent it as binary numbers.

So instead of staying home with their children, they earn $40,000 per year and pay $20,000 per year in child care.

When i buy apples directly from an orchard, i take the risk (just like buying stock) that i can sell them at a profit to grocers (who sell them to the consumers who consume them). I have no control over whether or not the grocers will buy them or not. I may end up with rotting apples because i didn't realize that people now hate apples...","348":"Market research also shows that stocks are valuable, so your previous point is invalid.

Every time in your life when you were sick with fever and sore throat and took a few ibuprofen and went into work or school you killed people... Only difference is we were not using the media to hyper inflate and sensationalize it to remove a president. I don't like Donald and I would never vote for him and I can see through this scam.

They'll have a much clearer idea what things are like these days.","361":"It probably *is* suitable just because business is so broad.  There are so many different companies, and inside those companies there are different departments, some more flexible than others.  Are there business jobs where hair could hurt your chances?  Yeah, I imagine there are.  Should you give up on business because of that?  Probably not, and I hope you don't!

Too much damage to cellular structures can cause the cell to destroy itself, as can too much damage to DNA. This is why bad sunburn causes skin to peel off, the epidermal and dermal layers received enough damage to decide they need to kill themselves for the greater good. However, if DNA is damaged in certain ways, it can lead to cancer. It's not that DNA can't be repaired at all, it's that it is the \"master program\" for the cell and can be modified in ways that make the cell do things that it isn't supposed to.   You can also receive too much damage to important cells like in organs. It's actually therapeutic in some situations, such as using radioactive iodine to destroy some of a large thyroid, but many organs are not good at regenerating so the damage can hamper their functionality.","365":"It's not just skin, it's called apoptosis and most cells in the body can do it. It also goes beyond cancer, you don't want malfunctioning cells dumping chemicals into the rest of the body.

No change in farming agriculture would amount to the improvement that ceasing to grow food for animals would yield. ","367":"I'm not sure what you mean. All the things I said above are legal. If workers follow the proper laws and procedures and vote to unionize, a company can't just say \"no\" and send the cops to slaughter everyone like they used to. They can do all sorts of things to prevent unionization or retaliate for successful or unsuccessful efforts, but they can't just say \"no\" and that's the end.","368":"&gt; could they deny it  I don't know what you keep calling \"deny\".  So you've got a majority of Walmart employees signed on?  You either have a union or you don't.  If you don't have a union, then you don't have any of the legal protections given to unions in the U.S.  &gt; as opposed to every other corporation or company?

A great deal of science is in fields that has nothing to do with the topic, a volcanogist has only his personal beliefs, mostly based on early life brain washing, lots are from places where lack of faith is deemed a detriment so you are not likely to find their true opinion, Saudi Arabia and the USA spring to mind. Despite that, US scientists aren't that church going, even assuming that every single one attending is a believer, very unlikely.  &gt;\tThe majority of scien- tists in the US (60 percent), UK (66 percent), and France (81 percent) are nonattenders; only a small fraction of French scientists attend services once a week or more (3.2 percent).

Perhaps if there was even vague evidence of something let alone conclusive proof, then it would be researched seriously as it would be a life changing event for everyone on the planet. How much research is being done?  Close to zero..   We can detect radio signals and have been doing so for over a century, we know the quantum realm behind it, we can smash atoms together and explain the results, all the shrapnel.  There are no mystery physics remaining to explain metaphysical bunkum, just waving your arms around and having a vague opinion that \"something\" happens with no means of explaining it, based on no evidence just a \"perhaps\" is not an easily defendable position. You have nothing.","380":"It's not a fallacy if you are arguing something subjective because if it is subjective then it is illogical. No True Scotsman can only apply if the assertion is something that can be disproven because NTS is applied when the assertion is changed to exclude the offending proof. Likewise, if you clarify your position it is also not No True Scotsman. However; if you argue something to objectively be the case... You know what, let's change the example slightly to be less ambiguous:     \"No person born in Edinburgh likes eggs\"   \"I was born in Edinburgh and I like eggs\"   \"No TRUE person from Edinburgh likes eggs\"     Can you see where logic has broken down here?","381":"Then every time you have seen an accusation of no true scotsman it has been used incorrectly. The person in my example was arguing exactly what they said because they were literally a hypothetical person who was arguing something easy to disprove. This is literally just a textbook example.      It seems to me that you are primarily concerned with what the accusee in each example \\*meant\\* but that's not what debate is about, to the point of apologism for literal straw men. A debate is entirely logical. \"People who I consider to be Scottish do not add sugar to their porridge\" is not something anyone would ever argue.","382":"1.

Neither is \"someone might mistakenly invoke the fallacy incorrectly\" proof that \"the fallacy is frequently invoked incorrectly\".","384":"A dessert is a physical object that has been manufactured and can be resold.  It's cost is from physical ingredients.  It is a **product**.  It has value because it is a physical thing.  That seat is a **service**.  It has value because it is providing a opportunity.   An opportunity which you've taken from the airline by lying.  They can't resell it.   They *don't* have an extra dessert, they've got an empty seat.   They can't put that seat back on the shelf, and they can't sell it to someone else because you said you were going to be in it.  How about this: The more full a plane is, the less per seat it costs to operate.   Very simple.   More people to share the fixed hourly cost of fuel, crew, maintenance.....  Consolidating though hubs keeps the planes full and costs go down.  Empty seats means the cost per passenger goes up.         ","385":"&gt;the airline has just made exactly the same profit as it would have if I'd flown  No, they haven't.    The ticket covers the fixed cost of operating.   Actual revenue comes from selling booze, snacks, credit cards......  The modern business model is pretty much trapping people in a tube and selling them shit.  Empty seats don't buy shit.    ","386":"Bottom line, if it wasn't costing them money, would they care?   The two biggest numbers in Airline Economics are CASM and RASM.  Cost per *Available* Seat Mile and Revenue per *Available* Seat Mile.  How much is produced\/consumed for every seat, every mile.  Here's the thing.   Available is extremely important.  When passengers do the Hidden City, they remove the Available.       With a large airline like Lufthansa or Delta (who operates 4800 flights every day), it aggregates big time.  If *one* person on each flight does a hidden city, that's the equivalent of running 16 empty Boeing 777 flights every day.","387":"And why do you think that has an effect on me?  Waste your money the way you want to; no skin off my back.  Hell, for all you know, I support Sanders, too.","388":"The \"spots\" are always \"touching\". In other words, the wires are always physically connected. The way programmers change what data (electrical signals) is fed into those wires is by storing instructions into memory. How does the CPU know to retrieve those instructions and execute them? Ultimately it's hardwired to do so as part of its design and manufacture. Ever heard of the BIOS on a motherboard? That's the program permanently stored in Read Only Memory (ROM) that kicks off that whole process.","389":"BIOS is a program written to a ROM memory chip at the motherboard factory, that provides the initial instructions to the CPU. This includes initialising all the connected hardware, and eventually telling the CPU to start loading instructions from some storage media (which ideally contains an operating system). We call this process *booting*. The CPU is already hard-wired as part of its design, to load this BIOS program from the motherboard it's plugged in to.","390":"The CPU is designed so that if you feed it certain \"numbers\" (the binary numbers are just for human usability - it's all just a series of electrical signals to the CPU) it will perform certain operations. Some of those operations expect additional numbers to be input as part of the instruction (usually, addresses of memory that contain the data). This is all just based on the complex physical arrangement of the transistors and other components within the CPU.  We have a lookup table of what numbers represent what instructions. It's called an **instruction set**. A popular one is x86, which you can read about [here](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/X86_instruction_listings#Original_8086\/8088_instructions).","391":"The CPU is designed that way based on the arrangement of transistors and other components. Feed it a \"6\" and it will add the next two numbers. Feed it an \"8\" and it will store a number into memory. How exactly the transistors are arranged to do so is not even remotely ELI5, and the people who know it are paid millions for their expertise. If you want to see what it looks like inside a CPU you can watch [this video](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=Fxv3JoS1uY8).  The best I can do for ELI5: using transistors you can build logic gates. Using logic gates you can build logical functions. Transistors can also control which logic gates get activated based on a given input. You change which transistors are activated by sending signals to certain CPU pins in a certain order. The CPU is designed such that it would automatically read instructions from certain pins when powered on (which is where the BIOs\/boot process comes in). [Transistors to gates](https:\/\/www.cs.bu.edu\/~best\/courses\/modules\/Transistors2Gates\/).  If you have the basic building blocks to form transistors and\/or logic gates, you can build a fully functional computer, which is how people have simulated computers inside other software such as Minecraft or Factorio.","392":"A function. If the function is y=x\\*2, then inputting 4 will result in 8.  Programs are kinds of functions that (usually) take input, process it, and provide some kind of output. While computers only work with numbers, it's up to the program to interpret what that number means. They aren't always literally numbers that need to be displayed as text on a monitor.","393":"Do me a personal favor. In all prior examples, assume that the assertions are exactly as stated. There is no basis for \"Yeah but I didn't mean it that way...\". A Scotsman is a human person from Scotland. A person born in Edinburgh is just that.  If person 1 says \"All X's are Y's\"   Then person 2 says \"X1 is an X but not a Y\"   Then person 1 says \"Then X1 is not an X because all X's are Y's\"   Where X1 exists in the subset of all X  Then JUST GOING BY INFORMATION THAT IS PRESENT, PERSON 1's ARGUMENT IS FALLACIOUS.","394":"The title of your post was \"Why is the No True Scotsman considered a fallacy\" and that's been repeatedly answered. Whether you think that it is realistic as regards conversations is really neither here nor there.","395":"1. Again, this falls entirely outside of the purview of your original question. 2.

Neither is \"someone might mistakenly invoke the fallacy incorrectly\" proof that \"the fallacy is frequently invoked incorrectly\".","397":"If someone applies the No True Scotsman fallacy to a personal opinion, then that is incorrect. This has nothing to do with the validity of the fallacy. Your position seems to be \"I don't like people using the fallacy this way\" and your evidence is \"I see it happen a lot\". These are not very robust, logically speaking (well, your opinion may be internally consistent but it's not very interesting to discuss).","398":"So remember an object is all word based for you, even a complicated object?

Goes on to describe how Feynman then tried to learn to do both (as have I since reading this. And like Feynman, have failed).      More importantly, the larger point of the story is about how even basic everyday things that are \"universal\" can be done in completely unexpected and, frankly, alien seeming ways for other people! :)","400":"I think when talking about \"randomness\" It is more practical to ask about predictability.  Its impossible to tell if an event was random or just unpredictable, so I do not think there is much distinction. If its impossible to tell whether a spin left electron will be spin up or spin down, how would it matter if its \"truly\" random or not, as long as it is indeed \"truly\" unpredictable.","401":"Now that is a good question... I know I had some sex education in school but it wasn't very good. It's a common problem in schools because people are scared to talk about it. Some of the fear is that it will encourage kids to start having sex early but I think it's important for everyone to know how the body works. Everyone has one, so why hide it?  Kids need to know what is normal and what is not normal, so if there is a problem, they can talk to a doctor. Puberty is scary with everything changing and a lot of people feel shame about it when they shouldn't.

The highest month is usually February) is lower than 2019-20.  Again, the reason is because of our precautions to covid are very effective at keeping flu number down. Influenza isn't usually a big deal, so we never go to great lengths to stop it. While Covid is very contagious, and Can result in hospitalization (influenza can too). The reason that we have been so precautious with Covid is because so many hospitals are at above 100% capacity. That was the entire point of flattening the curve, to keep the numbers at a more manageable rate for a long period of time. But people have let up on the precautions because everyone is understandably sick of the isolation","407":"The flu travels with winter. In the northern hemisphere, the season is from Oct-May and in the southern hemisphere, the season is from May-June (year, 8 months vs 6 months seems pretty unfair, but I think it's mostly because people don't live in Antarctica. Australia, South Africa, and Argentina and Chile aren't as cold as Canada or Russia).   Anyway, no, I don't think it would just go away like that.

The added complexity *in some contexts* clearly makes life more able to sustain itself, otherwise it wouldn't evolve. In places where it is not useful, it does not evolve. This is why viruses are simple - they don't benefit from added complexity.  As for exactly how they work, they take advantage of the complexity in their hosts. The complicated things like growing and protecting oneself and getting food and reproducing are all handled by the host cell. *Somebody* has to do those things, and the virus simply allows the host cell to do them. Viruses don't even really understand how to make more viruses - they simply turn themselves over to the advanced machinery of the host and allow the host to use its own 'knowledge' of replication to make more virus.","412":"Many systems can be self-sustaining so long as they have 'food'. While we don't know the exact path that life followed as it formed, it seems safe to say that a very rudimentary von Neumann 'machine' molecule or arrangement of molecules came to be which then developed more and more complex 'programs' that eventually became DNA.  Again, such developments are very unlikely, but given the sheer number of molecules forming and breaking in the oceans even now, on the order of quintillions or more every second, over the course of trillions of years, it shouldn't be too shocking that it happened *once*.","413":"This  is why Bio-fuel is a good alternative to include.

However, if DNA is damaged in certain ways, it can lead to cancer. It's not that DNA can't be repaired at all, it's that it is the \"master program\" for the cell and can be modified in ways that make the cell do things that it isn't supposed to.   You can also receive too much damage to important cells like in organs.

We want the fluid to have certain properties when it comes out of the boiler (we don't actually want steam) and when we have a high boiling point, we can put in more energy.  Also, water can store a lot of energy before it actually changes temperature, way more than acetone.    The turbine speed is related to how much fluid you pump through it, not the temperature although the fluid type can effect that.  The thing that varies with the temperature is the torque, how hard the turbine can try to turn stuff.\nExplainee: Right, and the energy is generated by the turbine spinning, so wouldn't the liquid phase boiling at a lower temperature but generating the same pressure generate the same energy output?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","15":"Explainer: To start with, I made a mistake in my previous comment.  The turbine speed and torque is going to be based on super complicated fluid mechanics stuff that I don't know to well.    No, it won't have the same energy output.  Lets say that substance 1 has a boiling point of 50 degrees Celsius and substance 2 has a boiling point of 100 degrees Celsius.  Lets also say that they require the same amount of energy to heat up 1 degree Celsius (1 kj).  Substance 1 absorbs 50 kj of energy but substance 2 absorbs 100 kj.  This means that substance 2 can have more energy extracted by the turbine.    The pressure doesn't actually have much to do with it, it's actually held constant during the boiling process and a pump is used to get the liquid to the right pressure.\nExplainee: Right, this explanation is all compatible with thermodynamics (more energy in=more energy out), but why? Why doesn't a gas molecule at the same pressure affecting the same surface area and moving at the same speed, just at a different temperature, not move the turbine the same amount? The turbine extracts energy by spinning. It doesn't convert heat energy at all, it converts the kinetic energy of the paddles spinning to electricity, and that kinetic energy is generated by pressure.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","16":"Explainee: ELI5: In Chemistry, why are they called the Noble Gases?

You can \"feel\" something in the room, but none of your other senses register anything consciously.  This incongruence greats discomfort,t which manifests as fear.

Most people who get the flu just deal with it, and many have mild symptoms not worth reporting.\nExplainee: yea but in theory if those minor cases isolate themselves for like 2 weeks or something would have their own bodies destroy the virus or could be vaccinated with a flu shot or something, while the major cases who get caught by the testing should be kept an eye on or isolated for even longer as needed.

No.  We are the sum of our experiences and genes, nothing more nothing less.

Some of those operations expect additional numbers to be input as part of the instruction (usually, addresses of memory that contain the data). This is all just based on the complex physical arrangement of the transistors and other components within the CPU.  We have a lookup table of what numbers represent what instructions. It's called an **instruction set**.

The best I can do for ELI5: using transistors you can build logic gates. Using logic gates you can build logical functions. Transistors can also control which logic gates get activated based on a given input. You change which transistors are activated by sending signals to certain CPU pins in a certain order. The CPU is designed such that it would automatically read instructions from certain pins when powered on (which is where the BIOs\/boot process comes in).

In that case, mlms make the world function......  A ponzi scheme requires there to be an exaggerated or novalue behind the product being bought or sold. If everyone just held their stocks, (thus demand for buying stocks just froze), then people would sell their stocks (potentially liquidating the company) or stock holders would then demand dividends. Either way, there is value behind the product (ownership) being exchanged...  And yes, companies do typically buy back stock during recession (the opposite of dilluting) to manage stock prices, which is based on the majority of stock holders decision.\nExplainee: The difference with wholesalers, is that there is intrinsic value, i.e. Food, water, etc. Stocks don't have intrinsic value. And there's competition for the same objecrlt, e.g. Tomatoes. MLMs don't have competition, because you buy it from the company only.  And company buying shares back during recessions is what I mean by non-dividend shares as not being not intrinsically valuable. People only sell things that have less value while being held. So non-dividend shares are valuable like art.

I have no control over whether or not the grocers will buy them or not. I may end up with rotting apples because i didn't realize that people now hate apples...\nExplainee: But that's not doing market research. Maybe the analogy is not the best to price your point, but you can easily ensure you have sales before purchasing.   Also, you have the intrinsic value of apples which you can eat (I assume you're not allergic to it). So even though you may lose some of your money (the apples rot) you're guaranteed a certain level of return regardless.

I do think I understand what a proof by contradiction is supposed to do.  You start with an assumption:  \"P.\"  Then, through reasoning, you show that \"P\" leads to something that cannot be true (e.g., 2 + 2 = 0), therefore (assuming the steps hold) the initial assumption is the thing that cannot be true.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","131":"Explainer: &gt; (I'm one of those people who'd say \"just add the number you've created to the list\"  The assumption initially made was \"this list contains all the numbers\".

If so, then why does the fact that that is also true of a 13-18 year old mean that humans aren\u2019t capable of raising kids at the age of 13-18?  2.

She would stand a MUCH better chance than a 13 year old. Of course there would be a fatality rate if you did the experiment enough times, but the rate would be drastically different between the 13 year old and the 23 year old.

Of course something RAISED in captivity would die quickly but I still maintain that even if you took a 13 year old from early human evolution and made her birth a child and raise it alone, she would DIE.  3a.

And yes, companies do typically buy back stock during recession (the opposite of dilluting) to manage stock prices, which is based on the majority of stock holders decision.\nExplainee: The difference with wholesalers, is that there is intrinsic value, i.e. Food, water, etc. Stocks don't have intrinsic value. And there's competition for the same objecrlt, e.g. Tomatoes. MLMs don't have competition, because you buy it from the company only.

You own a part of the effort the company put into this. How is this different from you buying a chicken, cooking it and selling it for more? If you sold someone a 25% share of your chicken company, then that person is entitled to 25% of the value of the company. You no longer own 100% of that company. If all you did was sell one chicken, then you need to give that person 25% of the profits from that chicken.

It is, in theory, the shareholders that decide whether or not the company pays a dividend, management can advise but the board decides.   So if a company doesn't pay dividends it is usually a joint consensus of the management and the owners (shareholders) of the company. Of course, if someone owns 0.00001% of the shares of the company, they probably cannot expect to have much say (other than voting at the AGM) in the major strategic decisions of the company.\nExplainee: yeah, so I feel like buying non-dividend shares is more of a winner takes all system.

You can \"feel\" something in the room, but none of your other senses register anything consciously.  This incongruence greats discomfort,t which manifests as fear.  It is called the \"Ghost Frequency\" because it is theorized that many \"haunted\" areas simply produce tones close to 18.9 Hz (through resonance or other natural quirks) and people associate the fear response with a \"presence\" in the area.\nExplainee: Great explanation.

If you send 5 volts to the digital processor in my example above, it would be interpreted as a 1\/On\/True however you want to represent that. A string of those might represent an instruction or something.  If you send the same 5 volts to a 12 volt analog LED, it might light up with about 40% brightness.

Maybe the analogy is not the best to price your point, but you can easily ensure you have sales before purchasing.   Also, you have the intrinsic value of apples which you can eat (I assume you're not allergic to it).

This is why bad sunburn causes skin to peel off, the epidermal and dermal layers received enough damage to decide they need to kill themselves for the greater good. However, if DNA is damaged in certain ways, it can lead to cancer. It's not that DNA can't be repaired at all, it's that it is the \"master program\" for the cell and can be modified in ways that make the cell do things that it isn't supposed to.   You can also receive too much damage to important cells like in organs. It's actually therapeutic in some situations, such as using radioactive iodine to destroy some of a large thyroid, but many organs are not good at regenerating so the damage can hamper their functionality.\nExplainee: Never really thought about it that way.

In other words, the wires are always physically connected. The way programmers change what data (electrical signals) is fed into those wires is by storing instructions into memory. How does the CPU know to retrieve those instructions and execute them? Ultimately it's hardwired to do so as part of its design and manufacture. Ever heard of the BIOS on a motherboard? That's the program permanently stored in Read Only Memory (ROM) that kicks off that whole process.\nExplainee: So it's a section of memory that tells the computer to read the memory?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","390":"Explainer: BIOS is a program written to a ROM memory chip at the motherboard factory, that provides the initial instructions to the CPU. This includes initialising all the connected hardware, and eventually telling the CPU to start loading instructions from some storage media (which ideally contains an operating system). We call this process *booting*. The CPU is already hard-wired as part of its design, to load this BIOS program from the motherboard it's plugged in to.\nExplainee: How do the instructions make it do something, though. How do we get from 1s and 0s becoming 6 through math to \"computer do this\"? How does the transition work?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","391":"Explainer: The CPU is designed so that if you feed it certain \"numbers\" (the binary numbers are just for human usability - it's all just a series of electrical signals to the CPU) it will perform certain operations. Some of those operations expect additional numbers to be input as part of the instruction (usually, addresses of memory that contain the data). This is all just based on the complex physical arrangement of the transistors and other components within the CPU.  We have a lookup table of what numbers represent what instructions. It's called an **instruction set**. A popular one is x86, which you can read about [here](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/X86_instruction_listings#Original_8086\/8088_instructions).\nExplainee: &gt;it will perform certain operations  How does it do that? How does it know to do that? I know it's a machine and doesnt really \"know\" anything, but you know what I mean. How does it take the number 6 it calculated and turn that into action\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","392":"Explainer: The CPU is designed that way based on the arrangement of transistors and other components. Feed it a \"6\" and it will add the next two numbers. Feed it an \"8\" and it will store a number into memory. How exactly the transistors are arranged to do so is not even remotely ELI5, and the people who know it are paid millions for their expertise. If you want to see what it looks like inside a CPU you can watch [this video](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=Fxv3JoS1uY8).  The best I can do for ELI5: using transistors you can build logic gates. Using logic gates you can build logical functions. Transistors can also control which logic gates get activated based on a given input. You change which transistors are activated by sending signals to certain CPU pins in a certain order. The CPU is designed such that it would automatically read instructions from certain pins when powered on (which is where the BIOs\/boot process comes in). [Transistors to gates](https:\/\/www.cs.bu.edu\/~best\/courses\/modules\/Transistors2Gates\/).  If you have the basic building blocks to form transistors and\/or logic gates, you can build a fully functional computer, which is how people have simulated computers inside other software such as Minecraft or Factorio.\nExplainee: When you hear \"x input is converted to y output\", how is it converted\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","393":"Explainee: ELI5:Why is the \"no true Scotsman\" considered a fallacy?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","394":"Explainer: Do me a personal favor. In all prior examples, assume that the assertions are exactly as stated. There is no basis for \"Yeah but I didn't mean it that way...\". A Scotsman is a human person from Scotland. A person born in Edinburgh is just that.  If person 1 says \"All X's are Y's\"   Then person 2 says \"X1 is an X but not a Y\"   Then person 1 says \"Then X1 is not an X because all X's are Y's\"   Where X1 exists in the subset of all X  Then JUST GOING BY INFORMATION THAT IS PRESENT, PERSON 1's ARGUMENT IS FALLACIOUS.\nExplainee: I agree that this is a fallacy. I just don't think this is a thing people do. What generally happens is that they have a personal idea of what X stands for. Person 1 and Person 2 are not talking about the same X.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","395":"Explainer: The title of your post was \"Why is the No True Scotsman considered a fallacy\" and that's been repeatedly answered. Whether you think that it is realistic as regards conversations is really neither here nor there.\nExplainee: Okay, but then you have to wonder why the fallacy is even a thing, if it hardly happens in real life.  Plus, it basically never happens in good faith. I mean, fallacies usually refer to flawed reasonings that someone may not realize is flawed. That's not the case with this particular fallacy. Someone would have to be incredibly dumb to not see that there is a problem in the reasoning you laid out above.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","396":"Explainer: 1.

And it's not like you could easily prove that it is happening, unless you really engage with the person you are suspecting.  Like, what I said in my OP may easily be interpreted as an example of the fallacy. But that interpretation would be mistaken. That's why I'm suspecting the fallacy frequently is assumed incorrectly.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","397":"Explainer: \"I've never seen it myself\" is not an argument for \"therefore it is very rare\". Neither is \"someone might mistakenly invoke the fallacy incorrectly\" proof that \"the fallacy is frequently invoked incorrectly\".\nExplainee: I know. But what I'm thinking is, typically the cases that get accused of the fallacy are similar to my example (or to the wikipedia example). And those types of claims generally come down to a personal belief that the person has.  It comes up all the times when people are trying to gatekeep what is a \"true fan\" or a \"true citizen\" and such. Those situations are hardly ever a fallacy. It's just that people have a set idea.

Influenza isn't usually a big deal, so we never go to great lengths to stop it. While Covid is very contagious, and Can result in hospitalization (influenza can too). The reason that we have been so precautious with Covid is because so many hospitals are at above 100% capacity.

The added complexity *in some contexts* clearly makes life more able to sustain itself, otherwise it wouldn't evolve. In places where it is not useful, it does not evolve. This is why viruses are simple - they don't benefit from added complexity.  As for exactly how they work, they take advantage of the complexity in their hosts. The complicated things like growing and protecting oneself and getting food and reproducing are all handled by the host cell. *Somebody* has to do those things, and the virus simply allows the host cell to do them. Viruses don't even really understand how to make more viruses - they simply turn themselves over to the advanced machinery of the host and allow the host to use its own 'knowledge' of replication to make more virus.\nExplainee: I get that viruses are simple because they dont benefit from added complexity, but I mean in terms of chemistry even viruses are incredibly complex compared to the elements on the periodic table.

tachometer shows the car's engine speed in revolutions per minute (RPM). It's like a speedometer for the engine, rather than the car itself. It helps drivers know how hard the engine is working, which is important for things like shifting gears, avoiding overheating, and getting the best fuel efficiency.","1":"I did check online and it says that skipping gears is not recommended because it can cause wear and tear on the transmission, and it's also not a safe practice in certain driving conditions. Plus, my instructor has been teaching me for a while now and I trust their expertise.","2":"The Earth's water is constantly cycled between the oceans, atmosphere, and land through the water cycle. This means that the same water molecules are being used over and over again. So, even though the total amount of water on Earth is a constant, we can still waste water because we're not conserving it for future use.","3":"But that's a very different situation. War and conflict are not a sustainable or desirable state of affairs, and the aid we provide is intended to alleviate human suffering and support the local economy, rather than to enable the continuation of conflict. In contrast, providing access to clean water is a long-term investment in the health, productivity, and well-being of the local population.","4":"Well, there are several types of spaces around your organs. There's the peritoneum, which is a membrane that lines your abdominal cavity and surrounds your organs like your stomach, intestines, and liver. There's also the pleura, which is a membrane that surrounds your lungs. And there's the meninges, which are membranes that protect your brain and spinal cord. And then there are the spaces between your organs, like the space between your liver and your stomach, or the space between your kidneys.","5":"Well, it's because of a combination of historical and cultural factors. In the US, the idea of a 'professional' hairstyle was often associated with European-American norms, which didn't include afros. This was partly because of racism and partly because of the influence of European-American culture on corporate culture. So, having an afro was seen as not fitting in with those norms, and therefore not professional. But, this is changing, and many companies are now embracing diversity and inclusion, and allowing employees to wear afros and other hairstyles that were previously seen as unprofessional.","6":"No, I think you can still be reliable and trustworthy in business while still being creative and innovative. You can still have a personal style that reflects who you are.","7":"A tachometer is a tool that measures the speed of a car's engine, and it's crucial for the driver to know the engine speed to ensure the car is running smoothly and efficiently.","8":"I think you might be misunderstanding what I'm trying to explain, because the way you're describing it sounds perfect.","9":"It's because humans have a long period of adolescence where we focus on developing physically, socially, and cognitively before we're ready to take on the responsibilities of parenthood.","10":"You are being obstinate and refusing to consider alternative perspectives.","11":"I'm not going to engage in a back-and-forth like this if you're not going to listen to the explanation. You're not going to get it, and it's not productive to keep discussing it.","12":"Well, universal income is a theoretical concept where every citizen of a country gets a guaranteed minimum amount of money from the government, regardless of their employment status. It\u2019s meant to ensure that everyone has enough money to meet their basic needs. Now, to prevent companies from raising prices, some proponents of universal income suggest implementing price controls or increasing the minimum wage. Others propose using the universal income to fund social programs that benefit everyone, like healthcare and education, which would reduce the burden on businesses and make it harder for them to raise prices. But these are just ideas, and there are many debates about how to make universal income work in practice.","13":"Because the materials with lower boiling points release their energy at lower temperatures, and we need higher temperatures to generate electricity efficiently.","14":"That's partially correct, but the relationship is more complex. Pressure is a major factor, but so is the efficiency of expansion, which can vary with temperature. A lower boiling point fluid might actually produce more energy per unit of fluid if it expands more rapidly at the same pressure, despite the lower temperature.","15":"The key difference is the temperature and pressure aren't the only factors that determine the kinetic energy of the gas molecules. The gas molecules in substance 2 are moving faster than the gas molecules in substance 1 because it takes more energy to heat them up. This increased kinetic energy is what the turbine is converting to electricity.","16":"The term 'noble' actually comes from the fact that they don't readily react with other elements, making them seem 'noble' or unreactive, rather than any direct reference to aristocrats or nobility. They're called noble gases because they're stable and don't easily form compounds with other elements, so they're 'noble' in the sense that they're unchanging and unreactive.","17":"I see what's happening here, you're getting confused between the two types of processes. Radioactive decay is a random process where unstable isotopes lose energy and stability by emitting particles, while nuclear fusion in stars is a different process where lighter elements are combined to form heavier elements. The decay chain you're thinking of is a series of radioactive decays, and radon is indeed a stable end product of that chain, so it won't decay into anything else.","18":"Lead is stable, it doesn't decay into other elements like radon does. But it can undergo alpha decay into other lead isotopes or into other elements like polonium.","19":"No, there will never be a 19th periodic column. The periodic table is based on the electron configuration of the elements. The columns represent the electron shells and subshells. The periodic table is a way to organize elements based on their electron configuration, and it is based on the fact that certain elements have the same electron configuration, which determines their chemical properties. The elements in the periodic table are arranged in a way that reflects their electron configuration, and this arrangement is based on the fact that certain elements have the same number of electrons in their outermost energy level. The periodic table is a way to organize elements based on their electron configuration, and it is based on the fact that certain elements have the same electron configuration, which determines their chemical properties.

During the off season, the virus is still present in the environment and in people's bodies, but it's not actively replicating. It comes back when the weather starts to change and people are more likely to be in close proximity to each other, allowing the virus to spread again.","23":"I think that's exactly what's happening, but with more severe consequences.","24":"In 2020, the influenza virus kind of disappeared from the world. This was because many people were wearing masks and keeping their distance from each other due to the COVID-19 pandemic. This reduced the opportunities for the influenza virus to spread and infect people.","25":"Yes, theoretically, but it would require a lot of resources and careful planning.","26":"Influenza virus was still present in 2020, but due to various factors such as mask-wearing, social distancing, and reduced mobility, its spread was significantly reduced.","27":"That's a common misconception, though - the measures we're taking to slow the spread of COVID-19 are also effective against influenza, because both are respiratory viruses that spread through the air, and they're both highly contagious.","28":"You're oversimplifying the situation and underestimating the complexity of influenza.  We're not just talking about a simple virus that can be eradicated by people staying home for two weeks and getting vaccinated.  It's a highly contagious and adaptable virus that has been around for centuries, and it's not going to be easy to get rid of.  And as for herpes, it's a completely different story.  Herpes is a latent virus that can lie dormant in the body for years, and it's not something that can be easily eradicated with a vaccine or by people staying home.  It's a much more complex and difficult problem than influenza.","29":"So, what's your point?","30":"the fact that people are willing to go to such extremes to reject the evidence is a testament to the importance of trusting the scientific process, not a reason to distrust it.","31":"That's a pathetic attempt to silence me, but it won't work. I'll keep saying what needs to be said.","32":"No, I'm saying it's a sport, but it's not as physically demanding as other sports like football or rugby.","33":"The 'off'ness is in the way the notes are played, not necessarily when they are played. It's a matter of timing and rhythm, which is hard to see in a static score.","34":"Well, they probably don\u2019t want to make you guys anxious about it. Puberty is a lot to take in. But honestly, it\u2019s not that scary. You\u2019ll figure it out as you go along. Just remember, it\u2019s normal and it\u2019s okay to have questions. If you have any, you can always ask your parents or a trusted adult.","35":"Imagine you're on a train, and the train is moving really slowly. You're in a deep sleep, which is like being in a really deep tunnel. But every now and then, the train comes out of the tunnel and into a station, and you get a little bit of light sleep, which is like being in a station for a bit. Then the train goes back into the tunnel, and you go back into deep sleep. This happens multiple times, and each time the train comes out of the tunnel, you get a bit more awake, but you still feel tired because you've been in the deep sleep for so long. Also, sometimes you have a REM sleep, which is like a really short stop at the station, and that's when you have dreams. But even with all these sleep cycles, you can still feel tired if you've been in deep sleep for a long time, because it's like the train is still moving really slowly, and you're not getting enough light sleep to wake up feeling refreshed.","36":"How long have you been feeling these symptoms?","37":"Don't worry, it's a common first step, and many people find it helpful even if they're not sure what to expect.","38":"Sponges are made of a type of material that can't handle high temperatures. If you boil a sponge, the heat will break down the material and cause it to melt or disintegrate. This means that boiling a sponge won't actually sanitize it - it will just make it fall apart. Instead, you should wash your sponge in hot water with some soap, and then wring it out and let it air dry. This will help to get rid of any bacteria that might be living on it.","39":"You're just mad because you think I'm a hypocrite, but I'm just being honest about my spending habits. I've cut back on a lot of things since the economic downturn, and I'm proud to say that I've been able to make some sacrifices. You're just trying to attack me personally because you can't argue with the facts.","40":"You're trying to deflect from the actual issue with your original comment and then call me out for being thin-skinned about a label that has no bearing on the conversation.","41":"The electrical wave is then processed by the brain, which interprets the signal as a thought.","42":"The term 'Noble Gases' is actually a reference to their unreactive nature, which was a novelty at the time of their discovery. It's a nod to the aristocracy's reputation for being unapproachable and unchanging, not a Buddhist reference.","43":"I think we're getting a bit off track here. Let's focus on the topic at hand, which is the testing of atomic theory. Heisenberg's involvement with the Nazis is a complex issue, but it's not directly relevant to the discussion of atomic theory. We were talking about how Oppenheimer showed that Heisenberg's math was wrong, which is a crucial aspect of understanding atomic theory. Can we get back to that?","44":"You can't just link to some article and expect that to be proof of everything. You need to understand the historical context and the sources that support your claims.","45":"What if they had actually used the right amount of uranium, and the reactor had actually worked, and they had actually gotten a chain reaction, and they had actually made a bomb, and they had actually used it on London, or New York, or Moscow, or Berlin?  Would you rather have that possibility, or the possibility of the Nazis having a nuclear bomb that they didn't use because Heisenberg made a mistake?  Because that's what we're talking about here.  It's not just that Heisenberg made a mistake, it's that he made a mistake that saved millions of lives.","46":"Yeah, it's actually really satisfying to get them out of your head like that.","47":"Okay, so imagine you have a lemonade stand. You want to grow your lemonade stand into a bigger business, but you need money to buy more lemons and sugar. That's where investment banking comes in. They help you find people who have money to lend you, or people who want to buy a part of your lemonade stand, so you can grow your business.","48":"I've been learning about the different types of plate tectonics and this fits into the larger picture of how the Earth's surface is constantly changing.","49":"But I'd argue that we can still learn something from the current process of continental drift, even if we can't predict the exact future outcome.","50":"Right, and that's why it's not always easy to categorize regulation as left or right. It's a complex mix of policy and ideology.","51":"The electrical wave starts in the brain, specifically in the neurons, and it's like a series of chemical reactions that create an electrical signal. This signal then travels through the neurons, kind of like a firework explosion, and it creates a cascade of activity that eventually leads to the creation of a conscious thought.","52":"I think you're confusing what you feel like your thoughts are doing with where they actually are. I'm not saying that's not a common experience, but it's a pretty radical departure from the way most people experience their thoughts.","53":"A tachometer is a tool that shows you how fast your engine is running. It's like a speedometer, but instead of showing how fast your car is going, it shows how fast your engine is spinning. This is important because if your engine is running too fast or too slow, it can be bad for the car.","54":"They do this by creating a private label brand, also known as a house brand. It's like when you make your own cookies and give them to your friends, but instead of cookies, it's products like shampoo. The company makes the product, but instead of putting their own name on it, they put a different name, like Equate. This way, they can sell it for cheaper than the original brand, like Head and Shoulders, because they don't have to pay for the same advertising and marketing costs.","55":"Well, the reason for this is largely due to the fact that humans have a very long period of immaturity, especially when compared to other mammals. This means that our brains continue to develop and mature well into our 20s and 30s, and this developmental period is critical for learning social skills, emotional regulation, and other complex behaviors that are essential for successful mating and parenting.","56":"The Earth's umbra falls on a part of the Moon that is below the horizon from the observer's location. This results in the Moon appearing to set while still in the umbra, creating a shadow on the topside of the Moon.","57":"The main difference is that strippers are seen as sex workers, and many people have a moral issue with that. Cheerleaders, on the other hand, are seen as athletes or entertainers, and people don't have the same moral objections to them.","58":"This is a possible answer to the question.","59":"So, you want to know about the rendering process, right? The computer calculates the graphics and then the GPU renders the final image.","60":"The monitor doesn't know what the numbers mean, it just knows that the computer is sending it a bunch of numbers. The computer is actually sending it a bunch of numbers that represent the color values, but that's a separate process. The monitor just displays whatever numbers it gets, and the computer handles the color interpretation.","61":"Well, the main difference is that analog signals are continuous, like the brightness of a light. Digital signals are discrete, like the numbers on a calculator. Analog signals are often represented as a range of values, like a voltage range from 0 to 10 volts. Digital signals are represented as a series of 0s and 1s. This is why digital signals can be so precise, but also why they can be so limited in terms of the range of values they can represent. In the case of the chip we're talking about, it can represent 256 different shades of gray, which is a pretty limited range. But for most purposes, it's plenty.","62":"Because in analog electronics, the voltage of the signal is directly proportional to the current flowing through it, so if one signal is too strong, it would just cause the current to increase, not max out the gate.","63":"Analog signals can take on any value between 0 and 1, but also can be negative, or greater than 1. Think of it like a waveform, it can be any height or depth, not just a fixed point. ","64":"If you want to use this sub, then you should learn to use it.","65":"The reason we don't see sunlight in space is because space is a vacuum. It has no air, and light needs air to travel through. On Earth, light can travel through the air, which is why we can see the sun. In space, light can travel through the vacuum, but it has nowhere to bounce off of, so we don't see it. It's like shining a flashlight in a completely empty room \u2013 the light will travel through the air, but it won't hit anything to reflect back to our eyes. ","66":"the explainee's response","67":null,"68":"Because the flu can be serious, especially for people who are older, have a weakened immune system, or have certain chronic health conditions. For example, pneumonia and sinus and ear infections are common complications of the flu. In severe cases, the flu can even lead to hospitalization and death. Getting a flu shot can help prevent these serious complications and keep you healthy.","69":"Even if you don't have a regular doctor, there are many online resources and public health clinics where you can get information about vaccinations. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) website is a great place to start.","70":"Because it is the frequency of a particular sound that has been reported to be heard by many people who have experienced a near-death experience or have been in a state of deep meditation.","71":"Yes, that's correct.  The 18.9 Hz frequency is thought to be a good candidate for creating a haunted atmosphere, but it's worth noting that it's not a guarantee.  The effect may be more pronounced in certain environments or on certain people.  As for physical reactions, yes, there are some documented cases of increased heart rate, blood pressure, and other physiological responses when people are exposed to the 18.9 Hz frequency, especially in conjunction with other factors like darkness, isolation, and suggestion.","72":"Water is constantly being cycled through the Earth's system, so even though the total amount of water is constant, the water in our oceans, lakes, and rivers is constantly being used and reused.","73":"Wow, you're so right. I must be the one with the issue, not the fact that five people have given you the same answer and you're still arguing. I'll just take your word for it that I'm the problem. Carry on, genius.","74":"But isn't it true that they're also losing revenue by not selling that seat on the original route?","75":"So you're saying that as long as the ticket price is low enough to attract customers, the airline will make a profit, even if it means operating at a loss?","76":"A period is when a woman's body releases blood and tissue from her uterus, usually every month. It's a natural part of a woman's reproductive cycle. It's like a monthly cleaning process for her body.","77":"So, let me try to explain it in a way that's easy to understand. The uterus is like a muscle that expands and contracts during your period. It's where the baby would grow if you were pregnant. The cervix is like a little opening at the top of the uterus that allows blood to come out during your period. And the vagina is like a tube that connects the cervix to the outside of the body. Does that make sense?","78":"The vagina is actually a tube-like structure that connects the cervix (which is the lower part of the uterus) to the vulva (the external genital area). It's not the whole thing, but rather a part of it. Think of it like a tunnel that leads from the outside to the inside of the body. Does that make sense?","79":"Well, let me try to break it down. When we say H(x,x), we're not literally saying that the program and input are the same thing. Instead, we're using x as a placeholder for both the program and the input. Think of it like a variable. In the case of H(a,b), a and b are separate variables. But when we say H(x,x), we're saying that the program and input are both represented by the same variable, x. Does that make sense? And as for how H(a,b) transforms into H(x,x), it's simply a matter of substituting x for both a and b. We're not changing the underlying logic of the function, just the way we're representing it. Does that help clarify things?","80":"Some doctors offer free or low-cost vaccinations and check-ups for people who don't have health insurance or can't afford to pay out-of-pocket. You might be able to find a community clinic or a non-profit organization in your area that offers these services.","81":"Well, for one, you need to provide them with shelter and healthcare, and also ensure the food they eat is nutritious.","82":"You're thinking of a small-scale farm that's just a hobby, but industrial-scale farming is a completely different beast.","83":"Because it's rooted in a history of colonialism and racism, where lighter skin was associated with higher social status and power. The idea that a white person can tan and still be socially accepted is a product of this legacy, while non-white people are expected to conform to societal beauty standards that value lighter skin, which is a form of internalized racism.","84":"No, I think it's still very much present, especially in countries where there's a strong historical context of colonialism, where whiteness has been imposed on them as the ideal beauty standard. ","85":"I think that's a really interesting question, and it highlights the complexity of the issue. While it's true that there's still a stigma around lighter skin, it's also true that personal preferences play a role in people's choices. However, it's also possible that those personal preferences are influenced by the societal beauty standards that perpetuate racism. So, while it might seem like a simple choice to dye one's hair pink or paint one's nails purple, the decision to lighten one's skin is often tied to a much deeper and more complex set of societal pressures. It's not necessarily about wanting to look like a caucasian person, but rather about wanting to conform to a beauty standard that is often tied to whiteness. Does that make sense?","86":"This is the missing part.","87":"The CPU takes the binary number and uses it to control the flow of electrical signals within itself. These signals can activate or deactivate certain parts of the CPU, which in turn can cause certain operations to happen. It's kind of like a very complex and very precise version of a series of if-then statements. The signals can also flow into other parts of the CPU, which can then perform their own operations based on those signals. It's all very fast and very intricate, and it's what allows the CPU to do all the things it does.","88":"Well, that's a pretty complex topic, but basically the computer's graphics card takes the number 8 and uses it to tell the monitor how many pixels to draw. The monitor then draws those pixels, which creates the image you see on the screen. Think of it like a recipe book. The computer gives the monitor a recipe for how many pixels to draw and where to draw them, and the monitor carries out the recipe by drawing the pixels.","89":"This is because the security questions are often designed to be easy to answer for the legitimate account holder, but hard to guess for an attacker. However, this can make them vulnerable to social engineering attacks, where an attacker tricks the account holder into revealing the answer to the security question.","90":"But that's exactly my point, the fact that you can get that information with a paid account on publicdata.com just goes to show that it's not as private as you think it is.  If a website like that can get it, it's likely that other people can too, especially if they're willing to pay for it.  And if you're not careful, you could be putting yourself at risk by giving them your private info.  It's not a foolproof way to protect yourself.","91":"I understand your point, but I was trying to provide context on why targeted attacks are less common. However, I see your point about the security model being flawed, and I agree that it's not a good approach to rely on the attacker's effort being too high.","92":"I'd be happy to explain it in a way that's easy to understand. So, let's start with the basics. Animals are raised on farms for food, and this process has a huge impact on the environment. It takes a lot of water, land, and energy to produce animal products like meat and dairy. ","93":"You're saying that you think that there are people who are capable of implementing your idea, even though it's been widely rejected by experts, and you're just waiting for someone else to make it happen.","94":"I'm not trying to be rude, but I think we're getting off track here. Let's focus on the science behind the phenomenon we're discussing. I understand that you have concerns about the environmental impact of livestock, but that's not directly related to the issue at hand. Can we try to break it down and address your questions one by one?","95":"Water is constantly being cycled through the Earth's systems, such as evaporation, condensation, and precipitation. This means that while the total amount of water on Earth remains relatively constant, the water that we use and the water that is available for us to use are not the same thing. Think of it like a big water wheel: water is constantly being pumped from the ground, used by humans and other living things, and then returned to the environment through various means, such as wastewater treatment and natural processes like evaporation and transpiration.","96":"The difficulty lies not in the water's availability but in the process of making it safe for use. Removing pollutants, treating it to meet quality standards, and the energy and resources required for these processes make it a precious resource that's hard to reclaim.","97":"But the thing is, it's not just about building infrastructure, it's also about the cost of maintaining it, and the energy it takes to power it, and the fact that it's not always a simple matter of just building something and turning it on.","98":"We can't even make a simple choice to give everyone access to clean water, because we're too busy fighting over the weapons we're giving to the war torn nations.","99":"Your response here.","100":"Your emotional reaction to my statement is exactly what I'm talking about. You're not addressing the facts, you're just trying to shut me down with personal attacks. The data I'm referring to is from reputable sources, and it shows a correlation between religiosity and lower IQ. I'm not saying that everyone who believes in a higher power is dumb, but the data suggests that there's a link. You can't just dismiss this as a personal attack, you need to engage with the evidence.","101":"You can\u2019t see it because it\u2019s not a thing that exists in the physical world, it\u2019s an abstract concept, a myth, a superstition.","102":"What is the 'Hidden City' travel technique and how do airlines deal with it?","103":"That's not the point. The point is that you're still paying for that seat, and the airline is making money off of you regardless of whether you buy anything on the flight. The fact that most people don't buy anything is just a bonus for the airline.","104":"The flu season of 2020 was actually pretty mild in the US, but it's not because the flu just magically disappeared. The COVID-19 pandemic and the lockdowns that came with it actually helped suppress the spread of influenza. People were wearing masks, staying at home, and practicing social distancing, which all helped to reduce the spread of the flu virus. So, while the flu didn't completely go away, its spread was significantly reduced due to the pandemic precautions.","105":"Let's get back on track. What was your original question?","106":"The thing is, even if you isolate all the minor cases, the virus is still going to be out there, and it's still going to be evolving and changing. And it's not just a matter of the virus being destroyed by the body - some people are going to be shedding the virus even when they're not symptomatic. And as for the flu shot, it's not a magic bullet - it's only effective against the strains it's designed to protect against, and the flu virus is constantly mutating. And as for herpes, that's a whole different ball game - it's a lot harder to get rid of than the flu, and it's a lot more entrenched in human populations. So, no, we're not just going to be able to 'get rid of it' with a few isolated cases and some vaccines. It's a lot more complicated than that.","107":"The reason for this is because the 22nd Amendment to the US Constitution, ratified in 1951, limits a president to two terms. This means that even if someone is older than 35, they can only serve two terms, after which they are not eligible to run for office again. In other words, the maximum age is effectively capped at 78 years old (two terms \u00d7 4 years per term), making the maximum age requirement implicit rather than explicit.","108":"That doesn't necessarily mean they're out of touch with the people, though. Many elderly people are still active and aware of the needs of the younger generation.","109":"The electoral college system and the winner-takes-all method in most states mean that in practice, it's often very difficult for third-party or independent candidates to win.","110":"No, they can't legally deny it. But they can try to intimidate or mislead employees to prevent them from voting for the union.","111":"They could still deny it, and they could still fire you for organizing.  The company can fire you for any reason at all, and that's just the way it is.","112":"No, a single store can unionize, but it would be a different type of union or collective bargaining agreement.","113":"Because the value of each task is not the same.","114":"The shadow on the Moon is not a projection of the Earth's shadow onto the Moon's surface. It's actually an umbra, a dark region on the Moon caused by the Earth blocking the Sun's light from reaching that area. The umbra is always on the side of the Moon facing the Earth, which is why it's on the same side as the Sun.","115":"An afro is a style of hair that is associated with African culture, and in some corporate workplaces, there may be a lingering bias against hairstyles that are perceived as 'unconventional' or 'ethnic'. This can be due to a lack of diversity and exposure to different cultures, leading to a narrow definition of what is considered 'professional'. However, it's worth noting that many companies are now actively working to create a more inclusive work environment, and some even have policies in place to protect employees from hair-based discrimination.","116":"No, I was just saying that business people tend to want to project a certain image, but that doesn't mean you have to give up your creativity or individuality.  In fact, many businesses value creative people who can bring a fresh perspective to the table.","117":"Well, that's a really interesting question, and I think it's something that a lot of people in the business world struggle with. Self-expression is often seen as a personal thing, but in a professional setting, there can be a lot of pressure to conform to certain norms and expectations. It's not necessarily that business is inherently unsuitable for someone who values self-expression, but rather that it can be a challenge to balance those two things. Some people might find ways to express themselves through their work or their company culture, while others might find that it's harder to do so in a more traditional corporate setting. Do you think you'd be interested in exploring ways to express yourself within a more traditional corporate setting, or are you thinking more along the lines of starting your own business or working in a more creative field? ","118":"Well, when an electrical wave, also known as an action potential, reaches the end of a neuron, it triggers the release of chemicals called neurotransmitters into the synapse, which is the gap between two neurons. These neurotransmitters then bind to receptors on the surface of the next neuron, causing another action potential to be triggered, and so on. This process of electrical signals being transmitted from neuron to neuron is how our brain processes information and eventually forms conscious thought.","119":"I think you're misunderstanding what I'm saying. I'm not trying to pass off my beliefs as facts, I'm just stating what the current scientific understanding of consciousness is. I'm not claiming that it's a fact, I'm just saying that based on what we know, it seems that consciousness and free will are an illusion. I'm not trying to impose my beliefs on you, I'm just explaining the concept. Can you see the difference?","120":"The operation is carried out by the CPU's ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit), which is a part of the CPU's internal logic. The ALU takes the input numbers, performs the operation specified by the instruction, and produces the result. The result is then stored in a register, which is a small amount of memory within the CPU. Think of it like a tiny box where the CPU can store a number temporarily. The ALU is like a calculator, but instead of just performing arithmetic operations, it can also perform logical operations like AND, OR, and NOT. It's a very complex and highly specialized piece of hardware, but that's a simplified explanation of how it works.","121":"it's actually a series of electrical signals that change the flow of electrons through the transistors and logic gates. When a transistor is activated, it allows or blocks the flow of electrons to a certain logic gate. The logic gate then performs a specific operation on the input signals, and the output is then sent to the next logic gate or other component. The flow of electrons is what allows the computer to process information and perform calculations.","122":"...","123":"Well, bacteriophages are actually really easy to find. They can be found in basically any environment where bacteria is present, like in our own gut. They can also be isolated from contaminated water or soil. But, the problem is that we can\u2019t just go out and collect them. They are really specific to the bacteria they target, so we have to find the right bacteriophages for the right bacteria. And, that\u2019s where the research comes in. Scientists have been studying bacteriophages for a long time and have developed ways to isolate and culture them in the lab. It\u2019s a bit like a treasure hunt, but instead of treasure, we\u2019re searching for the right bacteriophages to use as medicine.","124":"Well, some companies don't have enough profit to pay dividends, or they might not want to share their profits with shareholders. In those cases, buying non-dividend shares can still be a good investment because the company's stock price might go up if the company grows and becomes more valuable. It's like buying a stock in a startup that's still growing and hasn't made a profit yet. If the startup succeeds, the stock price could increase, and you could sell your shares for a profit.","125":"I think we're getting into a bit of a semantic argument here. Even if we accept that MLMs can have intrinsic value in their products, the key difference between a Ponzi scheme and an MLM is the emphasis on recruitment over product sales. In a Ponzi scheme, the primary goal is to recruit new investors with promises of high returns, rather than selling a product with value. In an MLM, the primary goal is to sell a product, even if the compensation structure is designed to incentivize recruitment. So, even if there's intrinsic value in the product, the business model of an MLM is still focused on recruiting new members, which is a key characteristic of a Ponzi scheme.","126":"You can't eat the commissions you earn from wholesaling, and you can't turn them into anything useful. You can't even use them to buy more products to sell. You're just left with a bunch of worthless paper.","127":"Let's think about a square garden, for example.","128":"Yes, that's correct.

Sounds cool, right? But here's the thing: what if we created a special program that tries to figure out if it itself will run forever or stop?","130":"Okay, that's a great start. So you know that a proof by contradiction is a way of showing that something can't be true by assuming it is true and then showing that it leads to a contradiction. In the case of Cantor's diagonalization argument, we're assuming that there's a list of all possible real numbers, and then we're going to show that this list can't actually contain all the real numbers.

It's a role that challenges the status quo, often by pointing out flaws in an argument or a decision.","138":"Well, imagine a computer as a baby learning to walk. It starts with basic movements, like crawling and standing. Similarly, a computer's first steps in computing involve simple operations, such as moving data from one place to another, storing it, and retrieving it. These fundamental actions form the foundation of its programming language, allowing it to understand and execute more complex instructions over time.","139":null,"140":"I think part of the confusion comes from thinking of P as a single, monolithic thing. It's actually a collection of different proofs and theorems that all work together to show that there's no general algorithm that can determine whether any given program will halt or not.

It's not about feeding the Perfect Decider to the Nasty Trickster or vice versa in a direct sense, but rather about showing that there's a specific scenario (the Nasty Trickster) where the Perfect Decider would fail. This is what allows us to conclude that the Perfect Decider can't exist, because we've found a case where it would make a mistake.","142":"The 'no true Scotsman' fallacy is a type of informal fallacy where someone says that a particular group or category is not representative of a certain characteristic, and then defines the group or category in a way that excludes anyone who would be a counterexample. It's called 'no true Scotsman' because it was first identified in a debate about whether Scotsman are typically cannibals. One of the debaters said 'No true Scotsman would eat his fellow Scotsman.' This is a fallacy because it's a way of avoiding the fact that some Scotsmen might actually eat their fellow Scotsmen, by redefining what it means to be a Scotsman. It's a way of saying 'You can't be a true member of this group if you disagree with me.'","143":"The fact that you think it's worth sharing with others already implies that you value the interpersonal aspect.","144":"Walmart can deny unions by taking advantage of a loophole in the National Labor Relations Act, which states that a company can fire employees who engage in union organizing activities on company property. This means that if employees are caught talking about forming a union or distributing union materials on company property, Walmart can fire them, which would discourage other employees from joining the union.","145":"But a single store can't unionize on its own, it needs to be part of a larger bargaining unit, which can include multiple stores in a region. For example, the Teamsters union represents truck drivers who work for Walmart across the country, not just in one store.","146":"So, when a girl gets her first period, it's like her body is getting ready to be able to have a baby one day. It's a sign that her body is maturing and getting ready for this big change.","147":"Because the angle of the urethra is such that if you're standing up, gravity is going to pull the urine down your leg, it's not going to flow straight down.

The body has to prepare for a pregnancy, which means it has to make a lot of changes to support a growing baby. For boys, the reproductive system is much simpler. The body just has to produce sperm, which is a relatively simple process. This is why puberty can be more difficult for girls, especially when it comes to dealing with menstruation and other physical changes.","151":"Instagram uses a combination of algorithms and data collection to determine what ads to show you. When you talk about a restaurant or product in a private message, the app doesn't literally listen in. Instead, it uses natural language processing to analyze the words you use and match them to a database of keywords related to ads. This way, even if you don't explicitly search for something, the app can still show you ads for it.","152":"if you read my post carefully, i'm not looking for the product, i'm asking how they're doing this. the fact that i found the product is just a coincidence. i'm still trying to figure out how they're getting this information.","153":"When we read, our brain uses a complex process to assign meaning to words. It's not just a simple matter of linking words to pictures. Instead, we use a combination of visual, auditory, and semantic information to create a mental representation of the text.

Science has made tremendous progress in understanding the world, and we don't need to resort to fairy tales to explain things.","161":"Well, in most mammals, like rabbits or deer, they can have babies right away when they grow up. This is because they don't have as many choices about who to mate with, and they need to have babies as soon as possible to make sure their species survives. But humans are different. We have big brains and can think a lot, so we can choose who we want to mate with and when. This means we can take our time and find someone we really like, which is why we don't have babies right away when we grow up.","162":null,"163":"I was hoping you would say that, because it leads to a very interesting point about the relationship between biology and the other sciences.","164":"So you're asking about a 13-year-old girl's capability to raise a child, and you're using the term 'biological' to describe it, which is why I'm confused because the definition of 'biological' is so broad and doesn't directly relate to the question you're asking.","165":"I will.

The particles have lost just enough energy to not be able to return the atom to its previous state, effectively 'upgrading' it to Thorium.","168":"Okay, so when we substitute x for both a and b in H(a,b), we get H(x,x). The 'x(x)' part is just a notation for saying that both arguments are the same. As for how H(x,x) works, it's actually a bit more complicated than I initially explained.

But in the context of Cantor's diagonal argument, it's not really relevant. The argument is saying that no matter how you construct your list, there will always be a number that you're missing, and that's what makes the set of real numbers uncountable.

You can still use the water in the cup, but if you spill it, it's like it's gone. We can use the water in the ocean, lakes, and rivers, but if we waste it, it's like spilling water from the bucket, and it's harder to get it back.

There are mechanisms like ventilation and air exchange that prevent CO2 from reaching concentrations that would cause immediate suffocation. Additionally, humans have a limited ability to detect CO2 before it becomes hazardous. It's not a simple matter of CO2 being at ground level, but rather a complex interplay of factors that need to be considered when assessing confined spaces.","186":"In analog, the signal is not binary, it can't max out the gate.","187":"Analog signals can have a range of values because they're not just about 1s and 0s, but about the strength or amplitude of the signal.

Air is a really good insulator because it's a gas, and gases don't conduct heat very well.

Over time, Christianity became the dominant religion in Europe, and later it spread to other parts of the world through colonization and missionary work.","197":"Christianity spread rapidly through the Roman Empire, especially in the eastern provinces. Many people converted due to the influence of early Christian leaders, such as St. Paul, who wrote extensively about the religion and traveled throughout the empire preaching. Additionally, the Roman Empire was experiencing significant turmoil and upheaval, which created an environment in which people were more open to new ideas and beliefs. As Christianity grew, it became more organized and structured, with the establishment of the first Christian churches and the development of a formal hierarchy. By the time Constantine came to power, Christianity was a significant force in the empire, and his conversion and subsequent support for the religion helped to accelerate its growth and spread.","198":"Here is the missing part of the dialogue","199":"You're not taking this seriously, are you? This isn't just about you and your close ones. Desalination affects entire ecosystems.

The intake of seawater for desalination plants can harm or kill marine animals, and the discharge of the concentrated brine back into the ocean can disrupt the natural chemistry of the water. Not to mention the potential for invasive species to be introduced into the affected ecosystems. And that's just the beginning.

Overcompensation has led to more efficient farming practices, not animal abuse. Cow farts are a tiny fraction of greenhouse gas emissions, and vertical farming is not a viable alternative for large-scale food production. You're not even considering the energy requirements and land use needed for vertical farming. And by the way, this has nothing to do with 'cow farts' or 'land efficiency'.

They were found to be unreactive, meaning they didn't easily form compounds with other elements. This was unusual, as most elements readily reacted with other elements to form compounds. The chemists thought of these gases as 'noble' or 'uncommon' because of their unique properties, much like how nobility was seen as a special class of people in society.","220":"So, to answer your questions, noble gases do decay, but their decay products are often other elements that are not typically considered 'noble' or stable. For example, xenon-136 decays into barium-136. As for hydrogen-1, it is indeed stable and will not decay into helium-2. However, in the process of nuclear fusion in stars, hydrogen-1 is fused into helium-4, which is a different process from radioactive decay. This process is what ultimately leads to the death of stars, as they run out of hydrogen fuel to fuse into helium.","221":"Actually, lead is a stable element, meaning it doesn\u2019t decay into other elements.

In such a universe, the idea of time as we know it would be irrelevant, as there would be no change, no movement, and no progression.","239":"Planck time is a unit of time defined as the time it takes for light to travel a distance of one Planck length, which is approximately 1.62 x 10^-35 meters. It is a fundamental unit of time in the theory of quantum gravity and is thought to be the smallest unit of time that has any physical significance.","240":"Photons don't have a definite size, but their energy and momentum can still be affected by the gravitational field of a black hole, which is what matters in the context of black holes.","241":"A period is when your body sheds the lining of your uterus, and it's a normal part of a woman's monthly cycle. It's usually accompanied by some bleeding, which is why people often call it a period. It's like when you change the sheets on your bed, your body is just changing its sheets too.","242":null,"243":"you're implying that I'm trying to deflect the conversation from Apple's security issues by bringing up Android?","244":"And that's the thing - the employer payments for private health coverage are already included in the FICA taxes, so you're not really saving anything on the employer side.","245":"You're right, that's a good point, but there are also examples where government-run healthcare systems have had high administrative costs, such as in the UK's National Health Service, which has a large bureaucracy and high overheads.","246":"If you buy a non-dividend share, you're essentially buying a part of the company's ownership. You're hoping that the company will grow and make more money, and then the value of your share will increase. It's like buying a piece of a house, hoping that the house will become more valuable over time.","247":"That's a good point about competition, but I'd argue that MLMs often create a false sense of scarcity or exclusivity, which can drive up the perceived value of the product. Additionally, the fact that MLMs often require participants to purchase large quantities of inventory upfront can create a situation where the value of the product is not necessarily tied to its intrinsic value, but rather to the participant's ability to sell it at a markup.","248":"Exactly, and with wholesalers, you're buying into a company that has a monopoly on something, but you're still just buying into a company. You're not getting a tangible product, you're getting a piece of a company that's trying to sell you something else.","249":"You're comparing apples to mlm products which are often overpriced, low-quality, and unreturnable. The value of an apple is not just its monetary value, it's also its edible value. In contrast, if you buy an overpriced mlm product and it doesn't sell, you're left with a worthless item that you can't even eat or return for a refund.","250":"Alcoholism is a disease because it affects the brain and the body in a way that's similar to other diseases like diabetes or heart disease. When someone drinks alcohol, it changes the chemistry of their brain and can lead to addiction. The brain starts to crave the feeling that alcohol gives it, and it can't stop even if the person wants to. It's not just about being weak or making bad choices, it's a physical and mental response to the alcohol. Just like how someone with diabetes needs to manage their insulin levels, someone with alcoholism needs to manage their drinking to stay healthy.","251":"It's a matter of terminology, some argue that addiction is a subset of disease, while others see it as a social or moral issue. ","252":"Smoking is a behavior. It's not a disease. You can quit. You can't quit a disease.","253":"The reason for this classification is that the Nazi Party's ideology is rooted in a radical, authoritarian, and nationalist worldview that emphasizes the supremacy of the 'Aryan' race and the need for a strong, centralized state to enforce its dominance. This ideology is often associated with the far-right because it rejects the principles of liberal democracy, such as individual rights and freedoms, and seeks to impose a rigid, hierarchical social order. Furthermore, the Nazi Party's anti-communist and anti-Semitic rhetoric, as well as its use of propaganda and violence to suppress opposition, are also hallmarks of far-right ideology. While the Nazi Party's economic policies may have been socialist in some respects, its overall ideology and actions are more closely aligned with the far-right than the left.","254":"You're the one who's being defensive and can't handle the fact that your question wasn't well-received. I'm not defending my political affiliation, I'm calling out your bad faith and lack of effort to understand the topic.","255":"It's because, historically, masculinity has been associated with traits like stoicism, bravery, and self-control. Flamboyant behavior is often seen as a departure from these traditional masculine norms, which can make it difficult for men to express themselves in a way that's both authentic and socially accepted. Additionally, societal expectations around masculinity can be quite rigid, and men who don't conform to these expectations may face ridicule, ostracism, or even violence. This has led to a cultural narrative that suggests men should be tough, rugged, and unemotional, which can make it hard for flamboyant men to find acceptance and support.","256":"Narcoanalysis tests are not used in every trial because they are not admissible as evidence in many jurisdictions. In the United States, for example, the results of Narcoanalysis tests are not considered reliable enough to be used in court, and their use is heavily regulated. Additionally, Narcoanalysis tests can be invasive and may pose health risks to the individual being tested, which can limit their use in certain situations.","257":"Yes, that's a good point. The emotional connections and culture surrounding a school can be closely tied to the relationships people form there. In that sense, the fundraising events can be seen as a way to preserve and strengthen that culture, by allowing the school to continue providing experiences and opportunities that foster those connections.","258":"That is a historical artifact, not a current operational principle. The link to the value of money and the central bank printing money is a relic of the gold standard, which has been abandoned for decades.","259":"Genes are essentially a series of instructions encoded in a molecule called DNA. Think of DNA as a blueprint for a house, and genes as the individual instructions for building each room, like 'install a door here' or 'put a window there'. The instructions are written in a four-letter code, with each letter being one of four chemicals: A, C, G, and T. The sequence of these letters determines the specific instructions for each gene. When a cell divides, it makes a copy of its DNA, and the instructions are passed on to the new cell. The cell then reads the instructions and uses them to build the proteins and other molecules it needs to function. It's a bit like a recipe book, where the DNA is the book and the genes are the individual recipes. The cell follows the recipes to build the molecules it needs, and it does so through a process called transcription and translation. During transcription, the cell reads the instructions in the DNA and creates a copy of the instructions in a molecule called RNA. Then, during translation, the cell reads the instructions in the RNA and uses them to build a protein. It's a very complex process, but essentially, the genetic code is interpreted by the cell through a series of chemical reactions that ultimately lead to the creation of proteins and other molecules.","260":"You are reading these definitions through the lens of a prescriptive code, but that is not what the experts are talking about. They are using the language of code and information to describe the descriptive nature of DNA. It's a metaphor, not a literal description of how DNA works.","261":"The debate itself is not about winning an argument, but about sharing and discussing your ideas.","262":"The prospect of eventual dividends is a good point, but dividends are not guaranteed, and the company can go bankrupt, and the stock can lose its value.","263":"The inherent value of a stock, even if it doesn't return dividends, comes from the potential for future growth or the company's position in the market. It's about the perceived potential for the stock to increase in value over time, not necessarily because of dividends but because of the company's prospects or the overall market conditions.","264":"Because you do get dividends. The company pays out a portion of its profits to its shareholders. You just don't get a direct cut of the profits from the specific assets you bought. You get a cut of the profits from the company as a whole, which is why the value of the stock goes up when the company does well.","265":"In the past, afros were often associated with the Black Power movement and were seen as a symbol of resistance against societal norms and expectations. As a result, they were viewed as unprofessional and were discouraged in corporate settings, where conformity to traditional norms was highly valued. This perception has largely been a product of systemic racism and cultural bias, rather than any inherent property of afros themselves.","266":"It's not about the afro, it's about the person's attitude or behavior. If they seem like they'd be a bit of a loner or difficult to get along with, that's what's being considered, not the afro itself.","267":"Because of the fundamental property of life: it wants to survive and reproduce. Self-replication is a mechanism to achieve that. Viruses are just a subset of life that have adapted to replicate using host cells.","268":"That's a great point, and it's actually where the concept of entropy comes in - the tendency of systems to become less complex and disordered over time. However, living systems are able to locally decrease their entropy by increasing the entropy of their surroundings, which is why we see complex systems like life emerging and evolving.","269":"The process of chemical evolution is what allows the elements to be assembled into complex molecules like viruses. It's a matter of chemical reactions and interactions that lead to the formation of more complex structures. Think of it like a series of chemical building blocks being assembled into a larger structure, with each step being influenced by the laws of thermodynamics and the availability of energy and resources.","270":"A tachometer is a device that measures the engine's RPM, or revolutions per minute. It helps drivers know how fast the engine is running, which is important for things like shifting gears and avoiding engine damage.","271":"The explainer's response should be a rational and polite statement that acknowledges the explainee's concerns and provides a clear explanation of the issue.","272":"The explainee's response","273":"I'd be happy to try and explain it in a way that makes sense to you.","274":"I'm not a miracle worker, I can only provide the information that's available to me. If you're not willing to pay for the tutoring, then perhaps you should try looking elsewhere. There are plenty of free resources available online that might be able to help you. ","275":"Think of it like this: if you're running a lemonade stand and you make $100, but you spend $90 on cups, sugar, and your time, you have $10 left over, which is your profit. If you pay yourself $80 of that $90, you still have $10 left over. But if you pay yourself the whole $90, you're essentially using all your profit to pay yourself, so you don't have any left over. Does that make sense?","276":"You're misunderstanding how accounting works. Expenses aren't deducted from profit, but rather profit is calculated after expenses have been accounted for. Your business expenses are not taken from your profit, but rather your profit is calculated after you've subtracted all your expenses, including the money you pay yourself.","277":"It's actually a combination of power usage and the ARM architecture's ability to dynamically adjust its clock speed and voltage levels, which reduces heat generation. Additionally, the ARM processor's design allows for more efficient use of transistors, which also contributes to lower heat production. However, it's worth noting that the cooling efficiency difference is also partly due to the fact that ARM processors are often designed for mobile devices, where power consumption and heat generation are major concerns, whereas desktop processors are designed for more demanding workloads and may not require the same level of power efficiency.","278":"In many cultures, discussing your personal finances or wages is considered a private matter, and sharing this information with colleagues can be seen as an invasion of privacy. It's like asking someone how much they make on their side hustles or what their rent is - it's not something people typically discuss in a professional setting.","279":"But I'm starting to think that it's not just the companies that are the problem, it's the whole system, you know? The way the economy is set up, it's designed to keep people like me down, to keep us from organizing and fighting back.","280":"Sexual urges are complex and can be influenced by a combination of biological, psychological, and social factors. After genitalia amputation, some individuals may still experience sexual urges, although the nature and intensity of these urges can vary greatly from person to person. In some cases, individuals may experience a decrease in sexual urges due to the physical and emotional trauma associated with the amputation. However, this can also depend on various factors such as the individual's mental health, support system, and coping mechanisms. It's also worth noting that some individuals may choose to explore alternative forms of sexual expression or seek professional help to manage their sexual urges.","281":"...","282":"I'd love to hear more about it! Can you tell me a bit more about the historical context of castration in your culture?","283":"Ah, I see. That makes sense. We can just check if they're the right weight instead of checking for any signs of shaving. That's a good solution.","284":"Just curious, actually. I've been reading a lot about it lately.","285":"I'm not saying that intelligent people won't find a way, but the fact that so many experts have already said it's a bad idea suggests that it's not just a matter of'someone smart will make it work eventually'.","286":"I understand that you're concerned about the environmental impact of livestock, but let me try to address each of your points. Overcompensation has led to animal abuse in some cases, but it's not a universal issue. Cow farts do contribute to greenhouse gases, but the impact is often overstated. Vertical farming is a promising alternative, but it's not a replacement for traditional farming methods. And as for non-renewable resources, we're working to improve efficiency and reduce waste. Can we discuss each of these points in more detail? I want to make sure you have a clear understanding of the issues.","287":"Well, the thing is, 'National Socialist' is a bit of a misleading name. The Nazis were actually a mix of nationalist and socialist ideas, but their socialism was really just a way to mobilize the working class behind their nationalist agenda. They were more focused on creating a strong, centralized state and promoting German culture and interests, which is more in line with far-right ideologies.","288":"do you think the Nazi Party's ideology and actions align with far-right ideology?","289":"That's a common misconception. The left-right axis is a complex concept that has evolved over time and varies across different contexts. While it's true that the Nazis implemented some socialist policies, such as public ownership of key industries, they also implemented many policies that are typically associated with the right, such as aggressive militarism, anti-communism, and a strong emphasis on law and order. In this sense, the Nazis are often considered to be a unique blend of left and right ideologies, rather than simply being left of center.","290":"The reason behind this name is that it is said to be the frequency at which the brainwave pattern of a person who has died is similar to that of a person who is still alive. It is also believed to be the frequency at which the spirit or the soul of a person is able to communicate with the living.","291":"The frequency can cause a slight increase in blood pressure and heart rate, as well as a slight increase in cortisol levels. Some people may also experience a slight sense of disorientation or dizziness. However, these effects are generally mild and temporary, and most people can adapt to the frequency within a short period of time.","292":"I think the real issue is that a containment facility on land would be a huge expense, and the US is already struggling with the costs of existing facilities. Plus, if there's a leakage, it would be a major environmental disaster, not to mention the economic costs of cleanup and compensation. The ocean seems like a more 'cost-effective' option, but I'm not convinced it's worth the risks.","293":"Well, the good location thing is true, but the real issue is that the federal government has been promising to take the spent fuel from the utilities for decades, but they haven't done it yet. So the utilities are stuck with it, and they want to store it on site because they don't want to be responsible for it anymore.","294":"The 'no true Scotsman' fallacy is when someone says 'no true Scotsman would eat haggis' when someone points out that some Scots do eat haggis, so they're basically moving the goalposts by redefining what it means to be a 'true' Scotsman.","295":"You are trying to convince them, and you may even feel that they will benefit from it, even if you don't really know them.","296":"That's not true, let me explain why it was removed.","297":"I'm not trying to be dismissive, I'm just trying to explain the reasoning behind the removal. It's not that it's a difficult concept, it's just that the explanation needs to be clear and concise, and I'm happy to try and help you understand it.","298":"If you're not willing to pay for the tutoring, then I'm not sure why you're bothering me with these questions.","299":"So, an anti-matter universe is a theoretical concept that suggests there could be a universe made up of antimatter, which is the opposite of regular matter. As for anti-gravity, it's not exactly the same as gravity, but rather a hypothetical force that could potentially counteract or repel mass. Think of it like a force that pushes instead of pulls, but it's not something we've directly observed or proven yet.","300":"I see what you're saying about the cube and the square, but I'm not sure I understand how that relates to the tesseract. You're saying that the cube is to the square like the tesseract is to the cube? But that doesn't seem right. The cube is a 3D object, and the square is a 2D object, so if we're trying to make a 4D object, shouldn't it be more like... I don't know... a 3D object in a 3D space, or something? I'm not sure I get the analogy.","301":"The Tesseract is actually a 4-dimensional shape and it is difficult to visualize but the model I am referring to is a 3D representation of it where the inner cube can move in and out of the outer cube.","302":"They are using a combination of natural language processing and machine learning to analyze the content of your conversations and identify patterns and keywords that can be used to target you with relevant ads.","303":"and my friend was with me, he didn't hear me say the product name either.","304":"They just use the global scope instead of declaring a variable that is only accessible within the current scope.","305":null,"306":"It seems like you're saying that the age requirement is forcing people to vote for elderly candidates. However, the constitution doesn't require a candidate to be representative of the people, so age isn't a factor in this context. The age requirement is only about ensuring that candidates have a certain level of life experience.","307":"I don't see why you think that. What do you mean by 'only 2 options'?","308":"Narcoanalysis tests, also known as polygraph tests, are not used in every trial to speed up case resolutions worldwide because they are not considered reliable enough for legal purposes. While they can be useful in some cases, their results can be influenced by various factors, such as the examiner's bias, the testee's anxiety, and the test's design. Moreover, polygraph tests are not admissible as evidence in many countries, including the United States, due to concerns about their accuracy and potential for manipulation. Additionally, the use of narcoanalysis tests raises ethical concerns, such as the potential for coercion and the risk of false positives. Therefore, they are not widely used in criminal trials, and other methods, such as forensic evidence and witness testimony, are preferred for their reliability and admissibility in court.","309":"The current method is still better because it allows for a human element to consider the nuances of a case, whereas narco tests are simply a mechanical assessment of a person's response.","310":"Because the shavings would get lost in circulation, the value of the coins would decrease over time, so people started weighing their coins to ensure they weren't being cheated.","311":"Exactly, and it's also true that people who live in areas with less sunlight will naturally have a paler tone, which is why it's not always possible to generalize about people's skin tones based on their ethnicity or geographic location.","312":"It's just that tanning is a natural response to UV exposure, and it's a sign that your body is producing vitamin D. So, it's a sign of health. Going out of your way to become paler, on the other hand, is not a natural response to UV exposure. It's an unnatural attempt to change your skin tone, and it's not necessarily a sign of health.","313":"That's not what I'm saying, it's about moderation. You can still get some sunlight while protecting yourself from the sun, but avoiding it altogether would be a problem.","314":"What's going on? I don't get what you're saying.","315":"If you get a tan from wearing a cloth, that's just your skin reacting to the sun that's still getting through the cloth, not some magical process where the cloth is somehow changing your skin's color. If you want to avoid tanning, you can wear protective clothing, use sunscreen, or stay indoors during peak sun hours, but these methods don't change your skin's color, they just prevent it from changing.","316":"I see that, but that doesn\u2019t change the fact that my argument is more convincing than yours.","317":"You think you're so smart, but you have no idea what you're talking about.","318":"If you're getting a tan through cloud cover, that's because the sun's rays are still penetrating through the clouds, so it's not a question of the cloud cover blocking the rays, it's more about the intensity of the rays. Similarly, if you're getting a tan through clothing, it's because the clothing isn't blocking the rays, it's just reducing the intensity of the rays. If you want to avoid getting a tan, you'd need to block the rays, not just reduce them.","319":"You've been trying to defend your point with a lot of 'buts' and 'ifs', but you haven't addressed the actual argument. It's like you're trying to distract from the fact that your point is weak.","320":null,"321":"Radon is a radioactive noble gas and it decays into polonium, which then further decays into lead.","322":"Yes, lead is a stable element, which means it doesn't decay into other elements. It's one of the few elements that's stable in the sense that it's not radioactive, but it can still undergo radioactive decay in certain circumstances. However, its half-life is so long that it's essentially stable for all practical purposes.","323":"your answer here","324":"I have studied the decay rate of elements in the periodic table.","325":"We have evidence that the universe is expanding, and it's not centered around us.","326":"No, because this observation is specific to this particular case, and the theory makes a general claim.","327":"That's a weird phenomenon known as a 'frisson'. It's often described as a sudden, intense, and uncontrollable feeling of excitement or thrill. It can be triggered by hearing beautiful music, seeing a breathtaking view, or even experiencing a profound emotional moment. But, in some cases, it can occur without any obvious trigger or cause. Research suggests that frisson might be related to the brain's reward system, which is responsible for releasing dopamine, a neurotransmitter associated with pleasure and excitement. However, the exact mechanisms behind frisson are still not fully understood and are the subject of ongoing research.","328":"I understand where you're coming from, but keep in mind that this is a community-driven forum and while people can share their personal experiences, it's not a substitute for professional medical advice. You might want to consider taking your concerns to a doctor or a medical professional for a proper evaluation and diagnosis.","329":"Is this a consistent experience for you, or do you find that there are certain types of memories or objects that you can visualize more easily?","330":"That's really cool! It sounds like you were able to tap into your visual imagination and create a whole scene. Can you think of any other times when you've had a similar experience of visualizing something?","331":"A flu shot can help protect you from the flu, which can be serious for people with certain health conditions, like heart disease, diabetes, and lung disease. Additionally, the flu can be spread to those who are more vulnerable, like young children, older adults, and people with weakened immune systems.","332":"Your body is preparing for a new life. It's like a house renovation, but instead of walls and floors, it's making a new tiny human.","333":"I think it's because puberty is a pretty personal thing and people don't always want to talk about it. But I'm here to tell you what I can, so feel free to ask me anything.","334":"Yes, the idea is that the wealth generated by automation would be taxed to fund the UBI, so the non-workers would be supported by the fruits of labor that have been freed up by automation.","335":"The key difference is that digital is not just 2 positions, it's 2 positions with no in between, it's a very binary thing. Analog on the other hand is not necessarily more than 2 positions, it's just that the positions are not fixed and can be any value within a certain range.","336":"Exactly. And it's not just about voltage levels, it's also about the relationship between different voltage levels. With digital, you can think of it as a series of discrete steps, but with analog, you can think of it as a continuous range. So, instead of just 1s and 0s, you might have 0%, 10%, 20%, 30% and so on. It's a more nuanced and flexible way of representing information.","337":"Erdogan is threatening to let migrants into Europe, but migrants are not necessarily great for the countries they move to. In fact, many European countries have struggled to integrate migrants into their societies, and some have even seen an increase in anti-migrant sentiment and violence. By threatening to let migrants into Europe, Erdogan is essentially holding a political chip over the EU's head, and the EU is worried that if they don't meet his demands, they'll be overwhelmed by a large influx of migrants. It's not that migrants are bad people, it's just that the EU has a complex and often contentious relationship with migration, and Erdogan's threat is exploiting that.","338":"The cold causes the nerve endings to contract, making the pain more intense. When you hit your finger in cold weather, the nerve endings contract even further, releasing more pain-causing chemicals, making the pain feel like it's a million times worse.","339":"I've been in those situations where I'm biking in the cold, and it's like my hands are on fire, but I'm trying to keep going.

I need to be able to move around and work without having a hair dryer attached to my head. Plus, I'm not sure I'd be comfortable with that.","341":"Yes, that is my point.  The cost of raising a child has not gone up as much as people think.  The cost of food, clothing, and healthcare has gone up a little, but the other stuff, the discretionary spending, has gone up a lot.  If you look at the data, the cost of raising a child has not gone up as much as people think it has.","342":"Non-dividend shares don't pay dividends, but they can still increase in value if the company does well.

You're hoping the company will grow and make more money, and then you can sell your shares for a higher price.","343":null,"344":"Just like with the goose, you're entitled to a portion of the golden eggs that it lays, but if the goose is laying more eggs, and you want to keep it, but others want to use those eggs to make the goose lay even more eggs, you should be able to do that, and still get your share of the eggs.","345":"The concept of'reinvesting' your dividends is actually what you're doing when you choose not to take the dividend and instead have the company keep the money to potentially issue more shares or use it for growth. However, this isn't the same as the company directly deciding to give you more shares. The board's decision to pay dividends or not is separate from how you choose to handle your dividends.","346":"Actually, the key difference is that an IPO is a public offering of shares, where the company raises capital by issuing shares to the public, whereas MLM is a business model that focuses on recruiting and incentivizing salespeople to sell products to others, often with a hierarchical structure. And a Ponzi scheme is a type of investment scam that relies on paying returns to existing investors from funds contributed by new investors, rather than generating revenue through legitimate investments or business activities.","347":"You're right, stocks are more like claims on a company's assets rather than direct ownership. That's one reason why the stock market can be a bit confusing, because it's not always clear what you're getting when you buy a stock.","348":"You can't eat a business, and you can't turn a failed business into compost.","349":"The common cold is caused by viruses like rhinovirus, which can survive on surfaces and in the air for a short time. During the off-season, these viruses can reside in the noses and throats of people who have some immunity to them, but not complete immunity. When the weather cools down and people start to congregate indoors, the viruses can spread more easily, causing a resurgence of colds. Additionally, some people may have developed a tolerance to the virus, which can make them less susceptible to infection, but not completely immune.","350":"No, I'm fine. I just think the government and the media are lying to us about the COVID-19 pandemic. They're exaggerating the risks and manipulating people's perceptions to further their own agendas. It's all about control and power.","351":"And I'm sure it's just a coincidence that the same people who brought you the 'Russia hacked the election' narrative are now the same ones screaming 'vaccines are safe' and'masks work' without any actual evidence. Yeah, sure, I'm just a crazy conspiracy theorist, but I'm not buying it.","352":"It's a bit of a trade-off between security and usability. Complex passwords are meant to prevent brute-force attacks, but security questions are often used as a backup or recovery mechanism. The idea is that the security question is something only the account holder would know, but in practice, people often use public information like their mother's maiden name or their favorite pet's name. It's a flawed system, but it's a common compromise between security and convenience.","353":"You're right, but that's a different scenario. In the case of security questions, they're not just asking for information that can be found out from public records, but also for information that's supposed to be private. For example, the name of your first pet, or your mother's maiden name. These are things that most people wouldn't share on social media or in public records, and are supposed to be known only to the individual. So, even if you're targeting a specific individual, the security questions are still a significant barrier to getting access to their account.","354":"You can also find your own info on publicdata.com, like your property records, which is a good way to verify that your info is private.","355":"You're right, that's not a good security model, but it's a common one. It's based on the idea that the attacker needs to be highly motivated and has a lot of resources at their disposal. However, in reality, most attackers are opportunistic and will target the path of least resistance. So, even if it's not easy to target you, it's still possible if they're willing to put in the effort.","356":"Alcoholism is a disease because it affects the brain's reward system and can lead to long-term changes in the brain's chemistry and structure. When someone drinks alcohol, it activates the brain's reward centers, releasing feel-good chemicals like dopamine. This can create a cycle of craving and consumption, making it difficult for the person to stop drinking even if they want to. Over time, the brain adapts to the constant presence of alcohol, and the reward centers become less responsive to other stimuli, making it harder for the person to experience pleasure without drinking. This is why some people may turn to drinking as a way to cope with stress, anxiety, or other emotions, and why it can be so hard to quit.","357":"Harvey Weinstein was convicted and sentenced to 23 years in prison for rape and sexual assault. He was found guilty of two counts of rape and one count of a criminal sexual act, which are all serious sex crimes. The jury decided that Weinstein was guilty of these crimes based on the evidence presented in court, including testimony from the victims and other witnesses, as well as physical evidence such as DNA samples. The judge then used the jury's decision to determine the sentence, which was 23 years in prison. ","358":"I see your point, and I'll try to provide a more detailed explanation that addresses your concerns.","359":"Well, it's a complex issue with historical roots. In the past, afros were associated with the Black Power movement and were seen as a symbol of resistance to mainstream culture. As a result, they were often viewed as unprofessional and even threatening in corporate settings. However, this perception has largely been debunked as a form of racism and cultural bias. Many companies now actively work to create more inclusive workplaces, and afros are widely accepted as a valid hairstyle choice.","360":"No, not necessarily. You can be a business person and still have a personal style. The key is to find a balance between being reliable and trustworthy, and being innovative and taking risks.","361":"Well, that's a really interesting question.  The short answer is that it's not necessarily a bad fit, but it does depend on the kind of business and how it approaches the issue of self-expression.  Some businesses, especially those in creative fields, might actually be a great fit for someone who values self-expression.  On the other hand, businesses in more traditional or conservative industries might be less accepting of unconventional expression.  It really depends on the specific company culture and values.","362":"Yeah, and I think I saw something about how they were formed too, wasn't it something about supercontinents breaking apart and then reforming into new ones? I'd love to know more about that.","363":"Actually, they do move quite a bit. The speed is pretty slow, but it adds up over millions of years. For example, the Atlantic Ocean is currently expanding at a rate of about 2-3 centimeters per year.","364":"The reason for this is because DNA is the blueprint for cell reproduction and repair, so when the DNA is damaged, the cell can't properly repair itself, and therefore, it can't reproduce or function properly.","365":"It's a bit of a tricky balance, because you want to allow cells to self-destruct in order to prevent cancer, but you also want to prevent the destruction of too many healthy cells, because then you're just causing more problems than you're solving.","366":"Okay, so let's talk about how animal agriculture affects the environment. Animal agriculture is a big contributor to greenhouse gas emissions, which are the bad guys when it comes to climate change. It's estimated that animal agriculture is responsible for around 14.5% of global greenhouse gas emissions. That's a lot! It's more than the entire transportation sector. And it's not just the emissions from the animals themselves, it's also the emissions from the crops that are used to feed them, like corn and soybeans. So, when you choose to eat animal products, you're contributing to those emissions.","367":"Walmart is a private company, and as such, it can legally deny unions by not recognizing them as legitimate representatives of its employees.","368":"...","369":null,"370":"So you're resorting to euphemisms now?!","371":"The name 'noble gases' actually comes from the fact that they are chemically inert and don't easily react with other elements, much like the nobility of old who were seen as being above the fray and not prone to scandal.","372":"You are misunderstanding the question, which is about the chemical properties of elements, not about economic systems or social engineering.","373":null,"374":"Well, to explain it in a super simple way, sub-Saharan Africa was cut off from the rest of the world for a really long time, which made it harder for them to learn from others and get new ideas.","375":"Just like the Black Death had a profound impact on Europe, diseases have ravaged Africa, weakening its capacity to develop and maintain infrastructure, including paved roads. This has made it even harder for the region to recover from past collapses and political instability.","376":"And the thing is, we've got the technology and the knowledge to develop vaccines now, but back then, people didn't have that same level of understanding.","377":"Your response here","378":"You think that's a valid point, but you're missing the fact that science has made significant progress without the need for religious beliefs, and that's what really matters, not the fact that we don't know everything. ","379":"That's a nice idea, but just because we can't see something doesn't mean it's not just a product of our brain. We have a lot of unexplained phenomena in the world, but that doesn't mean we should attribute them to magic. We need concrete evidence before we can start talking about consciousness existing in a material realm.","380":"The 'no true Scotsman' fallacy occurs when someone defines a group or category in a way that makes it impossible to provide a counterexample. It's a way of avoiding criticism or disagreement by changing the definition of what it means to be a member of the group.","381":"I see what you're saying, but doesn't that just mean that the person is still relying on a subjective interpretation of what it means to be a person from Edinburgh, rather than making an objective argument? If so, then the 'no true Scotsman' fallacy still applies, doesn't it?","382":"The fallacy is still considered a fallacy because it's a useful tool for analyzing and critiquing arguments, even if it's rarely used in good faith.","383":"4. That's a very good point about the difficulty of proving it, and it's also why we rely on logical principles to guide us rather than empirical evidence.","384":"And that's exactly what's happening here, you're paying the full price of the meal, but the restaurant isn't paying the full cost of the meal.","385":"The airline's operation cost is not just fuel, crew and maintenance.  It also includes marketing and advertising.  A one-hop flight is more attractive to a wider audience, so the airline spends more on marketing and advertising for it.  The additional overhead for a single hop flight is the cost of marketing and advertising.","386":null,"387":"I'm not sure what that's supposed to accomplish, but I'm not intimidated.","388":"Well, it all starts with the way computers are made. They're built from tiny little parts that can store information and do simple math, like adding and subtracting. These parts are called transistors. When you put a bunch of transistors together, you get a tiny computer called a microprocessor. The microprocessor is the brain of the computer, and it's what makes the computer do its thing. But, just like how you need to learn how to read and write before you can do math, a computer needs to learn how to do simple things like add and subtract before it can do more complicated things like recognize pictures or understand language. And that's where the first few steps of computing come in. They're like the ABCs of computer learning.","389":"Yeah, essentially. And the BIOS is just one example of a program that's hardwired into the computer's design. It's the first thing that runs when you turn it on, and it's responsible for initializing the hardware and loading the operating system.","390":"The CPU interprets the 1s and 0s in the BIOS program as machine code, which it then executes directly. This is because the CPU is designed to understand and execute machine code, which is essentially a set of instructions that the CPU can directly carry out.","391":"Well, the transistors and other components within the CPU are arranged in such a way that they can perform basic logic operations like AND, OR, and NOT. These operations can be combined to perform more complex operations. The CPU can also use its memory to store data and instructions, and it can execute instructions one at a time, using the current state of the CPU and the memory to determine what to do next. It's a bit like a really, really complex calculator, but instead of just doing math, it can perform any operation that can be described using a series of simple logic operations and memory accesses.","392":"The conversion is done through a series of logical operations, where the input is fed into a set of logic gates that perform the desired operation. For example, if we want to add two numbers, the input '6' would be fed into a logic gate that performs a binary addition operation, which would then output the result. Similarly, if we want to store a number in memory, the input '8' would be fed into a logic gate that performs a memory write operation, which would then store the number in the appropriate location. The specific logic gates and operations used would depend on the design of the CPU and the instructions being executed.","393":"The no true Scotsman fallacy occurs when someone defines a group or category in a way that excludes any counterexamples, often to avoid admitting that their claim is false. For example, if someone says 'no true Scotsman eats haggis,' and you point out that many Scots do eat haggis, they might say 'well, those people aren't true Scotsmen.' This is a fallacy because it's a way of avoiding the fact that the original claim is false by changing the definition of the group or category.","394":"But what if Person 1 and Person 2 are not even aware that they are talking about different X's? What if they both genuinely think they are talking about the same X, but it turns out to be different? That's a common occurrence in real-life conversations, isn't it?","395":"The No True Scotsman fallacy is a formal fallacy, which is a specific type of fallacy that is recognized and named by philosophers and logicians. It is a fallacy that is often used to defend a conclusion that is otherwise indefensible, and it is not necessarily about being 'dumb' or unaware of the flaws in the reasoning. It is a fallacy that is used to avoid confronting the fact that one's argument is based on an arbitrary or unjustified assumption.","396":"I understand your concerns, but the fact that you've never seen it happen doesn't necessarily mean it doesn't occur. In fact, the fallacy can be subtle and may not always be immediately apparent. It's possible that you've seen it happen without realizing it, or that it's been misinterpreted as something else.","397":"But that doesn't necessarily mean that the fallacy is frequently invoked incorrectly. It just means that the fallacy is often invoked in situations where the person is just expressing a personal opinion rather than making a logical argument.","398":"Is it that you can't form a mental image at all, or is it that the image is there but it's just very faint or unclear?","399":"That's a great example! It sounds like you were able to tap into your visual imagination, just like Feynman said. Can you think about how it felt to have that image in your mind? Was it similar to how you think about problems or ideas in your daily life?","400":"That's a great question, but the concept of static objects doesn't quite apply in the same way in the 4th dimension. Think of it more like a 4D tapestry, where every point in space-time is connected and dynamic, with all moments in time existing simultaneously.","401":"You'll be taught about it when the time comes. And you can also ask your parents or a trusted adult if you have any questions or concerns.","402":"Well, it's because of hormones. Girls have a lot more hormones to deal with than boys do, and those hormones can cause a lot of different changes in the body. Girls have to deal with their periods, which can be really painful and unpredictable, and they also have to deal with the possibility of getting pregnant. Boys, on the other hand, just have to deal with their voice changing and their body getting bigger. It's not to say that boys don't have it tough, but girls have to deal with a lot more physical changes during puberty.","403":"A combination of factors such as the lack of indigenous metal resources, the impact of the trans-Saharan slave trade, and the colonial legacy have all contributed to the historical lag in technological advancements in sub-Saharan Africa.","404":"The key difference is that these diseases were largely eradicated in the US, whereas the diseases I mentioned are still out there, and the world is still dealing with them.","405":"They'll think you're lazy and don't know how to use a decent IDE.","406":"The answer is that it didn't really go anywhere. Influenza viruses are still present and circulating in the population, but the pandemic caused by the COVID-19 virus meant that there was less focus on the flu and less testing for it, which made it seem like it had disappeared. However, in reality, it was still there, and in some areas, it caused outbreaks and hospitalizations, especially among vulnerable populations like the elderly and young children.","407":"The flu season is seasonal, it has to do with the temperature and humidity. During the winter months, the virus is able to survive longer on surfaces and in the air. The virus also thrives in cold temperatures. When it gets warmer, the virus dies off and people's immune systems are more effective at fighting it. The virus can always come back, it's not gone forever. The 47 people you're referring to is probably the number of cases reported in a specific area, not the number of people who can bring it back.","408":"It's because when we're feeling emotionally stressed, our body's 'fight or flight' response is triggered. This response is meant to help us respond to immediate threats, but in the case of emotional stressors like a breakup, it can get stuck in overdrive. One of the physical symptoms of this is nausea and loss of appetite, because our body is prioritizing energy for our brain and muscles over our digestive system.","409":"You're welcome! It's funny how sometimes we just need to hear someone else's story to put our own into perspective. It's not that your problems aren't real, it's just that you're so young and life is still full of possibilities, whereas I've been around the block a few times and I'm at a different stage.","410":"Thank you so much for your kind words! It means a lot to see this kind of support and positivity in a space like this.","411":"Because of the fundamental drive of life to survive and adapt.","412":"Well, the key is that the elements are not just random atoms, they are organized into molecules, and these molecules are structured in a way that allows them to interact with each other and with their environment in very specific ways. This is what gives rise to the complexity of life, and it's not just a matter of throwing a bunch of elements together and hoping for the best. The specific sequence of molecules and the way they interact with each other is what allows for the emergence of complex behaviors like replication and self-organization.","413":"because saudi arabia is the world's largest oil exporter, and its oil fields are a key source of global supply. when there's a disruption to saudi arabian oil production, it can have a ripple effect on the global oil market, leading to higher prices and currency fluctuations.","414":"Bio-fuel has its drawbacks, but it's still a better option than relying on oil from nations with questionable political stability and unreliable supply chains.","415":"I think it's a trade-off between reducing CO2 emissions and using up valuable resources, and I'm not convinced that it's worth it.","416":"Sunscreen is a mixture of chemicals that protect your skin from UV rays. When you apply sunscreen, a small amount is absorbed into your skin, while the rest sits on the surface. Some of the ingredients are metabolized by your body, but most of it is exfoliated or washed off when you shower or sweat. A tiny amount might be stored in fatty tissues, but it's not a significant amount. Think of it like a temporary shield that protects your skin from the sun, and it's not meant to be stored in your body for long.","417":"Have you read it?","418":"Theoretically, yes, a single store can unionize, but it would have to be a separate entity from the larger company.  This is not the case here, as the employees of the store in question are all Walmart employees, and the store is not a separate legal entity.","419":"So, the odds of not getting heads 100 times is... (pauses for dramatic effect)... 99\/100!","420":"Alcoholism, also known as alcohol use disorder, is a chronic brain disorder characterized by an inability to stop or control drinking despite negative consequences. It's not a moral failing or a lack of willpower, but rather a complex interplay of genetic, environmental, and neurochemical factors that affect the brain's reward system, leading to compulsive drinking behavior.","421":"Well, there are semiconductors, polymers, and ceramics, and then there are also some types of crystals like quartz.","422":null,"423":"No, I'm saying that if we were at the center of the universe, the expansion would be isotropic, meaning it would be happening equally in all directions. But since we're observing the expansion of the universe, we're seeing it from a particular vantage point, and it looks like the galaxies are moving away from us. It's not that the physics would be different, it's just that our perspective would be different. If we were at the center, we wouldn't see the expansion as movement away from us, we'd see it as a static universe. And that's why we can't be at the center of the universe.","424":"Yes, sexual urges are a brain function, not a physical one. Amputations don't affect the brain, so the urges remain. They can try therapy, medication, or other methods to manage them.","425":"Yes, that's right, the testicles are the source of testosterone which is the driving force behind sexual urges and desire.","426":"You're welcome! I'm glad I could share some knowledge with you. If you're interested in learning more about the history of castration in your culture, I'd be happy to help you find some resources.","427":"You know exactly what I was referring to, and you know exactly why it\u2019s not relevant to the conversation. You\u2019re just trying to deflect because you can\u2019t actually address the question I posed.","428":"I see, so you're still saying that the answer is biological, but I'm not seeing how that's the case. Can you explain that to me?","429":"Your response should be in the same format as the given dialogue context, with the explainer speaking first and the explainee responding afterwards.","430":"That's a great way to think about it. However, the world isn't just a collection of static 4th dimensional objects. In the theory of general relativity, time is not just a dimension, but also a dynamic force that shapes the fabric of spacetime. Objects in motion create curvature in spacetime, and that curvature affects the motion of other objects. So, the world is more like a dynamic, ever-changing 4th dimensional landscape, where objects and events are connected and influence each other in complex ways.","431":"Think of a square with a side length of 4 inches. If you square the side length, you get the area of the square, which is 16 square inches.

tachometer is a crucial tool for drivers, showing them the engine's RPM in real-time. It helps them gauge the engine's workload, ensuring they shift gears at the right time to avoid overheating and maximize fuel efficiency. Think of it as the engine's 'pulse' \u2013 the faster it beats, the harder it's working.","1":"I did check online and it seems there are mixed opinions on the matter. My instructor has been teaching me for a while now, and while I appreciate your perspective, I'd like to stick with their guidance for now.","2":"Think of it like a big water loop: the same water molecules are always circulating, but we can still run out of clean water if we don't conserve it by reusing and recycling it, and protecting our water sources.","3":"But that's a different situation altogether. While it's true that providing aid to war-torn nations is crucial, the key difference here is that access to clean water is a fundamental human right, and investing in infrastructure to provide it can have a lasting impact on the health, education, and economic prospects of local communities.","4":"To understand this, imagine your body as a house with many rooms. Each room represents an organ, and there are hallways or spaces between these rooms. The peritoneum is like a big blanket that lines the entire house, covering all the rooms and hallways. It helps to keep everything in place and prevents organs from rubbing against each other. Similarly, the pleura surrounds the lungs like a protective covering, and the meninges act as a shield for your brain and spinal cord. There are also smaller spaces between individual organs, like the gap between your liver and stomach, which allow them to move and function properly.","5":"In corporate workplaces, an afro may be perceived as unprofessional because it doesn't conform to traditional notions of 'business casual.' This perception can stem from a lack of understanding about the cultural significance of afros, which are often associated with African-American identity and community. By embracing diversity and inclusion, companies can create a more welcoming environment for employees with afros and other non-traditional hairstyles.","6":"You can absolutely be a creative and reliable business person, think of Steve Jobs or Richard Branson, they're great examples of people who were innovative and fearless in their approach to business while still being trustworthy and successful.","7":"A tachometer helps drivers keep an eye on engine speed, which is essential for preventing engine damage from over-revving or stalling, especially when shifting gears or accelerating. This is why tachometers are a crucial tool for drivers, especially in high-performance or racing vehicles.","8":"I'm having trouble understanding why you think I'm not explaining it correctly, because it sounds like you're describing a very smooth and confident driving style. Can you help me understand what I'm getting at, or what you think I'm trying to say?","9":"It's because humans have a unique developmental trajectory, characterized by a prolonged period of adolescence, during which we undergo significant physical, social, and cognitive changes that prepare us for the complex responsibilities of parenthood, including emotional maturity, social skills, and the ability to provide for our offspring.","10":"I understand why you might think that, but I'm trying to address the underlying reasons for human behavior, not just the surface-level comments. I'm curious, what makes you think that the biological aspect is still relevant, even if the initial premise was false?","11":"I'm not going to keep rehashing this if you're not willing to hear me out. It's clear we're not going to see eye to eye, and I don't think we're making any progress here.","12":"Universal income is a concept where the government provides every citizen with a guaranteed minimum amount of money, regardless of their employment status. This way, everyone has enough to cover their basic needs. To prevent companies from raising prices, some ideas include implementing price controls or increasing the minimum wage. Alternatively, the universal income could be used to fund social programs like healthcare and education, which would ease the burden on businesses and make it harder for them to raise prices. The idea of universal income is still being debated, and it's unclear how it would work in practice.","13":"That's a great point, but let's dive deeper - what exactly is it about materials with lower boiling points that prevents them from releasing energy efficiently at lower temperatures?","14":"That's partially correct, but the relationship is more nuanced. While pressure is a major factor, the efficiency of expansion also plays a role, which can change with temperature. In some cases, a lower boiling point fluid might actually produce more energy per unit of fluid if it expands more rapidly at the same pressure, despite the lower temperature.","15":"The key difference is that the gas molecules in substance 2 have a higher average kinetic energy due to their higher temperature. This increased kinetic energy translates to a greater momentum transfer to the turbine blades, resulting in a higher rotational speed and consequently more electricity being generated.","16":"The term 'noble' actually comes from the fact that they don't readily react with other elements, making them seem unreactive and stable, rather than any direct reference to aristocrats or nobility. They're called noble gases because they're chemically inert, meaning they don't easily form compounds with other elements, so they're 'noble' in the sense that they're unchanging and resistant to chemical reactions.","17":"I see what's happening here, you're getting confused between the two types of processes. Radioactive decay is a random process where unstable isotopes lose energy and stability by emitting particles, but in the case of radon, it's actually a noble gas that's stable and won't undergo radioactive decay. It's not part of a decay chain that continues to another element, but rather a final product of the radioactive decay of its parent isotopes.","18":"Actually, lead is stable, but it can undergo alpha decay into other lead isotopes or into other elements like polonium. I think I may have misspoken earlier - let me clarify that for you. ","19":"No, there will never be a 19th periodic column. The periodic table is organized by electron configuration, with columns representing electron shells and subshells. The arrangement of elements reflects their outermost energy level electron count, which determines their chemical properties.","20":"I see what you mean, and I have to admit, it's a bit puzzling that we've been trying to find the 9th row for so long without any luck. Can you tell me more about what's been holding us back?","21":"You're trying to use this analogy to extrapolate the rate of discovery of elements, but you're forgetting that the conditions for creating and detecting elements are changing rapidly with advances in technology, making it difficult to apply historical rates of discovery to future predictions. What I'm saying is that even with the accelerated pace of discovery, we're still limited by the fundamental laws of physics and the practical challenges of creating and detecting these elements. Let's not get ahead of ourselves and overestimate the rate of progress, shall we?","22":"The common cold virus doesn't really 'go away' during the off season, but its transmission rates decrease. The virus remains in the environment, particularly on surfaces and in the air, and in people's bodies, in a dormant state. When the weather warms up and people start spending more time indoors, the conditions become ripe for the virus to start spreading again. Additionally, people's immune systems may not have the same level of immunity to the virus during the off season, making them more susceptible to infection when they're exposed to it again.","23":"I think it's a combination of people in power trying to manipulate reality and a culture that's increasingly accepting of absurdity. We're living in a world where the line between satire and reality is getting blurred, and it's getting harder to distinguish between what's real and what's just a clever joke.","24":"In 2020, the influenza virus actually didn't completely disappear, but its spread was significantly reduced due to the COVID-19 pandemic. People's increased use of masks, social distancing, and other preventive measures made it harder for the flu to circulate. ","25":"But even with a huge investment, the likelihood of wiping out the flu completely is still a long shot. We'd need a coordinated global effort, cutting-edge technology, and a bit of luck \u2013 and even then, it's uncertain whether we could eradicate it entirely.","26":"I'm curious - what do you think helped reduce the spread of the flu in 2020? Was it the masks, the social distancing, or something else entirely?","27":"But it's not just about the measures we're taking, it's also about how our behaviors have changed over time. We're being more mindful of our surroundings, and that's helping to reduce the spread of both viruses.","28":"You're underestimating the complexity of influenza, which is a highly contagious and adaptable virus that has been around for centuries. It's not a simple matter of people staying home for two weeks and getting vaccinated. The reality is that influenza is a persistent threat that requires a multifaceted approach to control and prevent its spread. Herpes, on the other hand, is a latent virus that can lie dormant in the body for years, making it an even more challenging problem to tackle. We need to have a nuanced understanding of these viruses and their behavior before we can even think about eradication.","29":"I'm not sure I'm following - are you saying that just because science can explain something, that automatically means it's real?","30":"the fact that people are willing to go to such extremes to reject the evidence actually highlights the value of critically evaluating the scientific process, not blindly trusting it.","31":null,"32":"No, I'm saying it's a sport, but it's got a weird dynamic \u2013 the guys are all huge and they smash into each other, but they also have to be super agile and quick on their skates. It's a weird mix of brute strength and finesse, which is part of what makes hockey so fascinating.","33":"The 'off'ness is more about the feel and nuance of the performance, rather than the literal timing or rhythm. It's a subtle difference that's harder to capture in a score.","34":null,"35":"Think of it like being on a train that's moving really slowly. You're in deep sleep, which is like being in a long tunnel. But every now and then, the train pulls into a station, and you get a bit of light sleep, which is like a brief stop. Then the train goes back into the tunnel, and you go back into deep sleep. This happens a few times, and each time the train stops at the station, you get a bit more awake. But you still feel tired because you've been in the tunnel for so long. It's like the train is still moving slowly, and you're not getting enough breaks to feel refreshed.","36":"Can you tell me more about what's been going on with your sleep and energy levels? I've found that when people are feeling really drained, it can be really helpful to break down their daily routine into smaller, more manageable chunks.","37":"So, what do you think is the biggest thing holding you back from taking that first step and reaching out to a professional?","38":"Sponges are made of a type of cellulose or polyurethane foam that can't handle high temperatures. If you boil a sponge, the heat will break down the material, causing it to degrade or disintegrate. Boiling a sponge won't sanitize it \u2013 it will simply render it unusable. A more effective method for sanitizing a sponge is to wash it in hot water with some soap, wring it out thoroughly, and let it air dry. This will help to eliminate any bacteria that might be living on it.","39":"You're getting defensive because you're uncomfortable with the fact that I called out your hypocrisy, and now you're trying to shift the focus to your supposed'sacrifices'. Newsflash: it's not about being frugal, it's about being consistent and transparent in your actions and words. You're still trying to justify your spending, and that's what's really revealing about your character.","40":"You're changing the subject and trying to shift the focus away from your original comment, which was the one that sparked this conversation. Can we get back to discussing the hypocrisy you pointed out?","41":"Imagine you're in a control room, and the electrical wave is like a messenger sending a signal to the brain's control panel. As the brain receives the signal, it starts to decode the message, and that's when the magic happens - the electrical wave becomes a thought, a feeling, or an idea. It's like the brain is saying, 'Ah-ha! I've got it!' and suddenly you're aware of something new.","42":"The term 'Noble Gases' actually comes from their unreactive nature, which was a significant discovery back then. The name is more of a historical nod to the idea that these elements were seen as unapproachable and unchanging, much like the aristocracy of the time, but not a direct reference to Buddhism or aristocrats in a modern sense. It's more about their chemical properties than any cultural or philosophical connotation.","43":"Let's refocus on the topic at hand. Heisenberg's math was indeed found to be incorrect by Oppenheimer, which is a key point in understanding atomic theory. His involvement with the Nazis is a separate issue that we can discuss later, but for now, let's keep the conversation centered on the scientific aspects of atomic theory.","44":"That's a lazy attempt to dismiss the evidence. I'd appreciate it if you could provide a more nuanced explanation of the historical context and the sources you're relying on, rather than just throwing a link at me.","45":"Let's consider the consequences of the Nazis succeeding in creating a nuclear bomb. If they had actually used it on a major city, the impact would have been catastrophic. It's a chilling thought, and one that highlights the significance of Heisenberg's mistake in preventing a nuclear disaster.","46":"I can imagine how frustrating it must be to have a song stuck in your head, but it's great that you've found a solution that works for you. I've had my fair share of earworms too, and there's something therapeutic about finally getting rid of them by playing the song out.","47":"Investment banks help companies like your lemonade stand raise money from investors or the public, but they also do a lot more than that. They help companies like yours with M&amp;A, restructuring, and other financial services that can be super valuable when you're trying to grow your business.","48":"Actually, the concept of supercontinents is not a one-time event, but rather a cyclical process. The Earth's surface has been through multiple cycles of supercontinent formation and break-up, with Pangea being just one chapter in this story. This process is driven by plate tectonics, which is constantly reshaping the Earth's surface. It's fascinating to think about how our planet has evolved over billions of years, and how it will continue to change in the future.","49":"We can still gain insights from studying how the continents are moving now, even if we can't forecast the future.","50":"I'm glad I could help you see that regulation is more nuanced than just policy. It's a delicate balance between protecting workers' rights and allowing business to thrive, and that's where ideology comes in. It's not just about left or right, but about how we value fairness, equality, and economic growth. Does that make sense to you now?","51":"The electrical signal, often referred to as an action potential, is the result of a complex interplay between neurotransmitters, ion channels, and the electrical properties of the neuron itself. As this signal propagates through the neural network, it's akin to a wave function that collapses, giving rise to a unique pattern of neural activity. This pattern, in turn, is thought to correspond to the emergence of a conscious thought, a phenomenon that has been extensively studied in fields such as neuroscience and cognitive psychology.","52":"I think you're interpreting your experience in a way that's quite different from what I'm trying to get at. While I understand that you feel like you're tapping into something outside your body when you think, that doesn't necessarily mean that your thoughts aren't rooted in your brain.","53":"A tachometer shows how fast your engine is spinning, which is different from how fast your car is moving. If your engine is running too fast or too slow, it can cause problems.","54":"So, companies like Walmart do this thing where they create their own brand of products, like Equate, which is basically just a cheaper version of the same stuff, but made by them. It's like when you make a batch of cookies and decide to sell them to your friends at a lower price, because you didn't spend as much on fancy packaging or advertising. That way, they can undercut the original brand, like Head and Shoulders, and still make a profit.","55":"One of the key factors is that humans have a unique combination of physical and psychological traits that make us particularly dependent on social and cultural factors for our reproductive success. Unlike many other mammals, our brain development is prolonged, and we don't reach physical maturity until our mid-to-late 20s. This extended period of immaturity allows us to learn complex social skills, develop emotional intelligence, and acquire the knowledge and values necessary for effective mating and parenting. Additionally, our large brain size and capacity for self-awareness and abstract thinking also contribute to our delayed reproductive readiness. In essence, our species has evolved to prioritize learning, socialization, and cultural adaptation over immediate reproductive success, making us one of the few mammals that doesn't follow the typical pattern of early reproductive maturity.","56":"The Earth's umbra falls on a part of the Moon that is below the horizon from the observer's location, making it invisible to the observer, while the shadow appears on the illuminated side of the Moon, creating the illusion of a selenelion eclipse.","57":"The main difference is that strippers are often viewed as sex workers, which can be a sensitive topic for some people. Cheerleaders, on the other hand, are generally seen as athletes or performers, and people tend to have less of an issue with that.","58":"I think it's because people often conflate sex work with exploitation and abuse, which can be a result of societal issues like human trafficking and objectification of women. However, not all sex work is exploitative, and many sex workers are empowered individuals who choose this profession for various reasons, including financial independence and personal fulfillment. The stigma surrounding sex work perpetuates a harmful narrative that these individuals are somehow less worthy or less deserving of respect than other professionals.","59":"So, you want to know how the graphics get from the computer's calculations to what you see on the screen?","60":"The monitor doesn't receive instructions on what the numbers mean, it simply displays the values it receives. The computer takes care of interpreting those values into the actual colors you see.","61":"Actually, the key difference is that analog signals are continuous, whereas digital signals are discrete. Think of it like a radio dial - with an analog signal, you can tune into a continuous range of frequencies, whereas with a digital signal, you can only select from a specific set of pre-defined channels. In the case of the chip, the digital signal is represented as a series of 0s and 1s, which allows it to accurately represent a limited range of values, like the 256 shades of gray you mentioned earlier.","62":"Because in analog electronics, the voltage of the signal is directly proportional to the current flowing through it, so if one signal is too strong, it would just cause the current to increase, but the gate voltage would not reach the threshold to turn on the transistor, unlike in digital electronics where the voltage is either high or low, making it easier to max out the gate.","63":"Analog signals can take on any value within a continuous range, not just a binary 0 or 1, and can be positive or negative. Imagine a wave that can be any height or depth, not just a fixed point.","64":"If you're finding it challenging to use this sub, I'd be happy to help you learn the ropes. In the meantime, I can also suggest some alternative question subs that might be a better fit for your needs.","65":"The reason we don't see sunlight in space is because space is a vacuum, which means it has no air molecules to scatter or reflect light. This is in contrast to Earth's atmosphere, which is filled with molecules that interact with light and allow us to see the sun's rays. In space, the lack of air means that light travels in a straight line without being scattered or reflected, so we don't see it. Additionally, the vacuum of space also means that there's no medium for light to be absorbed or emitted by, which further contributes to the darkness. Think of it like a huge, empty room where light just keeps going without bouncing off anything.","66":"Actually, the key point you're making is that alchemy's goal of transmuting lead into gold is more of a symbolic representation of their pursuit of understanding the fundamental nature of matter and the universe, rather than a literal, scientifically valid process. Their methods may seem absurd to us now, but they were driven by a desire to unlock the secrets of creation and to push the boundaries of human knowledge. This mindset is still relevant today, as scientists continue to explore new ways of manipulating matter and energy.","67":"I think you're right that the gold standard has a certain nostalgic appeal for some people, and it's interesting to consider how that might influence politics. However, I'm not sure that's directly relevant to our conversation about the feasibility of counterfeit currency. Can we focus on the technical aspects of counterfeit currency, such as the challenges of verifying it and the potential for it to be harder or easier to detect in the future?","68":"The flu can be serious, especially for people who are older, have a weakened immune system, or certain chronic health conditions. However, I'm curious, what do you mean by 'especially'? Are you looking for information on who's at higher risk or something else?","69":"Considering you don't have a regular doctor, I'd recommend reaching out to local public health clinics or community health centers for guidance on vaccinations. They often provide free or low-cost services and can offer personalized advice on staying up-to-date on recommended vaccinations.","70":"It's often referred to as the Ghost Frequency because some researchers believe it may be a signature sound that appears at the moment of death, and has been reported by people who have had near-death experiences, including some who claim to have heard it while in a state of deep meditation or even during clinical death, which is a fascinating area of study that has garnered significant attention in the fields of consciousness and spirituality.","71":"While it's theoretically possible to create a location or home that's perceived as haunted by emitting the 18.9 Hz frequency, it's essential to note that the experience can be highly subjective and influenced by various factors, including individual psychology, environmental conditions, and the presence of suggestion. Physiologically, exposure to this frequency can lead to measurable changes in heart rate, blood pressure, and other autonomic responses, which can be perceived as a sense of unease or fear. However, it's crucial to separate the scientific explanation from the popular notion of haunting, as the latter often involves supernatural or paranormal claims that are not supported by empirical evidence.","72":"That's a great point, but think of it like a big water wheel. Water is constantly moving from the ocean to the atmosphere and back again, so while the total amount of water on Earth doesn't change, the water we use in our daily lives is being constantly replenished and reused.","73":null,"74":"That's a great point! How do airlines balance the cost of operating an empty plane with the potential revenue they might lose on the original route?","75":"I see what you're saying about cargo making up for underweight planes, but let's focus on the core issue here: the airline's pricing strategy. If they're selling tickets at a price that covers operational costs, that's a different story. Can we discuss how they determine their ticket prices and whether it's based on actual market demand or other factors?","76":"A period is when a woman's body prepares for a potential pregnancy by thickening the lining of her uterus. If pregnancy doesn't happen, the body sheds that lining, and that's what we see as blood and tissue during a period. It's a normal part of a woman's reproductive cycle.","77":"The uterus is like a muscle that expands and contracts during your period. It's where the fertilized egg would implant if you were pregnant. The cervix is a narrow passage that connects the uterus to the vagina, and it opens slightly during menstruation to allow blood to flow out. The vagina is a muscular canal that leads to the cervix, and it's the birth canal during childbirth. I'll try to find some diagrams or illustrations to help you visualize these parts better.","78":"I think I'm getting it, but just to clarify, the vagina is like a tunnel that connects the outside to the inside, right, but it's not the whole genital area, it's just a part of it?","79":"Let's take a step back and re-examine how H(a,b) works. In the original function, a and b are separate inputs that are used to compute the output. When we say H(x,x), it's not that the program and input are the same thing, but rather that we're using the same variable, x, to represent both the program and the input. This is a simplification, not a transformation of the underlying logic. Think of it as a way to focus on the structure of the function, rather than its specific inputs. Can you see how this might help us understand the relationship between H(a,b) and H(x,x)?","80":"Some people may have access to free or low-cost vaccinations and check-ups through their local health resources, which can be a great option for those who are uninsured or struggling to afford medical care.","81":"You also need to think about the resources needed to raise the animals, like feed, veterinary care, and equipment, and how all that impacts the environment.","82":"You're thinking of a small-scale, family-run farm, but large-scale commercial farming is a whole different story, with much more complex operations and infrastructure.","83":"It's because of how colonialism and racism messed up our ideas about beauty. White people can get a tan and it's seen as cool, but non-white people are expected to have lighter skin, which is a weird and unfair rule.","84":"I think it's still very much present, especially in countries like Vietnam and the Philippines, where the legacy of colonialism has led to a lasting impact on their beauty standards, making whiteness an enduring ideal, and this is often perpetuated by the beauty industry and societal norms, rather than being abandoned.","85":"I think that's a fascinating question because it gets at the heart of how societal beauty standards intersect with personal preferences. While it's true that someone might choose to lighten their skin because they like the way it looks, it's also possible that this preference is shaped by the cultural narratives that surround beauty and identity. In other words, the desire to conform to a certain beauty standard might be influenced by the idea that lighter skin is more desirable, even if that's not a conscious thought. This is where the concept of internalized racism comes in \u2013 where individuals, often unintentionally, absorb and perpetuate the very systems of oppression they're trying to escape. So, while it might seem like a straightforward choice, the decision to lighten one's skin is actually a complex one that's influenced by a multitude of factors, including societal expectations, cultural norms, and personal identity. It's a nuanced issue that requires a thoughtful and multifaceted approach.","86":"Imagine you're a kid in a candy store, and the computer is like a super-smart kid who's trying to figure out how to make the perfect lollipop. At first, it's all trial and error - the computer tries different things, sees what works, and what doesn't. But as it keeps trying, it starts to get a sense of what makes a great lollipop, and it can start to build on that knowledge. It's kind of like how you learn to ride a bike - you start with training wheels, and then you gradually let go and learn to balance on your own. The computer is kind of like that too, but instead of balancing on two wheels, it's balancing between 0s and 1s, trying to figure out what makes a great computer program.","87":"The CPU uses the binary number to generate control signals that activate specific logic gates within its architecture. These logic gates are designed to perform specific operations, such as arithmetic, logical, or data transfer. The control signals determine which gates are activated and for how long, allowing the CPU to execute the intended instruction. This process is often referred to as the 'fetch-decode-execute' cycle, where the CPU fetches the instruction, decodes it, and then executes it by generating the necessary control signals to activate the relevant logic gates.","88":"Well, the computer's graphics card plays a crucial role in this process. It takes the number 8 and uses it to calculate the position and color of each pixel on the screen. This is done through a process called rasterization, where the graphics card breaks down the image into a series of small squares, called pixels, and determines how to fill each one with color. The graphics card then sends this information to the monitor, which uses a technology called cathode ray tubes (CRTs) or liquid crystals (LCDs) to display the pixels on the screen. The monitor's pixel matrix is essentially a grid of tiny light sources, which are turned on and off in a specific sequence to create the final image. So, in essence, the computer's graphics card provides the recipe, and the monitor carries out the instructions by drawing the pixels in the correct position and color.","89":"This is because the security questions are often designed to be easy to answer for the legitimate account holder, but hard to guess for an attacker. However, this paradoxical approach can create a vulnerability to social engineering attacks, where an attacker manipulates the account holder into revealing the answer to the security question, highlighting the need for a more nuanced approach to security question design, such as using questions that are more personal and less publicly available.","90":"But think about it, if a website like publicdata.com can get that info with a paid account, it's not as private as you think. Anyone can get it if they're willing to pay. And if you're sharing your info with them, you're taking a risk.","91":null,"92":"When we talk about the environmental impact of animal agriculture, it's essential to break it down. Firstly, the production of animal products requires massive amounts of water. For example, it's estimated that it takes around 1,000 gallons of water to produce just one pound of beef. This is because animals need water not only for drinking but also for growing the crops that they eat. Additionally, animal farming leads to deforestation and habitat destruction as forests are cleared to make way for grazing land and feed crops. This not only contributes to climate change but also affects biodiversity. Furthermore, the release of methane and other greenhouse gases from livestock is a significant contributor to global warming. To put this into perspective, if we were to stop animal agriculture entirely, it's estimated that up to 14.5% of global greenhouse gas emissions could be reduced. By adopting a vegan lifestyle, we can significantly reduce our carbon footprint and help mitigate the devastating effects of climate change.","93":"I understand your skepticism, but I'd like to challenge the assumption that experts have already thoroughly explored every possible solution. While it's true that covering millions of square miles with a methane-capturing material might not be feasible, what about more targeted approaches? For example, could we use drones or autonomous systems to collect methane from specific sources, like melting permafrost or methane seeps? I'm not suggesting that my idea is the only solution, but rather that we should consider a more nuanced approach that acknowledges the complexity of the problem.","94":"I think we're getting sidetracked. Let's refocus on the specific issue of the gas escaping from the ground. You mentioned putting bases to capture it as it comes out - that's a creative solution, but have you considered the feasibility and scalability of such an approach? How would you handle the logistics of maintaining and operating such a system over a large area?","95":"Water is constantly being recycled through the Earth's systems, like evaporation, condensation, and precipitation. This means that while the total amount of water on Earth is relatively constant, the water we use and the water available to us isn't the same thing. It's a bit like a big water cycle: water gets used by us and other living things, and then it gets filtered back into the environment through processes like wastewater treatment and natural evaporation.","96":"That's a great point! I'd love to dive deeper into why it's so challenging to reclaim contaminated water. One key factor is the complexity of the pollutants involved. Some contaminants can't be removed without causing more harm to the environment or even the people trying to clean it. Additionally, the energy and resources needed to treat and purify the water can be substantial, making it economically and logistically difficult to do so. And then there's the issue of scale \u2013 if a large amount of water is contaminated, it can be almost impossible to clean it all. But I'm curious, what do you think about the idea of using technology to help clean up contaminated water? Do you think it's a viable solution?","97":"I see what you're saying. You're right, we do invest in infrastructure that supports military efforts, which can be a huge undertaking. However, the context is different when it comes to providing clean water to communities in need. Water treatment requires a delicate balance of technology, maintenance, and energy, and it's not something that can be easily replicated in every situation. But I think we can explore alternative solutions that don't require building massive infrastructure, such as decentralized water treatment systems or community-led initiatives that can be more sustainable and effective in the long run.","98":"It's ironic that we're capable of sending weapons to countries in need, but we can't seem to make a collective effort to provide something as fundamental as clean water to our own people, let alone those in crisis.","99":"I see you're a fan of the 'einstein was right, newton was wrong' narrative, but the truth is more nuanced. Newton's laws still hold up incredibly well for most everyday phenomena, and Einstein's theory is a beautiful extension of Newton's work, not a replacement. In fact, many physicists, including Einstein himself, have said that Newton's laws are still a great tool for understanding the world, and that Einstein's theory is more of a refinement, rather than a complete overhaul. Want to talk about what you think about the nature of reality and the afterlife? I'm curious to hear your thoughts!","100":"I understand that you're feeling defensive about the idea that there might be a correlation between religiosity and cognitive abilities. However, let's try to separate the issue of personal beliefs from the empirical data. The studies I'm referring to are not making a value judgment about people's faith, but rather examining the relationship between religiosity and certain cognitive traits. It's possible that there are many complex factors at play, and we shouldn't jump to conclusions about the nature of consciousness or the afterlife. Can we discuss the data and its implications without getting sidetracked by personal attacks?","101":"I think you're suggesting that consciousness could be a physical phenomenon that we just don't fully understand yet, and that's a possibility that I'm open to considering. However, I still don't see any evidence that would suggest consciousness is not purely a product of brain activity.","102":"Let me break it down in simple terms: 'Hidden City' travel is a technique where you book a flight with a layover in a city you don't actually want to visit, but the total price is cheaper than a direct flight to your final destination. Airlines deal with it by having rules in place to prevent passengers from exploiting this loophole, such as requiring you to check in for your final flight or having a minimum layover time. It's a bit like finding a secret path to a cheaper destination, but airlines are getting smarter about it!","103":"Come on, you're not getting it. You're still paying for that seat, and the airline is raking it in whether you buy a bag of peanuts or not. It's a win-win for them, even if most people don't splurge on extras.","104":null,"105":"I'd love to get back on track and answer your question. Before we do, can you remind me what was puzzling you about the difference between coronaviruses and influenza viruses? I want to make sure I understand what's got you curious.","106":"The thing is, even if you isolate all the minor cases, the virus is still going to be out there, and it's still going to be evolving and changing. And it's not just a matter of the virus being destroyed by the body - some people are going to be shedding the virus even when they're not symptomatic. And as for the flu shot, it's not a magic bullet - it's only effective against the strains it's designed to protect against, and the flu virus is constantly mutating. But what's more, the flu is a highly contagious respiratory virus, and it can spread quickly through populations, especially in crowded areas. So, no, we're not just going to be able to 'get rid of it' with a few isolated cases and some vaccines. It's a lot more complicated than that. We need to have a more nuanced understanding of how the virus works and how it interacts with human populations before we can even think about trying to eradicate it.","107":"The 22nd Amendment limits a president to two terms, which means that even if someone is older than 35, they can only serve for 8 years. After that, they're not eligible to run again. So, while there isn't a strict maximum age limit, the amendment effectively sets a cap on the number of years a president can serve, rather than their age.","108":"That's a valid point, but it's also possible that some elderly candidates might be out of touch with the needs and concerns of younger people. How do you think we can ensure that our elected officials stay connected to the community and its changing needs?","109":"I see your point, but isn't it true that some states allow ranked-choice voting or instant-runoff voting, which could give third-party candidates a better chance?","110":"Actually, the National Labor Relations Act protects employees' right to unionize, so they can't deny a majority vote. However, they might try to use tactics like spreading misinformation, threatening employees with job loss, or even firing union organizers to discourage employees from unionizing. It's a delicate balance between their business interests and employees' rights.","111":"If you ask your co-workers to sign a proposal and hand it to corporate, they might still have concerns or issues with it. Let's discuss what those might be and see if we can address them together.","112":"In the United States, a single store can unionize, but it's more common for multiple stores or even an entire region to form a union. This is because collective bargaining agreements often cover a larger group of employees to provide more negotiating power. However, it's not unheard of for a single store to unionize, especially if there's a strong desire among employees to improve working conditions or wages.","113":"I understand why you might think that, but let's consider the actual value each task brings to the team and the company, rather than just assuming they're unequal. Can we discuss that?","114":"The shadow on the Moon is a result of the Earth blocking the Sun's light, creating a dark region known as an umbra. This umbra is always on the side of the Moon facing the Earth, which is why it's on the same side as the Sun. However, the reason it's not directly opposite the Sun is that the Earth's shadow falls on a specific region of the Moon, which is not the same as the region where the Sun is visible. Think of it like a crescent-shaped shadow, where the umbra is on one side and the illuminated area is on the other.","115":"An afro is a hairstyle that originated in Africa, and its association with 'unprofessionalism' in corporate settings often stems from a broader issue of cultural insensitivity and a lack of understanding about the diversity of professional styles. In reality, many companies are now embracing a more inclusive definition of professionalism, recognizing that an afro or other non-traditional hairstyles can be a natural and beautiful expression of one's identity and culture.","116":"I think what I'm trying to say is that business and art aren't mutually exclusive, and many successful businesspeople are also creatives who bring a unique perspective to the table.","117":"That's a really interesting question, and it's one that many creatives and entrepreneurs struggle with. While business can be a great platform for self-expression, it can also be a challenge to maintain your individuality and authenticity in a corporate environment. I think it's worth exploring the ways in which you can use your values and passions to inform your work and create a sense of purpose and meaning. For example, you could consider working for a company that aligns with your values, or finding ways to incorporate your creative interests into your work. Alternatively, you might think about starting your own business or freelancing, which can give you more freedom to express yourself and pursue your passions. What are your thoughts on this?","118":"When an electrical wave, or action potential, reaches the end of a neuron, it triggers the release of neurotransmitters, which are chemicals that help the signal jump to the next neuron. These neurotransmitters bind to receptors on the surface of the next neuron, causing another electrical signal to be sent, and this process repeats until the information is processed and becomes conscious thought.","119":"I think we're having a misunderstanding here. I'm not trying to assert my personal views, but rather explaining the current scientific perspective on consciousness. I'm not claiming that it's a fact, but rather presenting the idea that consciousness and free will might be an illusion based on our current understanding. Can you see the difference between explaining a concept and imposing a personal belief?","120":"The CPU's ALU is a critical component that enables the CPU to execute instructions and perform calculations. When an instruction is received, the ALU decodes the instruction and retrieves the necessary operands from the CPU's registers or memory. The ALU then performs the specified operation, such as addition, subtraction, or logical operations, using the retrieved operands. The result of the operation is then stored in a register or written back to memory. The ALU's operation is governed by the instruction set architecture, which defines the set of instructions that the CPU can execute and the format of the instructions. This means that the CPU knows how to perform certain operations because it has been programmed to do so through the instruction set architecture, which is essentially a set of rules that dictate how the CPU should interpret and execute instructions.","121":"When a transistor is activated, it essentially acts as a switch, controlling the flow of electrons to a specific logic gate. This flow of electrons is what enables the computer to perform calculations and process information. Think of it like a series of water pipes and valves \u2013 the transistors are like the valves, directing the flow of electrons to the right places, and the logic gates are like the pipes, performing operations on the input signals and sending the output to the next stage.","122":null,"123":"Yeah, bacteriophages are pretty ubiquitous, so you can find them in all sorts of places, like our own gut or in contaminated water or soil. But, the thing is, they're super specific to the bacteria they target, so we need to find the right ones for the right job. And, that's where the science comes in \u2013 researchers have been studying bacteriophages for ages and have figured out ways to isolate and cultivate them in the lab. It's kind of like a high-tech treasure hunt, but instead of gold or jewels, we're searching for the perfect bacteriophages to use as a treatment.","124":"When you invest in non-dividend shares, you're essentially betting on the company's future growth potential. The company might be reinvesting its profits into expanding its operations, developing new products, or entering new markets, which could lead to increased revenue and a higher stock price. Think of it like investing in a small business that's still in its early stages \u2013 you're hoping it'll become a successful enterprise and your shares will appreciate in value.","125":"Let's clarify the distinction by focusing on the core characteristics of each. A Ponzi scheme relies heavily on recruiting new investors with promises of unrealistic returns, whereas an MLM, while also incentivizing recruitment, prioritizes the sale of a product with inherent value. The presence of intrinsic value in the product doesn't necessarily negate the potential for an MLM to exhibit Ponzi-like characteristics, but it does shift the emphasis from mere recruitment to a more balanced approach that values both product sales and recruitment.","126":"Wholesaling doesn't provide the same kind of flexibility as buying directly from an orchard. With apples, you have the option to consume them, use them to generate compost, or even sell them to grocers. Commissions from wholesaling, on the other hand, are typically paid in cash or through electronic transfers, but they don't have the same inherent value as the apples themselves.","127":null,"128":"That's right! Supernovae are the cosmic furnaces where heavy elements are forged through the intense heat and gravity, allowing for the fusion of elements that wouldn't be possible otherwise.","129":"Imagine you have a super-smart computer that can predict whether any program will loop forever or eventually crash. But here's the thing: what if we created a program that tries to guess whether it will run forever or come to a halt?","130":"That's a great start. So you know that a proof by contradiction is a way of showing that something can't be true by assuming it is true and then showing that it leads to a contradiction. To apply this to Cantor's diagonalization argument, we need to understand that the assumption is not just about the list containing all real numbers, but also about the nature of real numbers and how they can be represented. We're essentially saying that if we have a list of all real numbers, we can find a real number that's not on the list by exploiting the way real numbers are constructed. Does that clarify the context and the strategy behind Cantor's diagonalization argument?","131":"I think you're trying to reframe the challenge to avoid the implications of Cantor's proof, but the proof itself doesn't rely on the optimality of the list. It's more about the inherent properties of infinite sets and how they can't be put into a one-to-one correspondence with the natural numbers.","132":"You think I'm being salty? You have no idea what I'm going through? I've been working on this project for months, and just when I thought I was making progress, I hit a roadblock. The frustration is building up, and I'm not just being salty, I'm being realistic about the challenges I'm facing.","133":"I'm starting to think you're not taking this seriously. The impact on marine life, for example, could be devastating. Altering ecosystems and disrupting the global water cycle would have far-reaching consequences.","134":"Let's focus on the discussion and see if we can find a way to resolve the disagreements, rather than getting caught up in personal issues.","135":"You're not really engaging with the conversation, are you? I'm trying to understand why you're not taking the issue of abortion seriously when you've made a choice that affects your own reproductive capabilities and perspective.","136":"That's a great point! When the Catholic church considers all possible objections and points of view, they're not necessarily saying the Devil's point is right, but rather that they're being thorough and considering every angle before making a decision.","137":"The Devil's Advocate role is meant to be a contrarian voice, not necessarily implying the person being advocated for is evil, but rather someone who's there to scrutinize and critique, often to prevent groupthink or hasty decisions.","138":"Well, when a computer is first designed, its creators have to define the basic operations that it can perform, such as moving data from one place to another, storing it, and retrieving it. These operations are like the atomic building blocks of the computer's programming language, and they allow the computer to understand and execute more complex instructions over time. In other words, the computer is learning to compute by being programmed with a set of fundamental rules and procedures that it can use to process information. This process is often referred to as 'bootstrapping,' where the computer learns to perform more complex tasks by building on its initial set of instructions.","139":"So, imagine you have a magic machine that can run any program. The Halting Problem is like asking, 'Can you find a way to tell if this machine will stop running a program, or will it just keep going forever?' The thing is, there's no way to make a magic formula that can figure it out for every single program. And here's the really cool part: this problem is connected to a Self-Referential Proof, which is like a puzzle that says, 'Hey, I'm trying to prove that I'm impossible to solve!' It's like a brain-twister that shows us why we can't always figure out the answer to the Halting Problem.","140":"You're right, P can be overwhelming at first, but it's actually a collection of interconnected ideas that help us understand the limits of computation. Think of it like a web of threads, each one representing a different proof or theorem that contributes to the bigger picture. As you explore each thread, you'll start to see how they weave together to form a cohesive understanding of the halting problem.","141":"I think I see where you're getting confused - the crux of the argument is that the Nasty Trickster is crafted as a deliberate counterexample to the Perfect Decider's supposed infallibility. The key insight is recognizing that the Perfect Decider's failure is not about being fed to the Nasty Trickster, but rather about the existence of a specific scenario (the Nasty Trickster) where the Perfect Decider would inevitably falter. By identifying this counterexample, we can confidently assert that a Perfect Decider is logically infeasible, as it would necessitate an ability to correctly classify all possible programs, including those that exploit its own limitations.","142":"The 'no true Scotsman' fallacy is a sneaky way of avoiding the fact that not everyone in a group fits a certain stereotype. It's like saying 'Oh, no true Scotsman would eat haggis for breakfast every day.' But then, you redefine what it means to be a Scotsman to exclude anyone who does eat haggis for breakfast. It's a clever trick for dodging the issue, but it's not a valid argument.","143":"The fact that you think it's worth sharing with others already implies that you value the interpersonal aspect, which is further emphasized by the fact that you're engaging in a debate about it, suggesting that you're not only looking for personal validation but also genuinely interested in hearing others' perspectives and potentially learning from them.","144":"Walmart can deny unions by exploiting a loophole in the National Labor Relations Act, which protects companies from interfering with employees who want to form a union. However, the law has a caveat that allows employers to discipline workers for engaging in union organizing activities on company property, which gives Walmart the opportunity to intimidate and deter employees from unionizing by threatening them with disciplinary action or even termination. This approach has been criticized for being overly broad and allowing companies like Walmart to silence their employees' voices and maintain control over the workplace.","145":"That's a good point about the scale of Walmart's workforce. In the US, a single store can't unionize independently, but it can be part of a larger bargaining unit that includes multiple stores or even the entire company. For instance, the United Food and Commercial Workers union has represented Walmart workers in various states, but it's not a straightforward process. The National Labor Relations Board would need to determine the appropriate bargaining unit, considering factors like job function, location, and industry.","146":"So, when a girl gets her first period, it's a sign that her body is maturing and getting ready for puberty. The period is a natural process where her uterus sheds its lining every month because it didn't get pregnant. This is a normal and healthy part of a woman's reproductive cycle.","147":"The thing is, when you're standing up, the urine has to travel through the urethra and then down to the outside of your body, and because of the way the urethra is positioned, it's more like a downward slope than a straight shot. So, even if you try to push your hips forward or use a urinal, the urine is still going to follow the natural flow of gravity, which is down your leg. It's not just a matter of using a urinal, though - it's a physiological thing that's hard to overcome with just a device or a technique.","148":"I think I might have misspoken - I was trying to say that it's not uncommon for the direction of the stream to change, but it's not related to the growth of pubic hair. Pubic hair grows after puberty, but the issue with the direction of the stream is more related to the physical anatomy of the penis itself.","149":"I'm glad you're thinking ahead and wanting to learn more about what to expect. Puberty can be a wild ride, but it's also a time of great change and growth. One thing that might help is to talk to a parent or trusted adult about your feelings and concerns. They've been through it too, and can offer some valuable advice and reassurance. Plus, there are plenty of resources available online and in books that can help you understand what's happening and how to navigate it. You're not alone, and it's okay to ask for help when you need it.","150":"One reason for this disparity is that the female reproductive system is significantly more intricate and requires a multitude of physiological changes to support fetal development. In contrast, the male reproductive system is relatively straightforward, primarily involving the production of sperm. This fundamental difference in complexity contributes to the varying levels of physical and emotional challenges experienced by girls and boys during puberty. Additionally, societal and cultural expectations often place greater emphasis on girls' physical changes, such as menstruation, which can lead to feelings of anxiety and self-consciousness. ","151":"Instagram uses a combination of algorithms and data collection to determine what ads to show you. When you talk about a restaurant or product in a private message, the app doesn't literally listen in, but it does collect data on your conversations and browsing history. This data is then analyzed using natural language processing and machine learning to identify patterns and connections between the words you use and the ads you might be interested in. This way, even if you don't explicitly search for something, the app can still show you ads for it. It's a bit like how Google suggests search results based on your search history and browsing habits. However, it's worth noting that Instagram's data collection practices have raised some concerns about user privacy, and some users may choose to limit their data sharing or use ad blockers to minimize their exposure to targeted ads.","152":"I see your point, and I think I may have misunderstood your question. You're asking how the algorithm is suggesting products without you explicitly mentioning them, right? That's a fascinating topic, and I'm curious to learn more about it too.","153":"When we read, our brain uses a complex process to assign meaning to words. This process starts with recognizing the individual letters and words, which are then combined to form a visual representation of the text. But what's really interesting is that this visual representation isn't just a static picture \u2013 it's a dynamic, mental movie that's influenced by our past experiences, emotions, and context. As we read, our brain is constantly updating this mental movie, making connections between words, and retrieving associated meanings from memory. It's a highly interactive and adaptive process that's unique to each reader, and it's what allows us to extract meaning from language in a way that's both personal and dynamic.","154":"Because flamboyance is often associated with being gay, and many straight men may feel pressure to conform to traditional masculine norms, which can make them hesitant to express themselves in ways that are perceived as overly flamboyant. However, it's worth noting that this doesn't mean all straight men are opposed to flamboyance, and there are many who proudly express themselves in a more vibrant and expressive way.","155":null,"156":"Planck time is a unit of time that's really small - it's about 1.6 \u00d7 10^-35 meters, which is the distance light travels in a very short time. It's named after Max Planck and is used in theories about how gravity and quantum stuff work together.","157":"I mean, photons are basically just tiny packets of energy, so they don't really have a size in the classical sense. But when we talk about their energy and momentum, we can kind of think of them as taking up a certain amount of space, even if it's really, really small. It's all pretty mind-bending, but basically, it's a way of understanding how these tiny particles interact with the universe.","158":"That's really interesting. I've always wondered if there's a connection between earworms and the types of music we listen to regularly. Do you think that's possible, or is it just a random occurrence?","159":"Actually, I was just making a point about the nature of scientific knowledge. I'm not claiming to be an expert in physics or cosmology. Can we get back on topic and discuss the implications of Sean Carroll's work on our understanding of the universe?","160":"You're dodging the point. We've made a lot of progress in understanding the world, but there are still plenty of things we don't know. And that's exactly why people turn to religion or other belief systems - because they're trying to make sense of the unknown.","161":"Well, in most mammals, like rabbits or deer, they can have babies right away when they grow up because they don't have the same level of cognitive abilities as humans. Their reproductive strategies are primarily driven by instinct and the need to quickly produce offspring to ensure the survival of their species. In contrast, humans have advanced cognitive abilities, including self-awareness, emotional intelligence, and decision-making capabilities, which enable us to make choices about who we want to mate with and when. This allows us to delay reproduction and invest time in finding a suitable partner, which is a key factor in human mate selection.","162":"I think I see what you're getting at now. You're saying that the comparison between a 23-year-old and a 13-year-old is not entirely fair, as the 23-year-old would have a better chance of survival due to their physical and emotional maturity. You're also pointing out that the hamster example doesn't necessarily apply to humans, as humans have a more complex social and cultural context that affects their ability to survive. And finally, you're suggesting that humans have developed better survival skills over time, but that these skills are not necessarily innate, but rather a result of cultural and social changes. Is that a fair summary of your points? And if so, how do you think we can reconcile the idea that humans are capable of raising children at a relatively young age, but may not have the same level of survival skills as other animals?","163":"I was hoping you'd say that, because it leads to a more nuanced discussion about the relationship between biology and other sciences, and how it relates to the topic of Chesapeake Bay, which you brought up earlier.","164":"I see what you mean, I was using 'biological' as a shorthand to refer to the physical and emotional maturity of a 13-year-old girl, but I can see how that's not a direct or clear connection to the term. To answer your question more specifically, I was thinking about whether a 13-year-old girl would have the necessary physical and emotional development to care for a child, particularly in terms of providing for their basic needs, such as food, shelter, and education, as well as meeting their emotional and psychological needs.","165":"I will. But I do think it's worth noting that the fact that you had to frame your question in a way that would elicit a non-biological response, and then got defensive when people tried to discuss the biological aspects of the question, suggests that you may not be as interested in exploring the nuances of the topic as you are in confirming your own preconceptions.","166":"Well, let me try to give you a real-world example. Imagine you're a carpenter and you want to put a new roof on a house. The roof is shaped like a rectangle, and you want to make sure it's the right size. If you know the length of the roof, you can find the area of the roof by squaring that number. But if you know the area of the roof, you can find the length by taking the square root of the area. So, squaring and square roots are like two sides of the same coin \u2013 they're used to solve problems that involve finding areas and lengths.","167":null,"168":"Okay, let me try to clarify the transformation from H(a,b) to H(x,x). When we substitute x for both a and b, we're essentially saying that we're considering a single input, x, and applying the function H to it twice. The notation 'x(x)' is a way of indicating that the input is being processed by the same function twice, but it's not meant to imply that the function is looking at the literal string 'x(x)'. Instead, it's a shorthand for saying that we're applying the function H to the input x, and then applying it again to the result. This is different from H(a,b), where we're applying the function to two separate inputs. In terms of how H(x,x) works, it's actually a bit more complex than I initially explained, and it relies on some subtle properties of the function H. I'd be happy to elaborate on that if you're interested.","169":"I think what you mean is that the halting problem is a challenge in computer science that shows us that there's no general algorithm that can determine, given an arbitrary program and input, whether that program will run forever or eventually stop. Is that correct?","170":"I can try to explain the rest of the argument in more detail, but first, let's make sure we're on the same page regarding the halting problem. Can you tell me what you think the halting problem is, and why it's considered so important in the context of computability theory? This will help me tailor my explanation to your background and interests.","171":"That's a clever attempt to sidestep the paradox, but it's actually a case of trying to apply a solution to a different problem. The Sorites paradox is indeed a fascinating philosophical conundrum, but it doesn't directly address the issue at hand, which is the countability of the real numbers. Cantor's diagonal argument is a powerful tool that shows that any attempt to create a list of real numbers will always be incomplete, and that's what makes the set of real numbers uncountable. It's not about finding a better way to generate the list, but rather about the fundamental nature of real numbers, which is that they are inherently uncountable.","172":"That's an interesting point about bananas! But let's not stop eating them just yet. The radioactivity in bananas is a natural process that happens when they're growing. It's like how our bodies absorb small amounts of background radiation from the environment every day. So, eating a banana is not going to make us sick, but it's a great example of how radiation is all around us.","173":"One reason wood remains a popular choice is its relatively low cost and wide availability, making it an attractive option for builders. However, its susceptibility to damage from strong winds and tornadoes is a significant concern. When subjected to high wind speeds, wood can experience a phenomenon known as 'wind shear,' which causes the material to splinter and weaken. This can compromise the structural integrity of the house, making it more vulnerable to collapse. To mitigate this risk, builders often incorporate reinforcement measures, such as reinforced wood framing and anchoring systems, which can help to distribute the forces of high winds more evenly and prevent catastrophic failure. Despite these precautions, wood's inherent weaknesses make it a less-than-ideal choice for areas prone to extreme weather events.","174":"That's a good point, but let's also consider the long-term benefits of stone houses, such as their durability and resistance to pests and rot, which could potentially offset the higher upfront cost and maintenance requirements.","175":"I'd rather not speculate on the details of Weinstein's conviction, but I can tell you that the court's decision was likely based on a combination of factors, including evidence presented during the trial.","176":"That's an interesting point! But what if the company does grow in value, and then suddenly faces a major crisis or disruption in its industry? Wouldn't that wipe out all the gains from the long-term investment?","177":"The company's goal is to maximize shareholder value, but that doesn't necessarily mean giving shareholders more stocks. The board of directors considers various factors, including the company's financial performance and growth prospects, when deciding on dividend payments. It's not just about reinvesting dividends, but also about balancing short-term and long-term goals.","178":"To illustrate the difference, consider this: when you buy a stock, you're essentially betting on the company's future performance. You're not buying a tangible product, but rather a piece of paper that represents ownership. This is in contrast to MLMs, where you're buying a product that has inherent value, regardless of the company's performance.","179":null,"180":"I see what you mean. While upvotes can be motivating, I've come to realize that the true value of sharing my thoughts lies in the potential connections and discussions it sparks, rather than the numerical validation. It's interesting to note that our differing views on upvotes might be a reflection of our varying perspectives on what constitutes success in online communities.","181":"The thing is, the Earth's water supply is like a big pool that's always full, but the water can move around in that pool. Think of it like a big bucket in a pool. If you use some of the water from that bucket, you haven't added more water to the pool, so the total amount is still the same. But if you spill some of that water, it's gone, and it's hard to get it back. We can use the water in the ocean, lakes, and rivers, but if we waste it, we're essentially spilling water from that bucket. It's not like we're running out of water, but we are wasting a valuable resource that's hard to replace.","182":"That's a great challenge, I'd love to see you tackle it. Can you tell me more about what kind of purification methods you're considering?","183":"It's kind of like when you're trying to remember a catchy jingle from a commercial, and it just keeps popping back into your head. Our brains are wired to remember things that are catchy and easy to recall, so sometimes that can be a good thing, but other times it can be a bit annoying!","184":"So what's the worst song that's ever gotten stuck in your head? I'm talking earworms that just won't quit! ","185":"Actually, CO2 can accumulate at ground level in confined spaces, but it's not the only factor at play. Ventilation, air exchange, and our own ability to detect CO2 before it becomes hazardous all contribute to the risk. It's a complex situation that requires careful consideration when assessing confined spaces.","186":"In analog circuits, the signal is not binary, it's a continuous range of values, so it can't max out the gate like a digital signal can. Additionally, in analog circuits, the gate is typically not designed to be driven to its maximum capacity, as this can lead to non-linear behavior and distortion, whereas in digital circuits, the gate is specifically designed to be driven to its maximum capacity, which is 1 or 0, to ensure reliable switching and minimize errors.","187":"Analog signals can vary in amplitude, think of it like the volume of a song - it can be soft or loud, but a digital signal is just a binary choice, like a light switch that's either on or off.","188":"The water cycle is a continuous process that circulates water between the oceans, atmosphere, and land. While the total amount of water on Earth remains relatively constant, the way it's distributed and used changes constantly. This means that we can't 'waste' water in the sense that it disappears forever, but we can mismanage or inefficiently use water resources, which can have negative consequences for the environment and human societies.","189":"Just because it doesn't affect you directly doesn't mean it's not a global issue. Think about the ripple effects on marine life and the entire food chain if we were to disrupt the natural balance of the ocean's ecosystems.","190":"I think there might be a misunderstanding - I'm trying to understand why you feel that way. Can you help me see what you mean by 'the obvious'?","191":"I'm saying that, even if it doesn't belong here, the mods should've left it up since it was a legit question.","192":"I can understand why you're frustrated, and I'm truly sorry to hear that another innocent person might be involved. Can you tell me more about what you've heard or seen that suggests this? I'm here to listen and help in any way I can, and I want to ensure that we're doing everything we can to get to the truth.","193":"The plastic wrap works by trapping a thin layer of air between the window and the wrap, which is a good insulator because air doesn't conduct heat very well. It's a simple but effective trick that keeps the cold air out and the warm air in.","194":"Actually, the plastic film would actually let visible light through, but block the infrared radiation, which is associated with heat. So, in the summer, it would actually trap heat, not block it.","195":"I see what you mean now - it makes total sense. I was thinking about how greenhouses work in a different context, but I can see how the same principle applies here. It's actually really interesting to think about the physics behind it.","196":"So, let's go back in time. When the Roman Empire fell, it was like a big power vacuum. The Catholic Church was one of the few things that was still standing. Over time, it became super powerful in Europe and started spreading its influence. Eventually, Christianity became the main religion in Europe and then it spread to other parts of the world when people traveled and settled new places.","197":"That's a great question. One of the most significant factors was the role of the early Christian communities in the eastern provinces, where Christianity was initially met with less resistance. The martyrdom of early Christian leaders like St. Polycarp and the writings of St. Ignatius of Antioch, which emphasized the importance of unity and obedience to the bishop, likely played a crucial role in shaping the early Christian mindset. Additionally, the Edict of Milan, issued by Constantine in 313 CE, granted Christians freedom to practice their faith openly, which marked a significant turning point. But what do you think was the most compelling aspect of Christianity that drew people in during this period?","198":"I guess I just felt a bit embarrassed about asking such a basic question, but I appreciate your understanding.","199":"I'm not joking around, the environmental impacts of desalination are serious. Think about it: the energy needed to remove salt from seawater is staggering, and that energy comes from burning fossil fuels, which spews out greenhouse gases. The consequences for marine life are dire - the intake of seawater can kill fish and other animals, and the concentrated brine discharge can alter the delicate chemistry of the ocean. And let's not forget the risk of invasive species being introduced into the ecosystem, which can have devastating effects on native wildlife. This is a complex issue that requires careful consideration, not to be taken lightly.","200":"I'm trying to understand why you're getting defensive when someone tries to offer a different perspective. Can you help me understand where you're coming from?","201":"I see what you're getting at. By cutting off the supply of new guns and ammo, you're hoping to eventually reduce the number of guns out there. But you're right, it's a long shot, and it would require a concerted effort from governments and manufacturers. Even then, it's impossible to say for sure whether it would work. It's a complex issue, and there are no easy solutions.","202":"Let's break it down. Animal agriculture requires a lot of water \u2013 it's estimated that a single pound of beef needs around 1,000 gallons of water to produce. If everyone adopted a vegan lifestyle, we could potentially save a significant amount of water, which would help alleviate droughts and water scarcity issues. Furthermore, animal agriculture is a significant contributor to greenhouse gas emissions, which are a major driver of climate change. By opting for plant-based diets, we can reduce our carbon footprint and help mitigate the effects of global warming. This isn't just about personal choice, though \u2013 it's also about the broader impact of our food systems on the environment.","203":"But that's exactly the problem - you're not just trusting that someone else will do it, you're assuming that they will, without any evidence that they actually will, and that's a gap in your plan, rather than a plan itself.","204":"I understand that you're trying to simplify a complex issue, but let's take a step back and break it down. The methane release from thawing permafrost is a natural process that's been happening for centuries, but human activities, such as agriculture and land use changes, are accelerating this process. It's not just a matter of 'capturing' the methane, but rather understanding the underlying causes and finding sustainable solutions. Your points about overcompensation, animal welfare, and land efficiency are valid concerns, but they're not directly related to the issue at hand. Let's focus on finding ways to mitigate the impact of thawing permafrost on the climate, rather than getting bogged down in misinformation and personal attacks.","205":"I think you're misunderstanding my point, I'm not saying the device is the problem, but rather that your approach to catching pok\u00e9mon is overly reliant on gadgets and not enough on actual skill and strategy.","206":null,"207":"I can see why you'd feel that way, and I think we're getting off track from the original point about microtransactions. Can we go back to discussing that and why you feel they're functionally meaningless?","208":"I think it's great that we can express ourselves freely, but I'm curious - what kind of workplaces might have issues with afros?","209":"I understand that you're trying to be humorous, but I'd appreciate it if we could focus on the explanation I provided. Can you help me understand your perspective on the topic, or would you like me to clarify something?","210":"Full metal jacket ammo is used for target practice and hunting because it has a harder outer casing, which allows it to retain its velocity and maintain a flatter trajectory over longer distances. This makes it ideal for precision shooting. However, its increased penetration power also means it can cause more damage to internal organs, making it less suitable for self-defense. Additionally, the jacketing process can make the bullet more prone to ricochets, which can be a concern in certain environments.","211":"But it's worth noting that the M855 is actually less likely to cause collateral damage than the M193, which is why it's preferred for military use.","212":"That's a good point about armor, but in terms of internal damage, FMJ rounds can be more unpredictable and may cause more collateral damage, which could be a concern in certain situations.","213":null,"214":"It's actually a nod to their unreactive nature. Think of it like a social hierarchy, where these elements are the 'ladies and gentlemen' of the periodic table \u2013 they're not interested in getting involved with the common folk, and they just keep to themselves. This was a clever way for chemists to describe their properties back in the day.","215":"Eventually, the universe will exhaust its hydrogen and helium reserves, as they're consumed in the formation of heavier elements, marking a significant shift in the cosmic composition.","216":"While it's theoretically possible to create new elements artificially through nuclear reactions in particle accelerators, making them naturally is extremely unlikely due to the extremely rare conditions required. As for the number of new elements that can be created artificially, it's difficult to predict with certainty, but it's likely to be relatively small, probably in the range of 1-5, considering our current technological capabilities and the challenges involved in synthesizing heavier elements. The process of creating new elements is a complex and ongoing area of research, and any predictions about the number of new elements that can be made will depend on future breakthroughs and advancements in technology.","217":"That's an interesting point about removing private insurance middlemen, but I'm not sure it's that simple. Even if we eliminate the middlemen, wouldn't the government still need to account for the costs of administering a single-payer system, such as claims processing and provider reimbursement? And wouldn't those costs be at least partially offset by the reduced administrative costs of private insurance?","218":"Well, imagine a big jar of cookies represents the limited resources in our society. If one person gets 9 cookies, or in this case, a disproportionate amount of wealth and power, it can lead to a situation where they have more opportunities and privileges than others, making it harder for those with fewer resources to access the same opportunities. It's not just about having cookies to eat, but about having the means to access healthcare, education, and other essential services that are crucial for a person's well-being and success.","219":"The term 'Noble Gases' actually stems from their unreactive nature, which was a departure from the norm in the late 19th century when they were discovered. Think of it as a nod to their uniqueness, rather than any direct reference to human nobility. The chemists who coined the term were more interested in highlighting their inertness, which set them apart from other elements that readily form compounds. It's a bit like how a rare or exotic species is often considered 'noble' in the natural world, due to its scarcity and distinct characteristics.","220":null,"221":"But what's more interesting is that the flowchart you're looking at is actually showing the decay chain of radon, not the noble elements. The radon decays into polonium, which then decays into lead, but lead is stable, so it doesn't decay further.","222":"Honestly, I was just trying to be cautious and not get ahead of myself. I don't have any concrete evidence, but the decay rate of the elements on the 7th row is quite alarming, and I'd hate to speculate about the 9th row without more data.","223":"I'm not sure I follow what you mean by 'downshifting'. Can you tell me more about it?","224":"I understand your point, but my instructor also mentioned that skipping gears can have some drawbacks, and I'm not sure what to believe. Can you help me understand the context or clarify what you mean by engine braking?","225":"If you want to save on fuel and keep your engine in good shape, don't skip gears. But if you're not bothered, it's not a big deal.","226":"But, the thing is, science can only tell us what's feasible and safe, and even then, it's often a matter of interpretation. What's considered 'optimal' can vary greatly depending on the values and priorities of different stakeholders, and politics often comes in to mediate those differences and make decisions based on what's acceptable to the most people, rather than just what's scientifically supported.","227":"Well, some companies might not be profitable enough to pay dividends, or they might be choosing to reinvest their profits to fuel future growth. That makes non-dividend shares an attractive option for investors who think the company has what it takes to soar in the long run.","228":"The value of a share lies in the company's potential for growth and the expectation that it will continue to expand its operations, increase its revenue, and enhance its value over time. As the company grows, the value of the share is likely to appreciate, making it a more valuable asset for the long-term investor. In other words, the value of a share is not just about what you can get from it today, but about what it can potentially yield in the future.","229":"But think of it like this: the value of your shares isn't just about the cash you'll get if you sell them, it's also about the potential future profits the company can make, which can increase the value of your shares over time.","230":"Well, let me break it down for you. An MLM works by creating a hierarchical structure of distributors, where each level earns a commission on the sales made by those below them. This is different from an IPO, where a company issues stocks to the public for the first time, and the value of the stocks is determined by market forces. In contrast, an MLM's value is often artificially inflated by the company's sales tactics, which can lead to a false sense of security for its distributors. As for a Ponzi scheme, it relies on continuous recruitment of new investors to pay returns to earlier investors, rather than generating revenue through legitimate investments or business activities. In the case of an MLM, the company's sustainability is not guaranteed, and its success is often dependent on the ability to recruit new members. If the company's sales slow down or the market becomes saturated, the value of the investment can plummet, leaving distributors with significant losses. ","231":"However, even with a monopoly, there's still an underlying value to the product or service being sold, which is the value of the company itself. In the case of MLMs, the value of the company is not the product being sold, but rather the value of the distributorships and the compensation plan. This is a key difference between a monopoly and an MLM.","232":"You're oversimplifying the situation, as the uncertainty of grocer buyouts and the risk of apples rotting are intertwined. The intrinsic value of apples doesn't negate the need for market research or a solid sales strategy, but rather underscores the importance of managing these risks in a way that balances financial and logistical considerations.","233":"A computer learns its first steps through a process called bootstrapping, which is essentially a self-sustaining cycle of loading the operating system from a storage device and then using that operating system to load the rest of the system, creating a kind of feedback loop that enables the computer to become increasingly self-sufficient.","234":"Analog signals are continuous, meaning they can take on any value within a range, but it's more like a smooth line that can have many different levels of brightness or volume, not just 0 or 1. It's like the difference between a smooth line and a series of disconnected dots, but the line can have many different points of brightness or volume, like a volume knob that can be turned up or down.","235":"Non-dividend shares can be a good option if you believe the company will grow and increase its stock price over time. You'll have the potential to make a profit when you sell the shares at a higher price than you bought them for, without having to worry about dividend payments eating into your returns.","236":"Think of it like this: if you owned a house and it went up in value, you could sell it for more than you paid for it, even if you weren't getting any rent. Your share of the company is like that house - its value has gone up, even if you're not getting any dividends.","237":"I think what you're getting at is that non-dividend shares can be a bit of a binary situation - either you're in a position to influence the company's decisions or you're not, and if you're not, it's hard to see the point of owning them, especially if you're not looking for a high-risk, high-reward gamble.","238":"Imagine a universe where everything is perfectly static, with no change or movement. If there's no change, there's no time. Time is often defined as the measure of change, so if nothing changes, the concept of time becomes meaningless.","239":"Planck time is a unit of time defined as the time it takes for light to travel a distance of one Planck length, which is approximately 1.62 x 10^-35 meters. It's a fundamental unit of time in the theory of quantum gravity, representing the smallest time interval at which the laws of physics remain valid.","240":"That's a great point, and it's a common misconception that photons are just tiny points. In reality, photons are massless particles that have both wave-like and particle-like properties, and their energy and momentum are described by quantum field theory. The gravitational field of a black hole can indeed affect the path of photons, causing them to bend and change direction, which is why we can observe the effects of gravitational lensing around black holes. However, the energy and momentum of photons are not directly affected by the size of the black hole itself, but rather by the strength of its gravitational field, which depends on its mass and spin.","241":"A period is when your body prepares for a potential pregnancy by thickening the lining of your uterus. If pregnancy doesn't happen, the body sheds this lining, leading to bleeding. It's a natural process that happens every month in people with uteruses. During this time, you might need to use sanitary products to manage the bleeding, and some people might experience cramps or mood changes. It's a good idea to talk to a grown-up about how to take care of yourself during your period.","242":null,"243":"That's not what I meant at all - I'm saying that by pointing out Android's vulnerabilities, you're essentially engaging in whataboutism, a rhetorical tactic that dismisses a legitimate concern by shifting the focus to another issue, rather than addressing the original problem.","244":"That's correct, so increasing FICA taxes wouldn't necessarily save employers money on private health coverage since those costs are already factored into the FICA taxes.","245":"Actually, the UK's National Health Service is a great example, but it's also worth noting that a significant portion of those high administrative costs are due to the way the system is structured, with multiple layers of management and a complex system of primary care trusts, which can be inefficient. In contrast, countries like Sweden and Norway have implemented more decentralized and streamlined systems, which have resulted in lower administrative costs. Additionally, some studies have suggested that the cost savings from eliminating private insurance middlemen could be substantial, potentially even offsetting the increased costs associated with a government-run system. It's a complex issue, and there's no easy answer, but it's definitely worth exploring the potential benefits of a single-payer system.","246":"If you buy a non-dividend share, you're essentially buying a stake in the company, with the expectation that it will grow and increase in value over time. It's similar to buying a piece of real estate, where the hope is that the property will appreciate in value as the area develops and the economy grows.","247":"That's a good point about competition, but I'd argue that MLMs often create a false sense of scarcity or exclusivity, which can drive up the perceived value of the product. Additionally, the fact that MLMs often require participants to purchase large quantities of inventory upfront can create a situation where the value of the product is not necessarily tied to its intrinsic value, but rather to the participant's ability to sell it at a markup. Furthermore, the lack of transparency and the emphasis on recruiting new participants can also contribute to the perceived value of the product, as people are often more focused on making a profit from recruiting than from actually selling the product. This can create a situation where the value of the product is more tied to the participant's ability to build a network of sellers rather than the product's actual worth.","248":"You're essentially buying into a business model that's trying to sell you a product or service, rather than owning a tangible asset. It's a bit like investing in a restaurant, where you're hoping the chef's culinary skills will attract customers, but you're not actually cooking the meals yourself.","249":"You're making a valid point about the flexibility of having apples, but the comparison to MLMs isn't entirely apt. The value of an apple lies not only in its monetary worth but also in its edible quality. In contrast, an overpriced MLM product, even if it doesn't sell, retains some residual value as a commodity that can be resold or repurposed, unlike a consumable item like an apple.","250":"Alcoholism is like having a bad habit that's hard to break, but it's also a disease because it affects the brain and the body in a way that's similar to other diseases. When someone drinks too much, it changes their brain chemistry and can make them feel like they need to keep drinking to feel okay. It's not just about being weak or making bad choices, it's a physical thing that can be hard to control. It's like when you're trying to quit smoking, it's not just about being strong, it's about your body being used to the nicotine and needing it to feel normal.","251":"I think the reason for the debate lies in the complexity of the concept of disease. On one hand, the physical changes in the brain and the withdrawal symptoms when stopping alcohol consumption do suggest a medical component. On the other hand, the social and cultural factors that contribute to alcoholism, as well as the personal choices involved, make it a multifaceted issue that defies simple categorization. Perhaps we could say that alcoholism is a disease with a strong addictive component, rather than a straightforward case of addiction or disease?","252":"Smoking is a behavior, not a disease. While it can lead to serious health issues, like COPD and lung cancer, it's the choice to smoke that's the issue, not the act of smoking itself. Quitting is definitely possible, and many people have done it successfully. A disease, on the other hand, is a medical condition that's often beyond the person's control, like a genetic disorder or a neurological condition. So, while smoking can have serious consequences, it's not classified as a disease in the medical community.","253":"The Nazi Party's far-right classification stems from its radical nationalist and authoritarian ideology, which prioritizes the dominance of the 'Aryan' race and seeks to impose a rigid, hierarchical social order through a strong, centralized state. This ideology rejects key liberal democratic principles, such as individual rights and freedoms, and is characterized by anti-communist and anti-Semitic rhetoric, as well as the use of propaganda and violence to suppress opposition. While the Nazi Party's economic policies may have had some socialist elements, its overall ideology and actions are more closely aligned with the far-right than the left, particularly given its emphasis on racial supremacy and its rejection of democratic values.","254":"You're misinterpreting my response as defensive, when in fact I'm frustrated with the dismissive tone you've adopted towards someone who's genuinely seeking clarification on a complex topic. I'd appreciate it if you could engage with the substance of their question rather than attacking their character or intentions.","255":"It's because traditional masculine norms have often emphasized qualities like stoicism, bravery, and self-control, which can make it tough for men who are more expressive or flamboyant to fit in. Society has historically encouraged men to be tough, rugged, and unemotional, which can make it hard for flamboyant men to find acceptance and support. This can lead to a lack of role models and a sense of isolation for men who don't conform to these expectations.","256":"Narcoanalysis tests are not universally adopted in the legal system due to concerns about their reliability and the potential for coerced confessions. In many jurisdictions, the results of Narcoanalysis tests are not considered admissible as evidence in court, as they can be influenced by various factors, such as the individual's physical and mental state, the skill level of the practitioner, and the type of substances used. Furthermore, the invasive nature of Narcoanalysis tests raises ethical concerns, particularly in cases where the individual may be subjected to unnecessary risks or discomfort. As a result, their use is often limited to specific circumstances, such as in cases where other investigative methods have been exhausted or when the individual's safety is at risk.","257":"Yes, I see what you mean now. By framing fundraising events as a way to preserve and nurture the emotional connections and culture that develop within a school community, you're highlighting a more nuanced aspect of the issue. This perspective suggests that the emotional investments people make in their school relationships are not just personal, but also contribute to the broader cultural fabric of the school, which can be sustained and even enhanced through fundraising efforts. This interpretation adds depth to the discussion, as it acknowledges the intricate relationships between personal connections, community identity, and the financial resources that support them.","258":"The notion that the value of money is tied to the central bank's ability to print it is an outdated concept, stemming from the gold standard era. With the shift to fiat currency, the value of money is now determined by supply and demand in the market, and the central bank's role is more focused on managing the money supply to achieve economic stability rather than directly influencing the value of money through printing.","259":"Imagine DNA as a set of architectural plans, with genes being the specific blueprints for each component of the plant. The genetic code is made up of four chemical 'letters' \u2013 A, C, G, and T \u2013 which are arranged in a specific sequence to provide the instructions for building each part of the plant. When a cell grows or divides, it reads these instructions and uses them to construct the proteins and other molecules it needs to function. Think of it like a factory assembly line, where the genetic code serves as the production manual, guiding the cell's molecular machinery to build the necessary components. The cell's machinery interprets the genetic code through a series of chemical reactions, ultimately resulting in the creation of proteins and other molecules that allow the plant to grow and develop. This process is crucial for the plant's development, as it enables the creation of the specific structures and functions necessary for survival and reproduction.","260":"I see what you mean about the experts using the language of code and information. But can we explore why they might use this language? Is it possible that they're trying to convey the idea that DNA contains a kind of blueprint or template for life, even if it's not a literal code?","261":"The debate itself is not about winning an argument, but about engaging in a collaborative exploration of ideas, where both parties share their perspectives and insights to gain a deeper understanding of the topic.","262":"The prospect of eventual dividends is a good point, but it's essential to consider the company's financial health and its ability to pay dividends consistently. Even if a company has a good track record of paying dividends, there's always a risk that it might struggle to maintain that in the future. Additionally, the value of the stock is not solely determined by the prospect of dividends, but also by the company's growth potential, its competitive advantage, and its ability to adapt to changing market conditions. It's crucial to have a well-rounded understanding of the company's fundamentals before making an investment decision.","263":"The inherent value of a stock, even if it doesn't return dividends, comes from its potential to contribute to the company's growth, its position in the market, or its ability to adapt to changing market conditions, which can drive its value up over time.","264":"That's a great point, and it's a common misconception. When you buy stock, you're essentially buying a claim on a portion of the company's assets and profits. The dividends you receive are a result of the company's overall profitability, not a direct cut of the profits from the specific assets you own. Think of it like owning a small piece of a large pizza - you don't get a slice of the pizza itself, but you get a share of the overall pie when it's cut and distributed. And just like how the value of the pizza can increase when the whole pie is worth more, the value of your stock can increase when the company does well.","265":"That's a really interesting question! I think it's worth exploring why afros were often seen as unprofessional in corporate workplaces. One possible reason is that they were associated with the Black Power movement, which challenged societal norms and expectations. However, I'm not sure if that's the whole story. Can we dig deeper into this and explore other factors that might have contributed to this perception? Perhaps we can also talk about how systemic racism and cultural bias have impacted the way we think about afros and professionalism?","266":"It's not about the afro, it's about how you present yourself and interact with others during the interview. If you come across as friendly, open-minded, and team-oriented, that's what's going to make a good impression, regardless of your hairstyle.","267":null,"268":"That's a great point, and it's actually where the concept of entropy comes in - the tendency of systems to become less complex and disordered over time. However, living systems are able to locally decrease their entropy by increasing the entropy of their surroundings, which is why we see complex systems like life emerging and evolving. But let's dig deeper - the reason viruses have the tendency to self-replicate is because they've found a way to hijack the machinery of the host cell, essentially using the host's own cellular processes to replicate themselves. This is a great example of how life can exploit its environment to sustain itself, and it's a key factor in the evolution of complexity in living systems. It's not necessarily that life is defying the second law of thermodynamics, but rather that it's finding ways to use the laws of thermodynamics to its advantage.","269":"The process of chemical evolution is a bit more nuanced than a simple assembly of building blocks. It involves the gradual accumulation of chemical modifications and interactions that allow for the emergence of more complex structures. For example, the formation of nucleotides, which are the building blocks of RNA and DNA, requires a series of chemical reactions that involve the interaction of various elements and energy sources. These reactions are influenced by factors such as pH, temperature, and the presence of catalysts, which can either speed up or slow down the reaction. The resulting nucleotides can then be assembled into more complex structures, such as RNA and DNA, which can store and transmit genetic information. The specific coding and replication of viruses, on the other hand, rely on the host cell's machinery, which is capable of reading and writing genetic information with high fidelity. This is why viruses can hijack the host cell's replication machinery to produce more viral particles, even though they don't have their own understanding of replication.","270":"A tachometer is a crucial tool that gauges the engine's rotational speed in revolutions per minute, which is vital for efficient gear shifting and preventing engine wear and tear.","271":"I can understand why you're unsure, given the mixed advice you've received. The key point is that skipping gears can be safe and efficient, but it depends on the specific driving situation and the driver's skill level. The random person on the internet might be expressing a general rule, but it's not necessarily applicable to every driver or every driving scenario. Let's discuss the specifics of your driving and the conditions you're referring to, so we can have a more informed conversation about what's best for you.","272":"I think the mods might have had some concerns about the question, but that's just speculation on my part.","273":"I'd be happy to take another approach and try to break it down in a way that's clearer and more helpful for you.","274":"I understand your frustration, but I'd like to clarify that my previous response wasn't meant to dismiss your concerns. I'm here to help, and I'm willing to work with you to find a solution that fits your needs and budget. Can we discuss possible alternatives, such as a more affordable package or a payment plan, that might make my services more accessible to you?","275":"So let's say you're running a lemonade stand and you make $100, but you spend $90 on cups, sugar, and your time - that's your operating costs. If you pay yourself $80 out of the $90, you've still got $10 left over, which is your profit. But if you pay yourself the whole $90, you're essentially eating into your profit, so you'd be left with nothing.","276":"You're confusing the order of operations in accounting. Profit is calculated after expenses have been deducted, not the other way around. Think of it like a recipe: you start with total revenue, subtract all your expenses, and what's left is your profit. Paying yourself is just another expense, like rent or supplies.","277":"The ARM architecture's ability to dynamically adjust its clock speed and voltage levels is a key factor in reducing heat generation. However, a more significant contributor to the cooling efficiency difference is the ARM processor's inherent power consumption characteristics, which are optimized for low-power operation. In contrast, desktop processors like the Intel i3-5005u are designed to handle more demanding workloads and have a higher power draw, which generates more heat. Furthermore, the ARM processor's design allows for more efficient use of transistors, which also contributes to lower heat production. This is particularly relevant in mobile devices, where power consumption and heat generation are major concerns, and designers prioritize power efficiency over raw processing power.","278":"In many cultures, discussing your personal finances or wages is considered private. This is because people tend to view their income as a personal aspect of their lives, and sharing it with colleagues can be seen as crossing a boundary. It's similar to asking someone about their personal life, like their relationships or family plans, which is generally not considered appropriate in a professional setting.","279":"I think you're onto something there. The system does seem to be rigged against workers, but it's not just the economy - it's also the culture and the power dynamics at play. Companies often use tactics like intimidation and manipulation to prevent workers from organizing, and even when they do succeed in forming unions, they often face pushback from management and the government. It's a complex web of issues, but I think it's worth exploring further.","280":"Sexual urges are complex and influenced by a combination of biological, psychological, and social factors. After genitalia amputation, individuals may still experience sexual urges, although the nature and intensity of these urges can vary greatly from person to person. Some people may experience a decrease in sexual urges due to the physical and emotional trauma associated with the amputation, while others might not. This can depend on various factors, including their mental health, support system, and coping mechanisms. It's also worth noting that some individuals may choose to explore alternative forms of sexual expression or seek professional help to manage their sexual urges.","281":null,"282":"I'd love to hear more about it! Can you tell me more about what you know about castration in your culture, and what kind of context or time period are we talking about?","283":"Yeah, that's a lot easier. We can just weigh them to make sure they're real.","284":"I'm actually a chemist by training, but I've been working in a different field for a while now. I've been reading about the latest developments in materials science, and I'm fascinated by the potential applications of nanotechnology.","285":"I'm not saying that intelligent people won't find a way, but the fact that so many experts have already weighed in on this idea suggests that it's not just a matter of waiting for someone to figure it out.","286":null,"287":"The term 'National Socialist' might seem contradictory, but it's a reflection of the Nazis' complex ideology. They drew on elements of socialism to appeal to the working class, but their primary goal was to create a powerful, centralized state that prioritized German nationalism and interests, which is a hallmark of far-right ideologies.","288":"I think the Nazi Party's ideology and actions are a prime example of far-right extremism, with a toxic mix of nationalism, racism, and authoritarianism that's characteristic of the far-right. What's interesting is how their ideology has been influential in shaping modern far-right movements, despite being widely condemned by historians and scholars.","289":"That's a common misconception, but I see where you're coming from. The left-right axis can be tricky to pin down, especially when it comes to historical ideologies like Nazism. While the Nazis did implement some socialist policies, such as public ownership of key industries, their ideology was more complex and multifaceted. They combined elements of socialism, nationalism, and authoritarianism, which doesn't fit neatly into the left-right spectrum. What do you think is the most striking aspect of the Nazis' ideology that makes it difficult to categorize in this way?","290":"To be honest, I'm not aware of any scientific evidence that supports the idea that a specific frequency, including 18.9Hz, is associated with the brainwave patterns of deceased individuals or spirit communication. While I've heard of the Ghost Frequency being mentioned in the context of EVP recordings, I think it's essential to approach this topic with a critical and nuanced perspective, recognizing that the scientific community has not established a clear link between this frequency and paranormal activity. Can we explore this topic further and look into the research and theories surrounding EVP recordings and their potential connections to the concept of the Ghost Frequency?","291":"The frequency can cause a range of physical responses, including a slight increase in blood pressure and heart rate, as well as elevated cortisol levels, which can contribute to feelings of anxiety or unease. Some people may also experience a sense of disorientation or dizziness, while others might report a metallic taste or a sensation of being 'on edge.' These effects are generally mild and temporary, but they can be unsettling, especially if you're not aware of what's causing them. It's worth noting that individual responses to the frequency can vary significantly, and some people may be more sensitive to its effects than others.","292":"I think the real issue is that a containment facility on land would be a huge expense, and if there's a leakage, it would be a major environmental disaster with significant economic costs for cleanup and compensation. In contrast, disposing of waste in the ocean might seem like a cheaper option, but it raises concerns about the long-term risks to marine ecosystems and the difficulty of monitoring and mitigating any potential leaks.","293":"That's right, a good location is crucial to mitigate seismic risks. But the main reason it's a contentious issue is that the federal government has been dragging its feet on taking responsibility for spent fuel disposal, leaving the utilities in a tough spot. They're now seeking on-site storage as a temporary solution, which has sparked a lot of debate and opposition.","294":"The 'no true Scotsman' fallacy is actually a clever way for people to avoid admitting that their argument is flawed. It's like saying 'no true environmentalist would support this policy' when someone points out that many environmentalists do support it. This fallacy is a great example of how people can manipulate language to make their point seem more convincing, even if it's not based on reality. It's a subtle but powerful way to shift the conversation away from the actual issue and towards a subjective definition of what it means to be a 'true' something.","295":"You're trying to persuade others, but the question is, do you truly know them well enough to assume they'd benefit from your ideas?","296":"I understand you think it was due to the mods not liking the question, but let's take a look at the actual reason. The post was removed because it didn't align with our community guidelines, specifically the section on promoting personal opinions as facts. I'd be happy to help you understand the specific guideline and how to avoid similar issues in the future.","297":"I'm not trying to be dismissive, but the explanations that have been provided so far haven't been satisfactory. Can we start again from the beginning and break down the removal process in a way that's easy to follow and understand?","298":"I understand that you're a busy expert, but as someone who's been in a similar situation, I'd appreciate it if you could offer some guidance or point me to some resources that might be helpful. Can you tell me more about the specific issues with my case that you're seeing, and why you think I should pay for tutoring to learn about them?","299":"An anti-matter universe is a mind-bending concept that has garnered significant attention in the realm of theoretical physics. In essence, it proposes the existence of a universe composed of antimatter, which is characterized by the presence of antiparticles that have the same mass as regular particles but opposite charges. This idea raises intriguing questions about the fundamental nature of the universe and its underlying symmetries. Regarding anti-gravity, it's essential to note that it's not a synonym for gravity, but rather a hypothetical force that could potentially counteract or repel mass. While the concept of anti-gravity is often associated with science fiction, it's rooted in theoretical frameworks that attempt to explain phenomena such as gravitational waves and the behavior of dark matter. In the context of antimatter universes, anti-gravity might play a crucial role in shaping the cosmos, but it's still a topic of active research and debate in the scientific community.","300":"I see what you're saying about the cube and the square, but I'm not sure I understand how that relates to the tesseract. You're saying that the cube is to the square like the tesseract is to the cube? But that doesn't seem right. The cube is a 3D object, and the square is a 2D object, so if we're trying to make a 4D object, shouldn't it be more like... I don't know... a 3D object in a 3D space, or something? I'm not sure I get the analogy.","301":"The Tesseract is a complex mathematical concept that's hard to wrap your head around, but in a 3D representation, it's often depicted as a cube within a cube. This inner cube can move in and out of the outer cube, creating a mesmerizing effect. The model I'm referring to is a visual aid that helps to illustrate this concept, but it's not a direct representation of a 4D shape, which is why it might seem simplified compared to what you're used to.","302":"They use AI to analyze the conversations you have with your friends and family, as well as the posts you like and comment on, to figure out what you're interested in. It's like they're trying to have a conversation with you, but instead of asking questions, they're just listening in on what you're saying to your friends. Does that sound right to you?","303":"And my friend was with me, but he's really into his music and was wearing earbuds, so he wouldn't have been able to hear me anyway, which makes me wonder if it's really worth trying to keep the product name a secret if we're not even going to use it in a situation where it could be overheard.","304":"They prefer using a more encapsulated approach, like local variables or function parameters, to avoid cluttering the global namespace.","305":"The minimum age requirement is because the founding fathers wanted to ensure the president is old enough to have gained significant life experience, but not so old that they're nearing the end of their lifespan. As for a maximum age, the US Constitution doesn't set one, which might seem counterintuitive, but it's actually a deliberate choice. The founding fathers wanted to ensure the president is young enough to serve for two full terms, implying they wanted someone who's capable of long-term service, rather than someone who's too old to serve for a full term. This way, the president can focus on the long-term goals of the country without being limited by their own mortality.","306":"I see what you're getting at. You're saying that the age requirement might be limiting the pool of potential candidates, and that people might feel like they're being forced to choose between older candidates. That's a valid concern. Let's explore this idea further: what do you think the implications would be if we didn't have an age requirement for candidates?","307":"I'm not sure I understand what you mean by 'only 2 options.' Can you help me see what you're thinking?","308":"Narcoanalysis tests, also known as polygraph tests, aren't widely used in every trial to speed up case resolutions worldwide because they're not considered reliable enough for legal purposes. While they can be useful in some cases, their results can be influenced by various factors, such as the examiner's bias, the testee's anxiety, and the test's design. Furthermore, polygraph tests aren't admissible as evidence in many countries, including the US, due to concerns about their accuracy and potential for manipulation. The use of narcoanalysis tests also raises ethical concerns, such as the potential for coercion and the risk of false positives. As a result, they're not commonly used in criminal trials, and other methods, like forensic evidence and witness testimony, are preferred for their reliability and admissibility in court.","309":"The current method is still preferable because it allows for a nuanced consideration of human factors, which narco tests cannot replicate. While it's true that both methods have their limitations, the human element in our current system provides a more comprehensive understanding of a case, taking into account subtleties that may be missed by narco tests. This is not to say that narco tests are without value, but rather that they should be used in conjunction with other methods to ensure a more accurate determination of guilt or innocence.","310":null,"311":"That's right, and it's also natural for people to have varying skin tones due to factors like genetics, climate, and lifestyle, which is why it's not always accurate to make assumptions about someone's skin tone based on their ethnicity or where they're from.","312":"I think the distinction lies in the fact that tanning is a physiological response to UV exposure, whereas attempting to become paler is a deliberate attempt to alter one's appearance, which can be a sign of a deeper issue, such as body dissatisfaction or a desire to conform to societal beauty standards.","313":"I see what you're getting at, but it's not just about using sunscreen or covering up. The issue is that if people are avoiding sunlight altogether, they're missing out on the benefits of vitamin D and the positive impact it has on their overall health. Even moderate sun exposure is better than none at all. Think of it like a balance - you want to protect yourself from the sun's harsh effects, but you also need to allow yourself to get some beneficial exposure.","314":"I'm a bit confused - could you help me understand what you mean by 'preventing tanning vs actively lightening one's skin'? I'm not sure I see the connection.","315":"Wearing protective clothing or using sunscreen can prevent the skin from darkening, but it doesn't change the skin's underlying color. The tan you get from wearing a cloth is still a result of your skin's reaction to the sun's rays, not a change in skin tone itself.","316":"I see what you mean, but I'm still not clear on how this relates to our conversation about tanning through clothing. Can you help me connect the dots?","317":"I'm not sure I understand your perspective. Can you help me see why you think the issue of tanning vs skin lightening is irrelevant to our conversation about skincare?","318":"If you're getting a tan through cloud cover, that's because the sun's rays are still able to penetrate through the clouds, so it's not a question of the cloud cover blocking the rays, it's more about the intensity of the rays. Clothing can block UV rays to some extent, but it's not a foolproof method. The fabric's thickness, weave, and UPF rating can all impact how well it protects against UV radiation. If you want to avoid getting a tan, you'd need to use protective measures that can effectively block the rays, not just reduce them.","319":null,"320":"The term 'Noble Gases' actually comes from an older idea in chemistry where these elements were considered 'noble' because they don't readily react with other elements, much like how nobles in a society are considered to be of high status and not subject to the same rules as everyone else. However, this name is more a reference to their chemical properties rather than a nod to aristocrats. In fact, the term 'noble' in this context is more related to the Latin word 'nobilis', meaning 'well-known' or'renowned', which was used to describe these elements because of their unique properties and how they didn't fit into the other categories of elements at the time.","321":"Radon is a radioactive noble gas that decays into polonium-210, which then further decays into a series of other elements before finally stabilizing into lead-206.

By invoking the specter of a massive influx, he's exploiting the EU's deep-seated anxieties about migration, which have been exacerbated by years of populist rhetoric and ineffective policy. In reality, migrants have been a net positive for European societies, enriching their cultural fabric, contributing to their economies, and injecting fresh perspectives into their politics. The EU's struggle to integrate migrants is a symptom of its own structural issues, such as inadequate social welfare systems and inadequate education and job training programs. Erdogan's threat is not about migrants themselves, but about the EU's willingness to prioritize stability and security over its values of solidarity and human rights. By refusing to engage in a more constructive dialogue, the EU is missing an opportunity to address the root causes of the migrant crisis and instead, is playing into Erdogan's hands, further entrenching the cycle of mistrust and hostility.","338":"When you hit your finger in cold weather, the nerve endings in your skin contract, making the pain more intense. This is because the cold causes the nerve endings to become more sensitive, kind of like how a guitar string gets tighter when it's cold, making it easier to produce a clear note. The increased sensitivity of the nerve endings leads to a greater release of pain-causing chemicals, which is why it feels like the pain is amplified when you experience it in cold temperatures.

By doing so, you can make a more informed decision about whether the potential risks and rewards align with your investment goals.","343":"That's a common misconception about stock options, actually. When you're granted stock options, you're not necessarily entitled to a percentage of the company's profits. The value of the options is based on the difference between the exercise price and the market value of the stock at the time of exercise, not on the company's profits. ","344":"Just as you'd have the right to keep the goose and its eggs if you were the sole owner, you'd also have the right to keep your shares and any dividends they generate if you're not planning to sell them.","345":"The concept of'reinvesting' your dividends is a common strategy where you choose not to take the dividend and instead have the company keep the money to potentially issue more shares or use it for growth, which can lead to increased stock value over time. However, this approach is different from the company directly deciding to give you more shares as a reward for not taking dividends. The board's decision to pay dividends or not is a separate consideration, driven by their assessment of the company's financial health and growth prospects, rather than your individual investment choices.","346":"Actually, the key difference is that an IPO is a public offering of shares, where the company raises capital by issuing shares to the public, whereas an MLM is a business model that focuses on recruiting and incentivizing salespeople to sell products to others, often with a hierarchical structure. In contrast, a Ponzi scheme is a type of investment scam that relies on paying returns to existing investors from funds contributed by new investors, rather than generating revenue through legitimate investments or business activities. A key distinction is that companies in an IPO are transparent about their financials and operations, whereas MLMs often lack transparency, and Ponzi schemes are inherently deceptive.","347":"You're right, stocks are more like claims on a company's assets rather than direct ownership, and that's one reason why the stock market can be a bit confusing because it's not always clear what you're getting when you buy a stock. However, I'd like to add that this distinction is important because it affects how investors approach their investments. For example, if you own a stock, you're essentially betting on the company's future performance, whereas if you own a physical good, you have a more tangible asset.","348":"I understand your point about the risk of buying directly from an orchard, but let's not forget that a business, even a failed one, has value beyond its physical products. It has intangible assets like reputation, customer relationships, and knowledge that can be leveraged in different ways. Perhaps the analogy isn't perfect, but it highlights the importance of considering the broader value of a business, rather than just its immediate financial returns.","349":"The common cold is caused by viruses like rhinovirus, which can survive on surfaces and in the air for a short time. During the off-season, these viruses can be dormant in the environment, such as on surfaces, in the air, and on people's hands. They can also reside in the noses and throats of people who have some immunity to them, but not complete immunity. When the weather cools down and people start to congregate indoors, the viruses can become active again and spread more easily, causing a resurgence of colds. Additionally, some people may have developed a tolerance to the virus, which can make them less susceptible to infection, but not completely immune.","350":"I'm fine, but I'm concerned that the government and media are using COVID-19 as a pretext to erode civil liberties and expand their surveillance powers. The constant lockdowns, mask mandates, and vaccination requirements are all symptoms of a larger control agenda. I think we need to critically evaluate the information being presented to us and question the motivations behind it.","351":"I think it's suspicious that the same people who claimed Russia hacked the election are now pushing the narrative that vaccines and masks are safe without providing concrete evidence. It's hard not to be skeptical when the story keeps changing and the evidence seems to be lacking.","352":"It's a bit of a trade-off between security and usability. Complex passwords are meant to prevent unauthorized access, but security questions are often used as a backup when people forget their passwords. The idea is that these questions are something only the account holder would know, but in practice, they can be easily guessed or looked up. It's a common issue in many systems that try to balance security and convenience. ","353":"I see what you're saying, but the key difference lies in the intention behind the information being requested. Security questions are designed to be personal and private, not just public information that can be easily obtained from online sources. They're meant to be a more nuanced and targeted way of verifying an individual's identity, rather than just relying on easily accessible data. By including questions about first pets, mother's maiden names, or other personal details, security protocols aim to create a more robust and secure authentication process.","354":"If you want to verify that your personal info is private, you can check your property records on publicdata.com, which should match what you already know about yourself.","355":"I see what you mean. While it's true that a determined attacker might put in the effort to target you, the security model you mentioned earlier still relies on the idea that an attacker would bother to invest time and resources in targeting a single person. In reality, that's often not the case, and a more effective security model would take into account the likelihood of being targeted in the first place.","356":"Alcoholism is a disease because it affects the brain's reward system, which is designed to release feel-good chemicals like dopamine when we experience something pleasurable. When someone drinks alcohol, it hijacks this system, leading to long-term changes in the brain's chemistry and structure. This can cause the brain to become dependent on alcohol to feel normal, making it hard to quit even when the person wants to. Over time, the brain adapts to the constant presence of alcohol, and the reward centers become less responsive to other stimuli, making it harder for the person to experience pleasure without drinking. In essence, the brain gets rewired to prioritize the temporary high from alcohol over other sources of pleasure, leading to a vicious cycle of craving and consumption.","357":"Harvey Weinstein was convicted and sentenced to 23 years in prison for multiple counts of rape and sexual assault. He was found guilty of these crimes based on the testimony of his victims and other witnesses, as well as physical evidence, including DNA samples. The jury's verdict led to the judge imposing a sentence of 23 years in prison.","358":"I see your point, and I'll try to provide a more detailed explanation that addresses your concerns and avoids any dismissive language, starting with clarifying the distinction between removal reasons and a jury verdict.","359":"Well, it's a tangled web of cultural and social factors that has contributed to the perception of afros as unprofessional in corporate settings. On one hand, the afro has a rich history as a symbol of black identity and resistance to mainstream culture, particularly during the Black Power movement of the 1960s and 1970s. On the other hand, this same symbol was often viewed as a threat to the status quo, and those who wore their hair in this style were frequently seen as outsiders or troublemakers. As a result, afros were often excluded from the traditional norms of professionalism, which emphasized conformity and assimilation. However, this exclusion was not simply a matter of personal preference, but rather a reflection of deeper power dynamics and systemic inequalities. In recent years, many companies have begun to recognize the harm caused by these exclusions and have actively worked to create more inclusive workplaces. This shift is a step towards acknowledging the complexity of identity and challenging the notion that there is a single, universal standard of professionalism.","360":"Actually, being a business person doesn't have to mean sacrificing your personal style or creativity. In fact, many successful entrepreneurs and business leaders are also artists and creatives at heart. You can find ways to express yourself and showcase your unique personality while still being professional and reliable in your business dealings.","361":"Well, that's a thought-provoking question.  To be honest, I think it's a challenging fit, as business often prioritizes conformity and predictability over self-expression.  However, there are certainly businesses that value creativity and individuality, and if you're passionate about self-expression, you might find a company that aligns with your values.  Perhaps we could explore some examples of companies that prioritize self-expression and see if that's something you'd be interested in pursuing.","362":"That's so cool! Do you think the process of supercontinents breaking apart and reforming is like a natural cycle or is it more of a random thing that happens occasionally?","363":"So, even though it seems slow, it's actually a pretty significant change over a long period of time.","364":"DNA damage can lead to genetic mutations, which can cause cells to become cancerous or die, and because of this, it's not just a matter of cell replacement, but rather a matter of the entire organism being affected, making radiation particularly harmful.","365":"It's a delicate balance between allowing cells to self-destruct when they're damaged and preventing too much collateral damage to healthy cells, or you might end up causing more harm than good.","366":"Let's break it down. Animal agriculture is a huge contributor to greenhouse gas emissions, which are a major driver of climate change. In fact, it's responsible for around 14.5% of global emissions, which is more than the entire transportation sector. The problem isn't just the emissions from the animals themselves, but also the crops that are used to feed them, like corn and soybeans. So, every time you choose to eat animal products, you're adding to those emissions.","367":"Walmart can deny unions because it's a private company, but that doesn't mean employees don't have rights. In the US, for example, the National Labor Relations Act protects workers' rights to organize and form unions, even if the company doesn't recognize them. It's like a tug-of-war \u2013 Walmart might not want to let go of control, but employees are still pulling on the rope, and it's only a matter of time before they win recognition.","368":null,"369":null,"370":"I can see why you'd feel more comfortable using a different term - it's interesting to see how people approach sensitive topics in different ways.","371":"The term 'noble gases' comes from the fact that these elements are chemically inert and don't easily react with other elements, much like the noble class of old, who were often seen as being above the social hierarchy and not prone to scandal or controversy.","372":"I think there's a fundamental confusion here - we're discussing the feasibility of transforming lead into gold, which is a matter of chemistry, not economics or social policy. Let's focus on the periodic table and the properties of these elements.","373":"I think you're right, though, that the appeal of the gold standard isn't just about economics, but also about a sense of stability and security that it's supposed to provide. And that's something that can be tapped into by politicians and movements, as we've seen in the past. But I'm not sure that's necessarily a good reason to go back to the gold standard, especially if it would limit our ability to respond to economic crises and invest in our future.","374":"I mean, to break it down super simply, sub-Saharan Africa was basically isolated from the rest of the world for thousands of years, which made it tough for them to access new ideas and technologies. But that's a massive oversimplification, and there's a lot more to the story. For example, there were periods where sub-Saharan Africa was actually at the forefront of technological advancements, like during the Nubian kingdoms or the great Zimbabwean empires. So, it's not like they were completely cut off \u2013 they just didn't have the same level of global connectivity and exchange as other regions. And even today, there are still many countries in sub-Saharan Africa that are making huge strides in tech and innovation, so it's not like they're thousands of years behind or anything. That's a pretty unfair and inaccurate way to look at it.","375":"That's an interesting point about the Black Death, but let's not assume that the same dynamics are at play in Africa. What specific factors do you think have contributed to the lack of paved roads in Africa, and how do you think they compare to the impact of the Black Death on Europe?","376":"Actually, I think that's a misconception. The diseases I mentioned were not unique to America. Smallpox, for instance, originated in Africa, and spread to the rest of the world through trade and human migration. Similarly, tuberculosis has been present in humans for thousands of years, and was known to ancient civilizations. And while it's true that America developed vaccines, it's also worth noting that many of these diseases were prevalent in Europe and other parts of the world long before the advent of vaccines.","377":"I understand your skepticism, and it's great that we're having this conversation. Sean Carroll's work on the multiverse theory and its implications for our understanding of the universe is fascinating. How do you think his ideas on the multiverse relate to the concept of an afterlife, if at all?","378":"I think you're misunderstanding the point I'm trying to make. I'm not saying that people who believe in a higher power are dumb or incapable of doing good science. But what I am saying is that, as a scientist, I rely on empirical evidence and the scientific method to guide my research and conclusions. If someone's beliefs are based on faith rather than evidence, it can be challenging to have a productive conversation about the science. That's all I'm trying to say.","379":"That's an intriguing perspective, but we should be cautious not to conflate the lack of visibility with the lack of material basis. While it's true that radio signals are invisible to the naked eye, we can still understand their underlying mechanisms through scientific inquiry. Similarly, the workings of the human brain and the emergence of consciousness are complex phenomena that may require more nuanced and multidisciplinary approaches to grasp. Let's focus on exploring the possibilities of a material realm for consciousness, rather than dismissing it outright.","380":"The 'no true Scotsman' fallacy is actually a type of ad hoc reasoning. It's when someone tries to defend a claim by redefining the characteristics of a group or category after it's been challenged, essentially making it impossible to find a counterexample. Does that sound right to you?","381":"I see what you're saying, and I think we're getting at the heart of the issue. If the person is relying on a subjective interpretation of what it means to be a person from Edinburgh, then it's still a case of the 'no true Scotsman' fallacy. But if they're acknowledging that their conception of 'being born in Edinburgh' involves both the technical definition and a personal aspect, then it's not the fallacy. It's a matter of whether they're being honest about the subjective nature of their argument or not.","382":"That's a fair point, and one reason the fallacy is still studied is that it can serve as a useful example of how arguments can be structured to avoid scrutiny, even if it's not commonly used in good faith. It also highlights the importance of clear definitions and the potential for ambiguity in language, which can lead to flawed reasoning.","383":"4. That's a very good point about the difficulty of proving it, and it's also why we rely on logical principles to guide us rather than empirical evidence. In particular, we use principles like the burden of proof, which states that the person making a claim is responsible for providing evidence to support it, and the principle of charity, which encourages us to interpret arguments in the most favorable way possible, while still being honest about the argument's flaws. These principles help us to avoid the fallacy by ensuring that we carefully consider the evidence and arguments presented, and that we don't jump to conclusions or make assumptions without sufficient justification. By applying these principles, we can increase the chances of accurately identifying the fallacy and avoiding it in our own arguments.","384":"The airline isn't bearing the full cost of the extra seat, though, because they've already factored that into their pricing. You're essentially paying for the convenience of flying through their hub, but the cost of that extra seat is spread out across all the passengers who fly through that hub.","385":"The airline's operation cost is not just fuel, crew, and maintenance.  It also includes marketing and advertising, as well as other fixed costs such as airport fees and employee salaries.  A one-hop flight is indeed more attractive to a wider audience, which can lead to increased demand and, subsequently, higher revenue for the airline.  However, the additional overhead for a single hop flight is not solely the cost of marketing and advertising, but rather a combination of factors, including the higher revenue generated by the flight, which can offset the increased costs.  Furthermore, the airline's pricing strategy can also play a role in determining the profitability of a single hop flight compared to a two-hop flight.","386":"I see what you mean about Lufthansa being mid to high end, but even so, the fact that they make a profit from fixed costs and add-on sales means they're still relying on people flying to make money. And that's what I'm trying to say - the business model is designed to get people to fly, even if it's not necessarily the most efficient or sustainable way to travel.","387":"I'm not sure what you're trying to achieve with this, but I'm not easily swayed by empty threats.","388":"Well, imagine you're building a computer from scratch. You'd start with tiny parts that can store info and do basic math, like adding and subtracting. These parts are called transistors. When you put them together, you get a tiny computer called a microprocessor. It's like the computer's brain, and it's what makes it tick. But before a computer can do cool stuff like recognize pics or chat with you, it needs to learn the basics. It's like learning to read and write before you can do math \u2013 it's a necessary step.","389":"The BIOS is a type of firmware that's permanently stored in ROM, and it's what gets the computer up and running by initializing the hardware and loading the operating system, but I think I may have oversimplified things \u2013 the BIOS isn't just a single program that tells the computer to read memory, it's more like a collection of low-level instructions that help the CPU get started and set up the system for the operating system to take over.","390":"The CPU translates the 1s and 0s in the BIOS program into machine code, which it can then execute directly. This process is akin to a set of instructions that the CPU can directly carry out, much like how a chef follows a recipe to prepare a meal.","391":"Well, the CPU's architecture is designed to facilitate a process called pipelining, which allows it to break down complex operations into a series of simpler steps. These steps are then executed in a specific order, with the CPU using its registers to store and manipulate data as it goes. Think of it like an assembly line, where each step builds on the previous one to produce the final result. The CPU's ability to perform logic operations, memory accesses, and control flow decisions enables it to execute a wide range of instructions, from simple arithmetic to complex control flow.","392":"When the input 'x' is converted to output 'y', it's a result of a complex process involving the manipulation of electrical signals within the CPU. Think of it like a series of chemical reactions in a laboratory, where the input is the initial reactant, and the output is the resulting product. In the case of the CPU, the reactants are the electrical signals, and the product is the desired outcome, such as adding two numbers or storing a value in memory. The specific sequence of reactions, or in this case, logical operations, depends on the design of the CPU and the instructions being executed.","393":"The no true Scotsman fallacy is a type of informal fallacy that arises when someone uses a definition of a group or category that is overly broad or vague, and then uses that definition to dismiss any counterexamples that might challenge their claim. This can be seen in the example where someone claims that no true Scotsman eats haggis, but when confronted with evidence that many Scots do eat haggis, they redefine the term 'true Scotsman' to exclude those who don't fit their preconceived notion. By doing so, they avoid confronting the fact that their original claim is false and instead shift the focus to a redefined concept that is not subject to empirical testing or evidence-based validation.","394":"I mean, think about it \u2013 people often use words with different meanings without even realizing it. It's like a silent assumption that's not even on the table. And that's exactly what's happening here, right?","395":"The No True Scotsman fallacy is a specific type of fallacy that can be used to deflect criticism or avoid addressing the underlying flaws in an argument. It often involves making an assumption that is not explicitly stated, and then using that assumption to dismiss counterexamples or opposing views. This fallacy is not necessarily about being ignorant or unaware, but rather about using a rhetorical device to maintain a flawed argument.","396":"Let's consider the Monty Hall problem as an example. It illustrates how our initial intuition can lead us astray, and the fallacy can be present even when we think we're being logical. The problem's setup, where one door is left unchosen and the host opens one of the other two doors, can be misleading. Many people initially think the probability of the car's location remains 1\/3 for each door, but the correct solution shows that the probability is actually 2\/3 for the unchosen door. This subtlety can be applied to the context of your original post, where the fallacy might be present but not immediately apparent. By examining the argument more closely and considering alternative perspectives, we can increase the chances of detecting the fallacy, even if it's not as straightforward as we might think.","397":"I think that's a key point - the fallacy is often used as a way to shut down discussions or dismiss opposing views, rather than as a genuine critique of an argument's logical structure. It's a way to say 'you're not a true fan' or 'you're not a true citizen' without actually engaging with the argument itself.","398":null,"399":"That's a great example! It sounds like you were able to tap into your visual imagination, just like Feynman said. Can you think about how it felt to have that image in your mind? Did it feel like a normal thought process, or was it more like a daydream?","400":"That's a great question, but the concept of static objects doesn't quite apply in the 4th dimension. A more fitting analogy might be a 4D tapestry, where every point in space-time is intricately connected and dynamic, with all moments in time existing in a state of superposition, much like the principles of quantum mechanics. This perspective suggests that the world is not a collection of static objects, but rather a complex, ever-evolving fabric that weaves together past, present, and future.","401":"Hey, it's totally normal to feel scared or unsure about what's coming next. But I want to reassure you that you'll be learning about puberty in school, and it's a process that everyone goes through. Why don't I tell you a bit more about it, and you can ask me any questions you have?","402":"I think it's interesting that you mention the differences between boys and girls during puberty. While it's true that girls may experience more physical changes, such as menstruation and the potential for pregnancy, I think it's also worth considering the emotional and psychological aspects of puberty for both boys and girls. Boys may face pressure to conform to traditional masculine norms, such as being strong and athletic, while girls may face pressure to conform to traditional feminine norms, such as being nurturing and beautiful. Both boys and girls may also experience feelings of anxiety and uncertainty as they navigate these changes. Additionally, the way that society talks about puberty and sex can be really limiting and shaming, which can affect both boys and girls. I think it's really important to have open and honest conversations about these topics, rather than trying to simplify or downplay the differences between boys and girls.","403":"I'm struck by how the trans-Saharan slave trade can have such a lasting impact on technological advancements. Can you tell me more about how it disrupted the flow of ideas and innovations between regions?","404":"The key difference is that the diseases I mentioned are still ongoing global health concerns, whereas many of the diseases you mentioned were largely eradicated in the US thanks to vaccination efforts.","405":"They'll think you're not taking the time to write clean, maintainable code, and that you're just trying to get something working quickly without considering the long-term implications.","406":"The flu didn't completely disappear, but it was overshadowed by COVID-19. As a result, there was less attention and fewer tests for it, which made it seem like it had vanished. However, it was still present and caused problems in some areas, especially for people who are more vulnerable to illness.","407":"The flu season is indeed seasonal, influenced by temperature and humidity. During winter months, the virus can linger on surfaces and in the air. As temperatures rise, the virus dies off, and people's immune systems become more effective at fighting it. While the flu can always come back, it's not a permanent absence. The 47 cases you mentioned are likely a localized outbreak, not a measure of how many people can bring it back. Influenza can resurface, but it's not a guarantee, and it's more likely to occur when precautions are relaxed.","408":"When we're under emotional stress, our body's 'fight or flight' response gets hijacked, and it starts to interfere with our normal physiological processes. The gut and the brain are intimately connected, and when we're feeling overwhelmed, our body diverts blood flow and energy away from our digestive system, leading to nausea and a decrease in appetite. It's almost as if our body is saying, 'I need to prioritize your brain and your muscles right now, and I'll worry about digesting that sandwich later.' This response is meant to be a short-term adaptation, but when we're dealing with chronic stressors like a breakup, it can become a persistent problem.","409":"You're welcome! It's amazing how hearing someone else's story can help us see our own struggles in a new light. It's not that your issues aren't valid, it's more that you're just at the beginning of your journey, with a whole lot of life still ahead of you. I'm at a different place right now, but that doesn't mean your problems are any less significant.","410":"Your generosity in sharing your story has created a ripple effect of compassion and understanding. I'm grateful to be part of this community where empathy and kindness are the guiding principles.","411":"Because of the fundamental drive of life to survive and adapt, kind of like how you're hungry for food and want to eat it to keep going, life is hungry for energy and resources to keep going, and self-replication is a way to get more of those things so it can keep thriving.","412":"The emergence of complex behaviors like replication and self-organization arises from the intricate dance of molecular interactions, where the specific sequence and structure of molecules allow them to recognize, bind, and catalyze each other in a highly orchestrated manner, giving rise to the intricate web of biochemical pathways that underlie life's fundamental processes. This is not simply a matter of chance or random assembly, but rather a testament to the sophisticated interplay between the physical and chemical properties of the elements and the emergent properties of the systems they comprise.","413":"The attack on Saudi Arabia's oil facilities is having a significant impact on the price of oil and currencies because Saudi Arabia is the world's largest oil exporter, and its oil fields are a critical component of the global oil supply chain. The disruption to Saudi Arabian oil production is causing a shortage in the global oil market, which in turn is driving up prices and contributing to currency fluctuations. Moreover, the attack has heightened geopolitical tensions in the region, making investors more cautious and contributing to the volatility in the currency markets.","414":"While it's true that bio-fuel production can lead to increased greenhouse gas emissions, research has shown that advanced bio-fuel technologies can reduce these emissions by up to 80%. Furthermore, the lifecycle emissions of bio-fuel can be significantly lower than those of traditional fossil fuels, especially when considering the carbon sequestration potential of certain feedstocks like switchgrass or miscanthus. Additionally, the geopolitical benefits of reducing reliance on oil from unstable regions should not be underestimated, as it can help to mitigate the risks of supply chain disruptions and price volatility.","415":"I think it's a complex issue, and we need to consider both the environmental benefits and the potential drawbacks, like resource usage and land requirements, before deciding if it's worth pursuing.","416":"When you apply sunscreen, a small amount gets absorbed into your skin, kind of like how your skin drinks in moisturizer. But most of the sunscreen just sits on the surface, forming a protective layer that helps block UV rays. Some of the ingredients in sunscreen get broken down by your body over time, but a lot of it gets washed away when you shower or sweat. A tiny bit might get stored in your body's fatty tissues, but it's not like your body is storing up a bunch of sunscreen in there. Think of it like a temporary shield that protects your skin from the sun, and it's not meant to be stored in your body for long.","417":"What's your go-to resource for learning about sunscreen safety?","418":"While it's theoretically possible for a single store to unionize, the reality is that Walmart's corporate structure would need to be significantly altered for this to happen. The employees of the store in question are part of the larger Walmart workforce, and the store is not a separate legal entity with the autonomy to make collective bargaining decisions. In other words, the employees of the store would need to be recognized as a distinct bargaining unit, which would require a significant reorganization of Walmart's organizational structure.","419":"So, if you flip a coin 100 times and it's heads 99 times, it's a pretty safe bet that the 100th time it's going to be tails, right? But mathematically, the odds of it not being heads 100 times in a row are actually 99\/100. It's like the universe is just waiting for that one chance to turn it around!","420":"Think of it like a vicious cycle: the more you drink, the more your brain adapts to it, making you crave it even more. It's like your brain gets hijacked by a craving monster that's hard to tame. And the thing is, it's not just about the booze itself, but also about the way it affects your mood, your relationships, and your whole life. It's a disease that's hard to shake off, but with the right treatment and support, people can break free from its grip.","421":"Well, let me break it down further. Within semiconductors, we have silicon and germanium, which are widely used in electronics. Polymers can be divided into natural polymers like silk and cellulose, and synthetic ones like nylon and polyester. Ceramics include materials like glass and porcelain, which are known for their hardness and durability. These categories aren't exhaustive, but they give you a better idea of the diversity within each group.","422":"Actually, we haven't ruled that out entirely. The Copernican Principle suggests that we shouldn't assume our place in the universe is special, and the fact that we can see an enormous universe with billions of galaxies suggests that we're likely just one of many, many planets with life, but we haven't found definitive evidence to prove that we're definitely not the center of the universe.","423":"No, I'm saying that if we were at the center of the universe, the expansion would look different because it would be happening equally in all directions, which is called isotropy. But from our current vantage point, we see the galaxies moving away from us, which is consistent with the theory of dark energy. The key point is that our position affects how we observe the expansion, not the underlying physics. The laws of physics would still apply, but our view of the universe would be different depending on where we are.","424":"Yes, sexual urges are a brain function, not a physical one, so amputations don't change that. People who experience them after amputation might try talking to a therapist, or a doctor, about managing their feelings and finding ways to cope.","425":"Actually, it's a bit more nuanced than that. While testosterone is indeed produced in the testicles, it's not the only factor at play. The brain also plays a significant role in regulating sexual desire and urges, and other hormones like oxytocin and dopamine are also involved. So, it's not just the 'balls' that are responsible, but rather a complex interplay of hormones and neural processes.","426":"You're welcome! I'm glad I could share some knowledge with you. If you're interested in learning more about castration in your culture, I can try to help you find some relevant information.","427":"Come on, let's not play games. You're dodging the question because you're not sure how to answer it, and I'm starting to think you don't have a real argument to make. If you're going to make a claim, at least have the guts to back it up with some actual reasoning.","428":"I see you're still convinced that the answer is biological, but I'd like to understand what specific biological factors you think are at play here, especially since you mentioned ovulation and human behavior. Could you elaborate on that?","429":"I see what you mean about the variety of answers, and I appreciate that some of them made good points. However, I still think we need to address the fact that the premise of the question is false, and that the biological factors aren't the primary reason for human children being ready for parenthood. Can we talk more about what you think are some of the key social factors that contribute to this difference, and how they interact with the biological factors? I'm genuinely interested in hearing your thoughts on this.","430":"That's a great way to think about it. However, the key insight from general relativity is that time isn't just a dimension, but also a dimension that's deeply intertwined with the other three. This means that objects in motion don't just create curvature in spacetime, but also change the way we experience time itself. Imagine a planet orbiting a star - its motion affects the way time passes on its surface, relative to other planets or observers. So, the world is more like a dynamic, ever-changing tapestry of spacetime, where objects and events are connected and influence each other in complex, non-static ways.","431":"So, let's think about it this way: imagine you have a room that's 4 feet wide. If you multiply that width by itself, you get the size of the room, which is 16 square feet. Now, if you have a room that's 16 square feet, how can you figure out its width? That's where square roots come in - you take the square root of the size, and that gives you the width.
