that's good, because that's why you're here, and so we're talking about sleep today, and really about kind of what is the brain machinery through which we go through consciousness to unconsciousness and that transition.","1":"Okay. The best way to think about this transition is really called, it's a flip flop switch, okay? So this term comes from engineering, and the idea is that in sleep, you basically have kind of this all of nothing experience. Certainly people kind of drift off to sleep, but then all of a sudden you're unconscious, right? So it seems like it's this flip flop between the arousal system and the sleep promoting system, and it's certainly regulated, and we'll get a little bit into that, but they're certainly kind of made up of two reciprocally inhibitory processes. Okay, so we have the ascending reticular activating system. It originates in the brain stem, and there's a dorsal and a ventral arm to this, and so the dorsal arm has neurons, cholinergic neurons, that go up to the thalamus and then it projections into the fore brain, and then there's the ventral arm, and this is comprised of a whole bunch of different types of neurons, so there are monominergic, so there's kind of dopaminergic neurons that come from the periaqueductal gray, serotonergic ones from the dorsal raphae nuclei, histaminergic neurons that come from the tuberomammillary nucleus of the hippothalamus, and then noradrenergic neurons from the locus coeruleus, and so all of those are kind of working in tandem to kind of drive wake within the brain. So if we just think about drugs that are available inducing wakefulness, we can certainly, kind of the dopaminergic ones jump out, right? So we have amphetamines that kind of drive those signaling, and then modafinil, which is a wake promoting drug for people that have kind of excessive day-time sleepiness that maintains alertness throughout the day.","2":"For the role that they play with respect to the sleep-wake system is really kind of amping up the wake system, right? And so certainly that has like down stream consequences for the sleep system, because now the flip flop switch is kind of pushed in a much stronger direction, and we have to kind of rely on what regulates sleep to get it pushed back to sleep.","3":"And do we know much about why, or which stages of the sleep cycle are affected? You know, if you take amphetamines, is it then when you go to sleep, that you're not able to transition through each of the sleep periods, or is that less clear?","4":"You know, so I think that's less clear. In some ways, you know, getting back to this idea of this wake-sleep system, we have this sleep system that is kind of the counterpoint to this wake arousal system, and so the primary nucleus region is the ventral lateral pre-optic nucleus, also called VLPO, and that has particular neuron outputs that release GABA and galanin, which work in an inhibitory way on kind of the wake promoting ones. And so, it's kind of this delicate balance of these two systems that are ongoing. In your cognitive neuro-science training, right, it sounds like it's pretty specific and focused in a particular part of the brain, the cerebellum, and one thing that I'm interested in is you bring a participant into the study, have you ensured that they got a good night's sleep? Have you asked them about their sleep?","5":"You know, what we do in our studies, is we actually track people, for say a week, and they have to get in within this range of amount of sleep and then it has to be both amount of sleep and how stable it is. That variability can kind of impact it and certainly might have an impact on the machinery that's happening in the brain.","6":"Yeah, yeah, yeah. I find it fascinating in music to think about, you know, say I arrive in a place, if I'm going, say I'm going to D flat major. And there's something you once taught me. You taught me this song Don't Follow the Crowd.","7":"And there's that chord. It's not a Dennerman chord, but it functions as a dominant chord. But it doesn't matter, because you're still going to the place you're going to.","8":"But at that moment, I'm coming from here, and I wanna forge some, some solution. I get myself in a situation. (keyboard music)","9":"'Cause, you know, I just wouldn't think to use that chord in that situation. And there it was! And, you know, if you read the rule book, it's, that not in it.","10":"Something like that. And that's not 'cause like emotionally, it's almost like I'm here, I'm arriving here. But, if the base note is the same, it's like this inevitability about it, it's like I was there all along.","11":"And so, we could play a bit of that if you want to. And we could talk about some stuff. I've been doing it in F. (keyboards playing Amazing Grace) (laughing) Thanks Herbie, that was a trip.","12":"It's a good one. The melody on its own just goes. (hums Amazing Grace) That melody on its own is kind of lonely, right? And no one really knows how it feels. (plays and hums Amazing Grace) So which one did you prefer?","13":"Yeah, ah, that's great. I can decide how I want this melody to feel and the more notes there are, the more exciting it is. That's what musical harmony is. Does that make sense?","14":"Its basically a delay and it happens in all parts of the system: monitors can be a big one. Like consumer televisions can often have 15 milliseconds or more of latency just in the TV part. And then you've got the processing and the computer and all of these add up to the total latency.","15":"But VR makes, you have to give up a little bit of that freedom, you have to not do so many crazy things, so you can wind up having it be as responsive and high quality as it needs to be.","16":"That's right. When we teach machines to learn from data, to build a model from that data or a representation of that, and then to make a prediction. One of the places we often find machine learning in the real world is in things like recommendation systems. So do you have an artist that you really like?","17":"So I'm gonna look up Melanie Martinez. And it says here, If you like Melanie Martinez, one of the other songs you might like is by Au\/Ra. Do you know who that is?","18":"And that's actually a really interesting thing to think about because that creepy vibe is something that you can perceive and I can perceive, but it's actually really hard to describe to a machine. What do you think might go into that?","19":"Sometimes, the ads you see are really uncanny. And I think that's because they're based on so much data. They know where you live. They know where your device is. It's also important to realize that people in aggregate are actually pretty predictable. Like when we talk to each other, we like to talk about the novel things, like here, we're having this conversation. We don't do this every day. But we probably still eat breakfast. We're gonna eat lunch. We're gonna eat dinner. You probably are going to the same home you go to most of the time. And so, they're able to take that data that we already give them and make predictions based on that as to what ads they should show us.","20":"So there are things that machines are really great at that humans are actually not great at. And imagine watching every video posted to TikTok every day. So we just don't have enough time to do that at the rate at which we can actually watch those videos. But a machine can analyze all of them and then make recommendations to us. And then thinking about things that machines are bad at and people are good at, people are really great with only one or two examples of learning something new and incorporating that into our model of the world to make good decisions. Whereas machines often need tens of thousands of examples, and that's not even getting into things like good judgment because we care about people, because we can imagine a future that we want to live in that doesn't exist today. And that's something that is still uniquely human. Machines are great at predicting based on what they've seen in the past, but they're not creative. They're not going to invent. They're not gonna, you know, really change where we're gonna go. That's up to us.","21":"Now, that makes the gravitational field incredibly strong around the neutron star. So what would happen if we were on a neutron star, because of the gravity?","22":"Black holes are so amazing that when the neutron star stops and there's something actually there. There's material there. If it's so heavy it becomes a black hole, so it keeps falling, once the event horizon of the black hole forms, which is the shadow, the curve that's so strong that not even light can escape, the material keeps falling. And like you said, maybe space-time breaks down right at the center there, but whatever happens, the star's gone, that black hole is empty. So in a weird way black holes are a place and not a thing.","23":"There isn't a sensible way to talk about it yet, and that probably means that's where Einstein's theory of gravity as a curved space-time is beginning to break down, and we need to take the extra step of going to some kind of quantum theory of gravity. And we don't have that yet. So even though the black hole isn't completely understood, we do know that they form astronomically, that in the universe things like neutron stars form and things like black holes form. The consequences are very much speaking to this curved space-time. So, for instance, if two black holes orbit each other, they're like mallets on a drum, and they actually cause space-time to ring, and it's very much part of gravitation. The ringing of space-time itself, we call gravitational waves. And this was something Einstein thought about right away in 1950-1960, he was thinking about that.","24":"[Janna] Yes, they ring space-time also like a drum, and you can record the sound of that ringing after a billion years, when it's traveled through the universe. But then the next thing that happens is those neutron stars collide, and because of this incredibly high energy state of matter, which you study, it becomes this firework of different explosions. It's really quite spectacular.","25":"Not an experimental one. So, our theme here today is dimensions. So this is great that you have some math background because mathematicians think about dimensions in a different way.","26":"Let's bring one in. All right. The thing about relativity is that they really want you to think of spacetime as one four dimensional thing, right? It's kind of like space. It's not just three dimensions of space and one dimension of time.","27":"Why? This is a very good question. So, let's just start with space, right? We know a little bit about space. So here's my simple minded way of drawing space two dimensions, because that's how many I can draw on the blackboard. Let's say X and Y. And what is special about space, there's many things, but one is that if I have a curve or a path between two points, there's a distance that you can calculate, right? And the distance between those two points doesn't depend on your coordinates. It doesn't depend on whether you're in radial coordinates or Cartesian coordinates, or whatever. I'm allowed to imagine a curve that does something like this between those two points, and if I were a person walking on that curve, I would have an odometer with me maybe, and I would know, you would know, even without having done that, this path is always gonna be longer than that path. There's a formula, Pythagoras' Theorem that tells you what the shortest distance path is. That's the point. The physical-ness of what is real is the distance along a certain curve. So spacetime is like that. That's why it is useful to think about spacetime.","28":"So let me draw spacetime. Here's how we usually draw it. I'll just say X, but all of space is condensed in this one direction, and this is time, okay? So if you're a little person and you started some event, so you start, you're located somewhere in space, somewhere in the three coordinates of space, and whether you like it or not, you're moving through spacetime just by getting older.","29":"When people ask me can you travel through time? I say yes, yesterday I traveled 24 hours into the future and here I am, a day later. So that's just this. Okay, you're moving through time, like it or not. So what Einstein says is look, I can travel through spacetime in different ways, like I could hop in a rocket ship and fly out and then fly back, and then I could meet you there. So this is a different trajectory through spacetime, right?","30":"There is what we call a metric on spacetime, and when we talk about Euclidean space versus a curved space, versus a sphere or something, that's a different metric. And spacetime has its own metric which says the following thing, that the path between two events in spacetime that is a straight line, will always be the longest time.","31":"Yeah, exactly. If you had a sheet that was originally flat, and you set a marble on it, it would go in a straight line, but then if you put something on it so it warps it, that marble is now gonna be deflected.","32":"Yeah, that's right. And it goes exactly back to what we drew on the board where how those two people in the train and on the ground would divide spacetime up differently to space and time.","33":"So a nice place to start is with the idea of a triad. A triad is a three-part harmony, basically. (keyboard harmonic tone) So that's a triad. So this triad's called C major.","34":"So in Amazing Grace, you start with F. You know, if I go (melodic humming) \u266a How sweet the sound \u266a (scat singing) (laughs) Where am I right now? I don't know where I am. (scat singing) And my job is to get back home, but to make this chord make sense.","35":"You know, a lot of people, a lot of string theorists, they care a lot about all the different ways in which we could hide the extra dimensions. As someone who cares about cosmology, I wanna start asking why are the extra dimensions small at all? How did that happen? Is this something you think about yourself?","36":"The thing I want to talk about is this paper I wrote with Matt Johnson and Lisa Randall where we realize there's another way to compactify extra dimensions spontaneously, dynamically. If you imagine starting with this big piece of paper you couldn't wrap up everything, but within some region of space you could make a tube.","37":"Right? And down there in the tube it looks like your long thing that is compactified in one direction and infinitely extending in the other direction, so there's one less macroscopic dimension of space.","38":"Yeah, I've been trying to explain this to lower levels, and they always look at me like, are you pulling my leg here a little bit? Or is this the real thing that they use? Yes, it is the real thing they use. We study these branes in de Sitter space, and so what we found is that there are black brane solutions which instead of having a singularity inside are non-singular, and stable, and compactified. Is this a familiar thing? I know things like this have been discussed, right?","39":"Right. Imagine that rather than going down to a point, it just asymptotes to some fixed radius that continues infinitely far down there. But then you can ask, okay what about the rest of the universe? You have some sphere, some two dimensions compactified, and the balance between the cosmological constant and the electromagnetic field keeps it at a fixed distance.","40":"But then the other dimensions, the transverse dimensions, don't need to be anti-de Sitter. They can have either positive, zero, or negative cosmological constant. So you can basically get any sort of cosmological solution times a compactified sphere.","41":"Someone probably wrote it for him. So it's possible that if you do have this starting point of an empty de Sitter space with positive cosmological constants and fields lying around you inevitably get a multiverse. It just happens, you know, it's just part of quantum nucleation to different things, and then maybe you need to explain why we live in this universe rather than some other one via the anthropic principle or something like that. So how does our kind of, you know, low-tech old fashioned way of making new universes intersect with the kinds of things you'd think about.","42":"And if we put aside for the second the concerns of our colleagues in other parts of physics, and it's just amongst us chickens, what do you think about the future of cosmology and string theory, and the dynamics of these extra dimensions?","43":"And I just wrote a book called Something Deeply Hidden about many worlds, quantum mechanics, and how spacetime can emerge from it. Plenty of reading material for the audience out there.","44":"The reason we're not just flying off the earth is because earth has gravity, so if we throw something up, it comes back down, so that's why when we're walking on the earth, we don't fly off the earth because the earth has gravity, and it keeps us down.","45":"The main thing about black hole to remember is that it's just, like I said, how the earth holds you down, the black hole pulls you in, as well. Now, try and take the ball from me, black hole--","46":"And so we get the power with a lot less energy 'cause its power is energy per unit time. So we aren't depositing much energy in comparison. Can I just ask, 'cause you are using the thermal process of it heating up, but have you ever had the opportunity to use laser tweezers?","47":"So chirped pulse amplification took us sort of from, we were at 10 to the 12, but when I was working the 10 to the 12 sort of sat on a football sized field. It was a kilojoule laser with a nanosecond pulse. And we brought it down to something we call tabletop terawatt. So it was the same terawatt but now it was one joule and one picosecond, so it could fit on a basic optical bench like you would have in your lab. We were able to take that up to, I think the record is right around somewhere between 10 to the 22 and 10 to the 23 watts per square centimeter. So then in going forward, one of the holy grails is can we reach 10 to the 29 watts per square centimeter? So we still have six orders. So we've gone from 10 to the 12 to 10 to the 23. So we've done 11 orders, so you think six isn't so much harder. I have to tell you, over time, it's rolling over. We need another Nobel Prize winning idea. But if we get out there, that's where, if you focus the intensity, the energy in that volume is enough to break the vacuum.","48":"I don't know if people are working on that because I'm not so much in the medical field, but I should look into that and see if that's a possibility. So after hearing about high intensity lasers, can you think about next time you go back to the lab and you're wondering how to do something in the lab with lasers, can you see how short pulses might help you?","49":"Mostly today, I've been talking a lot about what can we do, what's possible. We think might be possible in the next couple of years. But really at the professional level its more the question of wisdom of what should we be doing.","50":"As an engineer of course, I love quantifiable things. I like saying here's my 18 millisecond motion to photon, here's my angular resolution that I'm improving. I'm doing the color-space right. But you can look not too far back where you say we have blu-ray DVDs at this amazing resolution, but more people want to watch Youtube videos at really bad early internet video speeds. Where there are things that if you deliver a value to people then these objective quantities may not be the most important thing. And while we're certainly pushing as hard as we can on lots of these things that make the experience better in potentially every way or maybe just for videos or for different things. I don't think that its necessary. I've commented that I think usually my favorite titles on mobile that are fully synthetic are ones that don't even try, they just go and do light-mapped, black-shaded. And I think its a lovely aesthetic. I think that you don't wind up fighting all of the aliasing. While you get some other titles that, oh we're gonna be high-tech with our specular bump maps with roughness. And you've got aliasing everywhere, and you can't hold frame rate and its all problematic. While some of these that are clearly very synthetic worlds where its nothing but these cartoony flat-shaded things with lighting, but they look and they feel good. And you can buy that you're in that place. And you want to know what's around that monolith over there.","51":"The end goal of reality, of course in computer graphics people chase photo-realistic form for a long time. And basically, we've achieved it. Photo-realism, if you're willing to throw enough discreet path traced rays at things, you can generate photo-realistic views. And we understand the light really well. Of course it still takes a half hour per frame like it always has, or more, to render the different things. So its an understood problem and given infinite computing power we could be doing that in virtual reality. However, a point that I've made to people in recent years is that, we are running out of More's Law. Maybe we'll see some wonderful breakthrough in quantum structures or whatever--","52":"But if we just wind up following the path that we're on, we're gonna get double and quadruple, but we're not gonna get 50 times more powerful than we are right now. We will run into atomic limits on our fabrication. So given that, I'm trying to tell people that, start buying back into optimization, start buying back into thinking a bit more creatively. Because you can't just wait, its not going to get to that point where it really is fixed to those highest degrees just by waiting for computing to be advanced. If we want this to be something used by a billion people then we need it to be lighter, cheaper, more comfortable.","53":"You know there's tons of opportunities for the synthetic case where you want to be able to have your synthetic fantasy world where everybody is a creature that's created by the computer and simulated reasonably. But of course we've got, you know we still don't do people well simulated. That's a hard problem, we've been beating our heads against it for a long time. I do think we're making progress and I wouldn't bet on that being solved in 10 years, but maybe 20 years. Because it is going to take a lot of AI. Its going to take a lot of machine-learning, where its not going to be a matter of us dissecting all the micro-expressions that people do. Its gonna be lets take every youtube video ever made and run it through some enormous learner that's going to figure out how to make people realistic.","54":"I'm still a believer that the magic's out there. We haven't found it yet, so somebody's going to happen upon the formula. I feel like I've felt little pockets of magic.","55":"All right, you're in the wrong place. [laughs] We're not gonna be talking about biology or computer science. So we wanna talk about the idea of dimensions. Do you know what dimension is? How we would define dimensions?","56":"Right, you know the difference between like one dimension two dimensions, three dimensions, et cetera. So let's do a little experiment here. So there's one dimension. I'll give that to you. Now, here's your task. I'm going to give you another dimension, and I'm gonna ask hold those two things at right angles to each other. It's easy to do. Yeah, so there's no trick here.","57":"I'm not trying to fool you here. Okay. Now this is going to be slightly trickier. I'm going to give you this. I want you to hold all three of them at right angles to all the others at the same time.","58":"So that's a different way of giving you two numbers and locating yourself, and we call those polar coordinates. It's a different coordinate system. What we want to do as physicists is look for extra dimensions. Can you imagine, can you think of any way that there could be extra dimensions?","59":"Time. Yes, Einstein said that we can think of time as a fourth dimension, and that's a very fascinating thing that we could talk about all by itself. But what about space? What about the solar system? Like, if you wanted to tell me where a certain star was in the sky, do you know how we do that?","60":"So astronomers call them right ascension and declination, which are two terrible words, but basically you've seen on the globe where you draw latitude and longitude, what it looks like.","61":"So you can define something as, well you know, how high above a certain location on earth it is, but the earth is rotating and revolving around the sun so we have to define separate celestial coordinates.","62":"So we've been, we've had, now, effectively two different ways of getting more direct measurements, one is the LIGO, which is the Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory, which is where, getting the ripples in space time, coming off of the merging of black holes. The other one that you're mentioning is actually called the Event Horizon Telescope, where they're using radio waves to actually image the event horizon, that region where light cannot escape from the black hole at the center of our galaxy, which I know they're working on it right now. It's an amazing thing, but that'll be the most direct imaging of a black hole. LIGO is a direct detection of the consequence of the merging of black holes. The critical part has been, like, for the super massive black hole at the center of our galaxy, we've seen the stars orbiting it, and we've measured the mass, so that way, so if you look at a spinning black hole, it actually fundamentally alters the emission that's coming off the stuff that's falling into it. These are discovered as what are called X-ray binaries, that is, you know, there's an X-ray member of the binary that is emitting in the X-rays, and it's really not very bright in the optical (mumbles) at all, so there's always, people are looking at these X-ray binaries.","63":"That's pretty good. So gravity wants to attract us to the Earth, and the Earth to us. But the Earth is so much bigger that even though we're actually pulling the Earth a little bit to us, you don't notice it so much. You know, the Moon pulls on the Earth a little bit.","64":"That's such a good question. No, we actually couldn't. In the Moon, gravity is weaker, you can almost float between footsteps if you look at the astronauts on the Moon. On the Earth, it's harder, 'cause it's bigger. If you go to a bigger, heavier planet, it gets harder and harder. But there are stars that have died that are so dense that there's no way we could lift our arms, no way we could step or walk. The gravity is just way too strong. Do you know how tall you are?","65":"Maybe four three. People think that while you're sleeping, your body has a chance to stretch out and gravity isn't crunching you together, but when you're standing or walking or sitting, the gravity contracts your spine ever so slightly, so that in the morning you might be a little bit taller than in the evening. See if it works for you. [Woman] Wow.","66":"They say that astronauts in space, definitely their spine elongates. There were two twin astronauts, one who stayed here on Earth and the other who went to the International Space Station. He was there for a long time, and when he came back, he was actually taller than his twin brother.","67":"Yeah, and that was because gravity wasn't compressing him all the time and he was floating freely in the International Space Station and his spine just kind of elongated. After a while here on Earth though he'll readjust, he'll go back to the same size. Have you ever heard of how gravity was discovered?","68":"Isaac Newton would ponder, how does the Earth cause things to fall? There's a famous story that Isaac Newton was sitting under a tree and the apple fell from the tree and hit him on the head and he had an epiphany and understood this law, this mathematical law for how that works. I don't actually think that's a true story, though.","69":"But it's a good story. So Isaac Newton realized that even if you're heavier, you will fall at the same rate as something much lighter, that that's the same. Once you hit the ground, if you're heavier, you'll hit the ground with much greater force, but you will hit the ground at the same time.","70":"They look the same, but this is much heavier, right? Okay, so try it, just try holding your arms up front, a little higher maybe, give them a chance to drop, and then drop them. [balls thud] [Janna laughs] Did they fall at the same time? Did they hit at the same time? So, Isaac Newton, he was also the one who realized that that's the same force that keeps the Moon in orbit around the Earth and the Earth in orbit around the Sun, and that's a huge leap. Here he is, looking at just things around him, and then looks at the stars and has this really big realization, that that's actually the same force. So, what have you learned today talking about gravity?","71":"It turns out, for people that are between the ages of 18 and 65, the agreed upon amount of sleep that people should get is between seven and nine hours, and it's really at least seven hours per night, to maintain optimal health as an adult. So at least seven hours. When we look at across all of the data that is available on like sleep and health, and sleep and psychiatric illness and those types of things, the largest risk is when people get five hours or less. What do you think is responsible for driving how much sleep you need, and things like that?","72":"Right. You can do part of this level, and you can do the other part, clearly. Got some expertise under your belt, and that's awesome, because I think that everyone should know more about sleep. And so the way that we think about what drives sleep are two independent but related processes and so they have kind of lame names. Process S and process C, and what you've kind of described is process C, and that's the master clock, right? And it helps regulate kind of the rhythms like all over your body, all your cells, and all those kind of things. It drives the release of melatonin from the pineal gland, and melatonin comes online under darkness, so when the sun goes down, your brain knows okay it's time to start getting ready for sleep, and so you start releasing melatonin, which really kind of sets the table for sleeping.","73":"Yeah, no, that's a really great question, and the same is true in places where the sun never goes down during the summer, and when it's dark all the time during the winter, and it turns out light isn't the only thing that kind of gates your circadian rhythm. But I think the thing that's really important, again there are two processes, that the other one is the S process, and that one's just kind of a really important driver of sleep. One name we call it is the homeostatic sleep drive. Kind of the longer you're awake, the sleepier you get. You stay up, you get sleepy. Time goes by, you get sleepier. Time goes by, you get sleepier. But it's actually kind of a fundamental principle for how sleep is regulated, and it's really kind of akin to like a balloon, okay? So you wake up in the morning and your balloon is flat. You've kind of like drained out all of the sleepiness. But then as you kind of go throughout the day, it kind of fills up, so you use your energy, it gets filled up. And then it gets filled up more as you get towards nighttime, right? And then when it's at this optimal amount is when you kind of go to sleep and let out all of the sleepiness again. And this is really what underlies why napping can also be bad for you. So napping's not inherently bad, but if you actually let out some of this air during the day, it's going to take longer for the balloon to get bigger, right, I see to where you feel sleepy, right?","74":"So yeah it's a light bulb and there's a couple of mirrors. Now the light bulb has to be a little bit special. It has to be a type of material that can store the energy in an excited state right? It has to stay up there really energetic and sit there for a while so that when the light comes along, it takes that energy and becomes stronger light and then the mirror sends it back and it does it again and again and again and between these two mirrors, it makes the light come out in a nice beam. In a laser, it comes out as a single color. They all come out with their waves at the same time. Every wave peaks at the same time which then makes it a giant wave and it's this giant wave that has a tremendous amount of power. So it can do something like cutting steel. But when you cut steel, or if you were cutting this floor, it's gray, it actually will absorb the light. That's why the light, you don't see it because the light isn't bouncing back or through it. So I like to use demos to explain how my laser works. So I've brought basically a hammer and a nail. I'm sure you've probably hammered a nail before into a piece of wood but the question is, if you asked yourself why it is we hit the big end and it's the tiny end that we put on the piece of wood. We could never pick up a hammer and hit the sharp end and hope this would go in to the piece of wood.","75":"That's right. All the force that we apply here, goes all the way through but then it can only basically come out when it contacts the wood in that one tiny spot. And so sometimes it's the force that you push something with but sometimes it is that force per unit area. But sometimes it's not even the force per unit area 'cos, you know, push down as hard as you can on that and see if we can get it pushed in. See it doesn't really work does it?","76":"Well it depends. So if you're cutting steel, you need to have the nail. You need to have it concentrated all of the light, not going in all directions but you need it into as small a point as possible. And for that we use a lens. For a lens, the light's coming down as a column, you put in a lens, it all focuses it down in the same way as the nail and then it starts cutting that steel. Okay so that force per unit area--","77":"Exactly. You know sometimes you want to have all of your energy not just in a small area but in the small volume and so one of the other dimensions is time or length. But with light, time and length are the same thing because light always travels at the speed of light.","78":"But if you send a one second long light pulse out into the skies there, the beginning of the pulse is actually two thirds of the way to the moon. It's 300,000 kilometers long. So now, if you talk about light being concentrated, that doesn't seem very concentrated. The type of lasers I play with in my lab will be no thicker than this piece of paper. So we take that energy that might be in three hundred thousand kilometers and we squeeze it all the way down into just this piece of paper and actually the beams are more the size of this piece of paper and so, in my lab, pieces of paper like this would be flying through the sky but we can't see them. 'Cos they don't come in our eyes, they fly by us and they're infra red.","79":"Exactly. And so now, if we have light like that that we wanna machine with. I bring this funnel and so, if we had a lens here and the light was coming down--","80":"Into a spot. So here would be my light coming from my laser and it would just be coming down, down, down, down, down. Hit a lens and it would have to focus down. But now, all the light started out with this big of a spread so concentrated this much. Eventually it would be here, more concentrated. But by the end, right at the focal spot, that's when I get all of my light, all of the energy has been squeezed down into fitting inside this piece of paper and that's why I say that I built a laser hammer. Because when this hits a piece of glass, it just smacks hose electrons right off the atoms and there's nothing else for them to do, they have to fly away. So can you tell me what you learned and maybe about the focusing of the light?","81":"That was, it was like, oh, wow, this might be it, and then, but very early on, it was, as I just started my, it was basically my second year of graduate school, it was like, uh, this is not that simple.","82":"You know, everybody's been just coming at it from different wavelengths at the optical infrared, and, but definitely the X-rays has been one of those things where it's like, oh, finally.","83":"It does seem to be that it may not even, in parts, it may not be even connected to this tiny, little torus at all because part of the work that I did, and others have done, is that type twos preferentially live in different kinds of galaxies than type ones, which should not in any way have to do with something such a small scale. They tend to be in smaller bulged, SB and SC type spiral galaxies. So there's something also having to do with environment that gets you to be a type two, and you can still maybe, timing wise, but there's something else that's going on on a larger scale because the type of the AGN should not really correspond to the host galaxy, but it seems to. And that was one of the things that we were finding out, and that was one of the early little ideas that the, individually, just as the torus model, the unified model, can't explain everything that we were observing at the time. But it is one of those things that it's, they're super luminous, they're all over the place, and we don't have a really good picture of it, which makes it exciting to study.","84":"But being off is not just being off. There's lots of things that are happening. We're gonna kind of talk about those different pieces of sleep.","85":"So our sleep is made up of different types, okay? The first one is called non-rapid eye movement sleep, or non-REM, okay? Or NREM. And then the other one, which might not be a surprise, is called REM. Rapid eye movement sleep. And those are the two main types of sleep that happen. The way that we measure that as a sleep scientist is that we'll actually bring people into the lab where they can do this at home, where we put electrodes on their scalp while they're sleeping, and that allows us to measure the brain activity that's going on during the night.","86":"When we measure all of that, we're able to see how much time someone's asleep, and how many times they wake up and stuff during the night. You know, we're also really interested in kind of, the amount of non-REM sleep someone gets and the amount of REM sleep that someone gets, because each part of those types of sleep do different things for the body. And so it's important to get both of those. And so within non-REM sleep, there are three stages ranging from N-1 to N-2 to N-3. So not particularly clever in our naming, but that's how we know what stages they are. And what they do is it moves from lightest to deepest sleep, okay? N-1, it's more kind of light, wakefulness sleep, kind of in and out of sleeping. Then you go into N-2, which is where we spend 45 to 55 percent of our sleep. And it's more this kind of light sleep, but then we get into kind of the really restorative sleep, and that's N-3. And in N-3, when we look at someone's EEG wave, we see these big slow waves, and it's called slow wave sleep. And so we spend about 20% of our sleep in slow wave sleep, though it can vary on a day to day.","87":"You know, some of that is totally accurate, that like when your brain's more engaged by being on your phone or doing things that you really enjoy or things that stress you out or any of those types of things, it's harder to get to sleep and to kind of fall into that deeper levels of sleep. Most of the REM sleep, this dreaming sleep, happens in the second half of the night.","88":"Okay? So we wake up a lot during the night, and we just don't remember it. And you'll go back down into deep sleep, and then up again into REM, you know, in kinda these cycles.","89":"Okay. Usually we want to keep naps, like 20 to 30 minutes. When people drop into deep sleep, and then they're woken up out of a nap, most people report that they feel way worse than they did before they took the nap, and that's because you've been in deep sleep, and it's this term called sleep inertia. So what are the stages of sleep?","90":"I think to really get deep into nanomaterials and nanoscale devices, you really have to understand to some level, quantum mechanics. What it teaches us as we make these devices smaller and smaller, their properties begin to now depend on the size and the orientation of these devices. There are materials, and you're taking a 2D materials class, you know about this, that are intrinsically thin. As they're grown, as they're fabricated, they're already at the nanoscale and they possess these quantum confinement properties that as a nanotechnologist, you try to exploit. And so the first ones I wanted to talk to you about are quantum dots, have you heard of quantum dots before?","91":"So these are typically semiconductors. They can be cadmium selenide cadmium sulfide, zinc selenide and they're small clusters of atoms. They can be from 2 to 10 nanometers. What's interesting about these materials?","92":"That's correct. Yeah. Because of quantum confinement, once you get below this 15 nanometer range, the band gap of the material depends completely on the size of the material. So in bulk materials, if you want to change the band gap, you have to change the material, right? But in these quantum dots specifically, just by changing the size, you can change their band gap. And because their band gap is changing, their optical properties are different. And you can precisely tune the wavelength of light that they emit just by changing their size.","93":"Carbon nanotube, right. So if you roll up graphene, depending on how you roll it and the angle, you roll it with, it has different properties. So if I roll it one way, it'll act like a metal. If I roll it a different way, it'll act like a semiconductor. The one that gets everyone most excited is that the electrons and holes move very fast through graphene. And so there's a lot of interest in using these for certain types of high-speed electronics. The other interesting application is because it's one atom thin, it's very sensitive to changes in the environment. And so there's a lot of interest in using them as diagnostics. It's on us researchers to find ways to A, control that process and then B, to actually build some sort of interesting technology from them.","94":"Yeah. 100%. That's right. And that's the motivation for looking at these emerging materials. But I would never bet against the innovation and the creativity in this nano electronic space. Tens of thousands of scientists, every time they hit a barrier, at least historically, as a guide, they have found a way to overcome it. It's a real marvel in ingenuity.","95":"It's just pretty lights. [laughing] But now that you suggested it, these were inspired by the array of quantum dots that we showed earlier. So that's the story I'm going to stick with. [laughing] I like it.","96":"So machine learning is a way that we teach computers to learn things about the world by looking at patterns and looking at examples of things. So can I show you an example of how a machine might learn something?","97":"That's true. Do you think, if we look at these pictures, do you think maybe we could say, Well, they both have pointy ears, but the dogs have a different kind of body and the cats like to stand up a little different.? Do you think that makes sense?","98":"This one's a jackal. And it's actually a kind of dog. But you made a good guess. That's what machines do too. They make guesses. Is this a cat or a dog?","99":"And so, you did something pretty amazing there. Because we asked the question, Is it a cat or a dog? And you said, I disagree with your question. It's a human. So machine learning is when we teach machines to make guesses about what things are based on looking at a lot of different examples. And I build products that use machine learning to learn about the world and make guesses about things in the world. When we try to teach machines to recognize things like cats and dogs, it takes a lot of examples. We have to show them tens of thousands or even millions of examples before they can get even close to as good at it as you are. Do you have tests in school?","100":"Which means that in the test, you're not seeing any problems that you don't know how to solve. As long as you did all your practice, right?","101":"So machines work the same way. If you show them a lot of examples and give them practice, they'll learn how to guess. And then when you give them the test, they should be able to do that. So we looked at eight pictures and you were able to answer really quickly. But what would you do if I gave you 10 million examples? Would you be able to do that so quickly?","102":"So one of the differences between people and machines is that people might be a little better at this, but can't look at 10 million different things. So now that we've been talking about machine learning, is this something you want to learn how to do?","103":"Yes, we're gonna talk about science and we're gonna talk about a very specific kinda science, about people who study brains. Do you know what a brain is? What is it?","104":"Maybe a mutual acquaintance of ours, Jasper gave a example of fault injection, and I like to use that as, when I'm trying to explain fault injection, he shows a pinball machine and the pinball machine, obviously the two inputs are the two plungers when you're playing a pinball machine, but fault injection, you can tilt the entire pinball machine, right? You're just introducing some external variable that's outside of the traditional inputs that you're used to and you've now controlled the environment in a advantageous way to the user or the player. Can you give an example of some type of fault injection that you're doing or working on?","105":"We're also scratching the surface of, like, what is possible? It's not necessarily just the system itself and not necessarily that algorithm itself. Like you said, you don't necessarily need to attack the math in some cases. You can just attack that check. And I think something that's been pretty cool is looking at higher energy particles. It's going to be maybe hard to entirely confirm, but I think it'd be really, really cool to actually see. Like, I want to see one of these faults because I haven't seen it myself. And also, how do you know that you've seen it? I've started playing with, like, setting up a cloud chamber. A cloud chamber lets you actually view high energy particles going through sort of like in a small jar with some evaporated alcohol. And I thought it'd be really cool if we put some memory chip in there, like a basic memory chip and we just fill it with some data, but then you put a camera on that area and you just watch. Assuming that there is a high energy particle that actually hits that memory, that should potentially flip the energy state of that bit. The outside microcontrollers should be able to read that and actually say, Oh wait, the data, even though I'm not changing data, I'm only reading data, and we should be able to visibly or optically see it. What I'm wondering is could that be a next area of research? Because I don't think anyone's actually looking at intentionally injecting high energy particles to take over a computer, when really, you know, that's another technique for fault injection, technically speaking.","106":"I've never seen... Maybe call it a verifiable visualization of it, right? We know it's true, you know, you can get skin cancer by going outside and having too many high energy particles hit you, but we've never seen it. And we know it can happen to a computer chip, but I've never seen both.","107":"The thing is, even if you know about that, then there's so many others that someone won't necessarily know about, because there's so many, I guess, potential areas for a fault to occur. Where do you think security is going or new research is going? Are there any new areas you think are coming out or are going to be more interesting, you know, pretty soon?","108":"For me, I think the things that have been recent and super interesting are typically down to physics-level effects that maybe we haven't seen before. I think my mind was blown with the, there was the light commands research, and they were able to modulate sound, although it's purely over light using a laser, they would hit the MEMS microphone, and it was picking that up and was able to then interpret it and essentially take control over light.","109":"It's the easier side. I would say my side is the easier side, right? I'm on the offensive side. I want to break into things. Someone on the defense side, they might have, you know, a system was developed and they now need to patch a hundred holes. They patch 99 of them. I only need to find that one.","110":"You got, pretty much, you got a very good idea about it. Basically you have a star, at the core its generating energy, which is countering the pressure of all that mass trying, being pulled in by gravity. Once it can't generate that energy anymore, the core collapses, once the core is collapsing, it keeps collapsing, and collapsing, and collapsing, and that's the critical thing that makes a black hole. You have enough mass in the volume, such that the escaped velocity becomes the speed of light, once light can't escape, hence the black part. (laughs) But that's the thing, is that just because there's an intense amount of gravity very close to a black hole, things don't start behaving differently. And my favorite analogy is a vacuum, everybody thinks, like, if you point a vacuum cleaner at something, it's just gonna suck everything in--","111":"Right, you will feel the gravitational pull, and it'll redirect you in some way, and if you're far enough way, it's just like you're very far away from the sun, or something else. If you're close enough, it will divert your path more, if you're close enough still, then you will get what are called tidal forces, where the difference between, for example, if you're standing next to a black hole, the difference in gravity between your feet and your head actually becomes significant. Next time you see a science fiction movie, if somebody says, Oh, my god, we've been caught in the gravitation field of a black hole, and we're gonna fall in, it's like, no, no, just, if you're far enough away, just thrust a little bit this way, and then you'll slingshot around the black hole.","112":"I wouldn't call them educational, but the movie Interstellar actually had, as one of the people involved in both writing it, and as a science advisor, Dr. Kip Thorne, who's a Professor at Caltech, who was part of the team that detected gravitational waves, and just won a Nobel Prize for it. So he made sure to try and get it as accurate as possible, so Interstellar, I think, is one of the best examples of getting black holes right.","113":"It's, there're multiple theories, there's observational evidence, more than some other theories that are really feeding into this because now we have the instrumentation, both in X-rays and infrared, in particular, because we don't have a direct optical line of sight to the center of our galaxy because there's just a lot of dust in the way. But the infrared can penetrate the dust, the X-rays can penetrate the dust, the radio can penetrate all of that dust, so by combining all of these different wavelengths, people are really coming to a point of okay, how is this happening, by looking at different wavelengths of light, we can get a better sense, but they're still working on the theory, it's not all done.","114":"Well, you're absolutely right that the attention machine learning gets has grown dramatically. 20 years ago, going to gatherings and telling people what I was working on and seeing the blank face or the like, Where's the turn? and walk away. Like, Oh, no. The accessibility of the tooling, like, we can now do in, like, five lines of code something that would have taken 500 lines of very mathematical, messy, gnarly code even, you know, five years ago. And that's not an exaggeration. And there are tools that mean that pretty much anyone can pick this up and start playing with it and start to build with it. And that is also really exciting.","115":"And part of the challenge of it is not the mathematics of building models, but the challenge is making sure that the data is sufficiently representative, potentially high quality.","116":"Right. And so, to say that another way, when you're collecting data from the real world and then building machine learning systems that automate decisions based on that data, all of the biases and problems that are already in the real world then can be magnified through that machine learning system. And so, it can make many of these problems much worse.","117":"And so, it's not just the provenance of that data, but it's, sort of, deeply understanding, Why does it look the way it looks? Why was it collected this way? What are the limitations of it? We need to think about that in entire process, how we document that process. This is an issue in companies where somebody might create something that even their peers can't recreate.","118":"These are great questions. So things like actuarial science, operations research, where they actually are not using machine learning as much as you might think. And then you have other sorts of companies or on the FinTech side, or even the ad tech side of things where they perhaps are using machine learning to the point of even absurdity.","119":"So when we think about the next five to 10 years, the things that are really still holding us back are these uneven applications of resources to problems because the problems that get attention are the high value ones in terms of how much money you can make or the things that are fashionable enough that you can publish a paper on it. So what do you think is holding us back?","120":"I am incredibly optimistic and not... Perhaps it's a personality flaw, but I can't help but look at the potential of the technology to reduce harm, to give us information that help us make better decisions. And to think that we would choose to address the big problems ahead of us. I don't think we have a hope of addressing them without figuring out the role that machine learning will play. And to think that we would then choose not to do that is just unthinkable.","121":"A lot of origami is animals, birds and things. There's also a branch of origami that is, it's more abstract or geometric, called tessellations. Tessellations, like most origami, are folded from a single sheet of paper but they make patterns, whether it's woven patterns like that, or woven patterns like this. If you hold them up to the light you can see patterns.","122":"The thing that makes them cool is they're sort of like tilings, it looks like you could put this together by cutting little pieces of paper and sliding them together, but they're still one sheet.","123":"There's no cuts in these just folding. We can build these up from smaller building blocks of folds, learn how to fold little pieces and put them together in the same way that a tiling like this looks like it's built up of little pieces. Can you make a fold that starts at the dot that doesn't run all the way across the paper?","124":"Mm-hmm. Each of these folds is peaked like a mountain and we call these mountain folds but if I made it the other way, then it's shaped this way and we call it a valley fold. In all of origami there's just mountains and valleys.","125":"So they're all reversible and it turns out that in every origami shape that folds flat, it's going to be either three mountains and a valley or, if we're looking at the backside, three valleys and a mountain, they always differ by two.","126":"Awesome, good. (laughs) It's a map of all the connections between every neuron in your brain. It literally, in a human brain, something like a map of the one quadrillion connections that a hundred billion neurons make with each other.","127":"Neurons are also digital. Meaning a Neuron either fires or it doesn't fire, so that's either one or zero. And it's the combination of those ones or zeros that actually produce the 10 thousand different answers that you say.","128":"So fortunately there's, I'm also doing it from space with the Spitzer Space Telescope, so particularly in the infrared, and my main interest has been to try and study the environment around the super massive black holes, not as close as where the X-rays are coming from, but clearly there's something from the X-ray corona that illuminates the rest of the accretion disk, and the dust that's further out. And so fundamentally, that's one of the key things that I'm trying to use, is trying to see how long, once you've got this sort of pulse that's generated close to the black hole, it propagates out, and so you can use optical wavelengths to see that the accretion disk lights up in the optical a little bit as it gets heated up from the X-ray, and then later on, the infrared dust, the dust absorbs it, and emits it in the infrared. And so that, I love that, the ability to exchange time for resolution, because these structures are so far away that we're never gonna get a telescope big enough where that has the resolution to see the accretion disk, or the dust distribution around--","129":"Yeah, again, we don't know exactly where X, Y, Z, zero is, we're assuming that it's something, you know, the X-rays that are coming out are very close to the event horizon of the black hole, but this is still, you know, your realm of X-rays, to really figure out those kinds of things. But once the X-rays, once the photons hit the corona, and are re-scattered, and up, energized, and then they start illuminating the accretion disk, it heats it up, and so just by the light travel time, when the optical, if it gets, you know, brighter and fainter, and then the infrared gets brighter and fainter, two weeks later, then the dust is two light weeks away from that. So it's a one dimensional one, so we're averaging, so we don't get the two dimensional, or even three dimensional one. And then we've done it now, of course, we have better telescopes, there was a project where you could do it with the Hubble Space Telescope and the ultraviolet, you used the Swift Observatory, which had optical and ultraviolet, and then from ground base, we did optical, and then from space we did it with Spitzer and the infrared. So you could actually see this bright flash go off in a nearby AGN called NGC5548, and then you see it propagate as it warms up the disk, as all that light is falling onto it, and then eventually you hit the, the, further away, where the dust is, and the dust tends to radiate in an infrared. So we got basically a structure, and you just, you see this flashbulb go off, and then it illuminates, effectively, the structure.","130":"So you do see it, basically the dust sublimation radius, and you see it at, and it tells you, depending on what kind of dust it is, and it's actually one of the problems for me studying, whenever we try and do X-ray studies of low luminosity active galactic nuclei in your, by galaxies, because there're all these X-ray binaries that are also emitting X-rays, which make our lives difficult. But they're also in black holes, when it's this really interesting sort of both, it's great, but ugh, it's also a source of noise for those of us who are trying to do X-ray observations of nearby galaxies.","131":"It's a weird thing to be sitting in your own galaxy, but not be able to separate all these, four million solar mass black hole creating, next to, how massive, it's like two to three solar masses for the X-ray binaries?","132":"And this goes to the idea that you don't have a core balance, that a supernova with a black hole as its final result, actually never has any kind of expulsion, that it all just goes. (imitates sucking)","133":"Which was one idea, but again, it's, I'll leave this to your theoreticians, I think there are problems with that, as well. I call it job security. That's right. (both laugh) We have a lot of things about black holes, both in terms of their formation, or even how they exist as they are, and how they're interacting with their environment that we're still not understanding.","134":"Do you think there are going to be general principles that guide those decisions? Because right now, it's generally up to the machine learning engineer to decide what tools they want to apply.","135":"If you train a model off of language off the internet, it sometimes says uncomfortable things or inappropriate things and sometimes really biased things. Have you ever run into this yourself? And then how do you think about that problem of potentially even measuring the bias in a model that we've trained?","136":"I imagine in the last few years, we've seen a lot of changes and improvements in the capabilities of NLP systems. So is there anything in that that you're particularly excited about exploring further?","137":"So when we think about quantum mechanics, we think about particles and their quantum charges in the Feynman way, the way that Feynman taught us. They come in and they exchange a force carrier and then they come out again, so that's how we think of an electron and light scattering, for instance, or something like that. And the language that Einstein gave us is so different. It's completely geometric, it's all this space-time. And it's also unnecessary.","138":"So do you think there's some sense in which we shouldn't be thinking about individual universes, individual space-time, so we should be thinking about superpositions of space-times?","139":"So when we're talking about the multiverse or the Big Bang, we are really talking about gravity ultimately, and we're talking about how a theory of gravitation which we know think of as a theory of space-time has a quantum explanation, has a quantum paradigm imposed on it that will help us understand these things, and we don't have that yet. One of the things that I think is so amazing is that the terrains in which we're going to understand quantum gravity are very few. It's the Big Bang, because that's where we know that quantum and gravity both were called into action. And there's black holes. One of the most interesting discoveries is of course Hawking's discovery, kick-started a kind of crisis, right? In thinking about why quantum mechanics and gravity were so knocking heads. It was one of the most beautiful examples.","140":"This is the Heisenberg's uncertainty principle in reality. You can't precisely say where the electron is, and you can't precisely say how quickly it's moving.","141":"This idea that the darkest phenomenon in the universe actually is forced to radiate quantum particles is pretty wild. I think everyone understood that it was a correct calculation, but I don't think a lot of people understood the implications, that it meant something really terrible was happening. Because this black hole, which could have been made of who knows what, is disappearing into these quantum particles which, in some sense, have nothing to do with the material that went in. So do you think that's a big crisis? The black hole evaporates, the information is lost?","142":"So this is a huge crisis 'cause either quantum mechanics is wrong, and as you described it, it's the most accurately-tested paradigm in the history of physics, how could it be wrong, right? Or the event horizon is letting information out and violating one of the most sacred principles of relativity.","143":"That's a nice way of looking at it. So that you're not actually violating classical relativity once you're in a regime where the wave function has really peaked around a very well-defined stage.","144":"Yes, so one of the things I like to think of with holography is that I can pack a certain amount of information in a black hole. I mean, you can literally think of it as throwing things into it. So let's say I have information in some volume and I'm under the illusion that I can just keep packing information in that volume, as much as the volume will contain. Eventually I'll make a black hole and I'll find out that the maximum amount of information I can pack into anything in the entire universe is what I can pack on the area. And since area is projecting the illusion, maybe, of volume, maybe the whole world is just a hologram. It's not a principle that only applies to black holes. It's saying that, if this theory of quantum gravity is correct, then this while three-dimensionality is an utter illusion and really the universe is two-dimensional. That's crazy.","145":"Do you think it's possible that gravity is really ultimately just quantum mechanics and doesn't exist at all in the fundamental ways that we've been talking about so far, like the Newtonian way and the space-time way, that those are just these kind of macroscopic illusions? Sometimes I talk about it in terms of temperature. Temperature is not a thing. There is no single thing called temperature. It's a macroscopic illusion that comes from the collective behavior, really quantum behavior of random motions of atoms. And is it possible that the whole of gravity is some kind of emergent illusion from what's really quantum phenomenon underlying it?","146":"So that's just like saying there's the idea of a dual description. It's just saying there's a perfect dictionary between these two descriptions, and so to belabor which one's real is silly. It's like saying, is French or is English real?","147":"Okay, so we'll do some, but I want to tell you a little bit about origami. Most origami follows two, I'll call them customs, almost like rules. It's usually from a square and the other is it's usually folded with no cuts. So these guys are folded from an uncut square.","148":"Okay. We're going to start with a model that every Japanese person learns in kindergarten, it's called a crane, traditional origami design, it's over 400 years old. So, people have been doing what we're about to do for 400 years.","149":"Let's fold it in half from corner to corner, unfold it and then we'll fold it in half the other direction, also corner to corner but we're going to lift it up and we're going to hold the fold with both hands. We're going to bring these corners together, making a little pocket and then, this is the trickiest part of this whole design, so you're going to put your finger underneath the top layer and we're going to try to make that layer fold right along the edge. Now you see how the sides kind of want to come in as you're doing that?","150":"It's called a petal fold, it's a part of a lot of origami designs and it's key to the crane. Now we're ready for the magic. We're going to hold it in between thumb and forefinger, reach inside, grab the skinny point that's between the two layers, which are the wings, and I'm going to slide it out so it pokes out at an angle. We'll take the two wings, we spread them out to the side and you have made your first origami crane.","151":"Now, this is a traditional Japanese design but there are origami designs that have been around so long we're not entirely sure where they originated. We're going to learn how to fold a cootie catcher.","152":"So we'll start with the white side up and we're going to fold it in half from corner to corner, in one fold and now we're going to fold all four corners to the crossing point in the center. We'll fold it in half like a book. On the folded side we'll take one of the folded corners and I'm going to fold it up through all layers. There's a pocket in the middle. We're going to spread the pocket and bring all four corners together. Where you have original corners of the square, we're gonna just pop those out. This is one of the most satisfying moments, I think-","153":"A lot of people are seeing blockchain in the news and maybe seeing a lot of sort of initial coin offerings (laughs) and sort of monetization opportunity around blockchain and getting very excited about it. And some of that excitement is real and should be, you know, encouraged, but some of it is also hype. How do you feel about the hype cycle around blockchain today?","154":"And it's because we've had a lot of PR, a lot of proof of concept, but truthfully, this is more like a science, right?","155":"It will develop. It will take five years. It will take 10 years. That kind of time is necessary. One of the areas that brought me to supply chain research is the fact that we're not just gonna see blockchain emerge. We're gonna see artificial intelligence continue to evolve. We're gonna see connective devices and this sort of growing internet of things and machinery that can do a lot more and have a wallet and transact on their own. And so I actually think a lot of where blockchain and other technologies are headed is this interesting synergy that will help us elevate the kinds of institutions we've used in the past and cobbled together to create that identifiable, verifiable trust.","156":"In that it's hard to compare it to some perfect future. Just like you compare autonomous vehicles to this very high standard because machines are doing it. It should be perfect. There should be zero car deaths.","157":"When you say, well, there's hundreds of thousands, millions of car deaths on the road due to human error today. I think we're in a similar place. We're going to see problems with this technology, and we are going to need to develop multiple kinds of standards that also have some flexibility. But it's going to also be a version, a system, that allows us to fix some of the things that are broken today.","158":"Yeah, it's crazy. They're really a lot of bad or malicious hackers out there who are doing just that. They're going into people's accounts and they're stealing money, but there's also another side of computer hacking where there are people who are trying to learn how those bad hackers are actually breaking in to the bank accounts.","159":"Yeah, exactly. They're looking for ways that they can create protection. It's kind of like the lock on your front door. That lock is to essentially prevent bad people from coming in or people accidentally coming in when they shouldn't. A hacker is essentially looking at a way, how can I get into this lock? But then there are the good ones who are trying to unlock it so that they can tell the company that made the lock, hey, we can actually protect people by making the lock a little harder.","160":"In many cases, they'll send them a new lock. So it's an upgraded, better version. Sometimes that's new features, but sometimes that's bug fixes and ways to protect you as well.","161":"That's a very good point. You should definitely make sure that you're obeying the law. They might work with the lock company and say, I'm trying to improve your product. And they're trying to find these holes or problems, and then share that with the company. Even though the good hacker is doing exactly the same thing as the bad hacker, it's the same exact skillset, and you're using the same exact techniques and information to try to break that lock, but your goal as a good hacker is really to help everyone like you and me to make sure that our stuff is protected. So hopefully they don't get in trouble because they're the good guys.","162":"I started going on the computer and playing video games, but I had some ideas of my own, and that's where I started to learn how to hack. I wanted to play with my friends on this video game and just change the way that things look.","163":"That's entirely possible. They may have done it for a reason, but you may have come up with a really good idea that, do you think there are other people who might like the idea that you came up with?","164":"When you have creative ideas like that, hacking can actually allow you to change the way a system works, and that means you can change a game and how the game is played, and then you can share that with your friends and other people who like that game. Once I started learning how to do it, I found that, things that were harder for me, I could make easier.","165":"You know, you're right. When you read about some of these technologies, it does feel like science fiction. But the part of nanotechnology I wanted to talk to you about is stuff that you probably use every day, most of your day, all of the time. Can you guess what aspect of nanotechnology I'm gonna talk to you about?","166":"So this is a silicon wafer, and they're embedded in basically almost every object that you use, from a laptop, to a phone, to cars, television sets, appliances. We ended up cutting these into little squares and those repeating patterns, each of those is a processor. And those chips are what goes into all of these objects. What I want to talk to you about is how we got from where we started, and how we're able to actually fit 18 billion of these little devices in a little one inch by one inch area. They're called transistors. It's a switch. Very simply, think of it as a light switch that turns on and turns off using an electric field by applying a voltage.","167":"I went through my kid's Lego bins to build a very simple model of a transistor. And these are wired together in circuits so that you can do computation. You can do logic with them. Where nanotechnology comes into play, the way you double the number of transistors on a chip. Can you guess what you would have to do to this transistor?","168":"You have to make it smaller. Exactly. But here's the problem. So about 10 to 15 years ago, the devices got so small that if you shrunk them this gate, that actually turns it on and off loses its ability to control the channel. And so what they did, was they took devices like this into these things, we call them, FinFETs, kind of like a fin on a fish. So they're very thin transistors. The width of these fins is only six nanometers. Okay? So 6 nanometers is 25 to 30 atoms across. And they repeat this over the entire wafer just about perfectly. It's just a huge feat in engineering. But these types of devices are exactly the kind of devices that your phones and computers either have, or will have in the near future. And it's a way that nanotechnology is directly impacting you right now.","169":"Exactly. So these are made using a technique called lithography. You basically coat the silicon wafer with a polymer. Then you put a mask on it and then you shine light through it. And the features of the mask, the size of those holes determine the feature size in the chip. It's not just the size of the mask that matters. It's the wavelength of the light that's used. We talked about nanotechnology being science fiction before, but this is real stuff that's being produced, that's being made, that's being used every day by people.","170":"When you give up most of what you want? Well, sometimes that definitely happens for sure. What if I told you that this is the kind of technology that I work on that means you could trade with any kid all over the world?","171":"That's probably a good idea, maybe somebody else likes it more than you do. So normally, when people trade, they have to go to the store, or they have to know the person so they can get what they asked for. With blockchain, you can make that exact same trade, but you don't need the store, and you don't even necessarily need to know the other person.","172":"So on code.org, one of the things you've been doing is actually building a game or that they have a game and then you can actually rewire some of the inputs and outputs of that. Is that right?","173":"Yep, there's also things like your mouse and there's even things like the microphone itself is actually an input device. It's taking something from you, which is the sound and it's then transmitting that, ad it's actually sending it to me. Are there any other things that you can talk to a computer? You can give it information.","174":"Typically, it's going to be something like the keyboard, right? I'm just going to be typing keystrokes to be talking to some piece of software or hardware, but other times it can be other things like even the temperature of a computer can actually affect how the computer operates, and it might be advantageous to me to cool down the computer and actually slow down the movement of electrons in something like memory, so that if a computer shuts off, it stores something that wasn't memory like a password and stores it for a long enough time that I might be able to actually extract it through some other methods.","175":"It just depends what you're trying to do. In some cases, it could literally be seconds because you already know how the system works, and other times, it could be years. So what have you learned about hacking?","176":"Well, that's true, we do use slingshot technology once things are out in the solar system. So, for instance, we use Jupiter and other planets so that when some of the spacecraft gets close, it'll slingshot around and it'll cause it to speed up. But mostly, around the Earth, gravity pulls things down, so when we want to send a rocket into space, when we wanna go to the Moon, when we wanna send supplies to the International Space Station, the trick is to get something moving fast enough that it escapes the gravitational pull of the Earth. Have you heard the expression what goes up must come down? It's actually not true. If you throw it fast enough, you can actually get something that doesn't come back down again, and that's basically how rocket launches work. You have to get the rocket for the Earth to go more than 11 kilometers a second. Think of how fast it is. Just one breath and it's gone 11 kilometers. If you get it to go that fast, it's not gonna come back down again. So you know the International Space Station which is orbiting the Earth? That's going around the Earth at 17,000 miles an hour. It has no engines anymore, the engines are turned off. So it's just there falling forever. So once it's out there, it's not coming back down as long as it's cruising like that.","177":"In a weird way, that is gravity pulling it. So have you ever had a yo-yo where you swing it around like this? The string is pulling it in at all times, but you've also given it this angular momentum. And as long as you give it the angular momentum, pulling it in actually keeps it in orbit. And so the Earth is pulling it in at all times, so that's why it doesn't just travel off in a straight line. It keeps coming back around. So it's funny, people think that the International Space Station is so far away that they're not feeling gravity, and that's not the case at all. They're absolutely feeling gravity. They're just cruising so fast that, even though they're being pulled in, they never get pulled to the surface.","178":"Yeah, you feel pinned to that. It's exactly like that. There's something called the equivalence principle where people realized, especially Einstein, that if you were in outer space in a rocket ship and it was dark and painted and it was accelerating at exactly the right rate, you actually wouldn't know if you were sitting on the floor of a building around the Earth or if you were on a rocket ship that was accelerating.","179":"Yeah. You ever had that experience where you're sitting in a train and the other one moves and for a second you're not sure if you're the one moving?","180":"That's because in some sense, you're really not. Imagine you're in this train and it's going near the speed of light relative to the platform, but it's so smooth, then you should be in a situation in which there's no meaning to your absolute motion, there's no absolute motion. So that if you throw a ball up, you might think from the outside of the platform, be confused that when gravity pulls that back down, it's gonna hit you or something, but it'll land in your palm as surely as if you were in your living room.","181":"So imagine you were an astronaut and you were floating in empty space. You can't see anything. There's no stars, there's no Earth. You can ask yourself, am I moving? There's really no way for you to tell. So you would probably conclude, well, I'm not moving. So then your friend Marina comes cruising past you, and maybe she's going thousands of kilometers a second, and you say, Marina, you're cruising at thousands of kilometers a second, you're going so fast. But she had just done the same experiment. She was just floating in space thinking, Am I moving? There's no way to know which one of you is moving and there's no meaning to the absolute motion. The only thing that's true is that you're in relative motion, that's true. You both agree you're in relative motion, and that's clear. But neither of you can say it's actually you who's moving and I'm stationary.","182":"So, let's say you and Marina are floating in space and you can't tell who's moving. Let's say you both see a flash of light. A flash of light comes from somewhere, you don't know where. So you measure the speed of light to be 300,000 kilometers per second. But here comes Marina and she's racing at the light pulse, as far as you can tell. Two cars driving towards each other seem like they're going faster towards each other than somebody who's standing still relative to one of the cars, right?","183":"So you would say, oh Marina is gonna measure a different speed of light. But she comes back and she says, No. 300,000 kilometers per second. Because from her perspective, she's standing still, and the laws of physics have better be the same for her. The speed of light is a fact of nature that's as true as the strength of gravity. And the two of you are in this quandary because if one of you is the preferred person who correctly measures the speed of light, that ruins everything about the idea of the relativity of motion. Which one of you should it be? So Einstein decides they must both measure the same speed of life. How could that possibly, possibly be the case? And he thinks, well, if speed is how far you travel, your spatial distance, in a certain amount of time, then there must be something wrong with space and time. And he goes from the constancy of the speed of light and a respect for this idea of relativity to the idea that space and time must not be the same for you and for Marina. And that's how he gets the idea of the relativity of space and time. [laughs] You have the best expression on your face. [laughs] It's pretty wild, but that is a starting point, actually, of the whole theory of relativity. That starting point leads to this complete revolution in physics where we suddenly have a Big Bang and black holes and space-time. Just from that one simple starting point. So, is your impression of gravity different than when we started the conversation?","184":"[laughs] That's exactly right. It kinda is like recharging your battery, right? And sleep is so critical for so many parts of our body and our mind, right? It plays a really important way that we learn, and it helps us kind of recover from the day before. It affects our immune system and our metabolism, all of these things that we need to kinda be healthy.","185":"And so what's really cool about this is that giraffes need to sleep like everybody else, and so the way that it does is it kind of slumps over and it gets down on its legs and it kind of becomes this ball, but what's crazy about the whole thing is they only sleep for like 30 minutes a day. 30 minutes! Because it can't waste any more time, because it can't be vulnerable for any longer. It can get eaten by lions and that kind of thing. It has kind of evolved in a way that it can still survive and still get all the restoration it needs under such a short period of time.","186":"So we think it works the same way, but maybe just like more efficiently. And so we're still really learning about how this works. Sleep science itself is kind of a new field.","187":"Really tired. Do you think you were a little crankier than usual? Yeah. That's actually really interesting, because what happens is humans and everything needs to sleep eventually, and so you can't stay up indefinitely, right? What do you think happens if you don't sleep?","188":"Right, right! So how do they do it? In the area that they live in, they need to stay cool, right? And so they spend a lot of time in the water, and so then as a consequence, they need to sleep in the water, but how do they do it? So it's really fascinating. What they do is while they're sleeping, they actually float back up to the surface and breathe without waking up. They're able to go about their whole sleep cycles but still able to breathe, because their body has adapted in a way that they can still get the oxygen that they need. It's a really amazing thing. What do you think?","189":"So now I want to talk about our last animal, and I think this one is probably the most amazing of all. Okay, so what's this?","190":"A dolphin! Yes. So dolphins, kind of like hippos, have to sleep in the water, okay? But because they're mammals, right, they need to breathe. Dolphins breathe air. They have to go up to the surface and breathe, right? And for an animal like that, it needs to figure out a way that it can sleep but also still survive, right? You know how dolphins sleep?","191":"One half of their brain at a time. So half of their brain goes to sleep, and the other half stays awake, so that they can continue to breathe and swim, and they do it in this four hours a time, so like their right part of their brain sleeps, they're able to go up to the surface and breathe. Then their left part of their brain sleeps for four hours, and it goes back and forth, back and forth, so they can kind of maintain alertness, still breathe, and survive. Is that amazing or what?","192":"Nano is kind of a funny word, right? It's a word that's used before another word, and it means one billion. What's the smallest object you can think of?","193":"A baby ant? Very good. So I have over here a meter stick, let me show it to you. And so that's a meter and if I divide it by 1000, I get a millimeter. So milli just means 1000. There's all these little lines on the ruler. And each of those little lines is one millimeter. So a baby ant is probably a couple of millimeters. So even the thing, that's the smallest thing you can think of, it's a million times bigger than a nanometer. Tiny, tiny, tiny.","194":"If I took this stick and I was to draw 1 billion lines, the distance between those two lines would be one nanometer. So that's really all it is. It's just a measure of size. But it's really, really, really tiny, smaller than anything that we can see with our eyes. The reason why, in nanotechnology, scientists, we care about things that are that small, is because there are objects called atoms. Have you ever heard of atoms before?","195":"That was a perfect explanation. But what if I told you that scientists invented a special type of microscope that not only lets you see atoms, but also lets you move them around and build things with them. Would you think that would be pretty cool?","196":"So it's called a scanning tunneling microscope. And not only can you see the atoms, but you can move them around. Atoms are kind of sticky. You can actually build things using this instrument with actual individual atoms. So if I gave you that machine, would you want to make something? Would you want to look at something very carefully?","197":"I study it because objects that are that small have really interesting properties. They behave completely different than objects that are big. And because of that, we can build really cool things with them. Like really fast computers, for example, or new types of batteries or new types of solar cells. And a lot of nanotechnology is kind of like playing with Legos. You take these small objects and you put them together to build something new. Something interesting that no one's built before. It's like Legos for scientists.","198":"You know an interesting topic is: what are the limits to what we can do with virtual reality? Where I'm pretty pleased with what we have today. What we can show people and say virtual reality, its cool. People get an amazing response from it. But we're still clearly a very, very long ways from reality.","199":"Mostly in VR we talk about the display and optics, the visual side of things, but we should at least tick off the other senses. And haptics is an interesting thing about virtual reality really doesn't have that aspect of touching things. You can move your hands around, you can do everything but its a disconnected experience because you know you don't have an actual solidity there. And I am pessimistic about progress in haptics technology. Almost all other areas I'm an optimist and I'm excited about what's coming up, but I don't have any brilliant vision about how we're going to revolutionize haptics and make it feel like we're touching the things in the virtual world.","200":"Yeah, that is one potential quality improvement that is still on the horizon is when we do spatialization, we use HRTF, the Head Relative Transfer Function, to make it sound like its in different places. But usually we just use this one kind of generic, here's your average human, HRTF function. Its possible, that of course, if you are right in the average then its perfect for you. But there's always people off to the extremes, that it doesn't do a very good job at. And there may be better ways to allow people to sample their own perfect HRTF which can improve the audio experience a lot. It all comes down to all these trade-offs.","201":"There was a huge concern about that at Oculus. And the term internally that went around was poisoning the well. They were very, very concerned. I mean for a long time there was a fight about whether gear VR should even be done, because the worry was if we let a product go out, like gear VR that didn't have those things. That if somebody saw it and it was bad, made them sick, made their eyes hurt, then they would be like I'm never going to try VR again. I tried it that time and it was terrible. And there was legitimate arguments about whether it was even a good idea to do that. And it turned out that yes, its obviously better to have all those things, but you can still do something that's valuable for the user without it. Its weird being at the beginning of a medium like this.","202":"So you can also think of a gravitational field, something that permeates all of space. Even though the earth is three stories below us, it's not as though it's pulling at us from a distance. We're actually interacting with the field at this point and there's a real interaction right here at this point. And that's nice, because people were worried that if things acted at a distance, that the way that old-fashioned inverse-square force law describes it, that it was as spooky as mind-bending a spoon, that it was like telekinesis. If you don't touch something, how do you affect it? And so the first step was to start to think of gravity as a field that permeates all of a space. And it's weaker very far from the Earth and it's closer very close to the Earth. So one way to think of this field as a field that's really describing a curved space-time that is everywhere. Forget the difficulty of the math, just the intuition comes from two kind of simple observations. One was what Einstein described as the happiest thought of his life. So, right now, you might feel heavy in your chair, and we might feel heavy on the floor and our feet, or standing in an elevator cab. And Einstein said, what does the chair have to do with it, or the floor, or the elevator? Those aren't gravitational objects. So he wanted to eliminate them, and one way to do the thought experiment is to imagine standing in an elevator that you can see out of, a black box. And imagine the cable is cut and you and the elevator begin to fall.","203":"You're in total free fall. Now, because things fall at the same rate, including the elevator and you, you can actually float in the elevator. If you just floated in the elevator, the two of you would drop, and you might not even know you're falling. You could take an apple and drop it in front of you, and it would float in front of you. You would actually experience weightlessness. It's called the equivalence principle. It was Einstein's happiest thought that what you're really doing when you're experiencing gravity isn't being heavy in your chair, it's falling weightlessly in the gravitational field. And that was the first step, to think of gravity as weightlessness and falling.","204":"You can make somebody look like they're in the International Space Station by flying up in a plane and then just free-falling, the plane just drops out of the air. And while it's falling, they will float weightlessly, and there's been a lot of experiments about it, but you don't want it to end unhappily, so the plane has to scoop back up, and then you see them become pinned to the floor of the plane, because then the plane is interrupting their fall. So that's the first thought, and then the next is, what is the shape that's chased? So if you were floating in empty space, really empty space, and you had an apple, and you threw the apple, what shape do you think it would chase, the path?","205":"Yeah, it would chase a curve, it would chase an arc. And the faster you throw it, the kind of longer the arc. So the second step to think about curved space-time is to say that when things fall freely around a body like the Earth, they trace curved paths, as though space-time itself, space itself was curved.","206":"So you described learning in a class about light the theory of special relativity where Einstein is really adhering to the constancy of the speed of light and questioning the absolute nature of space and time. And it seems like that has nothing to do with gravity, but he later begins to think about the incompatibility of gravity with his theory of relativity. So suppose the Sun were to disappear tomorrow. Some evil genius comes and just figures out a way to evaporate the Sun. In Newton's understanding of gravity, we would instantaneously know about it all the way over here at the Earth. And that's incompatible with the concept that nothing can travel faster than the speed of light. No information, not even information about the Sun, could possibly travel faster than the speed of light. So we shouldn't know about what happened to the Sun for a full eight minutes, which is the time it would take light to travel to us. And so he begins to question why gravity is so incompatible with relativity, but he already knows he's thinking about space and time in relativity. So then he gets to his general theory of relativity where he realizes if I eliminate everything but just the gravitational field of let's say the Earth and I look at how things fall and I see that they follow curves, well, then he realizes that space and time don't just contract or dilate, that they can really warp, that they can bend and that they can curve. And then he finds a way to make gravity compatible with relativity by saying if the Sun were to disappear tomorrow, the curves that the Sun imprinted in space-time would actually begin to ripple, and those are the gravitational waves, and they would change and they would flatten out, 'cause the Sun was no longer there. And that would take the light-travel time to get to us to tell us that the Sun was gone, and then we would stop orbiting and just travel along a straight line.","207":"Well I'm thinking about the idea that there might be more than three dimensions of space. What is your impression of theoretical physicists who think about things like extra dimensions of space that they haven't ever seen?","208":"It does. In fact, one way that different universes might be created and be different from each other is that different universes could have effectively different numbers of dimensions. Like we have three dimensions around us, but there's people out there, aliens, who could live in five dimensional universes.","209":"Mm-hmm. So we have quantum mechanics, right? The theory of atoms and so forth and how those work, and then we have gravity, and gravity doesn't seem to fit in. It's the one force of nature that we can't really easily fit into this quantum mechanical framework, so string theory is one of the best ideas.","210":"That's the good news. The bad news is that it only seems to work if spacetime is ten dimensional. [chuckles] So you would say well then it's wrong. It can't be right. Spacetime is not ten-dimensional. Spacetime is four dimensional. We've observed that. But instead, we say if spacetime looks four dimensional to us, but string theory, which might be the best theory we have of quantum gravity says it must be ten dimensional, maybe we can hide those extra six dimensions somehow. So here's how we could get lucky. We could imagine that there are extra dimensions of space that are curled up somehow that are so small that we can't see them. This is actually an old idea. It goes back to Kaluza and Klein right after general relativity was invented in 1915. But there's a more recent idea that says there could actually be relatively large extra dimensions. There could be extra dimensions that are actually that big, like a millimeter across that you would not have noticed. But here's the new, exciting idea. So let's imagine, okay. This is a piece of paper. But let's imagine this is our entire world. So, in other words, our real world is three dimensional, but let's imagine that we're just idealizing it down to two dimensions, so we all live here. You and I live here. But let's imagine that we're embedded in this bigger space. So there are extra dimensions that are actually big, okay? And let's imagine that. When I say we live on this three dimensional world what I mean is imagine that the particles that you and I are made of, right, the quarks, the leptons, the electrons and everything, all the forces we know about, electromagnetism, the weak nuclear force, the strong nuclear force, imagine they can't leave this surface. This is what we call a brane. B-R-A-N-E. Have you heard this word before?","211":"From membranes, you know. We have lines, one dimension. We have two dimensional surfaces. So if you have a line that is a vibrating physical thing, you call it a string, right?","212":"If you have a two dimensional surface that vibrates and is a physical thing, we call that a membrane. Membrane theory goes back, it never was as popular as string theory, but it's been around for a while. But if you had extra dimensions of space, then you can three dimensional vibrating things, and four dimensional vibrating things.","213":"Well basically the strings are the particles that we see. It's exactly the same thing as we said for the straw, if you look at it far away it looks one dimensional. A little loop of string, so a little one dimensional circle that is vibrating. If you look at it from very, very far away, it just looks like a particle. So in string theory, an electron is a little string. A photon is a little string.","214":"Yes, string theory's even better. So the phrase Grand Unified Theory was coined in the 1970s for theories that joined electricity and magnetism. So a good string theory is gravity plus the Grand Unified Theory.","215":"It's even better. It's the theory of everything. What would you tell a friend of yours if they asked you what dimensions are, what extra dimensions are, what a brane is?","216":"That's right. And we could live there. The world we see around us, the three dimensions of space around us could reflect the fact that we are somehow stuck on a three dimensional brane trying to escape.","217":"Yeah, that's exactly right. And you can append it. You can sort of add new information that's more current, but you can't actually go erase anything.","218":"We're gonna have to create entire new concepts of how they do trade and how they work with us, too. What kind of barriers or road blocks would you imagine are gonna happen in the blockchain space?","219":"Yeah. One of the problems that Bitcoin has faced is Bitcoins getting stolen or lost. But a lot of that actually comes from people trying to recentralize Bitcoin in different ways making themselves actually a pretty easy target.","220":"Because the materials are so small, they're at the nanoscale, their properties are dominated by quantum mechanics, which means that even slight changes in their size, in their orientation give profound changes in their properties. And while that's very scientifically interesting, and it allows you to tune their properties by making subtle changes, from a technology point of view, it's a bit of a headache in the sense that in technology want to optimize for a property and then repeat that over and over again. So what are some of the challenges that you face in the lab related to working with these materials and then trying to incorporate them into the batteries?","221":"That's actually, I think a very common problem. We can build a device in the lab it could be a transistor, can be a battery. And then you ask the question, okay, so what's the next step? How do we take it from that lab demonstration into a technology? The kind of work that I'm very interested in is developing tools to make the exact type of materials that you want. The tools that we've used in the past for conventional fabrication just don't work with these materials because they're all grown from the bottom up. They're intrinsically small, and you have to find ways to either use chemistry or some other means to get them to assemble into the structures that you want to actually either grow specifically what you want or after you grow them, to pull out the ones that you want. You need to be able to build that same thing over and over again, with the exact same properties. No one institution, no one research lab, no one national lab is gonna solve all of these problems on their own because they are difficult problems. And there is a real important payoff at the end. And it's gonna take all of us, making our contributions to push this field forward.","222":"The first thing I want to show you is origami in the real world. This is the origami lamp. It comes shipped flat but it folds, clip holds it together. The lamp has LEDs on the inside so when we power it up we get light, we have a lampshade and we get the base.","223":"Origami applications have in common, is that at some stage the thing is flat and so whenever you need to either start from a flat state and then take it to a 3D state, or conversely, for deployables like space, you want to have it in a fully folded flat state but then take it to a 3D state, or possibly an unfolded flat state. Whenever a flat state is involved, origami is a really effective way of making the transition between those states.","224":"New problems arise when we try to make origami out of things other than paper, but also new opportunities. An example here which is a kind of a variant of the Miura-Ori. It's got a three-dimensional structure. If I stretch it one way, it expands the other but because it has these S-bends in the pattern, if you squeeze it, it doesn't go all the way flat. This is a epoxy impregnated aramid fiber and so if I put this fold pattern into it and then compress it and then put a skin on the top and bottom, this becomes incredibly lightweight but incredibly strong.","225":"Another origami challenge that comes up with these patterns is if we're going to make an aircraft out of this thing we're going to need hundreds of yards of folded origami. We're not going to do it by hand and this might be the new frontier in origami engineering, which is the design of machines that can fold patterns that have applications.","226":"It's something we've talked about a little bit that with all the richness of behavior of origami from a flat sheet, it seems like there ought to be an equally rich world of things that don't start flat but are still made from flat sheets of paper.","227":"When we were much smaller societies, you and I could trade in our community pretty easily. As the distance in our trade grew, we ended up inventing institutions, right? If you Uber or you use Airbnb or you use Amazon even, these are just digital marketplaces and platforms that help us facilitate an exchange of value. But today, we actually have a technology that allows us to trade one to one but at scale, and it's called blockchain technology. There is some kind of interface for it. You could have an app, or you could use a computer to do it, but instead of there being a company in the middle that's helping you make that transaction, it's a bunch of software code.","228":"In some cases, yeah, it is. And a lot of people in the financial industry, in particular, are looking at it from the banking side of how do we use this technology to trade things like Bitcoin or other tokens that are easier to use instead of today's currency. A lot of people think about blockchain as Bitcoin because it's sort of in the news a lot, and it's this new cryptocurrency. And it's kind of exciting. But we're actually seeing a lot more use cases for blockchain that aren't around the currency side. They're more around, how do you take any asset and be able to trade that using this same technology.","229":"Really glad that you could join us. So we've been talking about sleep today, various levels of complexity. But now with you, I really want to talk about what do we know about sleep and the aging brain. Can you tell me a little bit about some of the work that you've been doing in that area?","230":"So within dementia risk in particular, Alzheimer's for instance, there are kind of two clear features that seem to be part of the pathology, right? So there's beta-amyloid which accumulates in the brain, and then there's kind of these tangles, this tauopathies, right? And so it sounds like sleep seems to be related to the tauopathies. What about kind of beta-amyloid?","231":"Okay, so there is this bio-directional piece, but I think perhaps the most exciting thing that happened in the sleep field, at least in my view, has been understanding the role of sleep and its clearance of beta-amyloid in the brain. This idea that sleep is kind of the dishwasher of the brain, it seems like, that you know A betta accumulates as we kind of use energy, and you know it's kind of a waste product, and the idea that if you don't clear it out, that it's going to build up and accumulate.","232":"To figure out how to do that we need to learn a little bit about what makes a point. So, let's come back to the crane. You can probably tell that the corners of the square ended up as points, right?","233":"Yeah, exactly. Actually you've discovered something pretty neat because you made your point not from a corner so you've already discovered one of the key insights. Any flap, any point, leg of the ant, takes up a circular region of paper. Here's our boundary. To make your point from an edge you use that much paper and the shape, it's almost a circle. If we take the crane we'll see if the circles are visible in the crane pattern. Here's the crane pattern, and here's a boundary of the wing, and here's the other wing.","234":"And to do that we use a new technique called circle packing in which all of the long features of the design are represented by circles. So, each leg becomes a circle, each wing becomes a circle and things that can be big and thick, like the head or the abdomen, can be points in the middle. Now we have the basic idea of how to design the pattern, we just count the number of legs we want. We want a spider, if it's got let's say eight legs, it's also got an abdomen, that's another point, and it's got a head, so maybe that's 10 points. If we find an arrangement of 10 circles we should be able to fold that into the spider. So in this book, Origami Insects II, it's one of my books and has some patterns, and this is one of them for a flying ladybug and, in fact, it is exactly this flying ladybug. We've got the crease pattern here in the circles and you might now be able to see which circles end up as which parts, knowing that the largest features like the wings are going to be the largest circles, smaller points will be smaller circles. So any thoughts which might be?","235":"Origami artists all around the world now use ideas like this to design, not just insects, but animals, and birds, and all sorts of things that are, I think, unbelievably complex and realistic but most importantly, beautiful.","236":"It's really fascinating work, especially now we're all familiar with the viruses and how they act. And I'm not aware of any viruses that build nanostructures. So how did you come to that? And then how do you actually program a virus to do your bidding?","237":"So you've evolved, and I suppose, trained these viruses to build the materials that you want them to build by exposing them to the raw materials and then evolving their function. We're talking about the electronics from nanomaterials. That critical issue that we're facing is how do you go from those single experiments with a single material, understanding its properties, how do you scale that to the billions of devices that you need in a technology? It is a chemistry driven approach. We're not going to grow them exactly where we want them, but to take that one step, and to tie into what you're doing, tt sounds like there could be an area of collaboration where instead of using conventional chemistry, that we can train some of these biological elements to do that work work for us.","238":"One of the things I love about about nanoscience is it tends to break up the silos between those traditional scientific disciplines. My training was in chemistry, but I had to very quickly merged chemistry and physics. And now I see an area where chemistry, physics, and biology are coming together to produce new materials and new technology, and to advance the field forward. And so being in this field, you kind of have to cross pollinate between these different disciplines and kind of advance the field together.","239":"Telescopes, solar arrays, they need to be packed into a rocket, go up, but then expand in a very controlled, deterministic way when they get up into space.","240":"These are the building blocks of many, many origami deployable shapes, it's called a degree-4 vertex. It's the number of lines. So in this case, we use solid lines for mountain, we use dash lines for valley. We're going to fold it and use these two to illustrate some important properties of origami mechanisms. It's important in the study of mechanisms to take into account the rigidity. So what we're going to do to help simulate rigidity is to take these rectangles and we're going to fold them over and over so that they just become stiff and rigid.","241":"So this is what's called a single degree of freedom mechanism. You have one degree of freedom, I can choose this fold, and then if these are perfectly rigid every other fold angle is fully determined. One of the key behaviors here is that with the smaller angles up here, the two folds that are the same parity and the folds that are of opposite parity move at about the same rate but with this, as we're getting closer to 90 degrees, we find they move at very different rates and then at the end of the motion, the opposite happens. This one is almost folded but this one goes through a much larger motion so the relative speeds differ.","242":"So when we start sticking together vertices like this, if they're individually single degree of freedom then we can make very large mechanisms that open and close but with just one degree of freedom. So, these are examples of a pattern called the Miura-Ori. When you stretch them out they're pretty big.","243":"Yeah, so typically the mechanism will run from corner to corner, to diagonally to opposite corners because then you can stretch it out that way. Notice some differences between the one you have and the one I have in how this one sort of opens out almost evenly but this one opens out more one way and then the other.","244":"And it's exactly the difference between the motions of these two vertices. So these angles are closer to right angles and the closer you get to a right angle the more asymmetry there is between the two directions of motion. And then the other difference is how efficiently they pack, so these started at about the same size but when they're flat notice that yours is much more compact. So if I were you making a solar array, I'd say, oh, I want that one. But if I say, well, I want them to open at the same rate, then I want this one.","245":"There's an engineering trade-off to get them both to work. And there's another place that shows up in deployable structures in a very cool structure. This is a folded tube, it sort of pops out like this but it has this neat property that if you twist it quickly, it changes color. There's a Mars Rover application where they need a sleeve that protects a drill and as the drill goes down, the sleeve is going to collapse and they're using a pattern very much like this.","246":"Yeah, or in Minecraft. When you look at a TV on the wall there showing like a picture of a mountain or something, how can you tell that its not just a window and there's something else behind it. Because it always doesn't look quite right if you have a static picture of a person on a screen and you move around like this, its not really changing. And its interesting, those are things we have to figure out We need to figure out when you look at something in reality how can you tell whether its real or not. Have you been to a 3-D movie where you put on the little glasses?","247":"So what they do, the trick for that is, if you ever at a theater and you take up the glasses and you look at it, you'll see its blurry where there's actually two pictures that they're showing at the same time. And what those little glasses do, is they let one eye see one picture, and the other eye see a different picture. So then your eyes can say, oh it looks like I'm seeing through the screen or something is floating out in front of it. In the VR headsets, what we do is, there's actually either two screens or one screen split in half, so that it draws a different picture, completely different picture, for each eye. And we make sure that each eye can only see the picture it intended to. And that's what can make things feel like they got this real depth to them, that its something that you could reach out and touch and it doesn't feel like a flat TV screen.","248":"Essentially what harmony is, is like a language, right? And so as with any language, the more words you're capable of speaking in a language, the more you can say. All right, so in harmony, this might be how many notes you can think to add to a chord to make it feel a different way. Have you ever heard of the circle of fifths?","249":"Okay, that's great. On one side, we have a lot of the notes which make us feel brighter, you know, like these kinds of, (keyboard music) these really bright sounds. And the other side is a lot more to do with the darkness of a key center. So we're home in F, but imagine we're taking a quick visit to B-flat, but then the sun comes out.","250":"You got it. Ooh! Yeah? Yeah, yeah. So this is really, this is like a gleaming glade or something, you know? Let's play this tune, Amazing Grace. Let's play it in its simplest form.","251":"Just to see how things feel. Yeah. All right, lets do it. (both playing Amazing Grace) So it's F major seven, but its over A. Which is F seven over A. (both playing) B flat major seven with an A and a G in it. F major seven with an E and a D and a G, yeah. (laughter) D minor seven with a G in it. C softs, or minor, nice. B flat major. G seven, F sharp major seven. Home, yeah! I like that. So what harmony does is just gives us even more tools to tell those stories. Cool, yeah. Nice, man.","252":"Oh, very good. You've come to the right place. So we're gonna think about physics. Have you heard the word physics before? Do you know what that is?","253":"And how would you find yourself, like if someone said where are you, could you use some words or ideas to say where you are on that line?","254":"But here's what I want you to think about. If I say I'm at this point on the line, I could translate that into saying I'm at the three centimeter point, if I were here I'd be at the four centimeter point, the five centimeter point, right?","255":"We need one number to tell you where we are. That's one dimension. That's what it means to be one dimensional. I only need to tell you one number to figure out where we are.","256":"There you go. Exactly. We're gonna build a little two dimensional space. You wanna do it? You wanna do the honors here? Why don't you put those two lines together?","257":"So those are the dimensions. That's how we think about dimensions. Remember, we just needed one number to find ourselves on the line, we need two numbers to find ourselves on the plane.","258":"This is why physicists think about things we don't know about. We're wondering whether there could be extra dimensions you've never seen. Yeah. That are tinier than atoms. So, okay. So what have you learned? What do you know about dimensions now? How do you think about dimensions in a slightly different way than you did before?","259":"I think so. I think you're right. All right Hank, we want you to keep up studying, learn a lot of math and physics and help us discover new dimensions some day. Does that sound like a fun idea?","260":"Absolutely. And that's a great example because you have models that are operating to do things like figure out if a new email is spam or not. So what would you think about if you were looking at an email and trying to decide if it went in one category or another?","261":"So these are things we would call features. And we go through a process where we do feature engineering, where somebody looks at the example and says, Okay, these are the things that I think might allow us to statistically tell the difference from something in one category versus another. So for example, perhaps you don't speak Russian, you start getting a lot of email in Russian.","262":"This is a great question because it really gets to the difference between some of our different tools in our machine learning tool belt in addressing problems like this. So if we were to use a supervised learning classic classification approach, a person would need to think about those features and creatively come up with them in approach we call the kitchen sink approach, which is just try everything you can possibly think of and see what works. Unsupervised learning, where we don't have labeled data and we're trying to infer some structure out of the data is you're projecting that data into a space and looking for things like clusters. And there's a bunch of really fun math about how you do that, how you think about distance and by distance, I mean that if we have two data points in space, how do we decide if they're similar or not?","263":"Supervised learning, we have our labels and we're trying to figure out what statistically indicates if something matches one label or another label. Unsupervised learning, we don't necessarily have those labels. That's the thing we're trying to discover. So reinforcement learning is another technique that we use sometimes. You can think about it like a turn in a game and you can play, you know, millions and millions of trials so that you're able to develop a system that by experimenting with reinforcement learning can eventually learn to play these games pretty successfully. Deep learning, which is essentially using neural networks and very large amounts of data to eventually iterate on a network structure that can make predictions.","264":"It is, but it also thrives in environments where you have a decision point, a pallet of actions to choose from. And it actually comes historically from trying to train a robot to navigate a room. If it bonks into this chair, it can't go forward anymore. And if it falls into that pit, you know, it's not going to succeed. But if it keeps exploring, it'll eventually get to the goal.","265":"So typically, you would choose deep learning if you have sufficient high quality data, hopefully labeled in a useful way. If you really are happy not to necessarily understand or be able to interpret what your system is doing or you're willing to invest in another set of work afterwards to understand what the system is doing once you've already trained it. And this also comes down to the fact that some things are actually really easy to solve with linear regression or simple statistical approaches. And some things are impossible.","266":"You build a system that could actually be useless. So years ago, I had a client that was a big telecom company and they had a data scientist who built a deep learning system to predict customer churn. It actually was very accurate, but it wasn't useful because nobody knew why the prediction was what it was. So they could say, you know, Sunny, you're likely to quit next month. But they had no idea what to do about it. And so, I think there are a bunch of failure modes.","267":"Yeah. This is actually a good example of a very real world kind of machine learning problem where the solution to this was to build an interpretable system on top of the accurate predictions not to throw it away, but to do a bunch more work to figure out the why.","268":"It's actually fairly new that we're able to solve all of these problems and start to build these products and apply it in businesses and apply it, you know, everywhere. And so, we're still developing good practices and what it means to be a professional in machine learning. We're really developing a notion of what good looks like.","269":"Sometimes when people get, they worry about connectomics, I think what they're actually worrying about is that it's the end of the that we used to do neuroscience.","270":"So and a musician, how much of it do you think is in your hands versus in your brains? Meaning like, you do have connections in your muscles from the nerves that are from your spinal cord, what if some of the learning is there?","271":"Yeah. We do a lot of X-ray in addition to EM and this is actually, I'm not saying it's the only problem, but it's the only problem that needs to be solved right away, is that the data analysis, right? In fact, I think we calculated that there aren't enough humans ever to map a mouse brain where you collect every connection and et cetera so the problem is to get algorithms to trace, to recognize things in brains the way humans would recognize things in brains, or map things, trace things in brains. It's gonna cost a lot of money to imagine setting the gold standard for the wiring diagram even once and those are the kinds of ethical concerns that I'm worried about.","272":"Good to see you Mike, nice to have you here with me. So we go way back. 1991, the year I got married, I moved across the country, left my husband in New Jersey, to work with you in Livermore.","273":"And I've been talking sort of, started with sort of what is a laser through linear optics, non linear optics, high intensity laser physics, and saying that you know, we're trying to get to that Schwinger limit of 10 to the 29 watts per square centimeter. We're about somewhere just shy of 10 to the 23 I think at this point. But even if we get to 100 petawatts and focus that down to a wavelength, we're not at 10 to the 29. So you're hoping to build the biggest laser.","274":"Okay, but that's kind of cheating. That's not getting to 10 to the 29. If you could do it with 100% efficiency that's all we need.","275":"And that's, like you said, we're stuck a little bit, we're not up to that kind of acceleration, so that would be a Nobel Prize winning possible idea.","276":"And right across the beam. Don't you think that's gonna be the challenge? 'Cos it's not like our beams are as perfect as we like to think they are.","277":"Okay so there's a lot of us working around the world on these high intensity lasers and so, what do you think the real fun is? What do you see the real excitement being?","278":"So where people are swiping credit cards, those credit card numbers were stolen. They hired a company to come in and perform a penetration test to see, can the good guys essentially break in again to prevent this sort of thing in the future? And when this team came in, they found they actually were able to get pretty much to the same point of sale system, and the way they did that was by exploiting an internet-connected deli meat scale. Once the company was able to essentially get into the deli scale, because the deli scale was on the internal network, then they were able to really escalate privilege and find a vulnerability within another system. Essentially, that just got them into the network. and once you're in the network, it's often really easy to then escalate from there.","279":"Yeah, that's another interesting concept. It's really just different layers that we have for protection, because often when you're talking about something like a corporate network, or even your home network, you typically have sort of one level of defense, right? If someone can break that or it can get in through some other system that is connected or exposes some other protocol, like Bluetooth, right? You can connect to a Bluetooth device without being on the wireless network, without being on the LAN. That potentially gives you another place that you can pivot on and then access other devices, because if something has both Bluetooth and also Wi-Fi, well, if you can get in through Bluetooth, then you can then access the Wi-Fi and get to other devices on the network. Are you familiar with buffer overflows?","280":"But what's really cool about that is, when you're going into memory, you're starting to cross over that boundary of that hundred byte allocation, and now you're starting to write over additional memory. That other memory is really important stuff. So you have your name, the hundred bytes there, and then right next to your name is the return address, and that's the address that the code is gonna execute and it's going to return to after that function is done, and it's going to jump to that address, but after you type your hundred bytes, the next few bites that you type, you're actually going to overwrite that return address. So that return address could essentially be another address in memory. So what you end up doing is you type a name and it's not really a name, it's really just code. And that code, you keep typing until you get to the return address, and you start typing an address, which is really the beginning of your name and your computer or your processor is actually going to read that address and it will jump back to the beginning and then execute that payload. So that was sort of the very first thing that I think was super exciting to me when I started learning about really reverse engineering.","281":"Ever since buffer overflow started many years ago, there been a lot of protection mechanisms built to make it difficult to exploit. More and more, we're actually using smaller and smaller computers with smaller amounts of compute power. If you take a car, you have hundreds of microcontrollers that are all running there. So they don't really have a sophisticated operating system that can try to prevent attacks like buffer overflows. So how do we keep these low cost computers in here while adding layers of protection to prevent malice and these types of attacks? Sometimes it actually is, how can we write software or how can we build a system that prevents these types of attacks from entering? But oftentimes, it's really looking for how can we find new attacks that we haven't even necessarily thought of? What got you interested in computer science and information security?","282":"You brought up China and Iran, and something that's interesting about those areas is really censorship, right? They have essentially censored internet. In the US, we have a really interesting internal struggle here where we actually have government agencies like the state department that are funding software to evade censorship, like Tor and other mechanisms. While then we also have an internal struggle where we have other organizations like the NSA who are specifically looking to break that exact same system that the US government is also funding.","283":"It's good for us to understand how these systems can really break down. Although, I think one thing that I see is that some of, let's say, the organizations that are looking to break this are not necessarily going to share once they actually learn that information. They might actually sort of hold that in their back pocket and use it when it's advantageous to them.","284":"You haven't got to play with lasers. So I brought one. It's my friend's cat toy. Do you ever use a laser as a cat toy?","285":"That's true, that laser's just a dot. And so the other thing to notice though is that, like if I shine it in your eyes and I'm sorry if I do! But it seems awfully bright doesn't it? And yet when, you know, you shine this down and you put the laser, which one do you see easier?","286":"One of the things that lasers are great for is that because it's a directed beam, we can actually put that light where we want the light to go and sometimes you maybe just want to see something around the corner and you can't see it. But with a laser, you can actually and this is a smoky one so you can actually watch it go. You see it actually bending the corner?","287":"And that's because the light will go through this glass and, when it hits that corner, it has to bend. And we actually send laser beams down glass fibers, the size of your hair.","288":"So this is just a demonstration. If you have a laser like this, it actually bends and comes out, I'm gonna point it to you and you'll see it coming out the other end. It hits these walls, it has to go around and come out the other side. You wanna play? So is this the first time you've seen a laser or have you gotten to play with lasers somewhere else?","289":"That's a laser. We cut steel with them now. We actually do surgery with lasers. You know when some people have either scars or birth marks that they don't want to see? We can actually remove those with lasers now. Never seen a laser light show? When they light up the sky with lasers, it's almost like fireworks.","290":"Oh you got to see a shooting star? Well that's cool, that's nature giving you the show there. So what do you think about lasers? You think they're fun?","291":"So the side channel analysis is really looking not at a vulnerability within a system, but really unintended consequences of what the system is built on. A very simple example of a side channel is putting your ear to the ground to hear if there are horses coming towards you, and the same thing applies to technology. So you can have something like a CPU, it's executing instructions, certain instructions that use a little bit more power, and power is reserved in these capacitors, which are like tiny batteries next to your CPU. And as they're pulling power, there's something in physics called the electrostrictive effect where the capacitor will move in a very, very tiny amount. And then although we can't hear it, the microphone on a mobile device can actually listen to that. If you then listen to that and you say, oh, I see a pattern here, and you can go all the way down and then extract and reveal the full password, the full key, even though it could be argued that the algorithm itself, there's no problem with it.","292":"Yeah, I suppose the physical adjacency of the underlying transistors and capacitors that are holding that storage. That's crazy. I think the first time I heard of an interesting attack like that was learning about the cold boot attack. Being able to, you know, someone enters their password on their computer and that decrypts their hard drive and then they walk away. Being able to extract that password is really difficult. If I can pull that memory chip out and extract that memory, put it in my own device, except the problem is memory is volatile, so it'll erase as soon as I pull it out. You can take something like canned air, turn it upside down, cool that computer, make it real nice and cool. Then you have a minute or two to pull out the memory, put into your own device, extract the memory, and then you're good. It's such a simple method to really extract something kind of critical. Like Rowhammer, it's such a low level of vulnerability and you could argue that it's not necessarily a vulnerability in the architecture itself, but rather exploitation of physics at that point.","293":"What if it were illegal? Would you then do it? Fortunately it's not today, right? It hasn't been, you know, despite their attempts, none of that has been passed, but if you had a vehicle and you wanted to inspect it, but all of a sudden, it passed, I mean.","294":"So what if I told you that blockchain technology is basically a tool where you can do the exact same thing, but it goes to you and I directly? You wouldn't need an eBay or a brand in between.","295":"We have a lot of companies that sort of help us make sure that our trades happen, but if we could guarantee the same trade using technology as sort of a technological trust, then we wouldn't really need all those middlemen in between.","296":"It's basically a network of computers that all have the same history of transactions. And so instead of sort of there being one company with one database that holds all the information, the same sort of list is held by all these different people. Like, you could have it on your computer. And then it gets validated by everyone, and basically, that turns into the next part of the list. So it's sort of constantly updating itself.","297":"So it's kinda this like really big ledger or accounting system for all sorts of things that get traded, but instead of being owned by one company, it's owned by everybody.","298":"Excellent. I got an engineering physics degree. There you go, something in common. We're here today talking about lasers. So have you have had much exposure to lasers yet at school?","299":"Okay. As opposed to the experimental side and seeing things? Okay so I'm much more, I like to see the things happening. So then the question is, what's so special about making a light that's intense enough to actually possibly blow things up? Certainly we can blow atoms up with the laser hammer and when the laser light comes in and just smacks the electrons right off the atom. And so the question really is how do you make that? Back in the 70s and into the 80s, I know that was a long time ago for you, we had big energy lasers and we had short pulse lasers, we couldn't have big energy, short pulse lasers and actually it was my supervisor and I that figured the way around that and we got something called chirped pulse amplification. Have you heard of chirped pulse amplification by any chance?","300":"Well I brought a little bit of a prop to explain how chirped pulse amplification works. Our short pulses are made of different colors. So I've got a colored slinky here. We probably could've called it stretched pulse amplification but that's kind of boring so we used the word chirped. The word chirped comes around because birds chirp. When the birds are singing, the notes are actually changing audio frequency with time and that's a chirp. The point is is that when all the light is squeezed together like this, it's a short pulse. And that's when it's a hammer because all of the light is now concentrated and you can imagine if this was coming along and also using a lens to focus it small, then all of that light at the focal spot, concentrate. And so that was the laser hammer. So we can't have that in the laser. So the question is what could we do? The fact that it's different colors and different colors because of dispersion, travel different speeds inside material. So we used a long fiber, 1.4 kilometers of fiber but, in fiber, the red colors really haven't got that much in common with the glass atoms and so they spend very little time interacting and they travel fast. The red is going to start traveling faster than the green, faster than the blue and, as you travel down the fiber, next thing you know, you have a long pulse and it's chirped from red at the beginning to blue at the back. And so the frequencies go hoo! Like this okay? So this is a chirped pulse and now it's a long pulse. And so, first this is what we did, we chirped it, we stretched it, then we can safely amplify it because it's not all concentrated and, after we amplify it, then we use something called a compressor and we put all of the colors back together and it was back being a short pulse but a high energy pulse. And then we really had what I like to call a laser hammer. When this laser pulse goes inside, it smacks those electrons right off the atom.","301":"Well a lot of lasers and when lasers first came along, they were only single color. Your cat toy, would only be a single color, probably a red one and so that's just one color. And one color means that it has to really be there for the whole time. One color is one wave length of light and so it's just one wave that goes on and on and on. If you want a short pulse, you actually have to have all the colors. And if you can imagine that one point in time, and I like to say it's like a conductor of an orchestra. When you're listening to an orchestra warm up, they sound terrible, they're all playing their own notes. But when the conductor conducts them, they all play different notes but, together, it's beautiful music. So we have something in the laser called a mode locker and it's like the conductor and it says go now. And all the colors will start together but some colors are long wave length and others are shorter. So next thing you know, you have peaks meeting valleys and they cancel each other. And the more colors you can bring in, the faster that happens and the shorter the pulse you can make.","302":"The necklace is something that was designed for my Nobel prize. It's sold at the Nobel museum and it is a chirped pulse. So we've been talking a lot about lasers and applications, what have you learned about chirped pulses?","303":"Because I can delay the gratification of going home. First of all, just by using inversions, even before we add the notes to the chord. One thing that I was very joyful to discover is that every single melody note works with every single base note.","304":"F major, F minor, D flat major seven G flat diminished, G flat minor major seven, G minor seven, G soft, G seven, G seven sharp 11. And then, G seven with a flat 13","305":"That's it! (laughs) A flat soft, A flat major seven. A flat major seven sharp five, with a sharp 11. Essentially, what that demonstrates is that every note and every base note are compatible. So once we realize this its like, that's great! Now what should we do? What, how, what should we, what should we, how, what am I supposed to do? What to do, right. And sometimes the paralyzing thing when it comes to arranging, there are too many options, too many things are possible. So that's when it becomes super, super important to be aware of what you wanna try and say emotionally.","306":"So essentially, the way I'd apply negative harmony would be this idea of polarity, you know, between the overtone series and the undertone series, or you know, the one side and the other side. The perfect and the play goal. The feeling of a minor perfect-- (keyboard music) Resolving, it's so moving, you know? And it's a good alternative to something like, (keyboard music)","307":"Exactly, yeah. No, for sure. And, you know, F major can be something you arrive in from, if you arrive in F major from D flat, then it's like the sun's come up.","308":"So, there's a lot about context, I think. Once you have a language, it's about using it and applying it in those emotional ways. I think that's what makes the difference.","309":"That's good, that's a great place to start. There are cells in your brain. Those brain cells are connected by wires to each other. Electricity travels down those wires and communicates from one part of the brain to the other part of the brain, and each of those brain cells makes, you know, a thousand connections, it's something like a hundred trillion connections.","310":"I would say that that map also has your feelings in it because, here's why, your feelings, most neuroscientists think, come from your brain anyway, and amazingly, whether when you feel happy or sad or angry or scared, that's just brain cells communicating with each other.","311":"This is where it gets really crazy. Could we simulate that map inside a computer and would that computer then be thinking like that original brain from which we made the map?","312":"Huh. It would be like if you simulated a hurricane. Imagine we could keep track of every variable of a hurricane. Ever. Wind speed, every water molecule, et cetera, et cetera. Temperature. And we put that inside a super-fast computer and we simulated it, right? I don't think anyone would think that the inside of the computer would get wet. Even though we had simulated the hurricane perfectly, that wetness is consciousness, it's what we are. Is it ethical to imagine mapping a male brain versus a female brain to look for differences between those, to explain alleged behavioral differences between them?","313":"Like how can that possibly be? What I wanna do is prove to you that I know this combination without revealing the combination to you. And what you could do is you could write a little note, a secret that I definitely wouldn't know. Fold it up, stick it in here. And then, if I know the combination, I should be able to open it and tell you what you wrote. All right. There we go. All right. So,My dog is named Doug. Did you figure out what the combination was?","314":"So you're asking like, why shouldn't I just share my secrets with somebody? People don't trust each other. And if I was able to prove that I've done something correctly to someone without having to reveal my secrets, then that person would trust me more.","315":"What would you guys do? You'd probably first get together and like, figure out some secret code, right? And then like, write messages to each other in that code. But what if you've never met the person before? What if you wanna exchange secret messages with me and we've never met each other before? How could we possibly do that?","316":"But it's not. You wouldn't use like, a physical lock, or a physical box. We would instead use mathematics to do these kinds of things. You could take a message and encrypt it using mathematics. And then, I could prove to you that I know the key, I could open it up, and send it back to you. That way I would be proving to you that I know the mathematical key to the mathematical lockbox. So based on what we've discussed today, in your own words, what is a zero-knowledge proof.","317":"I've got one too. I was nine and we were at the science expo in San Francisco. Two scientists were dissecting an eye, a cow's eye. And I was like that is the coolest thing I've ever seen. And something about that that carried me forward. Something happened so long ago, it left some long lasting trace through neural circuits and it continues to shape the decisions we make about what to study and what to do.","318":"So we're interested in the idea that memory is kind of a pervasive force that shapes all our behaviors. And we're trying to understand how different kinds of memory are organized in different structures of the brain. And then to understand how those different structures work together to orchestrate complex cognitive behaviors like decision-making or reasoning and thinking.","319":"Yeah, you know things are kind of breaking down in unexpected ways I'd say. I think there's been a lot of really great work out of multiple labs showing hippocampal activity related to behaviors that don't look anything like episodic memories, but which might depend on episodic memories right? So for example also when you're making a decision about how to choose between two good options that suddenly you might see activity in the hippocampus related to the choice itself, others have found that you find activity in the hippocampus not only when people are forming memories, but also when they're imagining events that are gonna happen in the future. So it kind of forced us to rethink the way we define what the hippocampus might be doing in a way that can account for creating memories, thinking about the future, making decisions and other kinds of behaviors that involve what we would refer to you in the field as relational processing. And that raises all kinds of new questions about what memory really is. Reminiscing about our early influences that made us want to be scientists is that, you know, of course we know, we know better than to think that those are necessarily accurate memories. You know this reminds me of sort of the classic example from literature when people talk about memory of course is Marcel Proust's Madeleine in Remembrance of Things Past. Where in the book it's this taste for the, for the protagonist this taste of the crumbs of the Madeleine cookie and the tea that bring him back to his childhood. You know, seven volumes then emerge of memories of, of that childhood. Digging further into earlier drafts of Proust's novel that initially it didn't describe a Madeleine at all.","320":"I love math for the same reason. Today, I'm gonna tell you about a thing called zero-knowledge proof. So in a zero-knowledge proof, there are two people. There's a prover and a verifier. And I wanna prove that something is true to you. But the weird thing is, I wanna prove to you that it's true without telling you any reasons why. I remember when I first heard about it, I was like, wait, what? How can that possibly be? Right?","321":"But what if I could prove to you that I know where the puffin is without revealing to you where it is? Let me show you. I took that photo that we showed you. And I put it behind this poster here. Why don't you go take a look through that hole?","322":"So when you look at this board, we don't know where the photo was, right? Was the photo like with the corner here? In which case the puffin would be all the way at this side. Or was the photo with the corner here? In which case the puffin would be on the other side. So this is a really simple example of a zero-knowledge proof. I convinced you that I knew where the puffin was, but you didn't learn anything else.","323":"When I first learned about them, I just thought they were so cool. But it turns out they're also really useful, not just for finding like, puffins. If you just type in your password and the hacker hacks into the computer, they can just get your password. Right?","324":"Because then even if the hacker hacked into the computer, he wouldn't learn anything. Because even the computer doesn't learn anything. So Chelsea, in your own words, what is a zero-knowledge proof?","325":"Yeah, that's absolutely right. So infinity gets used a lot of different ways in mathematics. There's a way that mathematicians think of infinity as a number, just like the number 13, just like the number 10 million. So the reason that mathematicians consider infinity to be a number is that it is a size of a set. So the first example of an infinite set in mathematics is the set of all counting numbers. So one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, et cetera. That list goes on forever. That is an infinite set. And to be a little bit more precise, it's a countably infinite set. But as a number, infinity is pretty strange.","326":"Room number one. Exactly. I'm gonna use this symbol for infinity, but what we've just shown is that one, the one new guest plus infinity is equal to the same infinity. What happens if we had a second guest?","327":"They can't live together. That would be a great solution. I don't know. I think these people don't really get along. So I need to somehow create infinitely many new rooms, but I can only ask each person in the hotel to move a finite distance away. So let's take the guest who is originally in room one and move them into room two. So that's creating one new space for us. And I'm gonna take the guest who was originally in room two and move them into room four. Are you starting to see a pattern here?","328":"Yeah, I'm increasing by one more each time. So I'm doubling the room number in fact. So this is some of the strange arithmetic of infinity. So we have two Hilbert Hotels, each of which have infinitely many guests, then this is equal to?","329":"So when I'm teaching calculus and talking about concepts like limits and derivatives, those are only defined precisely with infinity. Teaching algebra, which is meant in a different sense about number systems, we deal with infinite families of numbers in their operations. Infinite sets are somehow very exotic. They're not found so commonly in their real world, but they're all over mathematics.","330":"It describes something in AI, which is that things that are really intuitive and easy for humans, are actually really difficult to build into AI systems. And on the flip side, picking up an object, really simple for people, but it's actually really difficult to build that into robotic systems. So do you have any experience working with robots or other AI systems?","331":"So you can think of robotics as having two core components. One is perception, being able to see and feel and so forth, and action, where the robot actually figures out how to move its arm. And both components are really essential, and both components are quite difficult. If you train a perception system independently of how to choose actions, then it might make errors in a way that mess up the system that selects actions And so if you instead try to train these two systems together, to have it learn perception action for the goal of solving these different tasks, then the robot can be more successful. One thing that's really difficult about robotics is, there actually isn't that much data of robots in the world. On the internet, there's all sorts of text data, all sorts of image data that people upload and write. But there isn't a lot of data of doing a simple thing, like tying your shoe, for example, because it's so basic. One challenge is even just getting data sets that allow us to teach robots to do these simple kinds of tasks.","332":"That's a great question. I think we should be able to accelerate the data collection process by having robots collect more data autonomously on their own. And by doing that, we might be able to overcome some of the challenges of Moravec's paradox.","333":"Deep learning is a common toolbox for addressing some of these challenges, because it allows us to leverage large data sets. And so, deep learning is basically, corresponds to methods for training these artificial neural networks. Another common method that comes up is reinforcement learning. A third kind of algorithm is meta learning algorithms. And these algorithms learn not just from the most recent experience on the current task, but leverage experience from other task in the past. And they're not just completely separate. We can combine the aspects of these algorithms into a single method that gets the benefits of each of them.","334":"Totally, now, as a little experiment, take your piece of paper and just crumple it into a ball. So what is it? Is the paper three dimensional or is it two dimensional?","335":"So it's not quite as solid as the apple, but it's also not quite as two dimensional as the original sheet of paper. And so for this reason, people associate this crumpled ball with a fractal dimension, maybe something like 2.5 dimensions instead of two or three, there are a lot of different definitions, precise definitions of fractal dimension. But I think the one that's easiest to understand is this thing called box counting dimension. You have, let's say an image and you want to decide what's the fractal dimension of this image. So what you're gonna do is you're gonna count the number of boxes, or you can imagine big pixels of this image that cover the boundary of this shape. And you're gonna see how does that counting compare with how the counts work for just an ordinary shape? So, so if I have a straight line and I start out with one big box that covers the whole line, and now I shrink my boxes by a factor of two, I just make boxes half as big. How many boxes will I need to cover that line?","336":"But if you take a more interesting shape, some kind of fractal shape, like let's say the coastline of great Britain and you start doing this box, counting experiment, something really interesting happens as you make these boxes smaller, the number of boxes you need to cover the coastline grows faster than it would for just a straight line.","337":"And so what this box counting is getting at is saying, well, I still can never decide what the length of the coastline is, but what I can do is I can see how quick does the number of boxes grow relative to how it would grow just for an ordinary one dimensional curve, like a line or a circle.","338":"So procedural computer graphics, which kind of came out of thinking about fractals is one answer to this question about how do you add more detail without for instance, consuming tons of memory or requiring artists to paint ultra detail the textures. So if, if you can instead describe at least some aspect of what you're looking at in a procedural or recursive way, then you can add as much detail as you need when you get close to objects.","339":"Yeah like perlin noise is a great example, right? Perlin noise was one of the early ways of synthesizing additional texture at any level of detail that you needed to make things look natural and realistic.","340":"Yeah like perlin noise is a great example, right? Perlin noise was one of the early ways of synthesizing additional texture at any level of detail that you needed to make things look natural and realistic. I have a, a random question. Do you know how the research into fractals began? You can look pretty far back in history to see kind of glimmers of this idea of fractals in science in the 19th century, people were trying to look for examples of things in mathematics that were very unnatural. So there was, for instance, this guy named Georg Cantor, who was showing that you can have these sets with really strange properties, or you can have functions with really strange properties. This thing called the devil staircase and so on. And it wasn't until about a century later where someone named Mendel Brock said, Oh, actually this strange mathematics that was meant to show how unnatural things can happen is actually a perfect description of things that really do happen in nature. And from there, people really ran with it and said, Oh, okay, well, if these fractal descriptions are good for nature, we can also use that for creating really realistic and believable pictures in computer graphics.","341":"It's still pretty easy, right? It turns out that stacking these two cups, it's actually really hard for robots to do that. So, let's think about how we might have a robot stack these two cups. You could program the robot to move its hand right here and then program the robot to close its hand around the cup.","342":"Exactly, right? That seemed pretty simple for the robot to do. Say we even just move the cup over here. Do you think the robot would still be able to stack the cups?","343":"Exactly. So, Moravec's paradox is something that means that these really simple things, like stacking cups, is really, really hard for robots, even though it's really easy for us. While robots are actually really good at really complicated and really difficult things. Think about the task of multiplying two really big numbers together.","344":"this really specific combination of zeros and ones everything that your computer does showing you pink panther videos on youtube calculating things searching the internet it does all of that with a really specific combination of zeros and ones which is crazy right that would be like saying your computer only understands these quarters for each quarter you need to tell it that you're going to use heads tails and you assign it heads or tails so i can switch between heads and tails and i can switch the zeros and ones in my computer so that it represents what i wanted to represent like an a and with quantum computers we have new rules we get to use too we can actually spin one of our quarters so it doesn't have to choose just one or the other","345":"yeah they can especially if doing your homework involves calculating something or finding information but what if your homework was to discover something totally new a lot of those discovery questions are much harder to solve using the computers we have today so the reason we're building these kinds of computers is because we think that maybe one day they're going to do a lot of really important things like help us understand nature better maybe help us create new medicines to help people","346":"What you're basically asking is, wait, what? Right? Right. So this is what makes zero-knowledge proof so fascinating, and so counter-intuitive. And I think the best way I can explain it to you is by means of an example. But before we do that, I have to decide what I'm gonna prove to you in a, with a zero-knowledge proof.","347":"And the way we're gonna approach this is through something called NP-completeness. What an NP-complete problem is, it's a problem that's really hard to solve. But if you can solve it, you can solve any problem that's in the class NP. And that includes a vast number of problems. And what we're gonna do is we're gonna use an NP-complete problem to actually prove an incredible variety of statements through a zero-knowledge proof. And the specific Np-complete problem that we're gonna be looking at is called map three-coloring. Okay, so here we have a map. Okay. And these are a bunch of countries. And we've arranged them so that no countries that have the same color share a border. That's what makes a map like this validly colored. And now you might think, well, why should we care? It turns out that whether or not a map can be three-colored in this way is an example of an NP-complete problem. And it turns out that, you know, maybe what you really wanna do, is you wanna give a zero-knowledge proof that you have at least 0.3 Bitcoins, right? That would be cool.","348":"Without revealing what the address is of your account. It turns out I can take that statement that I have at least 0.2 Bitcoins, and convert it into a map of countries. And that map of countries will be three-colorable like this only if you have at least 0.2 Bitcoins.","349":"Of course, the first step is we have to erase all the colors. What I've done is I've put a color inside each of these envelopes. Now, how do you know that it's a valid coloring? You don't. Right? You have to pick any two neighboring countries. You can pick them however you like. At random.","350":"Right? So you have a little bit of confidence, right, that I have managed to color this correctly. but not that much confidence. 'Cause I've only shown you two of the countries.","351":"Right? So now, of course, one way to get more confidence is to open up more of them for you, but that would be revealing information to you. I don't wanna do that. So instead, I'm gonna ask you to please turn around. And now, let's change up these colors. Can you pick two countries at random and we'll reveal two of the colors again.","352":"But as you'll see, now it's not green, it's blue. And this one on the other hand, is green. Okay. The colors I showed you last time, don't work with these new colors, right? This wouldn't have worked before.","353":"Exactly. Right. But it works for this coloring that I'm showing you right now. So what we've done is we've made it impossible for you to put the pieces together. And if you do this, let's say, a thousand times. And if I correctly showed you different colors, each thousand times, you'd be really convinced. And that's it. That's the entire zero-knowledge proof.","354":"It's not about making something more efficient. It's about doing things that we just didn't know how to do before. I can actually prove to you without revealing to you any of my secrets that I use to behave honestly. Right? I could prove to you that I signed some encrypted document correctly. Right? Without revealing to you what that secret document was. That ability to change the game. Like, really just change what we can do is what zero-knowledge brings to the table.","355":"I'll grant you that Hilbert's Hotel does not exist. For me, infinite objects absolutely exist. And I can't read the thoughts in your head, but I have a high degree of confidence that we have a lot of the same ideas about infinity.","356":"I mean I think that's another common misconception about mathematics is that it's so far removed from the humanities, for instance. I mean it's hard to ignore some of these philosophical questions, particularly when we're talking about certain things like infinity. And I think one of the most difficult things to really be precise about and to explain to students is the continuum hypothesis. What do you say to students about the continuum hypothesis?","357":"So what's so fascinating about the continuum hypothesis, if you take a subset of the real line that's infinite, does it necessarily have either the cardinality of the naturals or the cardinality of continuum, or is there some sort of third possibility? What's very surprising is the continuum hypothesis has been completely resolved in the sense that we now know for absolute certain that we will never know whether it's true or false. So this is a little bit confusing. The standard foundational axioms of mathematics that we take for granted are completely insufficient to prove the continuum hypothesis one way or the other. Mathematicians among other things have been very clear about exactly what they're taking as an assumption and exactly what they're concluding from it. So mathematical practice is to be exact transparent about the hypotheses you need to prove your theorem. So now I think of a proof of a theorem more like constructing a function where the domain of that function is all of the hypotheses that I'm assuming and then the target of that function is maybe a particular element in some universe that is the modularized space of the statement that I'm trying to prove or something like this. If the foundations were to change, if set theory were replaced by something else, maybe dependent type theory, do you think the theorem you've proven would still be true?","358":"When you were telling me about the sandbox, it felt like you didn't have to make that guess, that you could just see the sandbox in your eyes. I asked you about the towel. It doesn't come to mind immediately, but you can stop and think about it and kind of make a good guess because there are things you know about the world. And for those of us who study memory that's a really strong hint as to how memory works. And so for you your memory kept all the fun stuff and all the stuff that was important to you, but the details like did you have to have a ticket to get in or how you got there, all these other less interesting, less exciting aspects, your brain kind of decided letting go of all that information.","359":"Yeah, that's a great insight. Basically we can't remember everything. So when you tell us this memory of that vacation and your brain is able to kind of play almost this movie of a memory, a moment, a day that you had in your life a while ago, where do those memories come from?","360":"The hippocampus is a part of your brain that if you kind of took it out and looked at it, it looks a lot like a seahorse and it plays a really important role in creating those kinds of memories that help you two years after your vacation share with me what happened that day, all these details of that day. There's another part of the brain. It's actually also important for memory and it's called the amygdala and it is important for keeping all the kind of emotional processing going for memory. So memory for things that are really scary, it's gonna talk to the hippocampus now and get that memory to be really strong. Why do you think it might be important to remember scary things?","361":"You got it. And so we don't just remember everything and we don't remember random things. We remember the things that matter to us the most. So Abigail based on our conversation today, can you tell me what is a memory?","362":"Right? Yeah. So that's already a really good idea of what a fractal is. It has some really, really interesting detail at all, scales that makes it hard to talk about standard quantities like lengths and areas and volumes.","363":"Yeah, so if you look at kind of the wrinkly surface of an asteroid, each one of those little wrinkles adds a little bit to the surface area. And so it's really hard to say, what is the area of an asteroid? Let's take a look at a little example of where fractals actually show up in nature. What we're gonna try to do is we're gonna try to say what the length of the coastline of great Britain is. So we're gonna start out with the blue ones, which are spaced further apart. We're gonna ask you to connect the blue pins with a piece of string so we can get a measurement of the coastline. So we have our first measurement of the length of the coastline, and we're gonna do it over again. But this time we're gonna use the white pins, which are spaced closer together. So we measured the coastline again. And what do you think happens?","364":"I think I agree with you, but I think to really validate our scientific experiment, we should probably compare the length of the string. A lot of extra slack in that pig of string. So what we noticed with great Britain is we were never able to measure it's length. It just kept getting longer and longer. This is called the coastline paradox where there's not really one definite number you can assign to the length of the coastline, but it depends on how you measure it. Like if we kept going to really get this to be accurate, we might have to like actually go down the beach and start measuring these tiny little details along the coastline. But really there's so much detail. We would probably never get a definite answer for how long the coastline is. Fractals also give us a really nice language. We're talking about how smooth or rough some kind of shape is. And actually a lot of people, engineers and scientists use this idea of fractals and this language of fractals to compare different shapes, not in terms of their size, but in terms of their roughness. So based on everything we talked about today, how would you describe a fractal to somebody in your own words?","365":"Yeah, totally.  Like it's a shape that you can't use sort of the ordinary language that we use to talk about shapes you really need some other ideas or concepts to talk about.","366":"Our topic today is quantum sensing. So quantum is about the study of stuff that's really, really, really small and sensing is about measuring. So the word sensing comes from kind of like our senses. So do you know what your five senses are?","367":"Touch, exactly. So it's kind of really important for us to be able to have these senses, so we know what's happening in the world around us, right? In doing quantum sensing is we're trying to measure things that can be hard to see. Let me show you. Can you see inside it with your eyes?","368":"For example, we want to go inside, let's say the human body and see what's happening. Sometimes we can look under the surface of the Earth and see what's underneath it. We can make really, really precise clocks that will tell us, that can measure time really, really accurately. And we can make very, very fine measurements that'll tell us about the rules of science and how the world works around us. But we need to build better tools that allow us to do that.","369":"Yeah, I started out doing magnetic resonance, studying things like bone and biomedical magnetic resonance. Ended up playing with spins for a long time and the physics of spins just fascinated me.","370":"In a way, it's part of the same continuum. What you're doing is changing the technological platform and you're actually able to probe it more sensitively. The resolution you're able to get is much higher, so you can see smaller signals in a much smaller volume.","371":"You have to be close to it. You can detect it optically because if we tried to detect the magnetic moment of the electron, we wouldn't be able to do that because there, the energy is too low compared to thermal energies. But what the diamond system gives you is a natural up conversion in energy. So you can couple into an optical photon, which is then much easier to detect a single optical photon than it is to detect a micro wave.","372":"I think as you said, you know, anything that interferes with my signal is noise, but it can come from different sources. In some ways, the operation of the quantum system itself, as it's sensitive to different physical phenomena, the ones that I don't like, I call noise. The ones I do like, I call signal and that's an artificial definition that I'm making when I choose to build a sensor. One of the challenges we have is, we're trying to figure out if I wanna control it, where is it coming from? I remember we had experiments running in our lab one day and we were running these experiments about 100 megahertz. All of a sudden, we saw these big spikes coming in and we realized we're picking up the local FM stations.","373":"And that was a source of noise, like, it's completely random, but it is still there. And then the other form is very much what is intrinsically within your experiment itself because some of the materials that you have have defects that are coupling into your sensor, into your quantum system and are also producing noise.","374":"I would tend to agree that I think, in some sense, anything that uses superposition could be a quantum sensor, but then spectroscopy uses superpositions and has been around for 60, 70 years. I think what excites me most now is the idea that can we push the boundaries of how sensitive one can make this technique? How improving sensitivity, specificity, what other limits and we define it better, are there fundamental physical limits?","375":"So do you think you can integrate multiple NV centers or multiple optical sensors? So are there ways in which you can overcome this question of there's a spot size and that limits how many NVs I can pack into a certain region?","376":"Right. People bring in very different perspectives into what used to be a very niche field. I remember in physics, you'd only talk to people in your subfield and now we're picking up the phone and talking to people in the different departments, completely different areas and we're forced to learn different languages.","377":"exactly so i think something that frustrates a lot of people about quantum computing is the concept of decoherence right you can only keep your information quantum for so long right and that limits how many operations you can do in a row before you lose your information","378":"it let's talk about some of the things we think need to happen between now and fully fault tolerant quantum computers to get us to that reality i mean there's so many things that need to happen in my mind one of the things we need to do is build all these different layers of abstraction that make it easier for programmers to come in and just enter at the ground level you know","379":"you know now that everybody around the world can access a quantum computer through the cloud people are doing all kinds of cool things they're building games we've seen the emergence of quantum gains right what do you think people want to do with them","380":"Yeah it looks really blocky. And it's the same thing not only with shapes and games, but also colors and textures. And this is an especially a big problem in virtual reality because you have no control over where people are gonna go. What they're gonna look at, how close they're gonna get to various objects. So fractals on the other hand are these things that have infinitely, you know, nice details you get closer and closer and closer. And so this is something that can help us solve this problem in computer graphics of generating more detail. One of the reasons why fractals are really nice for computer graphics is because the algorithms that we use to draw images also have this kind of recursive flavor. What's recursion?","381":"So subdivision surface is a way of describing a smooth shape on a computer rather than some complicated fractal shape. So meshes and computer graphics are usually made of these flat polygons with kind of sharp edges. And so the question is how can I get something nice and round and smooth out of these sharp looking polygons? What I can do is I can start cutting one at a time, the corners of this paper off, it still looks very angular. I still have these really sharp points.","382":"Because I want to draw a smooth curve on the screen, but all my computer can do is draw straight lines. And that's actually too true of GPUs. It's kind of interesting. GPUs are basically really fast machines that can only draw one thing and that's a flat triangle. And so if we keep doing this with our paper, you kind of get pretty quickly the idea of what's gonna happen. So when you go to see a Pixar movie, for instance, every surface has been subdivided down. So you have tiny little triangles called micro polygons that are even smaller than the size of a pixel.","383":"Well, because people who really need to use these subdivision services for everything, people who worked hard over the years to make this super, super fast. In fact, subdivision services were invented basically at Pixar. There's this guy, Ed Capel, and he was harshly responsible for one of the most famous kinds of subdivision surfaces called Capel Clark subdivision surfaces. And in fact recently won the touring award for these subdivision services.","384":"So we've, talked a little bit about the positive features of fractals and procedural graphics, which is you can write one simple recursive program and the computer creates a lot of detail for you. So that's really nice, right? It's saving you a lot of work, but the downside is you lose a lot of control. So because the only thing you're describing is this short little program, you don't have complete control over how this is gonna end up. And so adding more controllability to procedural graphics is something people have been thinking about for many years. So how has our conversation changed your understanding of what fractals are all about?","385":"Okay, back into the 1960s, there was a research agency in the United States called DARPA, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency. Actually, it was called ARPA at the time. They wanted to build this notion of a packet-switching network. Not a circuit switch network like a phone network where you get a dedicated path and a dedicated set of bandwidth and links from source to destination.","386":"There's a lot big, right? And so remember, this was a Department of Defense, was they wanted to have forms of of communication that were very robust, that were survivable. Packets could all find their own ways, be routed differently through the network. So if parts of the network failed, you could route around failures.","387":"So you can sort of see how the network architecture that wasn't designed to be 100% reliable inside the core of the network, and had that complexity built into the edges of the network. And to me, the really cool thing is you put this infrastructure in place, and then all these super creative people think about amazing things to build on top of it. And you see this proliferation of amazing applications.","388":"Okay, well I don't know about the number seven, but there's something in the internet that's sort of similar to that. It's called the Domain Name System. The DNS's role is to translate names like gaia.cs.umass.edu, or ibm.com, or facebook.com to an IP address so that your application can actually send a message to that name, to that named service.","389":"That's 98% true. And if you own a network, like you're att.com, or your verizon.com, you can do, within that network, you can do what you want, right? So in that sense, the internet is very decentralized, that the control of the network is up to whoever owns the network. The 2% where you said there's nobody in control, there's a little bit of centralized control. There's an organization called the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers. Its responsibility is to handle, as the name ICANN suggests, names and numbers. It's that little bit of centralization, central authority that you need.","390":"Exactly, right. And maybe they're dropped in your apartment, but much more likely, they're dropped because of congestion somewhere between the Hulu or the Netflix or the Disney server, if you're watching a video, and your home. So even though you've got 200 megabits per second on that last hop, you don't have 200 megabits per second from the server into your apartment.","391":"Yeah. It is exactly using quantum phenomena to sense and measure things and the idea is that, if I can harness quantum phenomena and I can push the limits that are possible, I can get something that's ultimately more precise and potentially more accurate over time too.","392":"So I study spins. And so, spins are one of the platforms that people have suggested is a useful platform for building quantum technologies and I study spins on the solid state. And one of the platforms I work on is nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond.","393":"So you can implant nitrogen into a diamond and then you bombard it with electrons to create the vacancies and then you heat it up and anneal it, and then you get these nitrogen-vacancy centers in your system. So you mentioned quantum computing earlier. So have you heard of the idea of superposition?","394":"So rather than trying to build a lot of complex algorithms and gates with it, what you do is, you take these quantum bits and you take them out into the world and say, what do you see? What are you sensitive to? So you can use an idea called entanglement to make an even more sensitive quantum sensor, but it's even more fragile. So there's always this trade-off between being super fragile and being super sensitive at the same time.","395":"So entanglement is the idea that two particles are correlated. They're essentially in the same quantum state, so that you can't disturb one particle without disturbing the second particle. And so, if I have a large number of quantum sensors that are entangled, then they're all going to interact much more strongly than if I just had one of them interact at a time.","396":"In some ways, it is and you know, atomic clocks are remarkable devices and being able to measure time that precisely has really important consequences. In fact, our old GPS system is based on the accuracy of atomic clocks. They're a set of satellites, each of which has an atomic clock on board and they send out a timestamp and so, once it gets a signal from three different satellites, it can triangulate and figure out exactly where you are. Now, if you could make those clocks even more precise, you could actually accurately position where you are even more accurately.","397":"So some ways, you know, when atomic clocks were designed and built, we didn't necessarily think of GPS, but technology often works that way is that, there are new discoveries and then someone else comes along and says, hey, this is a great tool for some other application.","398":"Wow. Great question. Often, it's a little blue wire called an ethernet cable. So that cable is able to bring bits of information up into your apartment at say, a billion bits per second. That's pretty fast, right? Literally a wire that goes between a box in your apartment, sometimes called a router or a modem in your apartment that comes from an internet service provider come into this first network and then that network connects to another network connects to another network connects to another network.","399":"The underseas cables are so cool! They're these big cables that are laid down by switches. They cross both the Atlantic, the Pacific, the Indian Ocean. So the undersea cables are how the networks in Europe, United States, Asia are all connected together.","400":"That's really what we call the first hop. It's like from your phone, from your tablet, from the computer that you're on, there's no cables coming in. You go over a wireless connection. Wi-Fi is the protocol that allows your computer to talk to that first hop router over a wireless communication link.","401":"Ah, another great question. There's a couple of things that could happen inside the internet. Information is sent in these little packets of information from the Netflix server to your display device. And literally, each packet that arrives says, This is the first packet for Jenna. This is the second. This is the third. This is the fifth. This is the fourth. And they're reordered for you. Matter of fact, your computer will say, using the TCP protocol to the server, Hey, I didn't get packet four, can you resend it again? And again, the Netflix server is very happy to send you packet four again. The other is the internet protocol. If you think about sending letters through the US Postal Service, how you've got an address on it. So every packet that flows from the Netflix server to you has an address on it. It says, This is going to Jenna. It's going to the what's called the Internet Protocol address of your device. Think of all the range of devices that are hooked up to the internet. It's totally amazing, right? Every single one of them has one thing in common, and that is they speak the IP protocol, the Internet Protocol. That was a great question.","402":"That's the computer science brain thinking right there. So we wanna think of a function as procedure or mapping between sets. So a function defines a one-to-one correspondence if it defines a perfect matching between the elements of its domain set and the elements of its output set. We call such functions bijections or isomorphisms. So the reason I'm so interested in this idea of a bijective function or a one-to-one correspondence that guarantees that every element of one set gets matched with an element of the other set, no matter how many elements there are, these bijections or these one-to-one correspondences as they help mathematicians reason about infinity.","403":"Today we're gonna think about infinity as a cardinality, which is a technical term for a number that could be a size of a set. And we're gonna use this idea of one-to-one correspondence to try and investigate the question of whether all infinite sets have the same size. So what I've drawn here are some pictures of some of the infinite sets that appear in mathematics. So the natural numbers are the prototypical example of an infinite set. So the natural numbers are clearly a subset of the integers. Both of these are infinite sets. Are they the same size infinity or different size infinities?","404":"Maybe two. Why not? Because now we're starting to make progress on matching all the negatives. We can match the natural number three with the integer two, the natural number four with the integer minus two. And do you see a pattern?","405":"Great. So now I have a much harder question. So we have the same challenge, again, evidently there are way, way, way more rational numbers than there are integers. Does that mean this is a larger infinite set than the integers? What do you think?","406":"Yeah, that's exactly right. And now for each pair of integers, I'm gonna represent it by a corresponding natural number. That's what's going on with this counting. And when I compose those operations, what I've done is I've encoded rational numbers as natural numbers in a way that reveals that they can be no larger, there are no more rational numbers than natural numbers.","407":"Now there's one final collection of numbers that we haven't yet discussed, which are the real numbers, all of the points on the number line. Do you think that's the same size infinity?","408":"Yes. You see the idea right away. So I'm gonna form a new real number whose first digit is different from this one. And you've already convinced yourself that this number is not on this list anywhere. Why is that?","409":"So we've started to explore some of the counterintuitive properties of infinity. On the one hand there are infinite sets that feel very different like the natural numbers, the integers, the rational numbers that nevertheless have the same size or the same infinite cardinality. While there are other infinities that are larger. So there's more than one size of infinity, not all infinities are created equal.","410":"yeah this whole infrastructure is all about creating levels that get progressively colder as you go from top to bottom down to the quantum chip which is how we actually control the state of the cupids","411":"okay so it's this idea that you have two objects and when you entangle them together they become connected and then they're sort of permanently connected to each other and they behave in ways that are sort of a system now so superposition is one quantum property that we use entanglement is another quantum property and a third is interference how much you know about interference","412":"so you can have constructive interference and you can have destructive interference we have constructive interference you have amplitudes wave amplitudes that add until the signal gets larger and if you have destructive interference the amplitudes cancel by using a property like interference we can control quantum states and amplify the kinds of signals that are towards the right answer and then cancel the types of signals that are leading to the wrong answer so given that you know that we're trying to use superposition entanglement and interference for computation how do you think we build these computers","413":"it's a perfect question i mean it's very early for quantum computing but we're building assembly languages we're building layers of abstraction that are going to get you to a point as a programmer where you can interchangeably be programming something the way that you already do and then make calls to a quantum computer so that you can bring it in when it makes sense we're not envisioning quantum computers completely replacing classical computers anytime soon we think that quantum computing is going to be used to accelerate the kinds of things that are really hard for for classical machines","414":"simulating nature is something that's really hard because if you take something like you know modeling atomic bonding and electronic orbital overlap instead of now writing out a giant summation over many terms you try and actually mimic the system you're trying to simulate directly on a quantum computer which we can do for chemistry and uh we're looking at ways of doing that for other types of things there's a lot of exciting research right now on machine learning trying to use quantum systems to accelerate machine learning problems","415":"So black holes, you describe them as huge. The interesting thing about black holes is they're hugely heavy, but they're actually physically really small. What really matters is the density. Do you know what density is?","416":"I can also ask how big it is, which is a question about its volume. If I make it smaller, then what's happening is it's becoming more dense. So imagine I crushed this really, really small. It would weigh the same, it would have the same mass, but it would be much more dense.","417":"Well, that's a really good question. So interestingly, the sun itself isn't heavy enough. So it has to be heavy enough that when it begins to collapse, it just overcomes all attempts to fight it. If you made something really dense, you would have to travel faster than the speed of light to actually escape. That's 300,000 kilometers per second.","418":"So it goes so fast that it goes completely dark. Any light that veers too close will fall in, will not be able to make it back out again. If a light is shining from the sun near a black hole, the black hole's not touching it. Why does the light get pulled in? Why does that happen?","419":"It is taking other stuff, but the funny question was like, if I wanted to move your chair, you'd think it was really strange if I didn't have to come near you and actually grab the chair and move it. One of the things Einstein thought about is he imagined that what the black hole is doing is it's changing the shape of space around it. What do you think of that idea?","420":"Isn't it crazy? And then Einstein goes a step further and thinks, well, what black holes must be doing is curving the space so strongly that even light gets caught. Sometimes you can get light caught into a whole orbit, literally the light going round and round in an orbit.","421":"So one of my main research areas is something called category theory, it's been described as the mathematics of mathematics. It's a language that can be used to prove very general theorems. And an interesting aspect of being a researcher in category theory that doesn't come up as much in other areas is that we have to really pay attention to the axioms of set theory in our work. When you're proving theorems, have you ever used the axiom of choice?","422":"So the way I think about it is if you have an infinite or an arbitrary family of sets and you know for sure that none of these sets are empty, then a choice function would allow you to select an element from each set sort of all at once. When you've used the axiom of choice in proofs, do you know which incarnation of this you've used?","423":"We're used to ethernet cables that can handle many hundreds of gigabits per second over a wired device. What are the typical data rates for IoT devices? I mean, not hundreds of gigabits.","424":"My sense is you're spot on, that they'll produce over time, a lot of data. And that a lot of IoT is about computing on that data. That computation happened mostly at the edge, or somehow a combination between the edge and something happening in a far away data center.","425":"Absolutely. I don't think we still have a completely satisfactory answer to that question. What was so, such a beautiful insight, as I'm sure you know, is that the idea of zero-knowledge","426":"If you can already predict the answer, then you must not be gaining any knowledge by that interaction. This insight of being able to predict the future accurately, and that being an evidence of a lack of new knowledge,","427":"Right. Sometimes. I mean, for example, in medical research, how amazing would it be, right, to be able to have a drug, and be able to prove that my drug works in this model.","428":"in a zero-knowledge way, without any interaction, right. I can just take the program, convert it to a zero-knowledge program, or an obfuscated program, and then just send it to you.","429":"It's a great question. I wish I could see the future. I can't actually, but let me try. The part of that that I'm the most comfortable answering is of course the mathematical side.","430":"Yeah, and probably nobody is. Have you heard a lot in your studies about these super massive black holes that we think lurk in the centers of very nearly every galaxy?","431":"Yeah, I think that's right. I think people are really perplexed about how you make something so big in such a short period of time. It's kind of funny, the bigger you make a black hole, it seems maybe counterintuitive, but the less dense the material has to be out of which you make it. So you can, out of something the density almost of air, you can make a supermassive black hole. You can't make a star out of that, but weirdly, if you skip the star phase altogether, it's conceivable that they directly collapse. And so there's suddenly a new way to make black holes that nature has figured out.","432":"There might be many alternate routes. It might be in the very early universe that bubbles in unusual phase transitions from very high energy universe to a low energy universe can make black holes. Like, we haven't really thought of the range of possibilities.And so there could also be primordial black holes that are still around that also skipped the star stage altogether that were formed really in the very earliest phases. And I think the interesting thing is, with your looking at like the Large Magellanic Cloud, is to wonder if we're gonna merge.","433":"Yeah, and it's very possible that as you said, the collision won't be so severe that it'll be very disruptive. So our entire solar system could stay intact and here we would go with the sun and all the other planets in orbit around a new black hole.","434":"We work a lot right now on thinking of black holes as batteries. So a black hole that can take, like a giant magnet, astronomical magnet in the form of another collapsed star, like a neutron star, and flip it around so fast, near the speed of light, that it actually creates an electronic circuit out of this moving magnet. And so that the power that can come out of these electronic circuits created by these batteries can be tremendous.","435":"It's a great question. I once did a calculation of using a black hole made out of the moon and the strongest magnet we could find on Earth to see if I could make an electronic battery. And honestly, you only get about enough energy to power New York City. But we have to find one in our neighborhood first.","436":"So Claire, we've had this pretty fascinating conversation about supermassive black holes in particular. And after our discussion, what is it that has changed for you in your perspective or what is it that excites you?","437":"and actually machine learning is one research direction where we're really hoping that we're going to find um key parts of the machine learning computation that can be sped up using quantum computing","438":"if you think about even just classical information like bits right at the end of the day when you store a bit in your hard drive there's a magnetic domain and you have a magnetic polarization right","439":"you can change the magnetization to be pointing up or pointing down right quantum systems we're still manipulating a device and changing the quantum state of that of that device you can imagine if it's a spin that you could have spin up and spin down but you can also if you isolate it enough you can have a superposition of up and down","440":"so what we do when we try to solve problems with a quantum computer is we encode parts of the problem we're trying to solve into a complex quantum state and then we manipulate that state to drive it towards what will eventually represent the solution","441":"so you need a chip with qubits each qubit is a carrier of quantum information and the way we control the state of that qubit is using microwave pulses you send them all the way down these cables and we've calibrated these microwave pulses so that we know exactly this kind of pulse what this frequency and this duration will put the cupid into superposition or we'll flip the state of the qubit from zero to one or if we apply a microwave pulse between two qubits we can entangle them","442":"there's sort of two main classes of quantum algorithms there's algorithms which were developed for decades right things like shore's algorithm which is for factoring grover's algorithm for unstructured search and these algorithms were designed assuming that you had a perfect fault tolerant quantum computer which is many decades away so we're currently in a phase where we're exploring what can we do with these near-term quantum computers and the answer is going to be well we need different kinds of algorithms to really even explore that question","443":"yeah they also unfortunately require fault tolerance right now the algorithms that we know of today to do those things um on a quantum computer require you to have millions of error-corrected qubits today we're at like 50. it's actually amazing that we're at 50. there's things that we know or we have strong reason to believe um are going to be faster to do on a quantum computer and then there's things that we'll discover just by virtue of having one","444":"i'm glad you're interested i think the place where lots of people can get involved right now is by going and trying it out and thinking about what they could do with it there's a lot of opportunity to find these near-term applications that are only going to be found by trying things out","445":"I think I have a somewhat similar perspective to you in that, if we provide more structure and support, and sort of forms of prior knowledge or experience in the algorithm, that should make it more efficient. And so if we can acquire those kinds of priors about the world and about interaction from previous data, maybe offline data, then I think we should be able to make learning of new tasks more efficient.","446":"It's a really, really hard problem. A lot of simulators, they don't simulate the world as a fine enough time granularity to really accurately capture things like skewing an object, for example. One thing that I think is promising is to try to not build simulators entirely from first principles, from our knowledge of physics. But instead to look at real data and see how real data might inform our simulations and try to build, allow robots to build models of the world, build simulators of the world, based on data and based on experiences. There's a little bit of a chicken and egg problem, because if we wanna use simulators to get lots of data, and we also need data to get good simulators, then there's no way to get around this.","447":"So a fractal is something that we see every day, but it's a little bit hard to describe. It's it's a shape that if you look at it really far away, or you look at it really up close, it has kind of a similar appearance. And actually that word fractal sounds a little bit like fraction.","448":"And that's kind of what we're gonna try out today. In fact, we're gonna have you build a fractal. A tree is a really good example of a fractal because if you look at the whole tree and then you break off a big branch of the tree.","449":"So your tree is totally beautiful, but it took a long time to make, right. How would you feel if I said, now you have to make a thousand of those trees.","450":"Yeah, it's a ton of work. If you think about Moana's island, it has these tens and hundreds of thousands of trees on it. And that's why we need computers to help us out because computers are really good at taking these really simple rules, like put two branches on every other branch and doing it really, really fast.","451":"Like coding, exactly. That's what actually a lot of the artists for the movies are working with code rather than with a paintbrush. So in your own words, how would you describe a fractal to somebody?","452":"We're in level five now. So you're the expert-expert. I'm a huge fan of the work that you did in RCP, the Routing Control Platform being a precursor to software-defined networking and the notion that rather than having protocols actually always compute things, that we could compute things in data centers. I'd be interested if you could sort of just reflect back on that time and sort of the beginnings of SDN and where it's come since then.","453":"And certainly, we've heard about some countries that impose firewalls that don't let certain kinds of traffic out, or certain kinds of traffic in. So there's no global body that is regulating that?","454":"I mean, even you could just tell that two people are communicating even though the traffic itself is encrypted. So you don't know what they're saying, just even knowing two devices are communicating.","455":"You're one of the most awesome networking researchers that I know. I'm curious, just to pick your brain, what do you think are some of the hot topics in networking research? Where do you think the field is heading?","456":"You know, we've had cellular networks now for 20, 30 years. So when we hear about 5G, what's trumpeted the most is the fact that oh, super high bandwidth, right? But I sense that the exciting things are more than just the network being faster.","457":"Coming back again to the softwarization. SDN and softwarization is a maybe a little bit behind the covers, that you wouldn't normally see it as a user going from 3G to 4G to 5G. You just see an increase in speed. But yet, the way the network is now being managed again, I think is bringing the cellular networking world sort of into the internet world in terms of the softwarization-","458":"So that's a great definition and I wanna pick that apart a little bit. So what you described is just right. Stars, when they run out of thermonuclear fuel are gonna collapse under their own weight. It'll explode in a supernova, it'll leave a core, and if the core itself is heavy enough, it will keep collapsing. It does, as you say, reach this point where not even light can escape. But the amazing thing is it leaves that point, you called it rightly the event horizon, it leaves it behind kind of like an archeological record because the start itself can no more sit at the event horizon than it can race outward at the speed of light. So the core of the star keeps collapsing and where it goes nobody knows. So in a weird way, the black hole isn't anymore a crush of matter. It left it behind in its wake, but the stuff of the star is gone.","459":"So the singularity is definitely predicted in Einstein's general theory of relativity and that's purely a theory of spacetime. And in the theory of spacetime, there is no question that a singularity would form when the star collapses catastrophically inside the black hole. Now, even when people talked about singularities back in the '60s, they thought, you know, quantum mechanics is part of the story of the whole of physics. It's not just gravity. And if we understand quantum gravity we'll realize that singularity probably doesn't ever actually form.","460":"I would say to some extent we don't know for sure. What we have found is that the mathematics is so unbelievably powerful that we're able to disprove wrong ideas just in pen and paper. Just very recently, within the past couple of years, the first ever human-procured image of a black hole showed us what we expected to see of the event horizon. So Jayda, after our conversation today, what would you say a black hole is?","461":"The beauty of being a student of something like black holes is you never stop having new impressions of what this enigmatic phenomena is. So in a year, I'll tell you what I learned that's new.","462":"So what you're describing is the famous Hawking radiation where a black hole cleverly kind of steals energy from the quantum vacuum and radiates and in the process of evaporates. And of course this caused a big kerfuffle because when the black hole evaporates, eventually that event horizons is yanked up. And the question is, where did everything go that had once fallen in?","463":"There's this domain of black holes in astrophysics where we see stars collapse, and we know that they exist and there's whole observational astronomy around them. And then there's this domain that we're talking about, where, as you said, black holes are so special because they're kind of guiding us in the right direction to understand the very nature of reality. And that makes them really unusually special. And one of the things I wanted to draw out is that we talk about the fundamental forces of nature. So there's the matter forces, and then the outlier is gravity. We've quantized all the matter forces in a way that we're rather comfortable with. Gravity keeps resisting quantization of gravity itself. And now we're thinking in a way that you're describing that, well, maybe it's only the quantum forces altogether.","464":"Right, and it allows you to prove that you've been behaving honestly, without revealing any of the secrets involved that you use to actually behave honestly. So we of course know that zero-knowledge proofs for NP-complete languages plays such a huge role in cryptography. I'm curious. What was your first experience with Np-completeness like?","465":"Exactly. Right. Because random is unpredictable and that's what we want. Right. We want that unpredictability around us to be utilized, to actually hide the information that we wanna hide. How have you used your knowledge in the projects that you've worked on? What are the challenges that you find?","466":"And also in the blockchain space, for example, if you wanna speed up the generation of proofs, if that could be done in a distributed way, then that would be great. One of the hopes that I have is that the power of multi-party computation is about bringing people together who are mutually distrustful.","467":"Everything you just said is exactly what we know from research. All the thoughts running through your mind, were really at kind of about a prediction into the future, right? You're like, how, how will this taste if, when it's in my mouth or how will I feel about my decision down the road? You know we think of memory as something in the past, but it's an example of how you use your memories of these two candies to predict what's gonna happen in the future so that you can make a decision in the present. But you did it, you made your way through that torture. And now you've got to keep the candy.","468":"Matilda. All right. We're gonna actually build an internet. I've got a couple of things here that I wanna show you, or a couple of toys, actually. Okay, let's pretend that these round balls are computers. And the internet is something that connects them. And right now, the internet is just one communication link. And Matilda is sent over the internet from this computer to your computer. So the internet is a network for carrying information from one computer to another. Now this network here looks pretty simple, doesn't it? Right? It's just one thing. Should we add some more friends in?","469":"That's right. So that's pretty cool. There are actually lots of different ways to actually go through the internet to get from what we call a source, the place that's sending the information, to the receiver, the place that's actually gathering the information together. And that's something we actually call routing.","470":"Yeah. So that's a really good observation. In most pieces of the internet, that's exactly what would happen. We want to take what's called a shortest path. But still, there are multiple paths. And why do you think that might be valuable?","471":"Exactly. So, Skylar, that was a great discussion about what we just built. And I wanted to talk to you about, or ask you about maybe one other really important part about networks. And it's not so much the thing itself, the physical thing, but more about the rules about communication. That's governed by something that are called protocols. Are you up for one?","472":"Lettuce go on. [Skylar and Jim laughing] A knock, knock joke is an example of a protocol, right? The computer that you are using say, makes a request, you ask for something, you get something in return. In the internet, there are protocols everywhere. So that two computers that have never talked to each other before know the rules for talking to each other. This global internet with billions of people using it are just lots of smaller networks that are all hooked together to each other. But also, what the internet allows are all of these what we call applications, Zoom, video playing services, can all run on top of the same internet.","473":"In the field we often talk of have having a mental model that we use to make predictions about what's about to happen and really use that to mean kind of a general understanding of what's going on. What does that look like in terms that come from your world of like the configuration of, of a circuit?","474":"We now think of the hippocampus so much in terms of memory but really some of the earliest work in neuroscience on the hippocampus talked about the role of the hippocampus in spatial navigation. And it really exposed I think one of the deepest questions in memory research, or at least from the neuroscience perspective is like, well what is the connection? What is the connection between spatial processing and memory? And why is it that neurons in the hippocampus when an animal is navigating a maze, why is it that there's spatial specialization there? I really do think that this notion of a mental model, a generative model is where those, where memory and space meet.","475":"It's really interesting. And I think it also really speaks to the kind of pervasive and circular role of memory, right? Because the maps are dependent on memories, they're built from memories and experiences. So there's this kind of dialogue with memory creating maps, maps creating experiences, experiences creating memories, affecting the maps, and really makes me think even of a question a friend asked me recently about moods and mental health and this feeling of like how do some people get kind of trapped in a state of mind where all they can see is a particular way forward. But then something happens in the world that shifts them to another model.","476":"Memories as models or models first and memory as part of what helps build the model starts generating new predictions. Exactly the kind you just brought up or other ways of thinking about things because an efficient model needs to let go of information, right? I just heard a colleague of mine joking about the fact that the principles of neuroscience textbook keeps growing and growing. And that if we had enough strength in theoretical neuroscience, if our models of neuroscience were good enough, that book should shrink back. We know that memory retrieval is essentially construction. And so you don't need to store all those separate memories. You need to construct them. But if you have a good model, let go of all those details and just construct them to feel as if it's a memory. But really all you're doing is using the model to fill the details. It's kind of like the matrix, you know.","477":"Getting way out there, but, but it is a way in which if you have the right model, it should be an efficient one. I'm wondering what you, what you think about what all this means for kind of a redefinition of what memory is, in many ways a revision or expansion of that notion. Would you be willing to try to help me think about how to define it?","478":"I agree. I think, you know, as you were speaking I was thinking maybe the most important word to replace there is record. Record implies an etching of something as it was. And maybe what we need instead is that it's a model, it's an approximation, it's an abstraction that can help us create the illusion of constructing your record. But that it's the model that's the important thing that drives the whole thing.","479":"So a lot of times stars are born together in two star systems and when they die, if they're heavy enough, they will collapse under their own weight and form a black hole. So here you have a black hole and a big fluffy star. And what will happen is it'll start to tear apart its neighboring star. Literally parts of the star will begin to spill onto the black hole and splatter on the black hole. But let's say both those stars formed black holes. And what these black holes do is they are like mallets on a drum. They create literally waves in the shape of spacetime as they're moving. So imagine mallets on a drum, how the drum ripples. Depending on how the mallets are moving you hear different sounds. So effectively these black holes, as they get very close together in the final stages of their life together, they're orbiting each other at hundreds of times a second. It's this really crazy event, but it's happening in complete darkness. Eventually they bobble together and they merge and then they wring out, the spacetime's going crazy around them, it's this storm in spacetime, and they settle down to a quiet black hole. Then those waves that they created travel through the universe, basically undisturbed. For a long time people thought, well, even if black holes are out there, they're impossible to observe. And then they got very clever. You might wonder how we could possibly hear black holes, that sounds crazy. So I'm gonna show you, but I'm gonna need your help. This demo involves an electric guitar. Do you play at all?","480":"Okay, you wanna do the demo for me? So the LIGO instrument electronically records the ringing of the shape of space with its very complicated instrument. It stands for Laser Interferometric Gravitational-Waves Observatory and the design was incredibly difficult and they didn't know if they would succeed. I think of the instrument as like the body of the electric guitar. And then they take the readout of the motions of the waves that they're recording, just like that guitar is recording the motions of the waves on the string. Now just play it like a little bit. And you can't hear anything, right? You're not meant to hear an electric guitar when it's not plugged in. What's happening is the guitar strings are ringing, but so quietly that we can't actually hear the sound. And this is like the gravitational waves, which are ringing the drum of spacetime, but so quietly that they're not move the air and we're not hearing them. So now play and I'm gonna turn the volume up a little bit. While I can't actually hear the ringing of the strings themselves, I can hear the data of the shape of the string recorded and played through this amplifier. And that's kind of the idea behind the LIGO instrument.","481":"It's a great question. If I didn't see you playing the guitar, I would recognize the sound of a guitar. And even if I had never heard of a guitar before I could figure out the frequencies that the string was playing, I could tell how strongly it had been plucked, and I could tell the length of it and where it was pinned down from the harmonics of the string. And I can tell the different lengths of the strings from the notes that they play. So I can actually reconstruct the instrument that's playing it. And it's very similar to LIGO, we can listen to the notes, the amplitude, the harmonics, and we can deduce the size and shape of the objects doing that. And they're very massive and they're very small and they have all the markings of a black hole.","482":"It's a really good question. Only this instrument, and that's why it was so hard to build. And by the time it gets here, it's so weak that it's only squeezing and stretching space at like the fraction of a nucleus over very large distances. Has your understanding of black holes changed over the course of our conversation?","483":"So over the past four levels, we've been talking about Moravec's paradox. I'm curious to get your perspective. There are still a lot of open questions for how to leverage previous experience and learn cumulatively over time.","484":"I think it's interesting. And also a huge challenge. I think that it's interesting that if a person sees a robot doing something that seems very capable, they assume that the robot can do all sorts of other capable things. It's a huge challenge, because that's actually not the case.","485":"I like that description, because it conveys how much complexity there is to these really basic tasks that we're doing. Is there a definition for the simple tasks that we do versus things that are more complex, like playing chess?","486":"I suspect that we'll start by doing whatever is most convenient, 'cause that's whatever we can get. But I think that for robots to be capable alongside humans, in a world with humans, I think that we may need to actually use human experience, human learning, to inform how robots learn, if we want them to follow the same kind of mistake pattern as humans, so that humans can interpret robots, and humans can understand what robots will and will not do.","487":"What I love about what you were describing is like you didn't use the word memory, were how you were talking about kind of perceptions and social judgments but I think probably we'd both agree that memory is a big part of that.","488":"Right, like it reminds me so much of, you know, what we in the field would refer to as statistical learning. On one hand we might have like a one-shot memory, a memory of something that we saw yesterday, like what we did or what we ate or where we were. But a lot of our memories and our knowledge instead are based on many, many, many experiences.","489":"Some of those examples really remind me also some of the questions about kind of abnormalities in, in memory or trauma or disruptions in memory and how they also play out in terms of not just what people remember but what they do with those memories right?","490":"You know when I look back at, some of the work for my own lab and in the field in general, I really feel like some of the most exciting discoveries were not an answer to a question that was around before, but they were discoveries that made us realize we weren't asking the right question. I think one example of that even has to do with the connection between memory and decision-making. There was a discovery about how the striatum responds to rewards and to learning that just all of a sudden flipped the way we thought about the role of reward and learning and memory, and may force us to realize there was something fundamentally connected between these processes. And that discovery just raised a whole new set of questions that didn't exist before.","491":"Each project should be very focused and rigorous and know what a study is designed for. But at the same time we have to keep our minds open, our eyes open for what else is happening. Some of the most interesting discoveries didn't make sense at first.","492":"And things that are hard for humans should also be hard for robots and humans to do. But it turns out that it's actually the opposite. I wanna try a little demo.","493":"So I have a penny in my hand and I'd like you to pick it up with your right hand and put it into your left hand. So that was pretty easy, right?","494":"We're gonna make this a little bit harder now. So, can you put these on? And we'll try to do the same thing again with your eyes closed. There you go. Let's try that one more time, and see if you can do any better. So close your eyes.","495":"Yeah. So that you're able, with a bit more practice, you're able to figure it out. When it fell on the ground, how did you know to pick it up off the ground?","496":"So when a robot tries to do something, like pick up an object, not only do you need to program exactly like what the motors should do, the robot also needs to be able to see where the object is. Then this is what's called a perception action loop in robotics. So if the object moves, the robot can then adapt what it's doing and change what it's doing to successfully pick up the object. It's really important for robots to be able to leverage, not just like the past hour of experience, but also ideally many years of experience, in order to do the kinds of things that you did.","497":"Yeah. It's really unintuitive. In order to survive, we need to pick up objects and everything. Basically many, many, like billions of years of evolution actually created humans and the ability to manipulate objects like that. So, it actually turns out that things that are really basic for us are actually just really complex tasks in general.","498":"That's a great question. So in reinforcement learning, the robot tries the task, and then it gets some sort of reinforcement, some sort of feedback. It's similar to how you might train a dog.","499":"So you could give it feedback like that. So it won't necessarily know itself, especially on the first few tries, but it's trying to figure out what the task is even.","500":"We give robots a camera and the camera produces this array of numbers. Basically, each pixel has three different numbers, one for R, for G and for B. And so the robot sees this really massive set of numbers. And it has to be able to figure out, from that massive set of numbers, what is in the world. There is a number of different ways to have the robot see, but we use a technique called neural networks, that tries to take out in those big numbers and form representations of the objects in the world, and where those objects are.","501":"I think that robotics is really, really hard. Having robots do even really basic stuff, like pick up objects, is really, really hard. So if they do take over the world, I think it'll be a very, very, very, very long time from now.","502":"Or you don't even need computers. Like I remember when I was a kid, I played electric guitar and I had all these guitar pedals with different effects and oh, what happens if you put the output back in the input and just run it through itself, you're gonna start hearing this kind of fractal sound, right? So today we've been telling people, fractals are things that are somehow self-similar, they have detail at all scales. Are there other ways you might introduce fractals to somebody or are there other things you might say, this is what a fractal is?","503":"I think about like the scale and variance of different physical equations, like navier-stokes is, you know, kind of scale and variant, you know, this Reynolds number that tells you how viscous things are, but you can have the same kind of fluid behavior at all different scales. And that's why you get turbulence at all different scales.","504":"I think that's also, what's so beautiful about fractals is that, you know, if you think about sort of the history of geometry as well, Felix Klein was looking at geometry by saying, well, geometry is all about in variance. I have some group of transformations and I look at objects that are sort of in variant with respect to these transformations. So if you just look at translations, okay, what kinds of shapes remain the same under translations? Will you get tiling? You get wallpaper. And if you start asking that same question, what if I allow scaling in my transformations then boom, you have fractal.","505":"Now you work on kind of the future of virtual reality and augmented reality and extended reality. But it's kind of interesting because I think if I think about exploring these infinite fractal landscapes in some way, they still feel a little bit lonely or they feel a little bit poor of the kind of richness that we have in the real world.","506":"People outside of computer graphics and engineering and science and so forth have also thought a lot about and used fractals as a language for talking about nature, for characterizing shapes and behaviors and so forth tissue or friction, or all sorts of really important phenomena. Do you think that computer graphics has kind of dropped the ball in terms of saying, you know, this is not something that's exciting anymore to work on procedural descriptions and we're, we're moving on from that?","507":"So one of the things I guess that touches on is this question about controllability or the ease of, with which everybody can create these worlds. Not just people, not just mathematicians, not just, you know, trained computer scientists. One thing when I think about Ken Musgraves working about this program, Bryce, this one I felt like I could really use, what do you think we still need to do in terms of putting these kinds of tools in, in people's hands, making it easier for people to use procedural machine learning, to build these kind of worlds?","508":"Yeah. And I think this is what what's so beautiful also about Mandelbrot's work is him saying, you know, it's not really about these exotic examples. Like even the Mandelbrot set or Julia sets or whatever. Yeah they're like really interesting mathematical curiosities, but they get at this idea that fractals are kind of inevitable. And Bob Ross probably never, as far as I know, never sat down and you know, thought about recursive descriptions of trees or anything like that. But it's just something that naturally comes to you as an artist.","509":"That's a great way to think about it. Infinity is something that never ends, where finite, the opposite of infinity, refers to a process or a quantity that we could actually count all the way through, at least in theory if given enough time. So if you had to guess, how many Skittles are in this jar?","510":"217. And if we wanted to figure out the exact number, how would we find out? We could put them all out and divide them into pieces of five and then we could use that. Yeah, absolutely. In fact, I did that before you got here, and it's 649 Skittles. Here's a much harder question. How many pieces of glitter do you think are in that jar?","511":"Yeah, absolutely not. Because this room holds only a finite amount of space. And in fact, infinitely many jars would not even fit in something called the observable universe, which is the portion of the universe that astronomers can see. Really how does that make you feel?","512":"You have very good intuition. So there are ways that mathematicians can build infinite collections of things. And if you repeat those processes, it's in fact possible to build even bigger and bigger sizes of infinity. So what have you learned today about infinity?","513":"so did you know that there's certain kinds of problems that computers sort of run out of space almost like you're trying to solve the problem and just like how you run out of space on your iphone when you're trying to take a picture if you're trying to solve the problem you just run out of space and even if you have the world's biggest supercomputer did you know that can still happen","514":"okay so quantum mechanics is a branch of science just like any other branch of science it's a branch of physics it's the study of things that are either really really small really really well isolated and really really cold and this particular branch of science is something we're using to totally reimagine how computing works so we're building totally new kinds of computers based on the laws of quantum mechanics that's what a quantum computer is","515":"i don't know what it's worth but uh i can put it face up right in that heads i can put it face down right so at any given time point in time if i ask you is my penny heads or tails probably you could answer it right","516":"but in the quantum world when we entangle things they're really now connected it's much much harder to separate them again so using the same analogy we spin our pennies and eventually eventually they both stop right and when they stop it's either heads or tails right so in my case i got tails and you got heads you see how they're totally disconnected from each other right our pennies in the real world now if our pennies were entangled and we both spun them together right when we stopped them if you measured your penny to be ahead i would measure my penny to be ahead and if you measured your penny to be a tails i would measure my opinion to be a tails if we measured it at exactly the same time we would still find that they were both exactly correlated","517":"the way that we are able to actually see these quantum properties is by making our quantum chips really really cold so that's what this is all about actually this is called a dilution refrigerator and it's a refrigerator it doesn't look like a normal refrigerator right but it's something that we use actually there's usually a case around it to cool our quantum chips down cold enough that we can create superpositions and we can entangle qubits and the information isn't lost to the environment","518":"And at some level, there's different set of rules that seem to come into play 'cause you can have particles at very microscopic scales seem to do really strange things. But one of the quests of quantum sensing is to harvest some of these unique properties at the micro scale. We are really interested in quantum sensors because we think they can give us the ultimate limit of sensitivity. So they're really, really sensitive to small changes, but they're also gonna be really reliable. Every time I make that measurement, I'll always get the same results.","519":"And what the MRI scanner is doing is, it's measuring the signal from all the water molecules that are present and specifically the hydrogen atom. In our bodies, we have these hydrogen atoms that are essentially spinning around magnetic fields all the time and we just don't know them. So in some sense, you've already used a quantum sensor.","520":"And then the different chemicals in the cells. If you look at the MRI images, you can see that they give you the broad features of what the tissue looks like. But if you wanna zoom in a little bit more and see what's actually happening inside a tissue or inside a cell and you need a different type of sensor that's gonna be more sensitive and for something like that, you're gonna need a quantum sensor.","521":"So there are quantum sensors that are sold for very specific applications, one of them is a magnetometer and those can be really, really sensitive to measure small variations in magnetic fields. They are trying to develop sensors that are gravitational sensors. Right now, we have no way of probing what's under the ground without digging into the ground."},"dialogue":{"0":"Explainer: Great.\nExplainee: I'm biased because I study one of the other sub-critical parts of the brain, the cerebellum.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","1":"Explainer: So that's good, because that's why you're here, and so we're talking about sleep today, and really about kind of what is the brain machinery through which we go through consciousness to unconsciousness and that transition.\nExplainee: Great.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","2":"Explainer: Okay. The best way to think about this transition is really called, it's a flip flop switch, okay? So this term comes from engineering, and the idea is that in sleep, you basically have kind of this all of nothing experience. Certainly people kind of drift off to sleep, but then all of a sudden you're unconscious, right? So it seems like it's this flip flop between the arousal system and the sleep promoting system, and it's certainly regulated, and we'll get a little bit into that, but they're certainly kind of made up of two reciprocally inhibitory processes. Okay, so we have the ascending reticular activating system. It originates in the brain stem, and there's a dorsal and a ventral arm to this, and so the dorsal arm has neurons, cholinergic neurons, that go up to the thalamus and then it projections into the fore brain, and then there's the ventral arm, and this is comprised of a whole bunch of different types of neurons, so there are monominergic, so there's kind of dopaminergic neurons that come from the periaqueductal gray, serotonergic ones from the dorsal raphae nuclei, histaminergic neurons that come from the tuberomammillary nucleus of the hippothalamus, and then noradrenergic neurons from the locus coeruleus, and so all of those are kind of working in tandem to kind of drive wake within the brain. So if we just think about drugs that are available inducing wakefulness, we can certainly, kind of the dopaminergic ones jump out, right? So we have amphetamines that kind of drive those signaling, and then modafinil, which is a wake promoting drug for people that have kind of excessive day-time sleepiness that maintains alertness throughout the day.\nExplainee: In terms of the dopamine, if you're taking amphetamines, that's usually to promote, as you said, wakefulness, but does that actually improve the quality of your sleep? How reliable are those kinds of interventions?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","3":"Explainee: In terms of the dopamine, if you're taking amphetamines, that's usually to promote, as you said, wakefulness, but does that actually improve the quality of your sleep? How reliable are those kinds of interventions?\nExplainer: For the role that they play with respect to the sleep-wake system is really kind of amping up the wake system, right? And so certainly that has like down stream consequences for the sleep system, because now the flip flop switch is kind of pushed in a much stronger direction, and we have to kind of rely on what regulates sleep to get it pushed back to sleep.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","4":"Explainer: For the role that they play with respect to the sleep-wake system is really kind of amping up the wake system, right? And so certainly that has like down stream consequences for the sleep system, because now the flip flop switch is kind of pushed in a much stronger direction, and we have to kind of rely on what regulates sleep to get it pushed back to sleep.\nExplainer: And do we know much about why, or which stages of the sleep cycle are affected? You know, if you take amphetamines, is it then when you go to sleep, that you're not able to transition through each of the sleep periods, or is that less clear?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","5":"Explainer: You know, so I think that's less clear. In some ways, you know, getting back to this idea of this wake-sleep system, we have this sleep system that is kind of the counterpoint to this wake arousal system, and so the primary nucleus region is the ventral lateral pre-optic nucleus, also called VLPO, and that has particular neuron outputs that release GABA and galanin, which work in an inhibitory way on kind of the wake promoting ones. And so, it's kind of this delicate balance of these two systems that are ongoing. In your cognitive neuro-science training, right, it sounds like it's pretty specific and focused in a particular part of the brain, the cerebellum, and one thing that I'm interested in is you bring a participant into the study, have you ensured that they got a good night's sleep? Have you asked them about their sleep?\nExplainee: Well in most studies, probably it is advised for your participants before they come in to get a good night's sleep, so those would be recommendations that you would lay out, you know, in communication with the participant, before they come in.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","6":"Explainer: A lot of people will see you as somebody who's drank in harmony their whole life. They've seen so much harmony, heard so much harmony. How do you make the choices, there's so much that's possible when you know stuff. How do you have the courage to make a choice?\nExplainee: It comes from just your life experience. And that moves you in a certain direction. How it gets expressed, many times, is sudden. Complete surprise. (laughs)\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","7":"Explainer: Yeah, yeah, yeah. I find it fascinating in music to think about, you know, say I arrive in a place, if I'm going, say I'm going to D flat major. And there's something you once taught me.

Which is a wonderful, wonderful thing.\nExplainee: Yeah, a lot of freedom.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","16":"Explainer: Have you ever heard of machine learning before?\nExplainee: I'm going to assume that it means humans being able to teach machines or robots how to learn themselves?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","17":"Explainer: That's right. When we teach machines to learn from data, to build a model from that data or a representation of that, and then to make a prediction. One of the places we often find machine learning in the real world is in things like recommendation systems. So do you have an artist that you really like?\nExplainee: Yeah, Melanie Martinez.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","18":"Explainer: All right.

The machine can understand whatever we tell it to understand. So there might be a person thinking about things, like the pitch or the pacing or the tone, or sometimes machines can figure out things about music or images or videos that we don't tell it to discover, but that it can learn from looking at a lot of different examples.

So you're imagining something more than the mass of the Sun.\nExplainee: [Will] Yeah, or about the mass of the Sun, condensed to the size of a city. It's dense enough that one teaspoon-full would weigh about a billion tons here on Earth.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","22":"Explainer: So what's the connection between neutron stars and black holes?\nExplainee: So, as I understand it, a black hole is sort of like a neutron star's big brother. It's more intense, though. If you have so much matter when a star is collapsing that it can't hold itself up, it collapses to a black hole, and those are so dense that space-time breaks down in some way or another.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","23":"Explainer: Black holes are so amazing that when the neutron star stops and there's something actually there. There's material there. If it's so heavy it becomes a black hole, so it keeps falling, once the event horizon of the black hole forms, which is the shadow, the curve that's so strong that not even light can escape, the material keeps falling. And like you said, maybe space-time breaks down right at the center there, but whatever happens, the star's gone, that black hole is empty. So in a weird way black holes are a place and not a thing.\nExplainee: So is there a sensible way to talk about what's inside a black hole, or is that, should you think of it as there is no space-time inside?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","24":"Explainer: There isn't a sensible way to talk about it yet, and that probably means that's where Einstein's theory of gravity as a curved space-time is beginning to break down, and we need to take the extra step of going to some kind of quantum theory of gravity. And we don't have that yet. So even though the black hole isn't completely understood, we do know that they form astronomically, that in the universe things like neutron stars form and things like black holes form. The consequences are very much speaking to this curved space-time. So, for instance, if two black holes orbit each other, they're like mallets on a drum, and they actually cause space-time to ring, and it's very much part of gravitation. The ringing of space-time itself, we call gravitational waves. And this was something Einstein thought about right away in 1950-1960, he was thinking about that.\nExplainee: Those waves are very exciting for me too because neutron stars orbiting each other also give off gravitational waves and we might be able to get some data about neutron star material from that kind of signal.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","25":"Explainer: Usually if it's math and physics, you end up as a theoretical physicist, right?\nExplainee: Yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","26":"Explainer: Now, in some sense that's kind of trivial to you and me, because of course you have space, which is three dimensional, you have time which is one dimensional, so spacetime is four dimensional. But it didn't turn out, it didn't occur to anyone that that was a sensible way to talk until really relativity. This is the crucial thing, right? Is that what Einstein realized is that sure there's both time and space, but how we divide spacetime into time and space can be different for different people, and really there's a real sense in which four dimensional spacetime is kind of a generalization of three dimensional space. And I think to really explain this we're gonna need a blackboard.\nExplainee: Okay.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","27":"Explainer: Let's bring one in. All right. The thing about relativity is that they really want you to think of spacetime as one four dimensional thing, right? It's kind of like space. It's not just three dimensions of space and one dimension of time.\nExplainee: Why though?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","28":"Explainer: Why? This is a very good question. So, let's just start with space, right? We know a little bit about space. So here's my simple minded way of drawing space two dimensions, because that's how many I can draw on the blackboard. Let's say X and Y. And what is special about space, there's many things, but one is that if I have a curve or a path between two points, there's a distance that you can calculate, right? And the distance between those two points doesn't depend on your coordinates. It doesn't depend on whether you're in radial coordinates or Cartesian coordinates, or whatever. I'm allowed to imagine a curve that does something like this between those two points, and if I were a person walking on that curve, I would have an odometer with me maybe, and I would know, you would know, even without having done that, this path is always gonna be longer than that path. There's a formula, Pythagoras' Theorem that tells you what the shortest distance path is. That's the point. The physical-ness of what is real is the distance along a certain curve. So spacetime is like that. That's why it is useful to think about spacetime.\nExplainee: Okay.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","29":"Explainer: So let me draw spacetime. Here's how we usually draw it. I'll just say X, but all of space is condensed in this one direction, and this is time, okay? So if you're a little person and you started some event, so you start, you're located somewhere in space, somewhere in the three coordinates of space, and whether you like it or not, you're moving through spacetime just by getting older.\nExplainee: Yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","30":"Explainer: And the crucial difference is that time is not the same for this person who stayed behind and sat in their chair, and this person who zoomed out there.\nExplainee: Why is that, that this one's shorter then?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","31":"Explainer: So when Einstein had this idea, oh gravity could be related to the curvature of spacetime, he did some equations, so he got it, that's a long story, we'll put that aside. What he figured out was that rather than gravity living on top of spacetime, it's a manifestation of the curvature of spacetime so when you have like the earth, the sun, the moon, they cause a gravitational field, they're actually warping the spacetime around them. They're giving it a different geometry.\nExplainee: Would it be if I had like a spring or not a spring, but like a sheet, and I dropped a book in the sheet, curves down?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","32":"Explainer: But there are no straight lines, because spacetime itself is curved. So do you think if you had to explain relativity what would you say?\nExplainee: I think I'd go with kind of the train paradox. Let's say I'm stationary, and someone's moving past me on the train, they think they're stationary on the train. Like they think that they're not accelerating, but if they start walking through the train cars, then they are accelerating in their frame, but then from my outside frame where I'm completely removed, I see they are accelerating. So I guess that relativity is all about perspective, I guess in a way.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","33":"Explainer: Harmony is about injecting melody with emotion so that ultimately, you leave home and you return home and you've learned something along the way.\nExplainee: Yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","34":"Explainer: Yeah, I like that, yeah.\nExplainee: Yeah, yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","35":"Explainer: And so when you think about extra dimensions, you put them together with brains and different fields wrapping around the extra dimensions and so forth, right?\nExplainee: Yes.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","36":"Explainer: You know, a lot of people, a lot of string theorists, they care a lot about all the different ways in which we could hide the extra dimensions. As someone who cares about cosmology, I wanna start asking why are the extra dimensions small at all? How did that happen? Is this something you think about yourself?\nExplainee: Yes, well ultimately we'd like to understand the observable universe. If string theory turns out to be the thing that the universe cares about, we'd like to know, with all of these possibilities that are in string theory, how do we get the one that looks like the world we live in?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","37":"Explainer: The thing I want to talk about is this paper I wrote with Matt Johnson and Lisa Randall where we realize there's another way to compactify extra dimensions spontaneously, dynamically. If you imagine starting with this big piece of paper you couldn't wrap up everything, but within some region of space you could make a tube.\nExplainee: Okay.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","38":"Explainer: Why don't you explain to us what a black brane is?\nExplainee: Well in some ways, it's very much like a black hole in that you have far away from it you have these large just flat dimensions. As you move in, there's something in the interior. It has, itself, higher dimensions, and so because physicists love to joke they thought, well it's like a membrane but it can have many different dimensions. Let's use P to stand in for those number of dimensions, and so they called them P-branes.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","39":"Explainer: Yeah, I've been trying to explain this to lower levels, and they always look at me like, are you pulling my leg here a little bit? Or is this the real thing that they use? Yes, it is the real thing they use. We study these branes in de Sitter space, and so what we found is that there are black brane solutions which instead of having a singularity inside are non-singular, and stable, and compactified. Is this a familiar thing? I know things like this have been discussed, right?\nExplainee: Yeah. Yeah. So, a lot of the branes that are relevant for studying things to do with anti-de Sitter spacetimes in various dimensions actually start out as these non-singular type brains, and then you find in the core, there's actually an anti-de Sitter spacetime.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","40":"Explainer: Right. Imagine that rather than going down to a point, it just asymptotes to some fixed radius that continues infinitely far down there. But then you can ask, okay what about the rest of the universe? You have some sphere, some two dimensions compactified, and the balance between the cosmological constant and the electromagnetic field keeps it at a fixed distance.\nExplainee: Right. Good, good.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","41":"Explainer: It's quantum. [laughing] It's a loud, it's of a loud it's gonna happen.\nExplainee: I still laugh from Keanu Reeves I'm afraid. [laughing]\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","42":"Explainer: I know not everyone buys that, right?\nExplainee: Not everyone buys it. There's a big discussion in the literature right now.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","43":"Explainer: If the viewers wanted to know more about how spacetime can emerge from quantum mechanics, they could read the graphic novel you just wrote.\nExplainee: Right, yes. I wrote and drew a graphic novel called The Dialogues: Conversations About the Nature of Universe.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","44":"Explainer: It's what keeps us on the earth.\nExplainee: What?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","45":"Explainer: The reason we're not just flying off the earth is because earth has gravity, so if we throw something up, it comes back down, so that's why when we're walking on the earth, we don't fly off the earth because the earth has gravity, and it keeps us down.\nExplainee: Nice.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","46":"Explainer: Okay. So this is about high intensity lasers. Not only how do you make them, but what was really stopping them being made in both cases is non linear optics. We wanna do something that requires a huge photon density application, and so that's how come we came up with chirped pulse amplification, so that we could stretch the pulse, safely amplify it, then compress it at the end, and then we're ready to do whatever we want at the end. So what do you think the main difference is between the continuous wave laser that you have that runs at 10 watts and a chirped pulse amplifier?\nExplainee: I feel like the continuous laser delivers power at a continuous rate, whereas you want all that power to be delivered in a really, really short time with your amplification.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","47":"Explainer: You haven't? Okay.\nExplainee: So I was always curious, how much further, like what higher power can we go now?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","48":"Explainer: Yes. And maybe what, do pump-probe spectroscopy and watch the cell? Or to ionize it?\nExplainee: I mean I was thinking more on the lines of if we want to, let's say destroy one cell, like a tumor cell or something like that. So that the neighboring areas are not affected but just the cell burns.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","49":"Explainer: {missing part}\n","50":"Explainer: Mostly today, I've been talking a lot about what can we do, what's possible. We think might be possible in the next couple of years. But really at the professional level its more the question of wisdom of what should we be doing.\nExplainee: That's one of the things we're trying to figure out, from an artist and storytelling perspective, what are the things that will make this meaningfully different from what we're used to, like a television on our wall. And we've been finding a lot of things, aspects of virtual reality that very much do that in my opinion. Things that allow you to feel presence, first and foremost, where you get lost, and you have to remind yourself, this isn't actually happening. And things that ultimately allow you to embody other characters. Things where you can actually change your own self-perception and play with neuro-plasticity and teach yourself things that are bizarre and unique.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","51":"Explainer: As an engineer of course, I love quantifiable things. I like saying here's my 18 millisecond motion to photon, here's my angular resolution that I'm improving. I'm doing the color-space right. But you can look not too far back where you say we have blu-ray DVDs at this amazing resolution, but more people want to watch Youtube videos at really bad early internet video speeds. Where there are things that if you deliver a value to people then these objective quantities may not be the most important thing. And while we're certainly pushing as hard as we can on lots of these things that make the experience better in potentially every way or maybe just for videos or for different things. I don't think that its necessary. I've commented that I think usually my favorite titles on mobile that are fully synthetic are ones that don't even try, they just go and do light-mapped, black-shaded. And I think its a lovely aesthetic. I think that you don't wind up fighting all of the aliasing. While you get some other titles that, oh we're gonna be high-tech with our specular bump maps with roughness. And you've got aliasing everywhere, and you can't hold frame rate and its all problematic. While some of these that are clearly very synthetic worlds where its nothing but these cartoony flat-shaded things with lighting, but they look and they feel good. And you can buy that you're in that place. And you want to know what's around that monolith over there.\nExplainee: We did a project called Life of Us, which was exactly that mindset. We were let's embrace low-poly aesthetic and just simple vertex shading. And we ended up realizing, you can embody these various creatures and transform yourself. And when you do that with co-presence of another creature, another human, it makes for a totally magical journey. You don't even think for a second, you actually dismiss the whole idea of photo-realism and embrace that reality for what it is. I think it actually helps put you at ease a little bit.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","52":"Explainer: The end goal of reality, of course in computer graphics people chase photo-realistic form for a long time. And basically, we've achieved it. Photo-realism, if you're willing to throw enough discreet path traced rays at things, you can generate photo-realistic views. And we understand the light really well. Of course it still takes a half hour per frame like it always has, or more, to render the different things. So its an understood problem and given infinite computing power we could be doing that in virtual reality. However, a point that I've made to people in recent years is that, we are running out of More's Law. Maybe we'll see some wonderful breakthrough in quantum structures or whatever--\nExplainee: Or bandwidth, or streaming.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","53":"Explainer: But if we just wind up following the path that we're on, we're gonna get double and quadruple, but we're not gonna get 50 times more powerful than we are right now. We will run into atomic limits on our fabrication. So given that, I'm trying to tell people that, start buying back into optimization, start buying back into thinking a bit more creatively. Because you can't just wait, its not going to get to that point where it really is fixed to those highest degrees just by waiting for computing to be advanced. If we want this to be something used by a billion people then we need it to be lighter, cheaper, more comfortable.\nExplainee: And there's constantly novel UX innovations. Like Google Earth, where the kind of elimination of your periphery as you zoom in and move. And also, giving you the user action to decide where you're going and looking. I'm constantly seeing people coming up with ways to break from the paradigms of actual reality and then introduce mechanisms that work very well.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","54":"Explainer: You know there's tons of opportunities for the synthetic case where you want to be able to have your synthetic fantasy world where everybody is a creature that's created by the computer and simulated reasonably. But of course we've got, you know we still don't do people well simulated. That's a hard problem, we've been beating our heads against it for a long time. I do think we're making progress and I wouldn't bet on that being solved in 10 years, but maybe 20 years. Because it is going to take a lot of AI. Its going to take a lot of machine-learning, where its not going to be a matter of us dissecting all the micro-expressions that people do. Its gonna be lets take every youtube video ever made and run it through some enormous learner that's going to figure out how to make people realistic.\nExplainee: Absolutely, there are these crucial thresholds where you pass a technological hurdle and all of a sudden that unlocks a whole world of creative potential. But I think, to your point very much, we need to solve the actual human and social challenges and turn those into opportunities to figure out how this technology fits into our lives.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","55":"Explainer: [Sean] What kind of science?\nExplainee: I like biology and computer science.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","56":"Explainer: All right, you're in the wrong place. [laughs] We're not gonna be talking about biology or computer science. So we wanna talk about the idea of dimensions. Do you know what dimension is? How we would define dimensions?\nExplainee: I guess, I don't know how to exactly define it, but I know, like the first four.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","57":"Explainer: Right, you know the difference between like one dimension two dimensions, three dimensions, et cetera. So let's do a little experiment here. So there's one dimension. I'll give that to you. Now, here's your task. I'm going to give you another dimension, and I'm gonna ask hold those two things at right angles to each other. It's easy to do. Yeah, so there's no trick here.\nExplainee: [laughing] Yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","58":"Explainer: Well, we could also say how far we are away from the center, just the distance. And then the angle that our little line makes with let's say the X axis.\nExplainee: Yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","59":"Explainer: So that's a different way of giving you two numbers and locating yourself, and we call those polar coordinates. It's a different coordinate system. What we want to do as physicists is look for extra dimensions. Can you imagine, can you think of any way that there could be extra dimensions?\nExplainee: Time?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","60":"Explainer: It's exactly the same thing as latitude and longitude but we put coordinates on the sky.\nExplainee: Oh.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","61":"Explainer: [Sean] And sort of the peels of an orange kind of thing, right?\nExplainee: [Juliana] Yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","62":"Explainer: So far, what do you know about black holes?\nExplainee: I never knew beforehand how hard it was to get actual data of the black holes itself, first of all, they're dark, and, like, they're so far away, it's almost impossible just to get a good image of them. They were discussing a project in which multiple radio telescopes of some sort, like, are, like, pinpointed all across, from Greenland to South America, and, like, and they're trying to get an image of the black hole in the center of our galaxy because, as opposed to just recording its impact on the surrounding stars and planets.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","63":"Explainer: Do you know what gravity is?\nExplainee: It's something that, so, right now, we would be floating if there was no gravity, but since there's gravity we're sitting right down on these chairs.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","64":"Explainer: [Janna] Exactly, the Moon is such a big body compared to anything else very nearby that it has the larger effect, pulling the water of the Earth. But more than the Moon, think about the Sun pulling on the Earth. We orbit the whole Sun, just the way the Earth pulls on the Moon and causes the Moon to orbit us. All of those things are acting on you and me right now.\nExplainee: If gravity was too strong, would we be able to get up?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","65":"Explainer: That's such a good question. No, we actually couldn't. In the Moon, gravity is weaker, you can almost float between footsteps if you look at the astronauts on the Moon. On the Earth, it's harder, 'cause it's bigger. If you go to a bigger, heavier planet, it gets harder and harder. But there are stars that have died that are so dense that there's no way we could lift our arms, no way we could step or walk. The gravity is just way too strong. Do you know how tall you are?\nExplainee: I'm in the fours. In the fours?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","66":"Explainer: Yes.\nExplainee: [Bonet screams] Ooh.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","67":"Explainer: They say that astronauts in space, definitely their spine elongates. There were two twin astronauts, one who stayed here on Earth and the other who went to the International Space Station. He was there for a long time, and when he came back, he was actually taller than his twin brother.\nExplainee: Wow.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","68":"Explainer: Yeah, and that was because gravity wasn't compressing him all the time and he was floating freely in the International Space Station and his spine just kind of elongated. After a while here on Earth though he'll readjust, he'll go back to the same size. Have you ever heard of how gravity was discovered?\nExplainee: Mm-hmm.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","69":"Explainer: Isaac Newton would ponder, how does the Earth cause things to fall? There's a famous story that Isaac Newton was sitting under a tree and the apple fell from the tree and hit him on the head and he had an epiphany and understood this law, this mathematical law for how that works. I don't actually think that's a true story, though.\nExplainee: Yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","70":"Explainer: And a heavy object.\nExplainee: Oh my God. [Janna laughs]\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","71":"Explainer: And so, how much do you think you need?\nExplainee: I mean, I've read that six is ideal for people in my age range.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","72":"Explainer: It turns out, for people that are between the ages of 18 and 65, the agreed upon amount of sleep that people should get is between seven and nine hours, and it's really at least seven hours per night, to maintain optimal health as an adult. So at least seven hours. When we look at across all of the data that is available on like sleep and health, and sleep and psychiatric illness and those types of things, the largest risk is when people get five hours or less. What do you think is responsible for driving how much sleep you need, and things like that?\nExplainee: I mean, I know sleep is kind of regulated by the thalamus and the suprachiasmatic nucleus sending signals to the pineal gland to which kind of secretes melatonin, which tells us when it's time to go to sleep.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","73":"Explainer: Right. You can do part of this level, and you can do the other part, clearly. Got some expertise under your belt, and that's awesome, because I think that everyone should know more about sleep. And so the way that we think about what drives sleep are two independent but related processes and so they have kind of lame names. Process S and process C, and what you've kind of described is process C, and that's the master clock, right? And it helps regulate kind of the rhythms like all over your body, all your cells, and all those kind of things. It drives the release of melatonin from the pineal gland, and melatonin comes online under darkness, so when the sun goes down, your brain knows okay it's time to start getting ready for sleep, and so you start releasing melatonin, which really kind of sets the table for sleeping.\nExplainee: I'm from Hoi, so we have very long days. We have early sunrises, late sunsets. Does that signify less sleep, because we have a shorter amount of time for melatonin to be released?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","74":"Explainer: What is a laser made out of? Well really it's sort of the same thing as a light bulb. Right?\nExplainee: So it's a beam?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","75":"Explainer: So yeah it's a light bulb and there's a couple of mirrors. Now the light bulb has to be a little bit special. It has to be a type of material that can store the energy in an excited state right? It has to stay up there really energetic and sit there for a while so that when the light comes along, it takes that energy and becomes stronger light and then the mirror sends it back and it does it again and again and again and between these two mirrors, it makes the light come out in a nice beam. In a laser, it comes out as a single color. They all come out with their waves at the same time. Every wave peaks at the same time which then makes it a giant wave and it's this giant wave that has a tremendous amount of power. So it can do something like cutting steel. But when you cut steel, or if you were cutting this floor, it's gray, it actually will absorb the light. That's why the light, you don't see it because the light isn't bouncing back or through it. So I like to use demos to explain how my laser works. So I've brought basically a hammer and a nail. I'm sure you've probably hammered a nail before into a piece of wood but the question is, if you asked yourself why it is we hit the big end and it's the tiny end that we put on the piece of wood. We could never pick up a hammer and hit the sharp end and hope this would go in to the piece of wood.\nExplainee: Because it needs to be centered so it can more easily just go in.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","76":"Explainer: That's right. All the force that we apply here, goes all the way through but then it can only basically come out when it contacts the wood in that one tiny spot. And so sometimes it's the force that you push something with but sometimes it is that force per unit area. But sometimes it's not even the force per unit area 'cos, you know, push down as hard as you can on that and see if we can get it pushed in. See it doesn't really work does it?\nExplainee: So the laser needs ultimately many things. It needs to be centered, it needs time to actually penetrate and then it needs--\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","77":"Explainer: Well it depends. So if you're cutting steel, you need to have the nail. You need to have it concentrated all of the light, not going in all directions but you need it into as small a point as possible. And for that we use a lens. For a lens, the light's coming down as a column, you put in a lens, it all focuses it down in the same way as the nail and then it starts cutting that steel. Okay so that force per unit area--\nExplainee: So it's kind of like a magnifying glass? Like it magnifies the light down to a point?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","78":"Explainer: Exactly. You know sometimes you want to have all of your energy not just in a small area but in the small volume and so one of the other dimensions is time or length. But with light, time and length are the same thing because light always travels at the speed of light.\nExplainee: Exactly.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","79":"Explainer: But if you send a one second long light pulse out into the skies there, the beginning of the pulse is actually two thirds of the way to the moon. It's 300,000 kilometers long. So now, if you talk about light being concentrated, that doesn't seem very concentrated. The type of lasers I play with in my lab will be no thicker than this piece of paper. So we take that energy that might be in three hundred thousand kilometers and we squeeze it all the way down into just this piece of paper and actually the beams are more the size of this piece of paper and so, in my lab, pieces of paper like this would be flying through the sky but we can't see them. 'Cos they don't come in our eyes, they fly by us and they're infra red.\nExplainee: There'd be like little concentrated beams of light just flying everywhere?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","80":"Explainer: Exactly. And so now, if we have light like that that we wanna machine with. I bring this funnel and so, if we had a lens here and the light was coming down--\nExplainee: It funnels into--\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","81":"Explainer: Which is, by the way, what, when I was just starting out in graduate school, that was the hot new thing, so.\nExplainee: Exactly.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","82":"Explainer: That was, it was like, oh, wow, this might be it, and then, but very early on, it was, as I just started my, it was basically my second year of graduate school, it was like, uh, this is not that simple.\nExplainee: It isn't.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","83":"Explainer: You know, everybody's been just coming at it from different wavelengths at the optical infrared, and, but definitely the X-rays has been one of those things where it's like, oh, finally.\nExplainee: And we've come a long way by seeing a wider range of the spectrum, we can elucidate more about the circumnuclear geometry, and there's just been so much progress made with all these new spectral models that we use to fit AGN spectra, and the different types of classes of AGN, like type one and type two are believed to be just a viewing angle effect of seeing this torus at different angles.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","84":"Explainer: You try, we all gotta try. You've probably heard about sleep as this kind of, you know, it's a biological process that happens in your brain. It's really important for your body, but it's a lot more complex than that. Sleep is made up of different parts. You know, when you think about sleep, what do you think about?\nExplainee: Resting, relaxing, really shutting down your brain, taking some time off of a busy schedule and work day.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","85":"Explainer: But being off is not just being off. There's lots of things that are happening. We're gonna kind of talk about those different pieces of sleep.\nExplainee: Okay.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","86":"Explainer: So our sleep is made up of different types, okay? The first one is called non-rapid eye movement sleep, or non-REM, okay? Or NREM. And then the other one, which might not be a surprise, is called REM. Rapid eye movement sleep. And those are the two main types of sleep that happen. The way that we measure that as a sleep scientist is that we'll actually bring people into the lab where they can do this at home, where we put electrodes on their scalp while they're sleeping, and that allows us to measure the brain activity that's going on during the night.\nExplainee: Okay. Are you like able to tell how much sleep someone's getting or what their sleep schedule is by REM?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","87":"Explainer: Okay? When do you think you experience the most REM?\nExplainee: Well I've heard that you don't really go into like a deeper sleep, so I'm guessing like N-3, or really any of the N's at all, really, if you are on technology right before you sleep. And also if there's too much light, or if you're listening to music while you're asleep or anything like that, you're not experiencing deep sleep, right?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","88":"Explainer: You know, some of that is totally accurate, that like when your brain's more engaged by being on your phone or doing things that you really enjoy or things that stress you out or any of those types of things, it's harder to get to sleep and to kind of fall into that deeper levels of sleep. Most of the REM sleep, this dreaming sleep, happens in the second half of the night.\nExplainee: Oh.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","89":"Explainer: One to six hours? That's a long nap.\nExplainee: It is a long nap.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","90":"Explainer: So have you taken a quantum mechanics course?\nExplainee: I have. I took that last year.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","91":"Explainer: I think to really get deep into nanomaterials and nanoscale devices, you really have to understand to some level, quantum mechanics. What it teaches us as we make these devices smaller and smaller, their properties begin to now depend on the size and the orientation of these devices. There are materials, and you're taking a 2D materials class, you know about this, that are intrinsically thin. As they're grown, as they're fabricated, they're already at the nanoscale and they possess these quantum confinement properties that as a nanotechnologist, you try to exploit. And so the first ones I wanted to talk to you about are quantum dots, have you heard of quantum dots before?\nExplainee: Yes.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","92":"Explainer: So these are typically semiconductors. They can be cadmium selenide cadmium sulfide, zinc selenide and they're small clusters of atoms. They can be from 2 to 10 nanometers. What's interesting about these materials?\nExplainee: Well, the other day we were talking about the different dimensions you can have of nanotechnology. So all the way from like 0D to 3D. If I remember correctly, my professor labeled it as 0D?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","93":"Explainer: Do you know what this is?\nExplainee: Carbon nanotube?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","94":"Explainer: You're speaking my language. This is what I spent many years of my life working on. You don't physically roll up graphene. You grow nanotubes by basically taking nanocrystals and you deposit them on a surface. And then you do a CVD process, chemical vapor deposition. So you basically flow in a carbon source, the carbon dissolves in a nanocrystal and then once nanocrystal is saturated, the nanotubes precipitate out of them in tubes. Then you have to develop ways to go into this pile of nanotubes and pull out exactly the ones that you want. So I have to find ways to program them to go exactly in the places that I want. I modify the surface of the nanotube with specific molecules that recognize one type of surface over another. And then I just pattern the surface and the tubes just land exactly where we want them to. And it's still very much in the research stage. The ultimate goal is to build functional high-speed electronics using these new materials.\nExplainee: In my nanomaterials class, actually just a couple of days ago, we were talking about different applications of nanotechnology and things we know. And we touched on the topic that right now, silicon is down to the smallest level that it can get. And so we have scientists out there researching other materials, to replace silicon.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","95":"Explainer: Yeah. 100%. That's right. And that's the motivation for looking at these emerging materials. But I would never bet against the innovation and the creativity in this nano electronic space. Tens of thousands of scientists, every time they hit a barrier, at least historically, as a guide, they have found a way to overcome it. It's a real marvel in ingenuity.\nExplainee: I gotta ask. The lights that are behind you, is that related to the quantum dots that you work with at all?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","96":"Explainer: Do you know what machine learning means? Have you heard that before?\nExplainee: No.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","97":"Explainer: And what makes a dog, a dog and a cat, a cat?\nExplainee: Well, dogs are very playful, I think, more than cats. Cats lick themselves more than dogs, I think.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","98":"Explainer: What about this one?\nExplainee: A dog. A cat. I think, a cat? Because it's more skinny. And also, its legs are like really tall and its ears are a little pointy.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","99":"Explainer: And how did you know that it's not a cat or a dog?\nExplainee: Because cats and dogs... Because they walk on their paws and their ears are like right here, not right here, and they don't wear watches.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","100":"Explainer: Are those like the practice problems you do before the test?\nExplainee: Well, just like everything that's gonna be on the test is on the review.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","101":"Explainer: Which means that in the test, you're not seeing any problems that you don't know how to solve. As long as you did all your practice, right?\nExplainee: Yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","102":"Explainer: So machines work the same way. If you show them a lot of examples and give them practice, they'll learn how to guess. And then when you give them the test, they should be able to do that. So we looked at eight pictures and you were able to answer really quickly. But what would you do if I gave you 10 million examples? Would you be able to do that so quickly?\nExplainee: No.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","103":"Explainer: Do you know why we're here today?\nExplainee: Because we're talking about science.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","104":"Explainer: What have you been up to? And yeah, what are you working on?\nExplainee: Lately I've been doing, you know, always a little bit of side channel analysis. So what I really do, you know, is all hardware layer. So I've been looking, you know, at some various devices lately, at how susceptible they are to fault attacks, what that sort of means in real life. You know, not just purely the research side, but also how much should you care about it.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","105":"Explainer: Maybe a mutual acquaintance of ours, Jasper gave a example of fault injection, and I like to use that as, when I'm trying to explain fault injection, he shows a pinball machine and the pinball machine, obviously the two inputs are the two plungers when you're playing a pinball machine, but fault injection, you can tilt the entire pinball machine, right? You're just introducing some external variable that's outside of the traditional inputs that you're used to and you've now controlled the environment in a advantageous way to the user or the player. Can you give an example of some type of fault injection that you're doing or working on?\nExplainee: One of them was looking at, like, a little hardware Bitcoin wallet, and you could use fault injection to actually recover secrets from it, and a lot of devices. I mean, the whole idea is pretty cool, right? Because you tell the device, Hey, I want to authenticate, and it's supposed to run some really crazy math that authenticates it, but instead of doing that crazy math and attacking the math, you just attack the check at the end.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","106":"Explainer: You mean flipping bits within flash?\nExplainee: Yeah, exactly, right. So flipping it in this sort of flash memory. And so someone's done it with x-rays. There's actually, I forget who now. There's a paper, at least one, and it's just like a little plate they make with like a hole in it to concentrate the x-ray source and it works, so yeah, it's super interesting. Like, one bit in memory means a lot, especially in the flash memory side. Yeah, visualizing it would be cool though.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","107":"Explainer: I've never seen... Maybe call it a verifiable visualization of it, right? We know it's true, you know, you can get skin cancer by going outside and having too many high energy particles hit you, but we've never seen it. And we know it can happen to a computer chip, but I've never seen both.\nExplainee: Yeah, so actually, so it's funny you mentioned, like, making it more obvious. I mean, staying on fault injection right now, this is lately what I've been up to. A lot of making a little kind of, you know, like electronics kits of old, right? And you can assemble it all yourself and see how it works. So making something like that for fault injection. So all kind of older logic and stuff like that. So, I mean, it's sort of based on, like, you're presented the little MUX chip. You know, voltage switcher. That sort of idea, using just discreet logic to generate the actual glitch itself. So, but you know, it's part of, I think, this stuff, right? It's like people don't know about it sometimes. Like, even engineers designing systems. It's new to a lot of people.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","108":"Explainer: The thing is, even if you know about that, then there's so many others that someone won't necessarily know about, because there's so many, I guess, potential areas for a fault to occur. Where do you think security is going or new research is going? Are there any new areas you think are coming out or are going to be more interesting, you know, pretty soon?\nExplainee: Fault injection has become pretty interesting. Like, there's been a lot of people poking at that, and I think a lot more products of interest. Side channel still might have a bit of a comeback. Basically, what I kind of see is a lot of the really cool stuff has been in academia because product security hasn't kept up, right? For the longest time, doing these attacks on hardware was pretty straightforward. You didn't need these crazy attacks. It looks like a lot of devices are coming out now that actually have real claims to security, right? More than just a data sheet mentioned. There's actually something behind it.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","109":"Explainer: For me, I think the things that have been recent and super interesting are typically down to physics-level effects that maybe we haven't seen before. I think my mind was blown with the, there was the light commands research, and they were able to modulate sound, although it's purely over light using a laser, they would hit the MEMS microphone, and it was picking that up and was able to then interpret it and essentially take control over light.\nExplainee: I'm curious of the backstory to how they found that. Because if you told me that, right? So you said like, Hey, Colin, you should test this out. I probably would be like, It probably won't even work. Which is like a lot of side channels. When I first heard about it, you know, working, doing firmware stuff, it was like, Oh, that sounds like it's not gonna work. Like, that sounds impossible. You know, the whole area of hardware hacking, it feels kinda like cheating because, you know, as you said, someone designing the system needs to know about so many different ways, right? So there's so many ways to break the system, and if you're designing them, you need to know all of them, but when you're attacking it, you really need to know one, right? So I can know nothing about, like, how does ECC actually work? You know, I have some vague hand-waving I can tell you about, but if you gave me a pen and told me, like, Okay, write it down, specifically the equations and what they mean and how the point model works and stuff. Right, no idea, but designers are like the other side. It's almost like, I don't wanna say the lazy side of it.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","110":"Explainer: So tell me, what do you know about black holes?\nExplainee: Well, I know they're created when stars, once they start growing, it doesn't, it can't expand anymore, so they collapse inward.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","111":"Explainer: You got, pretty much, you got a very good idea about it. Basically you have a star, at the core its generating energy, which is countering the pressure of all that mass trying, being pulled in by gravity. Once it can't generate that energy anymore, the core collapses, once the core is collapsing, it keeps collapsing, and collapsing, and collapsing, and that's the critical thing that makes a black hole. You have enough mass in the volume, such that the escaped velocity becomes the speed of light, once light can't escape, hence the black part. (laughs) But that's the thing, is that just because there's an intense amount of gravity very close to a black hole, things don't start behaving differently. And my favorite analogy is a vacuum, everybody thinks, like, if you point a vacuum cleaner at something, it's just gonna suck everything in--\nExplainee: But no, the wind, the pull isn't, if you're not close enough, it doesn't work.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","112":"Explainer: Right, you will feel the gravitational pull, and it'll redirect you in some way, and if you're far enough way, it's just like you're very far away from the sun, or something else. If you're close enough, it will divert your path more, if you're close enough still, then you will get what are called tidal forces, where the difference between, for example, if you're standing next to a black hole, the difference in gravity between your feet and your head actually becomes significant. Next time you see a science fiction movie, if somebody says, Oh, my god, we've been caught in the gravitation field of a black hole, and we're gonna fall in, it's like, no, no, just, if you're far enough away, just thrust a little bit this way, and then you'll slingshot around the black hole.\nExplainee: So are there any movies that actually do, like, get space right?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","113":"Explainer: I wouldn't call them educational, but the movie Interstellar actually had, as one of the people involved in both writing it, and as a science advisor, Dr. Kip Thorne, who's a Professor at Caltech, who was part of the team that detected gravitational waves, and just won a Nobel Prize for it. So he made sure to try and get it as accurate as possible, so Interstellar, I think, is one of the best examples of getting black holes right.\nExplainee: So it's, I'm assuming it's hard to, like, detect a black hole, besides if it's, if things are close enough that they're being pulled in, so it's basically a theory?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","114":"Explainer: You know, we first met 10, 11 years ago and machine learning has changed a lot since then.\nExplainee: Tooling that we now have, the capacity, and also, an elevation of the problem sets that we're dealing with and how to frame the problem. And I'm almost struggling to figure out whether it's a blessing or curse that it has become as accessible and as democratized and as easy to execute and you just build another new company from scratch. And so, what's been, kind of, your reflection on that?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","115":"Explainer: Well, you're absolutely right that the attention machine learning gets has grown dramatically. 20 years ago, going to gatherings and telling people what I was working on and seeing the blank face or the like, Where's the turn? and walk away. Like, Oh, no. The accessibility of the tooling, like, we can now do in, like, five lines of code something that would have taken 500 lines of very mathematical, messy, gnarly code even, you know, five years ago. And that's not an exaggeration. And there are tools that mean that pretty much anyone can pick this up and start playing with it and start to build with it. And that is also really exciting.\nExplainee: In contrast, what I'm struggling with, the friend of mine who asked me to look at some health care data for him. And despite the capabilities that we're having in all of the, kind of, bigger societal problems alongside with data collection engineering, all the gnarly stuff, that is actually not the machine learning itself, it's the rest of it where certain data isn't available. And to me, it's staggering how difficult it is to get it off the ground and actually use.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","116":"Explainer: And part of the challenge of it is not the mathematics of building models, but the challenge is making sure that the data is sufficiently representative, potentially high quality.\nExplainee: And how transparent do I need to build it for it to be adopted at some point? What types of biases in the data collection, and then also in the usage? We now call it the bias, but we're still struggling with the society not really living up to its expectations and then machine learning, bringing it to the forefront.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","117":"Explainer: Right. And so, to say that another way, when you're collecting data from the real world and then building machine learning systems that automate decisions based on that data, all of the biases and problems that are already in the real world then can be magnified through that machine learning system. And so, it can make many of these problems much worse.\nExplainee: Feeling increasingly challenged that my skillset of being very good at programming has become somewhat secondary. And it's feeling... [both laugh] It's really the bigger picture understanding of Who would be using that? How transparent do I need to build it for it to be adopted at some point? What types of biases in the data collection and then also in the usage? I think, in certain areas, we have societal expectations as to what is fair and what isn't.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","118":"Explainer: And so, it's not just the provenance of that data, but it's, sort of, deeply understanding, Why does it look the way it looks? Why was it collected this way? What are the limitations of it? We need to think about that in entire process, how we document that process. This is an issue in companies where somebody might create something that even their peers can't recreate.\nExplainee: What have you seen in terms of which industries, where they stand, like who is adopting now? Who is ready to utilize it? Where would you maybe wish that didn't even try? [Hilary laughs]\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","119":"Explainer: These are great questions. So things like actuarial science, operations research, where they actually are not using machine learning as much as you might think. And then you have other sorts of companies or on the FinTech side, or even the ad tech side of things where they perhaps are using machine learning to the point of even absurdity.\nExplainee: So I spent about eight years working in ad tech. And the motivation was really because it was such an amazingly exciting playground to push that technology that used to largely live in academia, really, out in the world and see, kind of, what it can achieve. It has created such a hunger for data that now everything is being collected. I'm curious, when are we going to make a foray into things like agriculture about smart production of the things we eat? You see and hear these interesting stories, but I feel like we're not ready yet to put that into a economically viable situation.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","120":"Explainer: So when we think about the next five to 10 years, the things that are really still holding us back are these uneven applications of resources to problems because the problems that get attention are the high value ones in terms of how much money you can make or the things that are fashionable enough that you can publish a paper on it. So what do you think is holding us back?\nExplainee: I fully agree on the steps you pointed out and the processes. I think there is a chicken and egg problem, like your former example, that these areas that need to wait for data, the value of the data collection is then also slightly less apparent. And so, it gets delayed further and you'll see that happening. But what my experience has been, there's unfortunately, I feel a drifting apart between academia and the uses of AI, but I am somewhat frustrated with a generation of students who have standard data sets that they never think about what the model needs to be used for, that they never have to think about how the data was collected. So with all of these challenges ahead of us, how optimistic are you about this world that I deeply believe we can create and the steps towards it?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","121":"Explainer: {missing part}\n","122":"Explainer: A lot of origami is animals, birds and things. There's also a branch of origami that is, it's more abstract or geometric, called tessellations. Tessellations, like most origami, are folded from a single sheet of paper but they make patterns, whether it's woven patterns like that, or woven patterns like this. If you hold them up to the light you can see patterns.\nExplainee: Wow.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","123":"Explainer: The thing that makes them cool is they're sort of like tilings, it looks like you could put this together by cutting little pieces of paper and sliding them together, but they're still one sheet.\nExplainee: They weren't cut?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","124":"Explainer: There's no cuts in these just folding. We can build these up from smaller building blocks of folds, learn how to fold little pieces and put them together in the same way that a tiling like this looks like it's built up of little pieces. Can you make a fold that starts at the dot that doesn't run all the way across the paper?\nExplainee: How about like that?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","125":"Explainer: Mm-hmm. Each of these folds is peaked like a mountain and we call these mountain folds but if I made it the other way, then it's shaped this way and we call it a valley fold. In all of origami there's just mountains and valleys.\nExplainee: So all the folds are reversible?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","126":"Explainer: Yeah.\nExplainee: No, I don't think so.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","127":"Explainer: We have to use electron microscopes and then what we have been developing a way to slice the brain into really thin slices, use an electron microscope to take a picture of each slice, and then use computers to put it all back. Imagine that we could get a map of every connection, right? And we knew how neurons fire. Do you think we could put that in a computer, that map, and then therefore, that computer should be able to think just like the brain that we extracted it from?\nExplainee: Well, the computer only communicates with itself in binary so it only has two options, it can only ask itself yes or no questions, but a human brain has an infinity of directions that it can go.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","128":"Explainee: So how do you do your observations in optical and infrared?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","129":"Explainer: So fortunately there's, I'm also doing it from space with the Spitzer Space Telescope, so particularly in the infrared, and my main interest has been to try and study the environment around the super massive black holes, not as close as where the X-rays are coming from, but clearly there's something from the X-ray corona that illuminates the rest of the accretion disk, and the dust that's further out. And so fundamentally, that's one of the key things that I'm trying to use, is trying to see how long, once you've got this sort of pulse that's generated close to the black hole, it propagates out, and so you can use optical wavelengths to see that the accretion disk lights up in the optical a little bit as it gets heated up from the X-ray, and then later on, the infrared dust, the dust absorbs it, and emits it in the infrared. And so that, I love that, the ability to exchange time for resolution, because these structures are so far away that we're never gonna get a telescope big enough where that has the resolution to see the accretion disk, or the dust distribution around--\nExplainee: So do you get dimensions of the disk out of that?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","130":"Explainer: Yeah, again, we don't know exactly where X, Y, Z, zero is, we're assuming that it's something, you know, the X-rays that are coming out are very close to the event horizon of the black hole, but this is still, you know, your realm of X-rays, to really figure out those kinds of things. But once the X-rays, once the photons hit the corona, and are re-scattered, and up, energized, and then they start illuminating the accretion disk, it heats it up, and so just by the light travel time, when the optical, if it gets, you know, brighter and fainter, and then the infrared gets brighter and fainter, two weeks later, then the dust is two light weeks away from that. So it's a one dimensional one, so we're averaging, so we don't get the two dimensional, or even three dimensional one. And then we've done it now, of course, we have better telescopes, there was a project where you could do it with the Hubble Space Telescope and the ultraviolet, you used the Swift Observatory, which had optical and ultraviolet, and then from ground base, we did optical, and then from space we did it with Spitzer and the infrared. So you could actually see this bright flash go off in a nearby AGN called NGC5548, and then you see it propagate as it warms up the disk, as all that light is falling onto it, and then eventually you hit the, the, further away, where the dust is, and the dust tends to radiate in an infrared. So we got basically a structure, and you just, you see this flashbulb go off, and then it illuminates, effectively, the structure.\nExplainee: So you can map out the dust, where do you see it?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","131":"Explainer: So you do see it, basically the dust sublimation radius, and you see it at, and it tells you, depending on what kind of dust it is, and it's actually one of the problems for me studying, whenever we try and do X-ray studies of low luminosity active galactic nuclei in your, by galaxies, because there're all these X-ray binaries that are also emitting X-rays, which make our lives difficult. But they're also in black holes, when it's this really interesting sort of both, it's great, but ugh, it's also a source of noise for those of us who are trying to do X-ray observations of nearby galaxies.\nExplainee: We have the same problem, we can't see the actual black hole underneath all these very bright X-ray binaries.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","132":"Explainer: Which is great, although it still doesn't help us in the AGN community, because we don't know how the millions to billions solar mass black holes came to be. But it's, at least we're building up, or hopefully that at some point, and by understanding these lower mass, how these lower mass black holes came to be, then we can see where there are a large scale number of mergers can potentially give us this, or you really need something, other, another corridor to fundamentally get us something that's a million solar masses, you know, on the minimum side, but definitely, you know, we've gotten those which are billion. So we know we can merge the million solar mass black holes to get the bigger ones, but how do you get to those in the beginning, particularly so early in the universe, when you get quasars at really high red shifts, so they're really early on.\nExplainee: Yeah, it is odd, it is very odd. I mean, the other thing that's a little odd, now we're going back to stellar mass black holes is, so we look at a lot of supernova remnants, and we, so we see them, we can only really see them in our own galaxy, and so we have a lot of supernova remnants, and so how we see them is, you see the expelled mass from the star as it died, so that creates an extended source, and then you look for the compact object that was left behind. And what's interesting is that you see, you quite often see the neutron stars because they pulse, so they're easy to see, but so far, we've not found a single black hole at the center of a supernova remnant. And so, which is interesting, so you say, you should see them, you know, you ought to see some fallback, you know, you need some matter, you need something, but no, never, not yet been detected.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","133":"Explainer: And this goes to the idea that you don't have a core balance, that a supernova with a black hole as its final result, actually never has any kind of expulsion, that it all just goes. (imitates sucking)\nExplainee: Yeah, that might be, yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","134":"Explainer: So what are some of the techniques you're applying to look at that debate data?\nExplainee: Something I'm interested in exploring is how well it works to use deep learning and sort of automatically extracted features from this text versus using some of the more traditional techniques that we have, things like lexicons or some sort of template matching techniques for extracting features from texts. That's a question I'm just interested in, in general. When do we really need deep learning versus when can we use something that's a little bit more interpretable, something that's been around for a while?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","135":"Explainer: So is that where some of that frustration around the lack of controllability and interpretability comes from?\nExplainee: Yeah, if you're building a model that just predicts the next thing based off of everything it's seen from texts online, then yeah, you're really gonna be replicating whatever that distribution online is.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","136":"Explainer: If you train a model off of language off the internet, it sometimes says uncomfortable things or inappropriate things and sometimes really biased things. Have you ever run into this yourself? And then how do you think about that problem of potentially even measuring the bias in a model that we've trained?\nExplainee: Yeah, it's a really tricky question. As you said, these models are trained to, sort of, predict the next sequence of words, given a certain sequence of words. So we could start with just, sort of, prompts like the woman was versus the man was, and, kind of, pull out common words that are, sort of, more used with one phrase versus the other. So that's, sort of, a qualitative way of looking at it. It's not ever kind of a guarantee of how the model is gonna behave in one particular instance. And I think that's what's really tricky and that's why I, sort of, think it's really good for creators of systems to just be honest about, This is, sort of, what we have seen. And so then, someone can make their own judgment about, Is this gonna be too high risk for, sort of, my particular use case?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","137":"Explainer: So we've been talking about gravity from Newton and celestial bodies, the Earth, the Moon, pulling on each other in the conventional sense of gravity being an attractive force, to the Earth creating curves in space-time, then we moved on to just diffused seas of energy and space-time as the real universe and gravitation is really just talking about space-time in general, and here we are, and you're really hardcore in theoretical physics. Where would you take the exposition of gravity from that point?\nExplainee: Well, one thing is quantum mechanics. Quantum mechanics is the most successful theory in the history of science, it explains the most different phenomena the most precisely. Yet many people would still say we don't understand even the basics of it.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","138":"Explainer: To have the waves together.\nExplainee: Yeah, and in two states and in two possible states of the world, you can just literally put a plus sign between them and that's a sensible state, that's a good state, it makes sense.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","139":"Explainer: So do you think there's some sense in which we shouldn't be thinking about individual universes, individual space-time, so we should be thinking about superpositions of space-times?\nExplainee: Yeah, I think so. I think if you were to go far enough back in the history of the universe, back to when it was very, very dense, very small, and when quantum mechanics was certainly important, then it must have been like that. I mean, if we believe that the dominant standard model of cosmology, something had to produce the density perturbations, the things that seeded all the galaxies and stars and everything else in the world. So there's a galaxy over there, let's say, and not over there, so how did that happen? Why is there a galaxy there and not there? In the standard theory, as you know, that was a quantum event, a random event. And it doesn't mean that if happened there and not there 'cause you flipped a coin, it actually happened in both places. There's gotta be a wave function where in one branch of the wave function there's a galaxy there and not there, and on the other branch it's the opposite.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","140":"Explainer: So when we're talking about the multiverse or the Big Bang, we are really talking about gravity ultimately, and we're talking about how a theory of gravitation which we know think of as a theory of space-time has a quantum explanation, has a quantum paradigm imposed on it that will help us understand these things, and we don't have that yet. One of the things that I think is so amazing is that the terrains in which we're going to understand quantum gravity are very few. It's the Big Bang, because that's where we know that quantum and gravity both were called into action. And there's black holes. One of the most interesting discoveries is of course Hawking's discovery, kick-started a kind of crisis, right? In thinking about why quantum mechanics and gravity were so knocking heads. It was one of the most beautiful examples.\nExplainee: Sure, yeah, it is a beautiful, beautiful idea. So, first of all, to be totally clear, though, we've never observed Hawking radiation, which is what he predicted, directly. I don't think very many people doubt that it's there, but yeah, Hawking discovered mathematically that when you have a black hole, it's got an event horizon, it's got a surface which is a point of no return. If you fall through that surface, no matter what you have, no matter how powerful the rocket you've got, even if you beam a flashlight back behind you in the direction you fall from, nothing escapes, not even light. It all gets sucked in and spaghettified and destroyed at the singularity, or something, something happens, but it doesn't get out. But in quantum mechanics, you can't really pin down the location of something precisely. If you try to pin down an electron in a tiny circuit in a microchip, sometimes you discover it's not actually there and then your computer crashes.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","141":"Explainer: Right.\nExplainee: You know, you try to pin something down near a black hole, well, it's a surface, it's got a particular radius for a round black hole, and wanna say something is inside or outside, well, you can't absolutely say that in quantum mechanics. And this kind of uncertainty produces a radiation, which you can think of as pulling some of the energy out of the black hole. The black hole is formed out of some mass and there's an energy in that. If you think of pulling some energy out of that and sending it off to infinity in the form of particles being admitted. And what Hawking found is that it's a thermal spectrum, it looks like a hot, or not so hot for a large black hole, but like an oven, the kind of radiation that comes out of a cast iron.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","142":"Explainer: Practical purposes.\nExplainee: Yes.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","143":"Explainer: So this is a huge crisis 'cause either quantum mechanics is wrong, and as you described it, it's the most accurately-tested paradigm in the history of physics, how could it be wrong, right? Or the event horizon is letting information out and violating one of the most sacred principles of relativity.\nExplainee: One thing about quantum mechanics is that any time you have a state of the world and another state of the world, you can literally add them together and get a third possible state, as crazy as that sounds. And so if you're gonna have a quantum theory of gravity, then we can't really talk about there being a black hole or not a black hole, or an event horizon or not an event horizon, because we could always a state that had an event horizon and a state that doesn't, or has the event horizon in a slightly different position, maybe, and add them together. So the existence or position of an event horizon can't possibly be determined as a fact any more than the position of an electron is determined. So I think that's the loophole.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","144":"Explainer: That's a nice way of looking at it. So that you're not actually violating classical relativity once you're in a regime where the wave function has really peaked around a very well-defined stage.\nExplainee: That's right, and one of the most exciting developments in the last 10 or 20 years is called holography, and it's called holography because a hologram is a two-dimensional surface that creates a three-dimensional image. It's got sort of 3D information built into it. And this, in a fundamental way, really has that 3D or higher dimensional information built into it. It's exactly the same as this theory of gravity and more dimensions.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","145":"Explainer: Right, exactly. And the most knowledge you could ever have would only be on a two-dimensional surface.\nExplainee: Right, and as big as the universe, and then you're done. So, you know, not likely that we're ever gonna hit that limit any time soon.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","146":"Explainer: I mean, temperature is still great to talk about. It doesn't mean we shouldn't talk about temperature. I mean, we should absolutely adjust our thermostats and talk about temperature. But if we look at it closer and closer and closer, we realize there's not a thing in the world that has as a quantum value temperature, isolated. And so maybe there is no such thing as gravity isolated from quantum mechanics.\nExplainee: Right, so I guess with the holographic description we've got two sides, which are actually secretly the same. On one side there's definitely no gravity. On the other side, well, it's a quantum theory of gravity, whatever that means. But the point is you can get it out, it's equivalent to this theory.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","147":"Explainer: [Robert] Would you like to give it a try?\nExplainee: Sure.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","148":"Explainer: So you ready?\nExplainee: Yep.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","149":"Explainer: Okay. We're going to start with a model that every Japanese person learns in kindergarten, it's called a crane, traditional origami design, it's over 400 years old. So, people have been doing what we're about to do for 400 years.\nExplainee: Wow.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","150":"Explainer: Let's fold it in half from corner to corner, unfold it and then we'll fold it in half the other direction, also corner to corner but we're going to lift it up and we're going to hold the fold with both hands. We're going to bring these corners together, making a little pocket and then, this is the trickiest part of this whole design, so you're going to put your finger underneath the top layer and we're going to try to make that layer fold right along the edge. Now you see how the sides kind of want to come in as you're doing that?\nExplainee: Yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","151":"Explainer: It's called a petal fold, it's a part of a lot of origami designs and it's key to the crane. Now we're ready for the magic. We're going to hold it in between thumb and forefinger, reach inside, grab the skinny point that's between the two layers, which are the wings, and I'm going to slide it out so it pokes out at an angle. We'll take the two wings, we spread them out to the side and you have made your first origami crane.\nExplainee: Wow.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","152":"Explainer: Now, this is a traditional Japanese design but there are origami designs that have been around so long we're not entirely sure where they originated. We're going to learn how to fold a cootie catcher.\nExplainee: Okay, good.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","153":"Explainer: Sure, and people are working on that already.\nExplainee: Yeah, yeah, exactly. And it's this very fruitful area of research, and you can find yourself looking like 20 years out, right, where you have an enormous number of electric cars. You have all of these batteries. That's essentially a distributed peak load power grid, right. Like, the cars are getting plugged in and unplugged at different times. If you have a mechanism that's able to automatically and autonomously be distributing power based on batteries that are scattered throughout the grid that are being used for other purposes. Their owners don't even necessarily need to be aware. I mean, to have something that looks like a much more viable society that still has a lot of electricity needs but is able to base that much more on renewables, is able to make up the difference during peak load periods or during differences in weather, that is able to have power much closer to where it is needed rather than having to be distributed over great distances. It's like, that's something that would be an enormously hard problem to solve. And it's not that the blockchain makes it easy, but it makes it possible.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","154":"Explainer: Where is this technology? Why haven't I seen any change yet?\nExplainee: (laughs) Yes, yes, yes.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","155":"Explainer: And it's because we've had a lot of PR, a lot of proof of concept, but truthfully, this is more like a science, right?\nExplainee: Yes.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","156":"Explainer: The system we have today is also broken. (laughs) Right?\nExplainee: Yes.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","157":"Explainer: In that it's hard to compare it to some perfect future. Just like you compare autonomous vehicles to this very high standard because machines are doing it. It should be perfect. There should be zero car deaths.\nExplainee: (laughs) Yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","158":"Explainer: Do you know what computer hacking is?\nExplainee: It's bad. Like, I'm going into someone's personal account or account, changing some stuff or just stealing some information or your money.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","159":"Explainer: What they're trying to do is they're trying to even prevent the bad hackers from getting in in the first place.\nExplainee: So they put like a protection account or something.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","160":"Explainer: Yeah, exactly. They're looking for ways that they can create protection. It's kind of like the lock on your front door. That lock is to essentially prevent bad people from coming in or people accidentally coming in when they shouldn't. A hacker is essentially looking at a way, how can I get into this lock? But then there are the good ones who are trying to unlock it so that they can tell the company that made the lock, hey, we can actually protect people by making the lock a little harder.\nExplainee: What would they do about the people and the broken lock?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","161":"Explainer: In many cases, they'll send them a new lock. So it's an upgraded, better version. Sometimes that's new features, but sometimes that's bug fixes and ways to protect you as well.\nExplainee: But like, they may get arrested because they might get mistaken.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","162":"Explainer: I started doing the good hacking when I turned nine years old.\nExplainee: Wow.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","163":"Explainer: I started going on the computer and playing video games, but I had some ideas of my own, and that's where I started to learn how to hack. I wanted to play with my friends on this video game and just change the way that things look.\nExplainee: But that would be kinda bad, because maybe the creator did it for a reason.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","164":"Explainer: That's entirely possible. They may have done it for a reason, but you may have come up with a really good idea that, do you think there are other people who might like the idea that you came up with?\nExplainee: Yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","165":"Explainer: What do you think of when you think of nanotechnology?\nExplainee: It kind of seems very science fiction.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","166":"Explainer: Yeah, so modern computer chips rely heavily on nanotechnology. Does this look familiar to you? Can you guess what this might be?\nExplainee: I don't know.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","167":"Explainer: So this is a silicon wafer, and they're embedded in basically almost every object that you use, from a laptop, to a phone, to cars, television sets, appliances. We ended up cutting these into little squares and those repeating patterns, each of those is a processor. And those chips are what goes into all of these objects. What I want to talk to you about is how we got from where we started, and how we're able to actually fit 18 billion of these little devices in a little one inch by one inch area. They're called transistors. It's a switch. Very simply, think of it as a light switch that turns on and turns off using an electric field by applying a voltage.\nExplainee: OK.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","168":"Explainer: I went through my kid's Lego bins to build a very simple model of a transistor. And these are wired together in circuits so that you can do computation. You can do logic with them. Where nanotechnology comes into play, the way you double the number of transistors on a chip. Can you guess what you would have to do to this transistor?\nExplainee: You make it smaller?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","169":"Explainer: You have to make it smaller. Exactly. But here's the problem. So about 10 to 15 years ago, the devices got so small that if you shrunk them this gate, that actually turns it on and off loses its ability to control the channel. And so what they did, was they took devices like this into these things, we call them, FinFETs, kind of like a fin on a fish. So they're very thin transistors. The width of these fins is only six nanometers. Okay? So 6 nanometers is 25 to 30 atoms across. And they repeat this over the entire wafer just about perfectly. It's just a huge feat in engineering. But these types of devices are exactly the kind of devices that your phones and computers either have, or will have in the near future. And it's a way that nanotechnology is directly impacting you right now.\nExplainee: How do you make stuff that small? Obviously it's not handmade, so is it factories and stuff?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","170":"Explainer: That's a really good question. It's actually a way that we can trade. Do you know what trade is?\nExplainee: Mmm-hmm, it's when you take turns doing something. It's when you give up most of what you want, right?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","171":"Explainer: Yeah.\nExplainee: If I could trade with any kid, I would trade, well, I would trade something I don't like so much.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","172":"Explainer: Oh, that's pretty cool. What do you know about computer hacking?\nExplainee: I don't really know much about computer hacking actually.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","173":"Explainer: Okay. With computer hacking, it's actually the same thing. Really, you have some sort of system and you have a bunch of inputs and you have some sort of output, and actually you, as the designer, you're essentially designing games and software. You're saying, well, I will only allow a user to really control these inputs. Can you think of any inputs the computer might have?\nExplainee: [Linda] Space bar.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","174":"Explainer: That's absolutely another input that exists on your computer. That's how I try to think of things is there's just a bunch of inputs. Often, if you're trying to break something or hack something, you're really saying, okay, how can I control these inputs in a way that wasn't necessarily expected?\nExplainee: What inputs would you normally use to hack?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","175":"Explainer: Typically, it's going to be something like the keyboard, right? I'm just going to be typing keystrokes to be talking to some piece of software or hardware, but other times it can be other things like even the temperature of a computer can actually affect how the computer operates, and it might be advantageous to me to cool down the computer and actually slow down the movement of electrons in something like memory, so that if a computer shuts off, it stores something that wasn't memory like a password and stores it for a long enough time that I might be able to actually extract it through some other methods.\nExplainee: How long does it take to get in?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","176":"Explainer: So you're saying gravity pulls things down, yet we've launched things into space. Do you ever wonder how we do that?\nExplainee: Isn't it like a slingshot, like if you pull something back enough it'll go in the opposite direction?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","177":"Explainer: Well, that's true, we do use slingshot technology once things are out in the solar system. So, for instance, we use Jupiter and other planets so that when some of the spacecraft gets close, it'll slingshot around and it'll cause it to speed up. But mostly, around the Earth, gravity pulls things down, so when we want to send a rocket into space, when we wanna go to the Moon, when we wanna send supplies to the International Space Station, the trick is to get something moving fast enough that it escapes the gravitational pull of the Earth. Have you heard the expression what goes up must come down? It's actually not true. If you throw it fast enough, you can actually get something that doesn't come back down again, and that's basically how rocket launches work. You have to get the rocket for the Earth to go more than 11 kilometers a second. Think of how fast it is. Just one breath and it's gone 11 kilometers. If you get it to go that fast, it's not gonna come back down again. So you know the International Space Station which is orbiting the Earth? That's going around the Earth at 17,000 miles an hour. It has no engines anymore, the engines are turned off. So it's just there falling forever. So once it's out there, it's not coming back down as long as it's cruising like that.\nExplainee: And does the gravity pull it or is it just floating?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","178":"Explainer: In a weird way, that is gravity pulling it. So have you ever had a yo-yo where you swing it around like this? The string is pulling it in at all times, but you've also given it this angular momentum. And as long as you give it the angular momentum, pulling it in actually keeps it in orbit. And so the Earth is pulling it in at all times, so that's why it doesn't just travel off in a straight line. It keeps coming back around. So it's funny, people think that the International Space Station is so far away that they're not feeling gravity, and that's not the case at all. They're absolutely feeling gravity. They're just cruising so fast that, even though they're being pulled in, they never get pulled to the surface.\nExplainee: It's like that ride at the rollercoasters where you go in and it's spins super fast and you can't feel it spinning fast but--\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","179":"Explainer: Yeah, you feel pinned to that. It's exactly like that. There's something called the equivalence principle where people realized, especially Einstein, that if you were in outer space in a rocket ship and it was dark and painted and it was accelerating at exactly the right rate, you actually wouldn't know if you were sitting on the floor of a building around the Earth or if you were on a rocket ship that was accelerating.\nExplainee: That's crazy.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","180":"Explainer: Yeah. You ever had that experience where you're sitting in a train and the other one moves and for a second you're not sure if you're the one moving?\nExplainee: Yeah, 'cause I go on the train every day to go to school, but I never feel like I'm moving when I'm in the train, and then I'm like, wait, what?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","181":"Explainer: That's because in some sense, you're really not. Imagine you're in this train and it's going near the speed of light relative to the platform, but it's so smooth, then you should be in a situation in which there's no meaning to your absolute motion, there's no absolute motion. So that if you throw a ball up, you might think from the outside of the platform, be confused that when gravity pulls that back down, it's gonna hit you or something, but it'll land in your palm as surely as if you were in your living room.\nExplainee: Isn't that kinda crazy? Amazing.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","182":"Explainer: So let me tell you where it gets really crazy.\nExplainee: [Maria laughs]\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","183":"Explainer: So, let's say you and Marina are floating in space and you can't tell who's moving. Let's say you both see a flash of light. A flash of light comes from somewhere, you don't know where. So you measure the speed of light to be 300,000 kilometers per second. But here comes Marina and she's racing at the light pulse, as far as you can tell. Two cars driving towards each other seem like they're going faster towards each other than somebody who's standing still relative to one of the cars, right?\nExplainee: Yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","184":"Explainer: Mine too, because I get to spend all day studying it. Because you know what sleep does for you?\nExplainee: It rests your body, like an electric car.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","185":"Explainer: They're pretty cool, right?\nExplainee: Mhm.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","186":"Explainer: And so what's really cool about this is that giraffes need to sleep like everybody else, and so the way that it does is it kind of slumps over and it gets down on its legs and it kind of becomes this ball, but what's crazy about the whole thing is they only sleep for like 30 minutes a day. 30 minutes! Because it can't waste any more time, because it can't be vulnerable for any longer. It can get eaten by lions and that kind of thing. It has kind of evolved in a way that it can still survive and still get all the restoration it needs under such a short period of time.\nExplainee: And how does it like recharge, like humans?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","187":"Explainer: And how did you feel?\nExplainee: Really tired.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","188":"Explainer: A hippopotamus. They have a different challenge. They sleep underwater.\nExplainee: I could never do that, I would pass out.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","189":"Explainer: Would it be cool to have that power?\nExplainee: Uh yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","190":"Explainer: So now I want to talk about our last animal, and I think this one is probably the most amazing of all. Okay, so what's this?\nExplainee: Aww a dolphin.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","191":"Explainer: A dolphin! Yes. So dolphins, kind of like hippos, have to sleep in the water, okay? But because they're mammals, right, they need to breathe. Dolphins breathe air. They have to go up to the surface and breathe, right? And for an animal like that, it needs to figure out a way that it can sleep but also still survive, right? You know how dolphins sleep?\nExplainee: How?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","192":"Explainer: I wanted to talk to you about a specific type of science called nanotechnology. Have you ever heard of this word before?\nExplainee: Nhn nhn.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","193":"Explainer: Nano is kind of a funny word, right? It's a word that's used before another word, and it means one billion. What's the smallest object you can think of?\nExplainee: A baby ant?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","194":"Explainer: A baby ant? Very good. So I have over here a meter stick, let me show it to you. And so that's a meter and if I divide it by 1000, I get a millimeter. So milli just means 1000. There's all these little lines on the ruler. And each of those little lines is one millimeter. So a baby ant is probably a couple of millimeters. So even the thing, that's the smallest thing you can think of, it's a million times bigger than a nanometer. Tiny, tiny, tiny.\nExplainee: Tiny, tiny, tiny, tiny.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","195":"Explainer: If I took this stick and I was to draw 1 billion lines, the distance between those two lines would be one nanometer. So that's really all it is. It's just a measure of size. But it's really, really, really tiny, smaller than anything that we can see with our eyes. The reason why, in nanotechnology, scientists, we care about things that are that small, is because there are objects called atoms. Have you ever heard of atoms before?\nExplainee: Yes. I first heard of them on a show I watched called StoryBots. They're just little things that make up everything on Earth, even earth.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","196":"Explainer: That was a perfect explanation. But what if I told you that scientists invented a special type of microscope that not only lets you see atoms, but also lets you move them around and build things with them. Would you think that would be pretty cool?\nExplainee: Yeah!\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","197":"Explainer: You are definitely a second grader! [laughing] My daughter would probably answer the exact same way. A unicorn would be awesome.\nExplainee: Why do you study stuff so small?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","198":"Explainer: {missing part}\n","199":"Explainer: You know an interesting topic is: what are the limits to what we can do with virtual reality? Where I'm pretty pleased with what we have today. What we can show people and say virtual reality, its cool. People get an amazing response from it. But we're still clearly a very, very long ways from reality.\nExplainee: That kinds of notes back to Realism in our history and how Realism was a response to Romanticism. And Realism was meant to capture the mundane, everyday lives of individuals and not idealize any of their activities in any way. And I think that that's really important for virtual reality. I think its kind of rite-of-passage for any kind of our technology to go through.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","200":"Explainer: Mostly in VR we talk about the display and optics, the visual side of things, but we should at least tick off the other senses. And haptics is an interesting thing about virtual reality really doesn't have that aspect of touching things. You can move your hands around, you can do everything but its a disconnected experience because you know you don't have an actual solidity there. And I am pessimistic about progress in haptics technology. Almost all other areas I'm an optimist and I'm excited about what's coming up, but I don't have any brilliant vision about how we're going to revolutionize haptics and make it feel like we're touching the things in the virtual world.\nExplainee: So I've tried the demos, at VRLA there's one that has waves, like audio waves I believe, that come up and then you can put your hands through that and feel the waves whenever you're supposed to be feeling bubbles or any kind of force field or something. And those are pretty interesting. I've seen some pretty interesting things that you can do with audios, you can cut down a lot of the storage I guess and the power that you would need in order to power a huge scene, you can just mimic the sounds of those scenes actually being there and they're not actually. For example, a professor at USC would have the sound of a train drive by without actually rendering the sound. And you would feel like you're deeply immersed in this world without having to have such an expensive scene built around you. So I think those are pretty significant.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","201":"Explainer: Yeah, that is one potential quality improvement that is still on the horizon is when we do spatialization, we use HRTF, the Head Relative Transfer Function, to make it sound like its in different places. But usually we just use this one kind of generic, here's your average human, HRTF function. Its possible, that of course, if you are right in the average then its perfect for you. But there's always people off to the extremes, that it doesn't do a very good job at. And there may be better ways to allow people to sample their own perfect HRTF which can improve the audio experience a lot. It all comes down to all these trade-offs.\nExplainee: You know, with display and with resolution, its one of those things where if people have one bad experience they kind of, oh well everything else. Its really difficult to build trust again with people who haven't done VR before but its easy to break off that trust when they have a bad experience.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","202":"Explainer: So, when you say it's an inverse-square law, that means that the closer you are, the more strongly you feel the gravitational pull. And that makes sense. There's very few things that are stronger when you're further apart.\nExplainee: Yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","203":"Explainer: So you can also think of a gravitational field, something that permeates all of space. Even though the earth is three stories below us, it's not as though it's pulling at us from a distance. We're actually interacting with the field at this point and there's a real interaction right here at this point. And that's nice, because people were worried that if things acted at a distance, that the way that old-fashioned inverse-square force law describes it, that it was as spooky as mind-bending a spoon, that it was like telekinesis. If you don't touch something, how do you affect it? And so the first step was to start to think of gravity as a field that permeates all of a space. And it's weaker very far from the Earth and it's closer very close to the Earth. So one way to think of this field as a field that's really describing a curved space-time that is everywhere. Forget the difficulty of the math, just the intuition comes from two kind of simple observations. One was what Einstein described as the happiest thought of his life. So, right now, you might feel heavy in your chair, and we might feel heavy on the floor and our feet, or standing in an elevator cab. And Einstein said, what does the chair have to do with it, or the floor, or the elevator? Those aren't gravitational objects. So he wanted to eliminate them, and one way to do the thought experiment is to imagine standing in an elevator that you can see out of, a black box. And imagine the cable is cut and you and the elevator begin to fall.\nExplainee: So, in free fall?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","204":"Explainer: Yeah, exactly.\nExplainee: Yeah, yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","205":"Explainer: Yeah, it would just go straight. But if you did that on the Earth, what would happen?\nExplainee: It would just go down.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","206":"Explainer: Isn't it kind of amazing?\nExplainee: Yeah. [laughs]\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","207":"Explainer: I'm sure you've heard about extra dimensions a little bit.\nExplainee: I've heard it, yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","208":"Explainer: Mm-hmm.\nExplainee: Is that an extra dimension? Does that fit into that, or is that something?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","209":"Explainer: Why in the world would you think that there are extra dimensions, right? So you've heard of string theory?\nExplainee: I have. So string theory is basically a theory of quantum gravity.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","210":"Explainer: Mm-hmm. So we have quantum mechanics, right? The theory of atoms and so forth and how those work, and then we have gravity, and gravity doesn't seem to fit in. It's the one force of nature that we can't really easily fit into this quantum mechanical framework, so string theory is one of the best ideas.\nExplainee: Right.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","211":"Explainer: [Sean] Do you know where it comes from?\nExplainee: No.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","212":"Explainer: From membranes, you know. We have lines, one dimension. We have two dimensional surfaces. So if you have a line that is a vibrating physical thing, you call it a string, right?\nExplainee: Right.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","213":"Explainer: If you have a two dimensional surface that vibrates and is a physical thing, we call that a membrane. Membrane theory goes back, it never was as popular as string theory, but it's been around for a while. But if you had extra dimensions of space, then you can three dimensional vibrating things, and four dimensional vibrating things.\nExplainee: So how do these strings give rise to things like mass and charge, and basically give us the properties of the particles that we see?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","214":"Explainer: Well basically the strings are the particles that we see. It's exactly the same thing as we said for the straw, if you look at it far away it looks one dimensional. A little loop of string, so a little one dimensional circle that is vibrating. If you look at it from very, very far away, it just looks like a particle. So in string theory, an electron is a little string. A photon is a little string.\nExplainee: So, is string theory part of what they call the Grand Unified Theory? Is it supposed to be the last thing that sort of unifies all the forces together?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","215":"Explainer: Yes, string theory's even better. So the phrase Grand Unified Theory was coined in the 1970s for theories that joined electricity and magnetism. So a good string theory is gravity plus the Grand Unified Theory.\nExplainee: Okay.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","216":"Explainer: It's even better. It's the theory of everything. What would you tell a friend of yours if they asked you what dimensions are, what extra dimensions are, what a brane is?\nExplainee: So we have three spatial dimensions. A brane is sort of the next level. So a brane is a higher dimensional object that vibrates through space.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","217":"Explainer: [Bettina] Have you ever heard of blockchain?\nExplainee: I have. Whenever we have a transaction, and let's say I buy something from you, this information gets logged. And it gets verified by a third person or third party. And then if like all this information verified and it all matches, right, the transaction goes through without any intermediary basically, right? It gets stored, and when you make further transactions, this information is ready, embedded. It's in the ledger.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","218":"Explainer: Same with, who are the actors? It's not just people anymore. It's machines.\nExplainee: [Valentinas] Absolutely.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","219":"Explainer: We're gonna have to create entire new concepts of how they do trade and how they work with us, too. What kind of barriers or road blocks would you imagine are gonna happen in the blockchain space?\nExplainee: So at least when we talk about Bitcoin, there are some trust issues and some hacks. So there's obviously a need to work on trust and feeling that it's a safe technology.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","220":"Explainer: What is it exactly that you're trying to tease out of these materials to improve the battery's performance?\nExplainee: At first, one of the main things that we did was use nanomaterials to add conductivity. And so carbon anodes and graphene are really good at adding conductivity to batteries. And then in the subsequent years, nanomaterials have been really interesting from things like incorporating sensors into batteries, to increasing the functionality of batteries, having some responsive materials that use things like graphene sheets that are incorporated into a matrix, and then you add a safety functionality to a battery. We're trying to squeeze out almost all the functionality that we can. And as new nano materials are being discovered and there're new properties being discovered, a lot of the time that someone tries to think of a way to translate that into a battery.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","221":"Explainer: Because the materials are so small, they're at the nanoscale, their properties are dominated by quantum mechanics, which means that even slight changes in their size, in their orientation give profound changes in their properties. And while that's very scientifically interesting, and it allows you to tune their properties by making subtle changes, from a technology point of view, it's a bit of a headache in the sense that in technology want to optimize for a property and then repeat that over and over again. So what are some of the challenges that you face in the lab related to working with these materials and then trying to incorporate them into the batteries?\nExplainee: I think every step of a process in a battery is something where you have to think about how would this translate to making a battery in terms of the production? One thing that I think is very interesting about the field of nanoscale materials in general, is that how you make the material changes the properties a lot. And so we claim that this 2D material has this property, then tying that to the battery performance is something that's pretty difficult to do. It takes a few steps in between. So we have to think kind of creatively with how we can do that.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","222":"Explainee: I'm Tom Hull, I'm a math professor, a mathematician. I've been doing origami since I was eight years old and studying the mathematics of origami ever since grad school, at least.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","223":"Explainer: The first thing I want to show you is origami in the real world. This is the origami lamp. It comes shipped flat but it folds, clip holds it together. The lamp has LEDs on the inside so when we power it up we get light, we have a lampshade and we get the base.\nExplainee: Why does origami lend itself to, say, this type of application?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","224":"Explainer: This is another real-world application but this particular implementation is used to make a wheel for a Rover.\nExplainee: Cool, so this is something that can actually get really, really tiny but then get big and fat and roll.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","225":"Explainer: New problems arise when we try to make origami out of things other than paper, but also new opportunities. An example here which is a kind of a variant of the Miura-Ori. It's got a three-dimensional structure. If I stretch it one way, it expands the other but because it has these S-bends in the pattern, if you squeeze it, it doesn't go all the way flat. This is a epoxy impregnated aramid fiber and so if I put this fold pattern into it and then compress it and then put a skin on the top and bottom, this becomes incredibly lightweight but incredibly strong.\nExplainee: Yeah!\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","226":"Explainer: Yeah, so what goes in as sheet and what comes out is this, or something this wide.\nExplainee: That's cool, yeah. What do you see as kind of like the next big breakthrough? Is there anything out there on the horizon that you're just like, oh wow, this is really exciting?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","227":"Explainer: We're gonna talk about blockchain technology. Have you heard of blockchain?\nExplainee: I've heard of the words blockchain, but I'm not sure I know what it is.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","228":"Explainer: And so it's being run by all of these different computers that have like a node. So they're all running the same software and guaranteeing your transactions as they happen.\nExplainee: I mean, I would assume this technology is taking away business or activity from these middlemen.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","229":"Explainer: Good to see you again, Yue.\nExplainee: Yes, good to see you.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","230":"Explainer: So it's interesting, so I also saw that there was also a recent meta-analysis around sleep disturbances and dementia risk, and in that study, they looked about 250,000 people in this meta-analysis, and they followed them around for 10 years, and you know, when they pulled all the samples together, they found there was a 1.2 fold increased risk for developing all caused dementia, so it sounds like both sleep apnea and then maybe sleep disturbances more generally are associated with increased risk for dementia. When I think about that, I think about how sleep lives in the brain, these neurodegenerative diseases live in the brain, and so what do we know about the causality of this? Could it be that individuals who have early onset of say, Alzheimer's, have then poor sleep kind of as a consequence of that?\nExplainee: Yeah, so I think what's really fascinating is all these bio-directional relationships that's being identified in animal studies especially, showing that sleep changes actually occur very early on in the disease process, so it could be a prodromal stage of Parkinson's, and also in transgenic model of AD, they're already showing a lot of circadian abnormalities in this mouse.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","231":"Explainer: So within dementia risk in particular, Alzheimer's for instance, there are kind of two clear features that seem to be part of the pathology, right? So there's beta-amyloid which accumulates in the brain, and then there's kind of these tangles, this tauopathies, right? And so it sounds like sleep seems to be related to the tauopathies. What about kind of beta-amyloid?\nExplainee: Yes, in the transgenic mouse models of AD, including those expressing human mutant amyloid precursor protein, APP type or both, so that's kind of showing the sleep changes in both of these pathologies.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","232":"Explainer: Here's a spider with eight legs, ants with legs and these, just like the crane, are folded from a single uncut square.\nExplainee: What?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","233":"Explainer: That's a corner, four corners of the square, four points. How would you make one point out of this sheet of paper?\nExplainee: I'm thinking of, like, a paper airplane.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","234":"Explainer: The crane has four circles but, actually, there's a little bit of a surprise because what about this? There's a fifth circle, which is like that, but does the crane have a fifth flap in it? Let's refold it and put the wings up. Well, yes, there is, there's another point and that point is the fifth circle of our crane.\nExplainee: Okay.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","235":"Explainer: You've got it, so you are ready to design origami.\nExplainee: Awesome.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","236":"Explainer: I remember reading your papers when I was a student and we're all trying to create these materials and finding ways to exploit their properties. What I love, and I'm delighted that you're here to talk to us about is how you took inspiration from nature and sort of recognize that nature's figured out a way to both synthesize incredibly complex nanostructures with high functionality and how you sort of were inspired by that to do the research that you're doing now.\nExplainee: Life gave us this toolkit that is already on the nanoscale. So we think that that's a great place to think about making materials on the nano scale and manipulating materials on the nano scale, and wiring them together as well. This abalone shell, you can see the exquisite beautiful colors and structures of it. This is a nano composite material. If you take this and fracture it, and you look at it in a scanning electron microscope, what you'll see is that it's made out of these beautiful tablets. And I studied that as a graduate student. I looked at that and I said, that is completely amazing. You have an organism in the ocean, that takes what's in its environment, which is calcium and carbonate. That's dissolved in the water and templates it into this really exquisite structure. And so you think that's great. Calcium carbonate is great, but what if we wanted to make a solar cell or a another electronic device or a battery, how would you get an organism to do that? And you say, okay, that's a really crazy idea. But is it really that crazy if this abalone, already figured out how to do it, 500 million years ago? So we're saying, okay, abalones build shells. Can viruses build solar cells, can viruses build catalysts? Can they build batteries using the same kind of idea?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","237":"Explainer: It's really fascinating work, especially now we're all familiar with the viruses and how they act. And I'm not aware of any viruses that build nanostructures. So how did you come to that? And then how do you actually program a virus to do your bidding?\nExplainee: We work on something called bacteriophages, it's a virus with DNA. This particular bacteriophage called M13 bacteriophage is made up of single stranded DNA and proteins. It's long and thin. So it's 880 nanometers in length, and it's about 9 nanometers in diameter. And so one of the reasons I love it is it spans the nanoscale and almost the micron scale at the same time. Take the single strand DNAs, obviously a model, and you can cut it with molecular scissors. And you can put a new piece of DNA in between. And so you put a small piece of DNA in there that doesn't belong there. And that piece of DNA is going to randomly code for a protein. Now, the next time that that virus is replicated within a bacterial host, it'll be able to put a new protein sequence on the coat, just a short protein sequence on the coat, maybe like 8 or 12 amino acids in length. And just like that abalone is going to grab calcium and build calcium carbonate. We're going to have our viruses build iron phosphate for a battery electrode material or Gallium arsenide or cad sulfide for a semiconductor material.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","238":"Explainer: Looking ahead, 5 years, 10 years, where do you see your own work, and maybe the field more broadly?\nExplainee: The future I'd like to see is environmentally friendly chemistry and materials synthesis. And I think that we're really going that way. If we think about batteries of the future, solar cells of the future, thinking about earth abundant materials and processes that are compatible with the earth and environment.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","239":"Explainer: Whenever there's a part of a spacecraft that is shaped somewhat like paper, meaning it's big and flat, we can use folding mechanisms from origami to make it smaller.\nExplainee: Right.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","240":"Explainer: Telescopes, solar arrays, they need to be packed into a rocket, go up, but then expand in a very controlled, deterministic way when they get up into space.\nExplainee: Okay.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","241":"Explainer: These are the building blocks of many, many origami deployable shapes, it's called a degree-4 vertex. It's the number of lines. So in this case, we use solid lines for mountain, we use dash lines for valley. We're going to fold it and use these two to illustrate some important properties of origami mechanisms. It's important in the study of mechanisms to take into account the rigidity. So what we're going to do to help simulate rigidity is to take these rectangles and we're going to fold them over and over so that they just become stiff and rigid.\nExplainee: [Grad Student] Okay.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","242":"Explainer: So this is what's called a single degree of freedom mechanism. You have one degree of freedom, I can choose this fold, and then if these are perfectly rigid every other fold angle is fully determined. One of the key behaviors here is that with the smaller angles up here, the two folds that are the same parity and the folds that are of opposite parity move at about the same rate but with this, as we're getting closer to 90 degrees, we find they move at very different rates and then at the end of the motion, the opposite happens. This one is almost folded but this one goes through a much larger motion so the relative speeds differ.\nExplainee: Right.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","243":"Explainer: And they fold flat and a pattern almost exactly like this was used for a solar array for a Japanese mission that flew in 1995.\nExplainee: So then you like fly it up compactly and then once you get up there, there's like some sort of like motorized mechanism, but you only need it on one fold.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","244":"Explainer: So, sadly, the only way to get them at exactly the same rate is when these are microscopic slivers and then that's not useful.\nExplainee: For sure, right, right.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","245":"Explainer: And it's exactly the difference between the motions of these two vertices. So these angles are closer to right angles and the closer you get to a right angle the more asymmetry there is between the two directions of motion. And then the other difference is how efficiently they pack, so these started at about the same size but when they're flat notice that yours is much more compact. So if I were you making a solar array, I'd say, oh, I want that one. But if I say, well, I want them to open at the same rate, then I want this one.\nExplainee: So, it's kind of a trade-off?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","246":"Explainer: That's actually a really good description. The idea is that if you've got a system here that can make you see whatever we want you to see, then we can make you believe that you're anywhere else, like on top of a mountain, or in a dungeon or under the ocean.\nExplainee: Or in Minecraft.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","247":"Explainer: Yeah, or in Minecraft. When you look at a TV on the wall there showing like a picture of a mountain or something, how can you tell that its not just a window and there's something else behind it. Because it always doesn't look quite right if you have a static picture of a person on a screen and you move around like this, its not really changing. And its interesting, those are things we have to figure out We need to figure out when you look at something in reality how can you tell whether its real or not. Have you been to a 3-D movie where you put on the little glasses?\nExplainee: Yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","248":"Explainer: {missing part}\n","249":"Explainer: Essentially what harmony is, is like a language, right? And so as with any language, the more words you're capable of speaking in a language, the more you can say. All right, so in harmony, this might be how many notes you can think to add to a chord to make it feel a different way. Have you ever heard of the circle of fifths?\nExplainee: Mm-hmm.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","250":"Explainer: Yeah.\nExplainee: And then G.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","251":"Explainer: Nice, okay cool. Lets try one more version where we add some colors. Alright so lets visit the B flat, with a bit more imagination.\nExplainee: Yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","252":"Explainer: We're gonna talk about some science. Do you like science?\nExplainee: Yes, a lot.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","253":"Explainer: Exactly. It's not really one dimensional, right?\nExplainee: So everything has to be one or two dimensional before it's three dimensional.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","254":"Explainer: And how would you find yourself, like if someone said where are you, could you use some words or ideas to say where you are on that line?\nExplainee: I think I would be maybe there, since I'm facing it.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","255":"Explainer: Has its own unit, has one number.\nExplainee: Yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","256":"Explainer: We need one number to tell you where we are. That's one dimension. That's what it means to be one dimensional. I only need to tell you one number to figure out where we are.\nExplainee: Unlike three dimensional, you have to tell a lot 'cause if it's like a sphere, you kind of have to start using points.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","257":"Explainer: I think you should be in this chair and you should be explaining this to me. You're much better at this than I am.\nExplainee: Yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","258":"Explainer: Well, as far as we know.\nExplainee: Yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","259":"Explainer: Yeah, do you think you'd be excited if physicists said that they found extra dimensions of space?\nExplainee: That would be an amazing discovery. The news would be spreaded around the world rapidly.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","260":"Explainer: So in your studies, have you learned about machine learning?\nExplainee: Yeah, I have. So to me, machine learning is essentially exactly what it sounds like. It's trying to teach a machine specifics about something by inputting a lot of data points and slowly, the machine will build up knowledge about it over time. For example, my Gmail program, I assume that there would be a lot of, like, machine learning models happening at once, right?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","261":"Explainer: Absolutely. And that's a great example because you have models that are operating to do things like figure out if a new email is spam or not. So what would you think about if you were looking at an email and trying to decide if it went in one category or another?\nExplainee: I'd probably look at certain keywords. Maybe if the recipient and the sender had exchanged emails before and generally, those fell into in the past.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","262":"Explainer: So these are things we would call features. And we go through a process where we do feature engineering, where somebody looks at the example and says, Okay, these are the things that I think might allow us to statistically tell the difference from something in one category versus another. So for example, perhaps you don't speak Russian, you start getting a lot of email in Russian.\nExplainee: Obviously, like the features that you just described are features which a person would have had to think about. Are there features which, like, the machine itself could learn?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","263":"Explainer: This is a great question because it really gets to the difference between some of our different tools in our machine learning tool belt in addressing problems like this. So if we were to use a supervised learning classic classification approach, a person would need to think about those features and creatively come up with them in approach we call the kitchen sink approach, which is just try everything you can possibly think of and see what works. Unsupervised learning, where we don't have labeled data and we're trying to infer some structure out of the data is you're projecting that data into a space and looking for things like clusters. And there's a bunch of really fun math about how you do that, how you think about distance and by distance, I mean that if we have two data points in space, how do we decide if they're similar or not?\nExplainee: And how do the algorithms themselves usually differ between unsupervised and supervised learning.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","264":"Explainer: Supervised learning, we have our labels and we're trying to figure out what statistically indicates if something matches one label or another label. Unsupervised learning, we don't necessarily have those labels. That's the thing we're trying to discover. So reinforcement learning is another technique that we use sometimes. You can think about it like a turn in a game and you can play, you know, millions and millions of trials so that you're able to develop a system that by experimenting with reinforcement learning can eventually learn to play these games pretty successfully. Deep learning, which is essentially using neural networks and very large amounts of data to eventually iterate on a network structure that can make predictions.\nExplainee: With reinforcement learning versus deep learning, it seems to me that reinforcement learning, is it sort of like the kitchen sink approach that you were talking about earlier, where you're just kind of trying everything?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","265":"Explainer: [Hilary] Yes. [both laugh]\nExplainee: Oh, I didn't realize it was that deep, almost. Is there a situation which you'd want to use a deep learning algorithm over a reinforcement learning algorithm?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","266":"Explainer: So typically, you would choose deep learning if you have sufficient high quality data, hopefully labeled in a useful way. If you really are happy not to necessarily understand or be able to interpret what your system is doing or you're willing to invest in another set of work afterwards to understand what the system is doing once you've already trained it. And this also comes down to the fact that some things are actually really easy to solve with linear regression or simple statistical approaches. And some things are impossible.\nExplainee: What would be the outcome if you were to choose the, quote-unquote, wrong approach?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","267":"Explainer: You build a system that could actually be useless. So years ago, I had a client that was a big telecom company and they had a data scientist who built a deep learning system to predict customer churn. It actually was very accurate, but it wasn't useful because nobody knew why the prediction was what it was. So they could say, you know, Sunny, you're likely to quit next month. But they had no idea what to do about it. And so, I think there are a bunch of failure modes.\nExplainee: Would that be an example of, like, linear regression where the regression is accurate, but, you know, for marketing purposes, it's like, if you don't know why I'm quitting the service, then how can we fix this?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","268":"Explainer: Yeah. This is actually a good example of a very real world kind of machine learning problem where the solution to this was to build an interpretable system on top of the accurate predictions not to throw it away, but to do a bunch more work to figure out the why.\nExplainee: How can we improve machine learning algorithms?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","269":"Explainer: Maybe a wiring diagram is not sufficient to understand the brain, and it would be crazy to think that that would be sufficient, actually.\nExplainee: If you limit the connectome to be just the wiring diagram without, you know, more information about myelination or glial cells, all types of environmental features that surround the neurons and axons then you have an incomplete picture, no doubt.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","270":"Explainer: Yes.\nExplainee: I'm a musician and I don't think it's possible. I think that there are too many, you know, so much of it is associative to what you already know.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","271":"Explainer: So and a musician, how much of it do you think is in your hands versus in your brains? Meaning like, you do have connections in your muscles from the nerves that are from your spinal cord, what if some of the learning is there?\nExplainee: Are you still doing EM or?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","272":"Explainee: Hello Donna, good to see you.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","273":"Explainer: You could not convince me to stay, no.\nExplainee: But you were there long enough to make a big impression and get some good work done.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","274":"Explainer: That's right, if you can do that, go for it.\nExplainee: And then we will shine that laser onto that electron beam, and the electron's rest frame, we beat the Schwinger limit.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","275":"Explainer: So we can either cheat by doing laser accelerating and going into that rest frame.\nExplainee: Yes.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","276":"Explainer: Okay.\nExplainee: And make them act as one coherent source. So one of the things that we'll be doing with our two petawatts, we're going to see if we can actually combine them into a 50. If you can do that, you can begin to imagine doing this with many lasers. Many petawatt lasers of the scale we're talking about. So one could possibly see an exawatt from that. People have been able to combine 10s of lasers together for a coherent source so you have to be able to phase lock them, you have to be able to make their phases be exactly connected and related and be able, as they propagate through all the different optical components, whatever it may be--\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","277":"Explainer: And right across the beam. Don't you think that's gonna be the challenge? 'Cos it's not like our beams are as perfect as we like to think they are.\nExplainee: So that's right so you have to have the aperture size, you have to have them phase locked across the entire aperture. Which will be a great challenge and people have done it, again, with small lasers. The lasers we'll be trying to do is about a 40cm aperture. So we'll begin to start looking at this. And actually wavelength control and then be able to adaptive optics other ways which you can control the uniformity of the phase is something that's been developed in lots of ways now. For defense applications, for science applications. So we will do our best to make use of all these technologies. Lasers I think have progressed so much. Just like the semi conductor did, 'cos there's such a market for it, there were so many different applications for that.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","278":"Explainer: Have you heard of the breach of Target where they were breached many years ago and their point of sale systems were hacked?\nExplainee: Yes, I heard about that.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","279":"Explainer: So where people are swiping credit cards, those credit card numbers were stolen. They hired a company to come in and perform a penetration test to see, can the good guys essentially break in again to prevent this sort of thing in the future? And when this team came in, they found they actually were able to get pretty much to the same point of sale system, and the way they did that was by exploiting an internet-connected deli meat scale. Once the company was able to essentially get into the deli scale, because the deli scale was on the internal network, then they were able to really escalate privilege and find a vulnerability within another system. Essentially, that just got them into the network. and once you're in the network, it's often really easy to then escalate from there.\nExplainee: I've heard about similar attacks in hospitals using hospital equipment, but I'm surprised that something as simple as a meat scale would have been used in such an attack. We discussed it in class as how hackers look at some of the weakest links in these large networks and use those to tap into networks.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","280":"Explainer: Absolutely, you would essentially cause a segmentation fault.\nExplainee: Yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","281":"Explainer: But what's really cool about that is, when you're going into memory, you're starting to cross over that boundary of that hundred byte allocation, and now you're starting to write over additional memory. That other memory is really important stuff. So you have your name, the hundred bytes there, and then right next to your name is the return address, and that's the address that the code is gonna execute and it's going to return to after that function is done, and it's going to jump to that address, but after you type your hundred bytes, the next few bites that you type, you're actually going to overwrite that return address. So that return address could essentially be another address in memory. So what you end up doing is you type a name and it's not really a name, it's really just code. And that code, you keep typing until you get to the return address, and you start typing an address, which is really the beginning of your name and your computer or your processor is actually going to read that address and it will jump back to the beginning and then execute that payload. So that was sort of the very first thing that I think was super exciting to me when I started learning about really reverse engineering.\nExplainee: So how does the buffer overloading relate to what you are doing in terms of network security or designing software for penetration testing?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","282":"Explainer: Ever since buffer overflow started many years ago, there been a lot of protection mechanisms built to make it difficult to exploit. More and more, we're actually using smaller and smaller computers with smaller amounts of compute power. If you take a car, you have hundreds of microcontrollers that are all running there. So they don't really have a sophisticated operating system that can try to prevent attacks like buffer overflows. So how do we keep these low cost computers in here while adding layers of protection to prevent malice and these types of attacks? Sometimes it actually is, how can we write software or how can we build a system that prevents these types of attacks from entering? But oftentimes, it's really looking for how can we find new attacks that we haven't even necessarily thought of? What got you interested in computer science and information security?\nExplainee: I got interested in cybersecurity because I'm really into global affairs, global politics, and you often hear in the news about the rising power of China, the rising power of Iran. I enjoy how interdisciplinary computer science is. Like, nowadays there's so much going on in the world of computers and that's what fascinated me.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","283":"Explainer: You brought up China and Iran, and something that's interesting about those areas is really censorship, right? They have essentially censored internet. In the US, we have a really interesting internal struggle here where we actually have government agencies like the state department that are funding software to evade censorship, like Tor and other mechanisms. While then we also have an internal struggle where we have other organizations like the NSA who are specifically looking to break that exact same system that the US government is also funding.\nExplainee: There are a lot of ethical questions about whether we should be intervening in other countries, but it's pretty interesting that two different agencies of the government are actually working on contrasting technology. I can actually understand that because if we are creating a technology that we are going to deploy somewhere else, we should know its limitations. We should know how to control it.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","284":"Explainer: Oh really? Oh excellent. Well I'm somebody who studies lasers. So what do you think about lasers?\nExplainee: I don't know--\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","285":"Explainer: Well one of the fun things people do with lasers, the cat will try to grab that dot. I'm sure what you have at home is a flashlight. I brought a cute little one. So the question is, do you see any difference between what a flashlight does and what a laser does?\nExplainee: Flashlight is a bigger shine and the laser is just a dot.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","286":"Explainer: [Donna] And yet it's not. Isn't that amazing?\nExplainee: Yes.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","287":"Explainer: One of the things that lasers are great for is that because it's a directed beam, we can actually put that light where we want the light to go and sometimes you maybe just want to see something around the corner and you can't see it. But with a laser, you can actually and this is a smoky one so you can actually watch it go. You see it actually bending the corner?\nExplainee: Yes.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","288":"Explainer: So this obviously is much bigger than our hair. Right?\nExplainee: Yes.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","289":"Explainer: Have you ever seen that maybe there's a little bit of a red light when you do that?\nExplainee: Yes.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","290":"Explainer: That's a laser. We cut steel with them now. We actually do surgery with lasers. You know when some people have either scars or birth marks that they don't want to see? We can actually remove those with lasers now. Never seen a laser light show? When they light up the sky with lasers, it's almost like fireworks.\nExplainee: Well I saw a shooting star before.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","291":"Explainer: Have you done any work in side channel analysis?\nExplainee: Like, a little bit. I read the Rowhammer paper. I found it really interesting, but it's nothing that I've actually worked with.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","292":"Explainer: So the side channel analysis is really looking not at a vulnerability within a system, but really unintended consequences of what the system is built on. A very simple example of a side channel is putting your ear to the ground to hear if there are horses coming towards you, and the same thing applies to technology. So you can have something like a CPU, it's executing instructions, certain instructions that use a little bit more power, and power is reserved in these capacitors, which are like tiny batteries next to your CPU. And as they're pulling power, there's something in physics called the electrostrictive effect where the capacitor will move in a very, very tiny amount. And then although we can't hear it, the microphone on a mobile device can actually listen to that. If you then listen to that and you say, oh, I see a pattern here, and you can go all the way down and then extract and reveal the full password, the full key, even though it could be argued that the algorithm itself, there's no problem with it.\nExplainee: So all memory devices are just, it's just a bunch of gates and they're in rows. They basically all hold different pieces of memory. That's all the gates are. Either they're turned on or they're turned off. So what Rowhammer found was they tested a bunch of different memory devices and found that by doing a certain order of storing things, and then pulling that information back in a certain way in one place would actually flip gates in a different place. So you could actually do a bunch of things to a piece of memory that had nothing to do with something that may be critical in a different place and actually change its contents, and that obviously exposes all sorts of security issues, because that's very hard to predict.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","293":"Explainer: Especially now that we're seeing more and more companies who are trying to make it illegal for you to inspect the vehicle that you've purchased, right? Something that you actually own.\nExplainee: Yeah, I think that's nuts. I'm firmly against that for sure.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","294":"Explainer: That's amazing. What made you decide to trade on eBay?\nExplainee: Well, I mean, I've heard of it, and I trust it a lot because they have all of their guarantees, so I know that I'm gonna get money and the person's gonna get what they want.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","295":"Explainer: And there's a lot of those kinds of middlemen in our society today, right? We have a lot of banks.\nExplainee: Yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","296":"Explainer: We have a lot of companies that sort of help us make sure that our trades happen, but if we could guarantee the same trade using technology as sort of a technological trust, then we wouldn't really need all those middlemen in between.\nExplainee: So how does it work?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","297":"Explainer: [Bettina] Exactly.\nExplainee: That's cool.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","298":"Explainer: [Donna] And what's your major?\nExplainee: I'm an engineering physics major with a minor in math. I'm in the three, two program for biomedical engineering.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","299":"Explainer: Excellent. I got an engineering physics degree. There you go, something in common. We're here today talking about lasers. So have you have had much exposure to lasers yet at school?\nExplainee: Not yet. I'm really hoping that we will. I think it's super interesting just the field in general because I really do enjoy examining all the calculations and being able to do a little bit more of the math side of physics.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","300":"Explainer: Okay. As opposed to the experimental side and seeing things? Okay so I'm much more, I like to see the things happening. So then the question is, what's so special about making a light that's intense enough to actually possibly blow things up? Certainly we can blow atoms up with the laser hammer and when the laser light comes in and just smacks the electrons right off the atom. And so the question really is how do you make that? Back in the 70s and into the 80s, I know that was a long time ago for you, we had big energy lasers and we had short pulse lasers, we couldn't have big energy, short pulse lasers and actually it was my supervisor and I that figured the way around that and we got something called chirped pulse amplification. Have you heard of chirped pulse amplification by any chance?\nExplainee: Vaguely.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","301":"Explainer: Well I brought a little bit of a prop to explain how chirped pulse amplification works. Our short pulses are made of different colors. So I've got a colored slinky here. We probably could've called it stretched pulse amplification but that's kind of boring so we used the word chirped. The word chirped comes around because birds chirp. When the birds are singing, the notes are actually changing audio frequency with time and that's a chirp. The point is is that when all the light is squeezed together like this, it's a short pulse. And that's when it's a hammer because all of the light is now concentrated and you can imagine if this was coming along and also using a lens to focus it small, then all of that light at the focal spot, concentrate. And so that was the laser hammer. So we can't have that in the laser. So the question is what could we do? The fact that it's different colors and different colors because of dispersion, travel different speeds inside material. So we used a long fiber, 1.4 kilometers of fiber but, in fiber, the red colors really haven't got that much in common with the glass atoms and so they spend very little time interacting and they travel fast. The red is going to start traveling faster than the green, faster than the blue and, as you travel down the fiber, next thing you know, you have a long pulse and it's chirped from red at the beginning to blue at the back. And so the frequencies go hoo! Like this okay? So this is a chirped pulse and now it's a long pulse. And so, first this is what we did, we chirped it, we stretched it, then we can safely amplify it because it's not all concentrated and, after we amplify it, then we use something called a compressor and we put all of the colors back together and it was back being a short pulse but a high energy pulse. And then we really had what I like to call a laser hammer. When this laser pulse goes inside, it smacks those electrons right off the atom.\nExplainee: So the laser hammer that you were describing with other types of lasers and the one in the chirped is it still the same premise?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","302":"Explainer: Well a lot of lasers and when lasers first came along, they were only single color. Your cat toy, would only be a single color, probably a red one and so that's just one color. And one color means that it has to really be there for the whole time. One color is one wave length of light and so it's just one wave that goes on and on and on. If you want a short pulse, you actually have to have all the colors. And if you can imagine that one point in time, and I like to say it's like a conductor of an orchestra. When you're listening to an orchestra warm up, they sound terrible, they're all playing their own notes. But when the conductor conducts them, they all play different notes but, together, it's beautiful music. So we have something in the laser called a mode locker and it's like the conductor and it says go now. And all the colors will start together but some colors are long wave length and others are shorter. So next thing you know, you have peaks meeting valleys and they cancel each other. And the more colors you can bring in, the faster that happens and the shorter the pulse you can make.\nExplainee: What's the pendant?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","303":"Explainer: I think that people forget that you can work with the notes you already have by just rearranging them, just the simple idea of inversion, inversion of the simple triad, of F major. \u266aI once was lost and now I'm found \u266a \u266a Was blind \u266a \u266a But now I see \u266a Now how home do I want to go here, you know? Is there another verse to come?\nExplainee: Right.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","304":"Explainer: Yeah. so this is the note F.\nExplainee: Yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","305":"Explainer: F major, F minor, D flat major seven G flat diminished, G flat minor major seven, G minor seven, G soft, G seven, G seven sharp 11. And then, G seven with a flat 13\nExplainee: (laughs)\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","306":"Explainer: That's it! (laughs) A flat soft, A flat major seven. A flat major seven sharp five, with a sharp 11. Essentially, what that demonstrates is that every note and every base note are compatible. So once we realize this its like, that's great! Now what should we do? What, how, what should we, what should we, how, what am I supposed to do? What to do, right. And sometimes the paralyzing thing when it comes to arranging, there are too many options, too many things are possible. So that's when it becomes super, super important to be aware of what you wanna try and say emotionally.\nExplainee: But what about negative harmony, the dark side?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","307":"Explainer: Right.\nExplainee: You know, you changed the feeling of it, what otherwise would, you know, if you were to tell a kid that this is a major song, we should be happy.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","308":"Explainer: But if you arrive in F major from A major, then it's like the sun's gone in.\nExplainee: Interesting.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","309":"Explainer: Connectome.\nExplainee: To be honest, I have no idea.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","310":"Explainer: In one brain, in your brain. Could I take all of that information and put it inside a computer? Would that computer then be you?\nExplainee: Computers they don't have feelings, they won't have feelings and I think that's one thing that makes the human race strong.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","311":"Explainer: Huh.\nExplainee: Understanding the anatomy of the brain is definitely important but, it doesn't necessarily tell us everything about the function, there's some sort of temporal order from neuron to neuron and region to region that we may not be able to pick up.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","312":"Explainer: Because there's more to you in here than just information passing between neurons.\nExplainee: I'd like to think so.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","313":"Explainer: You have not. Right. It's a way for a prover to convince a verifier that something is true without revealing anything about why it's true, which sounds totally bizarre. Right?\nExplainee: Yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","314":"Explainer: So nowhere in this interaction, did you see any information that you didn't already know. And yet I convinced you that I know the combination. Right?\nExplainee: Yeah. So what's the exact purpose of a zero-knowledge proof? Is it like proving something but without giving enough information that could endanger whatever it is that you're proving?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","315":"Explainer: Suppose you wanted to exchange messages with someone that you knew.\nExplainee: Mm-hmm.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","316":"Explainer: It sounds impossible. Right?\nExplainee: It does.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","317":"Explainer: Is there any particular memory for you that you feel has been either kind of influential in your, in deciding which areas to pursue or that you feel is sort of emblematic of what it is to have a memory?\nExplainee: I was probably six years old and my aunt who had stage four ovarian cancer, she battled it for 20 years. She got me my first science kit and she asked me to cure cancer and I will never forget running into my aunt's room and just opening up the box and seeing that microscope, it was a tiny little blue one and the little microscope slides and the little pipettes. So they just, that memory will never be forgotten my whole life.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","318":"Explainer: I've got one too. I was nine and we were at the science expo in San Francisco. Two scientists were dissecting an eye, a cow's eye. And I was like that is the coolest thing I've ever seen. And something about that that carried me forward. Something happened so long ago, it left some long lasting trace through neural circuits and it continues to shape the decisions we make about what to study and what to do.\nExplainee: Just being able to apply those memories in the future is just so crucial in everyday life of the humans and the fact that we're learning how that works. And I would love to hear more about your side of memory and the mechanisms that you're studying.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","319":"Explainer: The best way to kind of think about that distinction really goes back historically to one of the most important discoveries in memory research. The patient was referred to famously as patient HM. The neurosurgeon went in and removed the tissue that happened to be right around the hippocampus on both the left side and the right side of HM's brain. But then they started noticing something odd in his behavior. He was not able to create new memories of the experiences he had after the surgery. And that led Brenda Milner and her colleagues to report that the hippocampus was very important for memory, but a one particular kind, these sort of explicit, or as now referred to them episodic memories. But the hippocampus was not necessary for learning skills like mirror tracing, things that you can't necessarily articulate but you just get better at over time. And it really led to a couple of decades or more even of an enormous amount of very important work that kind of kept on breaking memory down further and further into different types. Episodic and semantic as both forms of explicit memory where episodic refers to memory for an event that happened like what you did yesterday morning and semantic refers to general knowledge about the world. Implicit memory is being broken down into a bunch of different kinds like skills or habits or conditioning. And when I started graduate school, many of us felt kind of the next question was really to understand how do we now understand how they work together. This was right around when functional magnetic resonance imaging started becoming a popular tool for measuring brain activity. We could scan the entire brain and we could ask questions about multiple brain regions at once. And we discovered that what we might expect during a skill learning task that only the striatum might show activity, that we also saw the activity in the hippocampus. Or when we asked someone to form an episodic memory that we thought might depend only on the hippocampus we suddenly also saw activity in the prefrontal cortex. And so the confluence of these new ideas and questions about how different forms of memory interact together with the development of new tools for studying the human mind and brain allowed us to kind of adjust our view of memory systems, to think of them less as multiple completely separate independent systems and instead to try to understand how they really work in concert with each other and give rise to all kinds of behaviors that might not fit neatly into one category or another.\nExplainee: Are the connectivities that you're seeing using the FMRI in your studies, are they different when you look at the implicit and explicit memories? Are you seeing more activity in the striatum in comparison to the hippocampus or the prefrontal cortex?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","320":"Explainer: What's your favorite subject?\nExplainee: I'd say math. Some of the small problems can actually be really big and complicated. It's like a puzzle.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","321":"Explainer: I know where it is, but I don't wanna tell you. Do you believe me? You're not sure to believe me. Right?\nExplainee: Yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","322":"Explainer: But what if I could prove to you that I know where the puffin is without revealing to you where it is? Let me show you. I took that photo that we showed you. And I put it behind this poster here. Why don't you go take a look through that hole?\nExplainee: I see the puffin.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","323":"Explainer: So when you look at this board, we don't know where the photo was, right? Was the photo like with the corner here? In which case the puffin would be all the way at this side. Or was the photo with the corner here? In which case the puffin would be on the other side. So this is a really simple example of a zero-knowledge proof. I convinced you that I knew where the puffin was, but you didn't learn anything else.\nExplainee: Why do you study zero-knowledge proof?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","324":"Explainer: What if instead, we could somehow use a zero-knowledge proof to log in. You would just be able to prove that, hey, I'm Chelsea, without revealing anything to them. If you could do that, then it would be amazing, right?\nExplainee: Yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","325":"Explainer: What does infinity mean to you?\nExplainee: Really anything that has no end to it.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","326":"Explainer: Adding infinities. Multiplying infinities. And there's a sense in which it's very similar to the arithmetic that you learned about already. But it's also totally different. It has some very weird properties. Welcome to Hilbert's Hotel. Unlike an ordinary hotel, has accountably infinitely many rooms. Suppose a new guest shows up, you might think that the new guest could take the room that's all the way down at the end of the hall, all the way at infinity, except there isn't a room like that. The rooms each have a number, and even though there's infinitely many rooms, each room is only a finite distance away. So here's how we're gonna make room for the new guest. I'm gonna ask the guest in room one to move into room two, and then we're gonna ask the guest in room two to move into room three, and we'll continue this all the way along. It looks to me like there's space for the new guest. Where is it? \nExplainee: It'll be in room number one.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","327":"Explainer: Absolutely. So now I'm gonna make this story a little more complex. That there's another Hilbert's Hotel down the street and they're having plumbing issues and we need to find room for them.\nExplainee: They can't live together?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","328":"Explainer: They can't live together. That would be a great solution. I don't know. I think these people don't really get along. So I need to somehow create infinitely many new rooms, but I can only ask each person in the hotel to move a finite distance away. So let's take the guest who is originally in room one and move them into room two. So that's creating one new space for us. And I'm gonna take the guest who was originally in room two and move them into room four. Are you starting to see a pattern here?\nExplainee: Yes. You're going up one each time?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","329":"Explainer: Infinity, great. Hilbert's Hotel is a story that mathematicians have been telling themselves for almost 100 years because it's a really visceral way to think about some of the counterintuitive properties of the arithmetic of infinity.\nExplainee: How does infinity come across in mathematics for you?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","330":"Explainer: Yeah. That's what it's called.\nExplainee: Yeah. yeah, I haven't heard of it before.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","331":"Explainer: Yeah, so there's this generalization gap, this gap between what it was trained to do and the new thing.\nExplainee: So what's like the most complicated thing for a robot to learn, is it motion?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","332":"Explainer: So you can think of robotics as having two core components. One is perception, being able to see and feel and so forth, and action, where the robot actually figures out how to move its arm. And both components are really essential, and both components are quite difficult. If you train a perception system independently of how to choose actions, then it might make errors in a way that mess up the system that selects actions And so if you instead try to train these two systems together, to have it learn perception action for the goal of solving these different tasks, then the robot can be more successful. One thing that's really difficult about robotics is, there actually isn't that much data of robots in the world. On the internet, there's all sorts of text data, all sorts of image data that people upload and write. But there isn't a lot of data of doing a simple thing, like tying your shoe, for example, because it's so basic. One challenge is even just getting data sets that allow us to teach robots to do these simple kinds of tasks.\nExplainee: Do you think that we'd be able to kind of accelerate that process of collecting data? Or do you think, is it the way that we've been collecting those types of data sets, Is that what's keeping us behind?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","333":"Explainer: That's a great question. I think we should be able to accelerate the data collection process by having robots collect more data autonomously on their own. And by doing that, we might be able to overcome some of the challenges of Moravec's paradox.\nExplainee: What are some common algorithms that are used in these types of techniques as the robot is learning?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","334":"Explainer: And why three?\nExplainee: I would also say three.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","335":"Explainer: Totally, now, as a little experiment, take your piece of paper and just crumple it into a ball. So what is it? Is the paper three dimensional or is it two dimensional?\nExplainee: Because it has the pipes and the width. And there's a depth to it as well.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","336":"Explainer: And if I cut that box in half again, how many boxes do I need to cover the line.\nExplainee: two\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","337":"Explainer: But if you take a more interesting shape, some kind of fractal shape, like let's say the coastline of great Britain and you start doing this box, counting experiment, something really interesting happens as you make these boxes smaller, the number of boxes you need to cover the coastline grows faster than it would for just a straight line.\nExplainee: Four.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","338":"Explainer: And so what this box counting is getting at is saying, well, I still can never decide what the length of the coastline is, but what I can do is I can see how quick does the number of boxes grow relative to how it would grow just for an ordinary one dimensional curve, like a line or a circle.\nExplainee: Yeah, I've, I've heard about that. Where if you, if you change the amount of measurement for a coastline, you can actually change like how much of the coast that, that there is like if you measure in mile lengths, you're gonna get a much different estimate than if you measure in one inch increments.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","339":"Explainer: So procedural computer graphics, which kind of came out of thinking about fractals is one answer to this question about how do you add more detail without for instance, consuming tons of memory or requiring artists to paint ultra detail the textures. So if, if you can instead describe at least some aspect of what you're looking at in a procedural or recursive way, then you can add as much detail as you need when you get close to objects.\nExplainee: Is there any other interesting applications of fractals?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","340":"Explainer: Yeah like perlin noise is a great example, right? Perlin noise was one of the early ways of synthesizing additional texture at any level of detail that you needed to make things look natural and realistic.\nExplainee: Oh, you mean like perlin noise?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","341":"Explainer: Something that explains what's hard and what's easy for a robot. Something like stacking these two cups. Do you think that's easy or hard?\nExplainee: If it's this way, then it's easy, but if it's this way, you need to balance it or, oh-\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","342":"Explainer: And then program the robot to move over here and open the- \nExplainee: And drop it.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","343":"Explainer: When we gave it instructions, did we tell it to look at where the cup was? Or did we tell it to just move over here?\nExplainee: We told it to just move over here.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","344":"Explainer: yeah do you know what your computer thinks that is\nExplainee: An A\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","345":"Explainer: this really specific combination of zeros and ones everything that your computer does showing you pink panther videos on youtube calculating things searching the internet it does all of that with a really specific combination of zeros and ones which is crazy right that would be like saying your computer only understands these quarters for each quarter you need to tell it that you're going to use heads tails and you assign it heads or tails so i can switch between heads and tails and i can switch the zeros and ones in my computer so that it represents what i wanted to represent like an a and with quantum computers we have new rules we get to use too we can actually spin one of our quarters so it doesn't have to choose just one or the other\nExplainee: Zero, one.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","346":"Explainer: So actually, in the blockchain space is one of the spaces where we are seeing zero-knowledge proofs being implemented. And I think it's just the beginning. Let's talk about zero-knowledge proofs. At its core, a zero-knowledge proof is an interaction between two people. Then I should be able to convince you that some statement is true, but you won't have any idea why it's true.\nExplainee: Will I, like, understand that it's true because like, you know, the operations performed in the proof are like, of a certain, like, you know, they have like, certain attributes that would make them true?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","347":"Explainer: What you're basically asking is, wait, what? Right? Right. So this is what makes zero-knowledge proof so fascinating, and so counter-intuitive. And I think the best way I can explain it to you is by means of an example. But before we do that, I have to decide what I'm gonna prove to you in a, with a zero-knowledge proof.\nExplainee: Sounds good.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","348":"Explainer: And the way we're gonna approach this is through something called NP-completeness. What an NP-complete problem is, it's a problem that's really hard to solve. But if you can solve it, you can solve any problem that's in the class NP. And that includes a vast number of problems. And what we're gonna do is we're gonna use an NP-complete problem to actually prove an incredible variety of statements through a zero-knowledge proof. And the specific Np-complete problem that we're gonna be looking at is called map three-coloring. Okay, so here we have a map. Okay. And these are a bunch of countries. And we've arranged them so that no countries that have the same color share a border. That's what makes a map like this validly colored. And now you might think, well, why should we care? It turns out that whether or not a map can be three-colored in this way is an example of an NP-complete problem. And it turns out that, you know, maybe what you really wanna do, is you wanna give a zero-knowledge proof that you have at least 0.3 Bitcoins, right? That would be cool.\nExplainee: Yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","349":"Explainer: Without revealing what the address is of your account. It turns out I can take that statement that I have at least 0.2 Bitcoins, and convert it into a map of countries. And that map of countries will be three-colorable like this only if you have at least 0.2 Bitcoins.\nExplainee: How would we turn something like this into a zero-knowledge proof?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","350":"Explainer: All right. Sounds good. Right? Here we have green, right? And over here, we have blue. Okay. And as you can see, they're two different colors.\nExplainee: Mm-hmm.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","351":"Explainer: Right? So you have a little bit of confidence, right, that I have managed to color this correctly. but not that much confidence. 'Cause I've only shown you two of the countries.\nExplainee: Yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","352":"Explainer: Nice. And that's smart of you to check with the same one of the ones you already had. Right?\nExplainee: Mm-hmm.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","353":"Explainer: But as you'll see, now it's not green, it's blue. And this one on the other hand, is green. Okay. The colors I showed you last time, don't work with these new colors, right? This wouldn't have worked before.\nExplainee: Yeah, because of this one, right?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","354":"Explainer: You would use encryption. Right. But it's really, this is the protocol.\nExplainee: So what are the broader implications of like, zero-knowledge proofs. Are they supposed to be like, more practical for like, implementation, and or, are they supposed to like, structurally prove something?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","355":"Explainer: It can be generative for sure.\nExplainee: It's definitely a really interesting thing to try to talk to students about.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","356":"Explainer: I'll grant you that Hilbert's Hotel does not exist. For me, infinite objects absolutely exist. And I can't read the thoughts in your head, but I have a high degree of confidence that we have a lot of the same ideas about infinity.\nExplainee: It's this idea that are things that you can think of, do they exist? You're getting into philosophy of math now. It's just exciting.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","357":"Explainer: I mean I think that's another common misconception about mathematics is that it's so far removed from the humanities, for instance. I mean it's hard to ignore some of these philosophical questions, particularly when we're talking about certain things like infinity. And I think one of the most difficult things to really be precise about and to explain to students is the continuum hypothesis. What do you say to students about the continuum hypothesis?\nExplainee: The most fun thing to teach when you teach about infinity, when students realize that you are talking about different sizes of infinity, but then a natural thing is for them to think about what is the next size of infinity that I can think about? And sort of the continuum hypothesis is sort of one of these really hard things to grasp.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","358":"Explainer: Do you remember from that day what color towel you used when you got out of the pool?\nExplainee: I think the one I used was a dark blue or a light blue or, or like sort of a teal.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","359":"Explainer: When you were telling me about the sandbox, it felt like you didn't have to make that guess, that you could just see the sandbox in your eyes. I asked you about the towel. It doesn't come to mind immediately, but you can stop and think about it and kind of make a good guess because there are things you know about the world. And for those of us who study memory that's a really strong hint as to how memory works. And so for you your memory kept all the fun stuff and all the stuff that was important to you, but the details like did you have to have a ticket to get in or how you got there, all these other less interesting, less exciting aspects, your brain kind of decided letting go of all that information.\nExplainee: I think as you get older you start forgetting things more because you have to make space for new things, which is why you forget stuff.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","360":"Explainer: Yeah, that's a great insight. Basically we can't remember everything. So when you tell us this memory of that vacation and your brain is able to kind of play almost this movie of a memory, a moment, a day that you had in your life a while ago, where do those memories come from?\nExplainee: I do know that there's different parts of the brain. So there's probably a part of your brain that remembers a bunch of stuff.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","361":"Explainer: The hippocampus is a part of your brain that if you kind of took it out and looked at it, it looks a lot like a seahorse and it plays a really important role in creating those kinds of memories that help you two years after your vacation share with me what happened that day, all these details of that day. There's another part of the brain. It's actually also important for memory and it's called the amygdala and it is important for keeping all the kind of emotional processing going for memory. So memory for things that are really scary, it's gonna talk to the hippocampus now and get that memory to be really strong. Why do you think it might be important to remember scary things?\nExplainee: Let's say you, you accidentally cut yourself. Then your brain makes a note and says don't get too close to sharp things, or you're going to cut yourself again.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","362":"Explainer: And so you can't actually measure the length.\nExplainee: Yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","363":"Explainer: Right? Yeah. So that's already a really good idea of what a fractal is. It has some really, really interesting detail at all, scales that makes it hard to talk about standard quantities like lengths and areas and volumes.\nExplainee: Would a planet or an asteroid be a fractal?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","364":"Explainer: Yeah, so if you look at kind of the wrinkly surface of an asteroid, each one of those little wrinkles adds a little bit to the surface area. And so it's really hard to say, what is the area of an asteroid? Let's take a look at a little example of where fractals actually show up in nature. What we're gonna try to do is we're gonna try to say what the length of the coastline of great Britain is. So we're gonna start out with the blue ones, which are spaced further apart. We're gonna ask you to connect the blue pins with a piece of string so we can get a measurement of the coastline. So we have our first measurement of the length of the coastline, and we're gonna do it over again. But this time we're gonna use the white pins, which are spaced closer together. So we measured the coastline again. And what do you think happens?\nExplainee: There's more in and out. Therefore probably takes more string for this one.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","365":"Explainer: I think I agree with you, but I think to really validate our scientific experiment, we should probably compare the length of the string. A lot of extra slack in that pig of string. So what we noticed with great Britain is we were never able to measure it's length. It just kept getting longer and longer. This is called the coastline paradox where there's not really one definite number you can assign to the length of the coastline, but it depends on how you measure it. Like if we kept going to really get this to be accurate, we might have to like actually go down the beach and start measuring these tiny little details along the coastline. But really there's so much detail. We would probably never get a definite answer for how long the coastline is. Fractals also give us a really nice language. We're talking about how smooth or rough some kind of shape is. And actually a lot of people, engineers and scientists use this idea of fractals and this language of fractals to compare different shapes, not in terms of their size, but in terms of their roughness. So based on everything we talked about today, how would you describe a fractal to somebody in your own words?\nExplainee: It's a shape, that you can't describe as a shape.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","366":"Explainer: What's your name?\nExplainee: Namina.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","367":"Explainer: Mm-hmm.\nExplainee: Yeah, and touch.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","368":"Explainer: That's exactly the type of thing that we're doing. We are sensing, is we're trying to measure what's inside, and do it without destroying the ball.\nExplainee: Yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","369":"Explainer: Okay.\nExplainee: For solar panels. Then, that drew me into new types of technology that used semiconductors with the one that's very popular now is quantum computings. And what about you? What got you interested in quantum sensing?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","370":"Explainer: Yeah, I started out doing magnetic resonance, studying things like bone and biomedical magnetic resonance. Ended up playing with spins for a long time and the physics of spins just fascinated me.\nExplainee: So what do you think is a big difference between imaging large biological objects versus sensing very small quantum objects, I guess?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","371":"Explainer: So it's because the nitrogen-vacancy center is a single defect. So you can actually see a single electron. In normal magnetic resonance, you don't have the sensitivity.\nExplainee: In order to be sensitive to like a single electron, do you have to be really close to it?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","372":"Explainer: [Sekhar] Yeah.\nExplainee: And those are very sensitive to fluctuations. Yeah. I guess any fluctuations can kick your quantum system either out of the state that it's in to another state.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","373":"Explainer: I think as you said, you know, anything that interferes with my signal is noise, but it can come from different sources. In some ways, the operation of the quantum system itself, as it's sensitive to different physical phenomena, the ones that I don't like, I call noise. The ones I do like, I call signal and that's an artificial definition that I'm making when I choose to build a sensor. One of the challenges we have is, we're trying to figure out if I wanna control it, where is it coming from? I remember we had experiments running in our lab one day and we were running these experiments about 100 megahertz. All of a sudden, we saw these big spikes coming in and we realized we're picking up the local FM stations.\nExplainee: Oh, yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","374":"Explainer: Right.\nExplainee: Maybe they should be using elements of quantum computation. So I don't have a strong view on it, but I do think it's an interesting question.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","375":"Explainer: Right.\nExplainee: But I don't know that there's necessarily a limit. I mean, it keeps expanding. I mean, I think that there are some groups that are able to identify, you know, 30, 40 individual nuclear spins around a single electron and control 10 or 15 of them.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","376":"Explainer: Yeah.\nExplainee: And that I think is gonna make real breakthroughs in the next 10 years, is the fact that we're just having this much larger group of scientists.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","377":"Explainer: common myth how many qubits do you have that's the only thing that matters like just add more qubits what's the big deal pattern them on your chip\nExplainee: I was asking a computer scientist recently where to read about fault tolerance in classical computing. He said oh they don't teach that in computer science classes anymore because the hardware has become so reliable. In a quantum system, when you look at it or make measurements, it can change in a way that's beyond your control. We have the following task, build a nearly perfect computer out of a whole bunch of imperfect parts.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","378":"Explainer: exactly so i think something that frustrates a lot of people about quantum computing is the concept of decoherence right you can only keep your information quantum for so long right and that limits how many operations you can do in a row before you lose your information\nExplainee: The great power of a quantum computer is also it's Achilles's heel. That it's very very sensitive to perturbations and noise and environmental effects. You're just multiplying your problems if all your doing is adding qubits.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","379":"Explainer: one last myth i think we should bust steve quantum computers are on the verge of breaking into your bank account and breaking encryption and creative cryptography\nExplainee: (laughing) Right, in the next five years there'll be tremendous progress in the field but people really have to understand that we're either at the vacuum tube or transistor stage. We're trying to invent the integrated circuit and scale up. It's still very very very early in the development of the field.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","380":"Explainer: What happens in Minecraft if you get really, really close to a shape?\nExplainee: Well, it just looks like a block.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","381":"Explainer: They're easy for a computer to execute, right? It just has to run this recursive procedure over and over and over again. We can kind of get as much detail as we want or need. When I think about fractals and kind of what they've done for computer graphics. The example I think is subdivision surfaces. Did you, did you encounter subdivision surfaces in your graphics class at all?\nExplainee: The name doesn't really ring a bell.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","382":"Explainer: So subdivision surface is a way of describing a smooth shape on a computer rather than some complicated fractal shape. So meshes and computer graphics are usually made of these flat polygons with kind of sharp edges. And so the question is how can I get something nice and round and smooth out of these sharp looking polygons? What I can do is I can start cutting one at a time, the corners of this paper off, it still looks very angular. I still have these really sharp points.\nExplainee: Right why are we doing this?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","383":"Explainer: Because I want to draw a smooth curve on the screen, but all my computer can do is draw straight lines. And that's actually too true of GPUs. It's kind of interesting. GPUs are basically really fast machines that can only draw one thing and that's a flat triangle. And so if we keep doing this with our paper, you kind of get pretty quickly the idea of what's gonna happen. So when you go to see a Pixar movie, for instance, every surface has been subdivided down. So you have tiny little triangles called micro polygons that are even smaller than the size of a pixel.\nExplainee: How long does this process take?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","384":"Explainer: Well, because people who really need to use these subdivision services for everything, people who worked hard over the years to make this super, super fast. In fact, subdivision services were invented basically at Pixar. There's this guy, Ed Capel, and he was harshly responsible for one of the most famous kinds of subdivision surfaces called Capel Clark subdivision surfaces. And in fact recently won the touring award for these subdivision services.\nExplainee: What do you think are the current shortcomings in, I guess applying fractals to computer science right now, what are, what is the cutting edge?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","385":"Explainer: I wanted to ask you a little bit about what you know about the history of the internet. Have you heard of ARPANET, for example?\nExplainee: I have not heard of ARPANET.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","386":"Explainer: Okay, back into the 1960s, there was a research agency in the United States called DARPA, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency. Actually, it was called ARPA at the time. They wanted to build this notion of a packet-switching network. Not a circuit switch network like a phone network where you get a dedicated path and a dedicated set of bandwidth and links from source to destination.\nExplainee: So what would packet switching enable? I'm sure there's something big here, for sure.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","387":"Explainer: There's a lot big, right? And so remember, this was a Department of Defense, was they wanted to have forms of of communication that were very robust, that were survivable. Packets could all find their own ways, be routed differently through the network. So if parts of the network failed, you could route around failures.\nExplainee: Sounds like the reason for like a request response type of structure.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","388":"Explainer: Ah ha! Spoken like a real computer scientist, right? You're a computer scientist. I'm a computer scientist. We talk about APIs, application programming interfaces. The API for the internet is something called a socket. And a socket simply says, I can communicate if I know your internet address, you know, 128.119.40.186, that number is the IP address of my server, the University of Massachusetts. If you know that, you can write a program anywhere in the world and send a message, and it'll pop out at my end.\nExplainee: I will be remembering that. [Jim laughs] I've heard that there are like seven keys to the internet, something like that.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","389":"Explainer: Okay. What does that mean?\nExplainee: No one authority holds control over any sort of decisions or destinations.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","390":"Explainer: Where do they get dropped, do you think?\nExplainee: Somewhere in their travel process.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","391":"Explainer: Cool. What do you think of when you hear the words quantum sensing?\nExplainee: I think that using some sort of quantum computing to sense some quantum level molecules or particles, like interactions and stuff, maybe.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","392":"Explainer: It would be the top tier.\nExplainee: What are you doing? Like, what are you studying?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","393":"Explainer: Right.\nExplainee: So how long does it take to make a sensor and to make that diamond? Is that created? Do you like, put energy into it or?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","394":"Explainer: So that's in some ways the key to both quantum sensing, as well as quantum computing. It's the idea that you can take a system and put it in a superposition of two states. Normally we think of classically a bit can be a zero or a one. So switch is either on or off. Whereas in a quantum system, it can be in what's called a superposition. So it can be partially on and partially off. But one of the challenges with quantum systems is that these superpositions are really hard to maintain because we don't see superpositions in the world around us. In quantum computing, you try really hard to isolate everything so that you can maintain this quantum property and the fact that it's actually going to lose its quantum properties as it interacts with the world also makes it a great sensor because now you're actually, you're using that fact that it's interacting with the world to say, wait, it's sensing something.\nExplainee: Okay, so it's like using like, the quantum computer would be kind of like the base level and then like you take it out into the world and see how like it differs?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","395":"Explainer: So rather than trying to build a lot of complex algorithms and gates with it, what you do is, you take these quantum bits and you take them out into the world and say, what do you see? What are you sensitive to? So you can use an idea called entanglement to make an even more sensitive quantum sensor, but it's even more fragile. So there's always this trade-off between being super fragile and being super sensitive at the same time.\nExplainee: How does entanglement work into it?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","396":"Explainer: It's more precise, Absolutely.\nExplainee: Okay. Is an atomic clock a quantum sensor?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","397":"Explainer: In some ways, it is and you know, atomic clocks are remarkable devices and being able to measure time that precisely has really important consequences. In fact, our old GPS system is based on the accuracy of atomic clocks. They're a set of satellites, each of which has an atomic clock on board and they send out a timestamp and so, once it gets a signal from three different satellites, it can triangulate and figure out exactly where you are. Now, if you could make those clocks even more precise, you could actually accurately position where you are even more accurately.\nExplainee: Okay, that's really cool.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","398":"Explainer: Well, we're gonna be talking about computers here today, and we're gonna be talking about the internet. I always like to think of the internet by analogy to say road systems for example, where you have roads in your neighborhood. You have state roads, you have the Interstate Highway System. And so the internet is a lot like that. It's an interconnection of local roads, local networks like the network in your house for example.\nExplainee: How does like all of the networks in my house connect to all the city networks?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","399":"Explainer: We could talk about that by analogy to a road system. It's not just one big, super highway. It's a lot of smaller super highways that are all interconnected. And those interchanges are what are called routers. That's where the links come together. You're talking about talking to a friend in Australia. So oh, it's coming in from the East Coast of the United States to this router, and it's going out say, that routers in San Francisco, it's going out on an underseas cable over to Australia rather than in this direction up to Japan.\nExplainee: So there is an underseas cable?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","400":"Explainer: The underseas cables are so cool! They're these big cables that are laid down by switches. They cross both the Atlantic, the Pacific, the Indian Ocean. So the undersea cables are how the networks in Europe, United States, Asia are all connected together.\nExplainee: How do you connect wirelessly?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","401":"Explainer: Ah, you said they're all in one spot. In fact, they're in lots of spots in Netflix. And so most applications would like to connect you with a server that's close to you. Server is really just a big computer with a lot of memory, a lot of discs that store all the Netflix movies, and also so that you don't have to cross over too many internet links to get from where the server is to the TV or the device in your home.\nExplainee: So when I'm watching Vampire Diaries in my house, how does it know exactly what to do without getting scrambled up?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","402":"Explainer: Calculus involves the study of functions. Functions are one of the most fundamental concepts in mathematics, but they aren't always so clearly defined. What would you say a function is?\nExplainee: I would say a function is a procedure that takes an input and does some operation and returns an output.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","403":"Explainer: That's the computer science brain thinking right there. So we wanna think of a function as procedure or mapping between sets. So a function defines a one-to-one correspondence if it defines a perfect matching between the elements of its domain set and the elements of its output set. We call such functions bijections or isomorphisms. So the reason I'm so interested in this idea of a bijective function or a one-to-one correspondence that guarantees that every element of one set gets matched with an element of the other set, no matter how many elements there are, these bijections or these one-to-one correspondences as they help mathematicians reason about infinity.\nExplainee: How can you compare something that is endless?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","404":"Explainer: I'm gonna now try and convince you that they are in fact the same size infinity. And this is using this idea of a one-to-one correspondence which was applied in this context by Georg Cantor. What he says is if we can match up the elements of the integers with the elements of the natural numbers so that there's nothing left over, so that there's a bijective function between them, then that's a proof that there's exactly as many natural numbers as there are integers. Start by matching zero with zero and one with one. But then we wanna include the negatives in the list. So which natural number would we match with negative one?\nExplainee: Maybe two.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","405":"Explainer: Maybe two. Why not? Because now we're starting to make progress on matching all the negatives. We can match the natural number three with the integer two, the natural number four with the integer minus two. And do you see a pattern?\nExplainee: All of the positive integers would be odd numbers and all of the negative integers would be even numbers?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","406":"Explainer: So I'm going to use this picture to count the rational numbers by actually counting the elements of this larger set because it'll be clearer geometrically. What I've drawn in this picture is the integer lattice. So Z cross Z refers to the set of all of these dots. So I'll start by counting the number at the origin, and you can see I'm just labeling the dots around the origin, moving in a counterclockwise fashion and getting progressively further away. And this process could continue, but maybe by now you see the pattern, though it'd be a little bit difficult to describe as a function.\nExplainee: Oh is it for each rational number, there's a pair of integers that represent that rational number?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","407":"Explainer: Exactly. That's exactly right. So we were hoping to compare the size of infinity of the rational numbers with the size of infinity of the natural numbers. What we've done is introduced an intermediate set, these pair of integer points, and this proves that this size of infinity is smaller than this size of infinity. Since we also have an injective function the other way, this size of infinity is smaller than this size of infinity so therefore they must be the same size.\nExplainee: That's wild.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","408":"Explainer: Georg Cantor proved that it is impossible to count all real numbers like we've just counted the rational numbers or just counted the integers. This is called the cardinality of the continuum, it is uncountable. What I'm going to do now is form a new real number that I guarantee is not on this list. Okay, so here's how we do this. What I'm gonna do is I'm gonna look at the diagonal elements. So I'll highlight them. This continues forever, and now I'm going to form a new real number by changing all of these.\nExplainee: If you just like added one to them, then that would be something that doesn't exist in any of the other ones.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","409":"Explainer: Great. That's exactly right. So what we've proven is that this number is missing, and therefore it is impossible to define a bijection between the natural numbers and the real numbers.\nExplainee: Oh wow.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","410":"Explainer: is it some sort of conjecture circuit that is a really good guess there's parts of that that are definitely about conducting this is the inside of a quantum computer\nExplainee: Oh wow.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","411":"Explainer: so that's pretty good so you mentioned superposition but you can also use other quantum properties like entanglement have you heard of entanglement\nExplainee: I have not.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","412":"Explainer: okay so how do noise-canceling headphones work \nExplainee: Not much.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","413":"Explainer: so step one is you need to be able to have an object or physical device we call it a qubit or quantum bit that can actually handle those things can actually be put into superpositions of states you know two cubit states that you can physically entangle with each other that's not really trivial right and things in our classical world you can't really entangle things in our classical world so easily we need to use devices where they can they can support a quantum state and we can manipulate that quantum state atoms ions and in our case superconducting qubits we make qubits out of superconducting materials\nExplainee: I have no idea.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","414":"Explainer: it's a perfect question i mean it's very early for quantum computing but we're building assembly languages we're building layers of abstraction that are going to get you to a point as a programmer where you can interchangeably be programming something the way that you already do and then make calls to a quantum computer so that you can bring it in when it makes sense we're not envisioning quantum computers completely replacing classical computers anytime soon we think that quantum computing is going to be used to accelerate the kinds of things that are really hard for for classical machines\nExplainee: But as like a programmer, how would quantum computing affect a different way of writing a program?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","415":"Explainer: I wanted to ask you if you have ever heard of a black hole?\nExplainee: Jude.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","416":"Explainer: Here, let me show you something. I can ask how heavy it is.\nExplainee: It's not weight, but it's how much of it is in it.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","417":"Explainer: If a star is heavy enough to explode into supernova what's left begins to collapse under its own weight. And if that's heavy enough, the core will not be able to stop collapsing, 'cause it no longer has the thermonuclear fuel, it's run outta fuel. And if it's run outta fuel, it's no longer shining and pushing outward. And without that it itself begins to go dark and there's nothing fighting the collapse anymore. And that's when you form a black hole.\nExplainee: How does it go that small?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","418":"Explainer: Well, that's a really good question. So interestingly, the sun itself isn't heavy enough. So it has to be heavy enough that when it begins to collapse, it just overcomes all attempts to fight it. If you made something really dense, you would have to travel faster than the speed of light to actually escape. That's 300,000 kilometers per second.\nExplainee: So if like the sun all collapsed on itself, it would form a black hole?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","419":"Explainer: So it goes so fast that it goes completely dark. Any light that veers too close will fall in, will not be able to make it back out again. If a light is shining from the sun near a black hole, the black hole's not touching it. Why does the light get pulled in? Why does that happen?\nExplainee: So it goes so fast that there's it's all dark?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","420":"Explainer: It is taking other stuff, but the funny question was like, if I wanted to move your chair, you'd think it was really strange if I didn't have to come near you and actually grab the chair and move it. One of the things Einstein thought about is he imagined that what the black hole is doing is it's changing the shape of space around it. What do you think of that idea?\nExplainee: Because the black hole is taking other stuff?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","421":"Explainer: Does infinity come up in your mathematics that you're studying?\nExplainee: One place infinity comes up is in algebraic geometry. Normally we think okay, well if you have two lines like this, you'd keep drawing them, they intersect right here. But in projective space, two parallel lines will also intersect at the point at infinity. Infinity is like this perfect concept for what we can add to a space that allows lines to have this more uniform property. What's your research in?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","422":"Explainer: And a choice function does what exactly?\nExplainee: Yeah, that's a good question.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","423":"Explainer: That you don't want the complexity of managing them to go up linearly with that. You'd like it to still stay pretty flat as you start adding.\nExplainee: Right, exactly. I mean, the good thing about IoT devices is that they tend to transmit very, very small amounts of data.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","424":"Explainer: We're used to ethernet cables that can handle many hundreds of gigabits per second over a wired device. What are the typical data rates for IoT devices? I mean, not hundreds of gigabits.\nExplainee: No, I mean I would imagine upper bound, KB per second, lower bound, you could see bytes per second just on average. But I mean, say that you have a temperature sensor running off of your Arduino that's reporting the temperature in your house every minute. That's going to be far less than kilobytes per second on average.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","425":"Explainer: [Amit] Right.\nExplainee: So what's your take on why knowledge is, rather than information, or zero-data proof. Clearly, there's data there. So can't be zero-data.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","426":"Explainer: being something that you can already predict. Right.\nExplainee: Mm-hmm.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","427":"Explainer: Right.\nExplainee: So that data then immediately imply, a knowledge. But people can't, sometimes.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","428":"Explainer: Yeah. This concept of zero-knowledge programs would allow you to carry out completely arbitrary computations\nExplainee: Mm-hmm.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","429":"Explainer: And I think that's a sign. That's a sign that our baby has grown up and, you know, it's time for it to be developed.\nExplainee: I think, profoundly, the students often also ask me, what are the future direction, both in terms of crypto, zero-knowledge proof, in the real world and how mathematical you see in computing.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","430":"Explainer: Does the Large Magellanic Cloud have a big black hole?\nExplainee: I'm a second year. So I'm measuring star formation histories in the Small and Large Magellanic Clouds.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","431":"Explainer: Yeah, I think it's a really good question. The only mechanism that we know for sure can form black holes is to collapse of very massive stars. So it's sensible to think, well maybe some very massive stars in a young universe collapsed under their own weight and then they merged and after some time they got big enough, but the black holes from stars can be tens of times the mass of the sun, maybe hundreds of times to the mass of the sun if they merge. To get to millions and billions, and if you just do the simple arithmetic of how many years that would take, there aren't enough years in the 14 billion years of the universe's lifetime. So they must have come from somewhere else.\nExplainee: So I don't study AGN a lot, but I do have a long term interest in black holes, it's one of the reasons I entered the field. I always was curious about how a black hole of that size was able to form. Was it the result of mergers between smaller black holes, ultimately creating gravitational well deep enough to contract a protogenic disc for a whole galaxy? Or, man, what happened?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","432":"Explainer: [Janna] Yeah.\nExplainee: We spend all of our time, when we learn about black holes in school, predominantly through star collapse.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","433":"Explainer: But when we do merge with Andromeda, presumably our black holes will merge and Andromeda indeed has a very big black hole as well at its center. And then we'll have this just gigantic-\nExplainee: And Andromeda is one of the few galaxies that is traveling towards us and do for a merger event at some point. So given a sufficiently low velocity, we would just have two big galaxies that, for the most part, pass through each other, pass by each other. But given a sufficiently high velocity, we will have some crazy black hole interactions and some crazy star interactions.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","434":"Explainer: Yeah, and it's very possible that as you said, the collision won't be so severe that it'll be very disruptive. So our entire solar system could stay intact and here we would go with the sun and all the other planets in orbit around a new black hole.\nExplainee: Supermassive black hole.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","435":"Explainer: We work a lot right now on thinking of black holes as batteries. So a black hole that can take, like a giant magnet, astronomical magnet in the form of another collapsed star, like a neutron star, and flip it around so fast, near the speed of light, that it actually creates an electronic circuit out of this moving magnet. And so that the power that can come out of these electronic circuits created by these batteries can be tremendous.\nExplainee: They're kind of misunderstood giants in a way. So I was curious, have you heard anything new or interesting in the field of black holes that will shape future discussions?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","436":"Explainer: It's a great question. I once did a calculation of using a black hole made out of the moon and the strongest magnet we could find on Earth to see if I could make an electronic battery. And honestly, you only get about enough energy to power New York City. But we have to find one in our neighborhood first.\nExplainee: You know, I know that at a certain point for our civilization to become sufficiently advanced, to travel the cosmos beyond, you know, the moon or Mars, we may have to be able to harness the power of our sun. Would it be similarly possible to harness the power of a black hole like you were mentioning, to travel?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","437":"Explainer: i have colleagues here that tell me it can take up to weeks to train certain neural networks right\nExplainee: Certainly, depending on the complexity of your model then computational speed is one thing.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","438":"Explainer: and actually machine learning is one research direction where we're really hoping that we're going to find um key parts of the machine learning computation that can be sped up using quantum computing\nExplainee: Sure, yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","439":"Explainer: if you think about even just classical information like bits right at the end of the day when you store a bit in your hard drive there's a magnetic domain and you have a magnetic polarization right\nExplainee: So in a classical computer, you know, you have all sorts of logical gates that perform operations and they change an input to some sort of output but I guess it's not immediately obvious how you do that with quantum computers.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","440":"Explainer: you can change the magnetization to be pointing up or pointing down right quantum systems we're still manipulating a device and changing the quantum state of that of that device you can imagine if it's a spin that you could have spin up and spin down but you can also if you isolate it enough you can have a superposition of up and down\nExplainee: Sure.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","441":"Explainer: yeah that's a really good question this actually is a model of the inside of one of our quantum computers\nExplainee: So how do we actually encode it to start with?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","442":"Explainer: the key is to come up with algorithms where the result is deterministic\nExplainee: Okay.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","443":"Explainer: there's sort of two main classes of quantum algorithms there's algorithms which were developed for decades right things like shore's algorithm which is for factoring grover's algorithm for unstructured search and these algorithms were designed assuming that you had a perfect fault tolerant quantum computer which is many decades away so we're currently in a phase where we're exploring what can we do with these near-term quantum computers and the answer is going to be well we need different kinds of algorithms to really even explore that question\nExplainee: Interesting, so what do those algorithms look like?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","444":"Explainer: yeah they also unfortunately require fault tolerance right now the algorithms that we know of today to do those things um on a quantum computer require you to have millions of error-corrected qubits today we're at like 50. it's actually amazing that we're at 50. there's things that we know or we have strong reason to believe um are going to be faster to do on a quantum computer and then there's things that we'll discover just by virtue of having one\nExplainee: Yeah certainly having a search algorithm is very useful. Factoring, those are definitely useful things that I would imagine could be done a lot faster on a quantum computer.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","445":"Explainer: How can we get robots to learn more efficiently or learn faster?\nExplainee: From my experience, it's a matter of how much support you give the, like, robot when it's learning. One could be like a narrower task range. Another is maybe like also biasing the types of samples that you're collecting can bias towards interactions that are gonna be useful where the hands actually interact with each other, rather than just off doing their own things. What have you found to be like your go-tos between the different styles?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","446":"Explainer: Yeah. So you may not transfer the exact strategy or the exact policy that the robot takes, but you should be able to learn some general heuristics about performing manipulation.\nExplainee: There's this gap between the simulators that we have now and what we actually experience in reality. So what do you think are promising directions to try out for actually making our simulations match reality more closely?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","447":"Explainer: Have you heard of fractals before?\nExplainee: No, absolutely not.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","448":"Explainer: So somehow they have to explain to the computer what a tree looks like so that the computer can draw the tree for them.\nExplainee: Yes.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","449":"Explainer: It almost looks like that branch that you broke off is itself another tree. So our rule is that every branch splits into two smaller branches.\nExplainee: Okay.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","450":"Explainer: So your tree is totally beautiful, but it took a long time to make, right. How would you feel if I said, now you have to make a thousand of those trees.\nExplainee: I'd be like, oh my that's a lot of work.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","451":"Explainer: On a computer if you wanna learn to draw fractals, then you might need to learn a little bit about programming. [Keenan] Programming. Yeah.\nExplainee:  Programming.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","452":"Explainer: So hey, Jen, it's great to see you again.\nExplainee: Good to see you, Jim.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","453":"Explainer: Right, well it holds together because we have standards, and we have protocols that you mentioned.\nExplainee: Exactly, protocol standards for how the equipment talks to one another. And increasingly, certificate authorities that help bootstrap the secure, encrypted and communication between end hosts. So there are a few of these sort of centrally, kind of agreed upon kinds of infrastructure, but for the most part, each network runs itself.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","454":"Explainer: And certainly, we've heard about some countries that impose firewalls that don't let certain kinds of traffic out, or certain kinds of traffic in. So there's no global body that is regulating that?\nExplainee: Not really because each country really can have it's own laws and its own norms. And so they can decide, like the Great Firewall of China can decide, they don't wanna let certain content be accessed by the citizens inside that country. So if a country decides they don't wanna answer a request for a particular domain name, they say, Hey, I don't want to let someone know the IP address of this website. They can decide not to let those answers be delivered inside their country. And so encryption plays a role in helping people keep their privacy or prevent surveillance, but it's not perfect. It's often possible, still, to know a fair amount about what people are doing, even if you can't look inside the envelope at the letter that's written.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","455":"Explainer: So you can infer or guess a lot of things.\nExplainee: Exactly.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","456":"Explainer: So you want the computation close to where the endpoint is.\nExplainee: Exactly, and I think that what's now exciting about that is all three of these technologies, wireless, networking and cloud, which are normally three different communities, three different sets of technologies, three different sets of standards or practices, now have to work together in close harmony to be able to service applications that are really critical and that that might be interacting with the physical world in ways where safety is a potential concern.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","457":"Explainer: You know, we've had cellular networks now for 20, 30 years. So when we hear about 5G, what's trumpeted the most is the fact that oh, super high bandwidth, right? But I sense that the exciting things are more than just the network being faster.\nExplainee: I agree. It's both the high bandwidth, it's the low delay so that you can have these applications that interact with the physical world and need answers in real-time. It's about having the compute really close so that you can integrate computation and communication. It's about having more coverage.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","458":"Explainer: What is your impression of what a black hole is?\nExplainee: I'm a senior at NYU. I'm studying physics and environmental studies.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","459":"Explainer: So from the outside, if you're an astronaut, you're watching your friend, another astronaut going into the black hole, it's as though your times become rotated relative to each other. So the profound thing is as an astronaut on the outside, looking at this round event horizon, you think of the center of black hole as a point in space, but to the person who's fallen in, it's not a point in space at all, it's a point in time. The singularity, or the end of it all, the crush in the center of a black hole is in their future. So they can no more avoid the singularity than you can avoid the next instant of time coming. So the death in the singularity is inevitable. Although we don't really think the singularity necessarily exists.\nExplainee: I remember that once you pass the event horizon space becomes time and time becomes space, in like, a coordinate sense.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","460":"Explainer: So the singularity is definitely predicted in Einstein's general theory of relativity and that's purely a theory of spacetime. And in the theory of spacetime, there is no question that a singularity would form when the star collapses catastrophically inside the black hole. Now, even when people talked about singularities back in the '60s, they thought, you know, quantum mechanics is part of the story of the whole of physics. It's not just gravity. And if we understand quantum gravity we'll realize that singularity probably doesn't ever actually form.\nExplainee: I sort of know what a singularity is. I think of it as something where everything is compacted into one single point, it's a place where the laws of physics don't exactly work out. What did you mean when you said that you don't think the singularity really exists?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","461":"Explainer: I would say to some extent we don't know for sure. What we have found is that the mathematics is so unbelievably powerful that we're able to disprove wrong ideas just in pen and paper. Just very recently, within the past couple of years, the first ever human-procured image of a black hole showed us what we expected to see of the event horizon. So Jayda, after our conversation today, what would you say a black hole is?\nExplainee: So since we obviously have never been to a black hole, how do we know for sure, like, what happens after you cross the event horizon or what happens inside a black hole? Is it just like, inferred from the math?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","462":"Explainer: Talk us through Hawking's initial revolution that led to a lot of these conversations about the information around black holes.\nExplainee: Hawking's big insight was that he had to apply both the rules of quantum mechanics and the rules of gravity to really understand how black holes behaved. But Hawking took a point of view where he brought quantum mechanics into the game. He really that if you took that into account, that it's actually not quite true that black holes are black, that actually things can escape from black holes.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","463":"Explainer: Now, to be clear, nobody disputes that black holes will quantum radiate, that Hawking radiation is a solid prediction. The black holes should in fact evaporate, that's not disputed, right?\nExplainee: That's right. It would be wonderful if we could have some experimental of evidence for this, if we could really build a black hole in the lab and test to see whether it behaves this way. But I think there is hope that we'll be able to detect some of these effects either indirectly, by looking at black holes out in the universe, or also maybe indirectly in the laboratory by looking at systems which aren't black holes, but which radiate in kind of similar ways.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","464":"Explainer: That's near and dear to my heart. Multi-party computations.\nExplainee: Obviously, zero-knowledge proofs are about proving things to another person without revealing the details of what it is that you're proving. But, you know, in my mind, zero-knowledge actually goes even further beyond that. It's like this overarching concept that you can see a lot in multi-party computation, where you wanna accomplish some sort of task without revealing anything more than exactly what you need to accomplish that task.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","465":"Explainer: Indeed.\nExplainee: But once you flip that on its head and you're no longer trying to do that, suddenly all of the bad properties of randomness become good.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","466":"Explainer: No doubt. And especially with cloud computing, exploiting the power of the cloud to enable zero-knowledge proofs, and to make use of zero-knowledge proofs, would be amazing.\nExplainee: Yeah. Absolutely.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","467":"Explainer: There you go, there is your decision. Okay, you can take those. It took you some time there. You looked like you were really working hard at that problem. And that's interesting because actually we know that from research that when people have to make a decision between two things they like equally, some people like economists think oh those are the easiest decisions because they're both good options. But as psychologists and neuroscientists we know it's the opposite. One of the reasons is because there's no simple answer of like I know that one's better I'm just gonna go with it. And so we think that that's the kind of decision where memory is especially important because you have to kind of come up with more information.\nExplainee: Exactly, and then also like after it was like, maybe like I would've, enjoyed this more than that and like maybe I should've chose the other one. And you don't know.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","468":"Explainer: Got a favorite movie?\nExplainee: Matilda.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","469":"Explainer: Let's say we want to get a video from here, over to here. How do you think that video would sort of travel through this network?\nExplainee: Maybe it could go to here, to here, to here, to here.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","470":"Explainer: That's right. So that's pretty cool. There are actually lots of different ways to actually go through the internet to get from what we call a source, the place that's sending the information, to the receiver, the place that's actually gathering the information together. And that's something we actually call routing.\nExplainee: Huh, but wouldn't it just be easier for it to go from here to here, instead of going from here to here, to here to here?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","471":"Explainer: Yeah. So that's a really good observation. In most pieces of the internet, that's exactly what would happen. We want to take what's called a shortest path. But still, there are multiple paths. And why do you think that might be valuable?\nExplainee: Maybe one way is messed up or broken. So you go the other way.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","472":"Explainer: Lettuce.\nExplainee: Lettuce who?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","473":"Explainer: It's a great analogy. You know I remember when I first learned of your work, for me as somebody who studies learning and memory, which are processes that are all about rapid updating that to me was really mind blowing that we can now start asking questions about dynamics of circuits on a timescale that's much closer to the timescale of human thought than anything we had before.\nExplainee: The field is definitely opening up in the kinds of questions that can be asked now with these approaches. And I think what you're pointing out is that conceptually it's where we wanted to go anyway. So if there's so much orchestration that happens and a symphony is not a single piece, it's not a single pattern of, of harmony between instruments and, and similar to the brain, symphony of your brain is not a single pattern. It's a very dynamically changing pattern.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","474":"Explainer: In the field we often talk of have having a mental model that we use to make predictions about what's about to happen and really use that to mean kind of a general understanding of what's going on. What does that look like in terms that come from your world of like the configuration of, of a circuit?\nExplainee: I think this is the most exciting area of memory research right now I think, which is how people build and remember, you know, and keep with them models of the world over long periods of time. When I think about a mental model, I think about ideas, potential outcomes, potential events, potential actions, and how they all depend on one another. So when we predict what will happen next it would be, I am currently sitting at this piece of the network and I know that there are, there are these possible outcomes. And so I have to get ready for those, you know, four possible outcomes. But that brings this interesting question to the fore, I think which is how does a network system in our mind and our brain create a network model of the world outside? It's almost like there's a reflection in the structure of what's inside in the hardware and what we're building in a very abstract way. And I think that relates to some interesting work that's coming out about the hippocampus too.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","475":"Explainer: We now think of the hippocampus so much in terms of memory but really some of the earliest work in neuroscience on the hippocampus talked about the role of the hippocampus in spatial navigation. And it really exposed I think one of the deepest questions in memory research, or at least from the neuroscience perspective is like, well what is the connection? What is the connection between spatial processing and memory? And why is it that neurons in the hippocampus when an animal is navigating a maze, why is it that there's spatial specialization there? I really do think that this notion of a mental model, a generative model is where those, where memory and space meet.\nExplainee: That makes a lot of sense. And I think that it makes me wonder how we think about places in the abstract, what is a cognitive place, right? And what is, how do we map out the cognitive spaces that we, that our mind moves within in the same way or in a similar way to the spaces that we physically walk in. But I think it opens a lot up, a lot of questions about how individuals make their own maps, right? And then how the way that they choose to make that map will then affect the way that they may respond in the future to a new context or environment.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","476":"Explainer: It's really interesting. And I think it also really speaks to the kind of pervasive and circular role of memory, right? Because the maps are dependent on memories, they're built from memories and experiences. So there's this kind of dialogue with memory creating maps, maps creating experiences, experiences creating memories, affecting the maps, and really makes me think even of a question a friend asked me recently about moods and mental health and this feeling of like how do some people get kind of trapped in a state of mind where all they can see is a particular way forward. But then something happens in the world that shifts them to another model.\nExplainee: Which is actually really interesting because you can make different maps in different physical spaces too, right? As you walk into a new room you make a new map of that room. So what are the doorways basically for mental models? And I think that often we sort of fall into this pattern of, of thinking about memory as, as always additive, that we always just keep gathering more information and update what we currently have. We don't as often speak about deleting pieces of information or, or perceptions or something that we thought was a, was a useful fact but actually it's not a fact.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","477":"Explainer: Memories as models or models first and memory as part of what helps build the model starts generating new predictions. Exactly the kind you just brought up or other ways of thinking about things because an efficient model needs to let go of information, right? I just heard a colleague of mine joking about the fact that the principles of neuroscience textbook keeps growing and growing. And that if we had enough strength in theoretical neuroscience, if our models of neuroscience were good enough, that book should shrink back. We know that memory retrieval is essentially construction. And so you don't need to store all those separate memories. You need to construct them. But if you have a good model, let go of all those details and just construct them to feel as if it's a memory. But really all you're doing is using the model to fill the details. It's kind of like the matrix, you know.\nExplainee: Right.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","478":"Explainer: Getting way out there, but, but it is a way in which if you have the right model, it should be an efficient one. I'm wondering what you, what you think about what all this means for kind of a redefinition of what memory is, in many ways a revision or expansion of that notion. Would you be willing to try to help me think about how to define it?\nExplainee: I think it's information certainly that, that is stored in the brain and that can then affect our behavior. I think getting your behavior in there somewhere seems, seems important. But also is it just a record of the past or is it, you know, our perceptions of, of what happened in the past, or how we've changed how we think about that past event or have we deleted that event completely and then gathered this higher level structure or mental model that then allows us to behave differently in the future? So it's more alive, it's more changing. It's more, I think it's bubbling out and gathering, gathering and growing and becoming more flexible, but it's also sort of bubbling in, in the sense of deleting and removing and forgetting. So yes, I think that what we need to add perhaps is that changeability and perhaps the behavioral relevance of that changeability. I don't know, what do you think?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","479":"Explainer: Have you heard about black holes?\nExplainee: Yes, I know it has a lot of mass, but it's very small. I know that there are several theories about the universe due to black holes, like, around the universe and how it's made.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","480":"Explainer: So a lot of times stars are born together in two star systems and when they die, if they're heavy enough, they will collapse under their own weight and form a black hole. So here you have a black hole and a big fluffy star. And what will happen is it'll start to tear apart its neighboring star. Literally parts of the star will begin to spill onto the black hole and splatter on the black hole. But let's say both those stars formed black holes. And what these black holes do is they are like mallets on a drum. They create literally waves in the shape of spacetime as they're moving. So imagine mallets on a drum, how the drum ripples. Depending on how the mallets are moving you hear different sounds. So effectively these black holes, as they get very close together in the final stages of their life together, they're orbiting each other at hundreds of times a second. It's this really crazy event, but it's happening in complete darkness. Eventually they bobble together and they merge and then they wring out, the spacetime's going crazy around them, it's this storm in spacetime, and they settle down to a quiet black hole. Then those waves that they created travel through the universe, basically undisturbed. For a long time people thought, well, even if black holes are out there, they're impossible to observe. And then they got very clever. You might wonder how we could possibly hear black holes, that sounds crazy. So I'm gonna show you, but I'm gonna need your help. This demo involves an electric guitar. Do you play at all?\nExplainee: A little bit?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","481":"Explainer: Okay, you wanna do the demo for me? So the LIGO instrument electronically records the ringing of the shape of space with its very complicated instrument. It stands for Laser Interferometric Gravitational-Waves Observatory and the design was incredibly difficult and they didn't know if they would succeed. I think of the instrument as like the body of the electric guitar. And then they take the readout of the motions of the waves that they're recording, just like that guitar is recording the motions of the waves on the string. Now just play it like a little bit. And you can't hear anything, right? You're not meant to hear an electric guitar when it's not plugged in. What's happening is the guitar strings are ringing, but so quietly that we can't actually hear the sound. And this is like the gravitational waves, which are ringing the drum of spacetime, but so quietly that they're not move the air and we're not hearing them. So now play and I'm gonna turn the volume up a little bit. While I can't actually hear the ringing of the strings themselves, I can hear the data of the shape of the string recorded and played through this amplifier. And that's kind of the idea behind the LIGO instrument.\nExplainee: How do you know that it's like the black hole that's making this sound and nothing else?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","482":"Explainer: It's a great question. If I didn't see you playing the guitar, I would recognize the sound of a guitar. And even if I had never heard of a guitar before I could figure out the frequencies that the string was playing, I could tell how strongly it had been plucked, and I could tell the length of it and where it was pinned down from the harmonics of the string. And I can tell the different lengths of the strings from the notes that they play. So I can actually reconstruct the instrument that's playing it. And it's very similar to LIGO, we can listen to the notes, the amplitude, the harmonics, and we can deduce the size and shape of the objects doing that. And they're very massive and they're very small and they have all the markings of a black hole.\nExplainee: Is there anything that like gets affected on Earth because of those waves?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","483":"Explainer: So great to see you, Michael. Thanks for coming.\nExplainee: It's my pleasure.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","484":"Explainer: Why do you think it's so hard to build these things into AI systems and robots?\nExplainee: I guess if you think about a quintessentially human task, like playing chess or solving arithmetic problem, things that other creatures just don't do, when you're a human being, you have to learn that in cultural time. And so there's a limited amount of data you have. But if you're talking about seeing the world interacting with the world, using your effectors properly, that's the combination of this massive amount of evolutionary time. When you look at that, it's like the 56 games of chess I played in chess club that doesn't look like a lot of training data. You work so hard to make a robot, do one particular thing or one class of task, and then seems like people must always come up to you and say, 'So, okay, but what about my other task? Okay. You can fold the sock or stack a cup. How about my dishes?' Is that frustrating? Is that a challenge? Is it interesting?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","485":"Explainer: I think it's interesting. And also a huge challenge. I think that it's interesting that if a person sees a robot doing something that seems very capable, they assume that the robot can do all sorts of other capable things. It's a huge challenge, because that's actually not the case.\nExplainee: When we think about babies on their social cognition, we actually start from the idea that they have a notion of what an agent is. An agent is something that's self-propelled, that has its own internal states, like goals and beliefs. And so, it's very natural to imagine that when you see a seemingly, they call it propulsive, action by a robot, you're thinking, 'Hey, this thing has a desire. It has a goal. It's accomplishing it with its. So what if I give it a different goal? Why couldn't it do that?' They call it promiscuous generalization about agents, right? I think that the electrical outlet looks like a face. I think that my computer's mad at me. And so I think it, the challenge actually is to stop people from doing that, and to recognize limitations where there are some. Or we bring to bear our knowledge, sometimes incredibly quickly, to parse an uncertain image. So our experiences go all the way down to our very first impressions of the sensory signal.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","486":"Explainer: That notion of hierarchy is really interesting, because it is these higher level things, like playing chess, for example, that are easier for AI systems. And the reason why they're easier is that we're providing the abstraction for the system already, then when we give the game of chess to an AI system, we abstract away all the challenges of like picking up pieces and moving them, and we say, 'Okay, there's this board of however many boxes on it.' And you just need to figure out within that very narrow, small world, what to do. But handling and learning what those abstractions should be and handling everything from low level sensory inputs to that higher level processing is really, really hard.\nExplainee: Our impression that it's purely discrete and symbolic might be, just that might be an impression, because we talk about it in a language. And actually, the fact that it's connected up to all these perception and sensation and action systems means that it's probably grounded in a more continuous set of representations. I wonder, is there gonna be a point where what you really want to know is what are the experiences that a human has? [indistinct] human speech own project. His idea was, 'Well, I need the exact data that my son gets in order to train my robot to be like my son.' Or do you think that we're gonna end up in a world that's more like the large language models and that'll have to do?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","487":"Explainer: So what are you studying these days?\nExplainee: Well, I'm preparing my dissertation. The general topic is going to be how we perceive different types of social stimuli, like different people's faces and make judgements about them and how the way that we report on what we are experiencing tells us about what's actually going on inside our heads.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","488":"Explainer: What I love about what you were describing is like you didn't use the word memory, were how you were talking about kind of perceptions and social judgments but I think probably we'd both agree that memory is a big part of that.\nExplainee: Oh of course.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","489":"Explainer: Right, like it reminds me so much of, you know, what we in the field would refer to as statistical learning. On one hand we might have like a one-shot memory, a memory of something that we saw yesterday, like what we did or what we ate or where we were. But a lot of our memories and our knowledge instead are based on many, many, many experiences.\nExplainee: Oh, absolutely. I think this sort of reminds me of another project that I'm doing. It's fairly easy to get different participants to experience consistent negative emotions to the same stimuli, but with positive emotions it's so much harder to study. I might not react the same to like this like cute cat video than someone else. And I definitely believe that people's memory that they're bringing up unconsciously when they're experiencing something to make an emotional judgment informs especially our experience with positive emotion possibly more than negative emotion.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","490":"Explainer: I think what we're still kind of trying to understand as a field is the more kind of detailed and bigger picture of where does this model live? How does it get updated based on experiences? Why does that sometimes happen and sometimes not? There are actually people who are born without a hippocampus. They have disruptions to episodic memories. They have trouble after this conversation remembering what the conversation was about, but they do have pretty good semantic information. They have a good sense of knowledge about the world. And that's interesting for two reasons. One, it shows this association between the role of the hippocampus and these two forms of memory, episodic memories and semantic memory. The other reason it's interesting is that people often assume that we get to semantic memory through episodic memory, that we encounter one dog and then another dog, and then another dog and then we learned the concept, the semantic notion of a dog. And these people, their profile suggests that you can learn semantic information. You can learn general knowledge about the world, even without ever having the capacity to build those individual memories.\nExplainee: In people with intact brains, you might use a particular process, but if that brain region that subserves that process is damaged, that it's not that you can't do it anymore you just now do it a different way.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","491":"Explainer: You know when I look back at, some of the work for my own lab and in the field in general, I really feel like some of the most exciting discoveries were not an answer to a question that was around before, but they were discoveries that made us realize we weren't asking the right question. I think one example of that even has to do with the connection between memory and decision-making. There was a discovery about how the striatum responds to rewards and to learning that just all of a sudden flipped the way we thought about the role of reward and learning and memory, and may force us to realize there was something fundamentally connected between these processes. And that discovery just raised a whole new set of questions that didn't exist before.\nExplainee: It's really hard to tell people like, just don't use your memory to do this. And we just sort of have to infer and guess at what strategies that they're doing. Is there's a particular research question that the answer you think is gonna inform the research in your lab and perhaps in the rest of your field?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","492":"Explainer: Typically you would think that things that are easy for humans, are also easy for robots and computers to do.\nExplainee: Right.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","493":"Explainer: And things that are hard for humans should also be hard for robots and humans to do. But it turns out that it's actually the opposite. I wanna try a little demo.\nExplainee: Okay.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","494":"Explainer: So I have a penny in my hand and I'd like you to pick it up with your right hand and put it into your left hand. So that was pretty easy, right?\nExplainee: Yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","495":"Explainer: We're gonna make this a little bit harder now. So, can you put these on? And we'll try to do the same thing again with your eyes closed. There you go. Let's try that one more time, and see if you can do any better. So close your eyes.\nExplainee: Oh, there we go.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","496":"Explainer: Yeah. So that you're able, with a bit more practice, you're able to figure it out. When it fell on the ground, how did you know to pick it up off the ground?\nExplainee: From the sound.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","497":"Explainer: So when a robot tries to do something, like pick up an object, not only do you need to program exactly like what the motors should do, the robot also needs to be able to see where the object is. Then this is what's called a perception action loop in robotics. So if the object moves, the robot can then adapt what it's doing and change what it's doing to successfully pick up the object. It's really important for robots to be able to leverage, not just like the past hour of experience, but also ideally many years of experience, in order to do the kinds of things that you did.\nExplainee: It's kind of hard for me to understand why like robots can do like all these crazy calculations, but they can't do like all the simple stuff, so.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","498":"Explainer: Yeah. It's really unintuitive. In order to survive, we need to pick up objects and everything. Basically many, many, like billions of years of evolution actually created humans and the ability to manipulate objects like that. So, it actually turns out that things that are really basic for us are actually just really complex tasks in general.\nExplainee: So do robots know, like, they messed up? They know.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","499":"Explainer: That's a great question. So in reinforcement learning, the robot tries the task, and then it gets some sort of reinforcement, some sort of feedback. It's similar to how you might train a dog.\nExplainee: Yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","500":"Explainer: So you could give it feedback like that. So it won't necessarily know itself, especially on the first few tries, but it's trying to figure out what the task is even.\nExplainee: Does a robot see like how we see or does it like, just see like a program or something?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","501":"Explainer: It depends on how you program the robot. If you program the robot to follow exact motions and follow a very specific program, then it won't go off that program. It will always do those actions. But if something unexpected happens, that the program wasn't designed to handle, then the robot might go off court.\nExplainee: Do you think robots will take over the world? Just being honest.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","502":"Explainer: Yeah for sure.\nExplainee: Just because I was so excited, you know? So that the thing is that it took me maybe 30 minutes. A kid at home who's like 13 and 14 who just starts playing around with a simple computer program can make incredibly beautiful fractals.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","503":"Explainer: Or you don't even need computers. Like I remember when I was a kid, I played electric guitar and I had all these guitar pedals with different effects and oh, what happens if you put the output back in the input and just run it through itself, you're gonna start hearing this kind of fractal sound, right? So today we've been telling people, fractals are things that are somehow self-similar, they have detail at all scales. Are there other ways you might introduce fractals to somebody or are there other things you might say, this is what a fractal is?\nExplainee: And I think that's one of the things that's exciting about it.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","504":"Explainer: Yeah.\nExplainee: And then you get it all.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","505":"Explainer: [Keenan] Right?\nExplainee: And when everybody understands scaling.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","506":"Explainer: Now you work on kind of the future of virtual reality and augmented reality and extended reality. But it's kind of interesting because I think if I think about exploring these infinite fractal landscapes in some way, they still feel a little bit lonely or they feel a little bit poor of the kind of richness that we have in the real world.\nExplainee: Scaling is a simple thing yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","507":"Explainer: Absolutely.\nExplainee: Well, it's also, it's not even possible to explore, to store an entire world in your computer.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","508":"Explainer: So- He made a lot of happy little trees.\nExplainee: I think in that case, it came down to the fact that Ken in particular had a mission to make accessible tools for people without sacrificing the power and the richness of making beautiful things. I mean, in a sense he was kind of the computer graphic, Bob Ross. You know? So- \nExplainer: {missing part}\n","509":"Explainer: So what do you know about infinity?\nExplainee: I think it means that it's really just something that's infinite, that never ends.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","510":"Explainer: That's a great way to think about it. Infinity is something that never ends, where finite, the opposite of infinity, refers to a process or a quantity that we could actually count all the way through, at least in theory if given enough time. So if you had to guess, how many Skittles are in this jar?\nExplainee: I would say about like 217.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","511":"Explainer: So let's try and imagine infinitely many jars. Would they fit in this room?\nExplainee: No.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","512":"Explainer: That's a wonderful question, a very rich question. What do you think?\nExplainee: I think maybe because you said it was unlimited.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","513":"Explainer: me too\nExplainee: Yeah, always when I'm trying to take a photo.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","514":"Explainer: have you ever heard of the word quantum \nExplainee: No.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","515":"Explainer: i'm going to start by telling you about something called superposition so i'm going to explain it using this giant penny\nExplainee: Heads.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","516":"Explainee: Yeah, I mean I'm definitely gonna impress all my friends when I tell them about this, they're gonna be like, quantum what?\nExplainer: your hair is tangled or whatever you can you can untangle it right\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","517":"Explainer: but in the quantum world when we entangle things they're really now connected it's much much harder to separate them again so using the same analogy we spin our pennies and eventually eventually they both stop right and when they stop it's either heads or tails right so in my case i got tails and you got heads you see how they're totally disconnected from each other right our pennies in the real world now if our pennies were entangled and we both spun them together right when we stopped them if you measured your penny to be ahead i would measure my penny to be ahead and if you measured your penny to be a tails i would measure my opinion to be a tails if we measured it at exactly the same time we would still find that they were both exactly correlated \nExplainer: that's so cool right \nExplainer: {missing part}\n","518":"Explainer: So sensing is really just about measuring stuff.\nExplainee: Okay.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","519":"Explainer: Exactly. Yeah. Do you know what an MRI, how an MRI works?\nExplainee: No, I don't and I feel like I should because I've gotten them millions of times.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","520":"Explainer: Start to see the different cells\nExplainee: Yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","521":"Explainer: We can do it on tissues right now or on the surface, but we can't actually do it inside the body. So right now, we're struggling to figure out which scenarios can we use this to get better information and when can we not do it.\nExplainee: Are there any other quantum sensors at the moment that are

studied the brain for 30 years, but I have to say, sleep science is the most fascinating area of neuroscience I've ever encountered.","1":"I'm excited to dive into the topic with you, especially since you have a background in neuroscience.","2":"Well, it's actually not very reliable. So, amphetamines, they can kind of improve sleep quality in the short term, but the long term, it's actually kind of the opposite. People taking amphetamines for wakefulness, they can develop kind of rebound insomnia, so they actually have a harder time falling asleep at night. And it's not just that, but it's also not really improving sleep quality in the long term. So, people taking amphetamines for a long time, they're not getting better sleep, they're just kind of, they're just managing their sleepiness, but it's not really addressing the underlying problem.","3":"So, it's not necessarily that the amphetamines directly improve the quality of sleep, but rather they can help regulate the timing of sleep, which can lead to better quality sleep in some cases.","4":"And do we know if the sleep deprivation that results from taking amphetamines is more likely to disrupt the normal architecture of sleep, or is it more like a reduction in the amount of sleep that you get?","5":"And I think one thing that we were discussing earlier, that you could consider, is how that might be assessed, so maybe you'd have them fill out a sleep diary, or maybe you'd use actigraphy, which is a non-invasive way to track movement during sleep.","6":"You have to be willing to take risks. And that's a hard thing to do, because when you're working with harmony, you're working with a very precise language.","7":"You said the song's chord progression is a nice example of a tonal center, and that's what I was thinking about, the tonal center of D flat major, the chord progression of the song, how it's centered around D flat major.","8":"What does that do to the sound of the chord?","9":"I still remember when I first heard that chord progression, it was so unsettling, like someone was whispering a dark secret in my ear.","10":"You're thinking of the harmonic series, aren't you?","11":"Do you know the chord progression it follows?","12":"It's a very old song, written a long time ago, and it's still sung today in lots of different places.","13":"It has a nice harmony between the notes.","14":"like how long it takes for the graphics card to render an image and then send it to the display.","15":"because that's what people are actually interested in.","16":"Yeah, that's basically it. Humans can program a machine to learn from data and improve its performance over time without being explicitly programmed to do so.","17":"You could try using a music streaming service like Spotify, and they use machine learning to recommend artists to you based on your listening history. They're trying to figure out what you like about Melanie Martinez, so they can suggest other artists that you might like. Does that make sense?","18":"Maybe it was also because the song was part of a playlist that you'd listened to before, and that's why Spotify thought you'd like it?","19":"to show you ads that are more likely to interest you based on what you've looked at before.","20":"Well, I think we've made a lot of progress in teaching machines to do things that we can do, but we're still a long way from truly doing things that we can't do. And as for things that we can do that a machine might never be able to do, I think that's a really interesting question. For example, a machine can't experience emotions like we do, which are really complex and hard to replicate with code. And I think there are also things like creativity and empathy that are unique to humans, and it's hard to see how we could program a machine to do those things in the same way that we do.","21":"That's the density of neutron stars, and we've observed them to be stable for billions of years.","22":"The event horizon is the point of no return. Once you cross it, you're trapped by the black hole's gravity.","23":"Well, that's a good question, because even if space-time breaks down, you could still talk about the mass and the angular momentum that's inside, so in some sense it's not empty.","24":"We've actually been able to detect these waves directly with the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory, or LIGO, and that's been a huge breakthrough, because it confirms some of the predictions that Einstein made about gravity, and it opens up a whole new way of observing the universe, a new way of listening to the universe, really, because these waves carry information about the most violent and energetic events in the universe, like the collision of two black holes or the merger of two neutron stars.","25":"but then again, you could also be a mathematician or a cosmologist, or even an engineer.","26":"And so, I think what we can do is draw a diagram of spacetime and then we can talk about how different observers can move through spacetime in different ways.","27":"Because if you think of it as separate dimensions, you get into problems with simultaneity, and that's a big problem.","28":"And spacetime is like that too. It's not just about the X and Y coordinates, but also about time. So, if I have a curve or a path through spacetime, I can calculate the distance along that path, and that distance is what's important. It's not just about how long it takes me to get from point A to point B, but also about the shortest distance path through spacetime.","29":"and that's why we draw it this way, because it's easier to visualize, right?","30":"because the other person experienced time dilation, so for them, time passed slower due to their increased velocity.","31":"Exactly, that's a great analogy, imagine you have a big sheet, and you put a heavy object, like a bowling ball, in the middle of it, it would warp the sheet, right? And if you dropped a marble near the bowling ball, it would roll towards the bowling ball, it wouldn't just fall straight down, it would follow the curvature of the sheet, that's kind of what's happening with spacetime and gravity, the heavy objects warp the spacetime, and other objects follow that curvature.","32":"The professor would say that the key to understanding relativity is to recognize that the laws of physics are the same everywhere in the universe, and that the passage of time and the experience of motion are relative to the observer.","33":"It's like a journey, you're starting somewhere, you're going somewhere, and you're coming back home.","34":"I can see how the fifth and the octave would work together, but what about the major third and the perfect fifth?","35":"How do you actually get a handle on what these extra dimensions are?","36":"Is it just that the extra dimensions are compactified in a way that we can't observe them, or is there some kind of dynamical process that's going on that's making them small?","37":null,"38":"You see, the name 'brane' comes from the idea that it's like a membrane, but it's not just a 2-dimensional membrane like a sheet of paper, but a higher-dimensional one, and the number of dimensions it has is what P stands for.","39":"You know, we've found similar structures in our research, where we compactify the branes and find stable, non-singular solutions, and it's been really interesting to see how they behave in different dimensions.","40":"That's how you get the Kaluza-Klein theory.","41":"I'm afraid I'm a physics professor, not a Hollywood actor, I need a bit more substance than that.","42":"about the relationship between the dimensionality of spacetime and the dimensionality of the objects that inhabit it.","43":"It's a story about a group of characters who live in a world that's not our own, but it's a world that's similar to our own. They start to notice that their reality is not fixed, that it's actually a product of quantum mechanics. And as they explore this idea, they start to see the world in a whole new way.","44":"Gravity, a force that pulls everything towards each other.","45":"Something like a black hole has gravity too, but it's so strong that nothing, not even light, can escape once it gets too close.","46":"The main difference is that the continuous wave laser is delivering power at a constant rate, whereas the chirped pulse amplifier is delivering the same amount of power, but in a very short time, so it's more like a giant kick, rather than a steady push.","47":"We have reached a point where we can produce lasers with powers of tens of kilowatts, and we're working on scaling that up to hundreds of kilowatts.","48":"We could use a high-intensity laser to ablate the cell, but we'd need to be careful not to damage the surrounding tissue, so maybe a technique like laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy could help us monitor the damage and avoid over-treating the area.","49":"I think that's a great point. VR can be a very isolating experience, and if we're not careful, it could exacerbate social isolation. But at the same time, it can also be a powerful tool for social connection. For example, we're seeing a lot of applications in therapy and education where VR is being used to facilitate social interaction and empathy. So, I think it's a bit of a double-edged sword.","50":"I think one of the biggest challenges is to balance the sense of presence with the limitations of the technology. If we're not careful, we might create a sense of immersion that's too realistic, making it difficult for people to distinguish between the virtual and the real world. And as for embodiment, it's fascinating to think about how we can use VR to change our perceptions and even challenge our biases. But we also need to consider the potential risks of altering one's self-perception, and ensure that we're using this technology in a way that's safe and beneficial for users.","51":"I think it\u2019s almost like you\u2019re saying that there are some applications of VR where the aesthetic, the visual style, the way that it looks is actually more important than the technical specifications. And that\u2019s a really interesting idea. Because in some ways, it\u2019s almost the opposite of what I would have expected, because I would have expected that people would be pushing for more and more realistic graphics. But you\u2019re saying that in some cases, it\u2019s actually the opposite, that the more stylized, the more cartoonish, the more low-poly, the more that people are able to engage with the experience. Is that right?","52":"and that's a huge challenge for virtual reality.","53":"I think that's where VR is going to have a huge impact. By giving people the ability to immerse themselves in new environments and experiences, we can break free from the limitations of our physical reality and create new possibilities for learning, creativity, and connection. It's not just about waiting for technology to advance, it's about using it to create new experiences that are more engaging, more interactive, and more powerful than anything we've seen before.","54":"And I think one of the challenges is going to be figuring out how to make this technology accessible to people who can't afford it, or who are not tech-savvy. We need to think about how to make VR and AR accessible to a wider audience, and how to integrate it into our daily lives in a way that feels natural and intuitive.","55":"How do you think biology and computer science could be connected?","56":"Yeah, the first four are pretty well-known. You've got your three spatial dimensions, length, width, and depth, and then you've got your one temporal dimension, which is time.","57":"You're gonna try to get your head around this, right?","58":"That way we would have a 2D coordinate system.","59":"You think time is a dimension? That's a great guess. People have thought about that. In fact, that's one of the things we call the theory of general relativity. Einstein said that time is not separate from space, it's actually a dimension of space-time. So, that's a good guess, but it's not exactly what we're looking for. We're looking for something that's a little more exotic.","60":null,"61":"You're getting it, that's exactly what I'm saying.","62":"I think it's fascinating that scientists are able to do that, and I'm curious to know more about the technology behind it.","63":"So, gravity is like a magic string that pulls everything towards each other, but it's really not magic, it's just a force that the Earth has that keeps us on the ground.","64":"We wouldn't be able to stand up or even sit down. If gravity was too strong, we wouldn't be able to move.","65":"How tall are you?","66":"What's that?","67":"That's because there's no gravity in space, so your spine stretches out because it's not being compressed by the Earth's gravity.","68":"Gravity was discovered by Sir Isaac Newton. He was sitting under an apple tree, and an apple fell on his head.","69":"But some people believe it's a true story, and that's what's cool about history - there's often different versions of the same story.","70":"So, the heavy object pulls them towards it.","71":"But I've also read that it's not just about the number of hours, but also the quality of those hours.","72":"That's right, so the suprachiasmatic nucleus, or SCN, is like the internal clock, and it gets input from the light in the environment, and that's what tells it what time of day it is, and it sends out signals to the rest of the body to regulate sleep and wakefulness, and the pineal gland is like the melatonin factory, it secretes melatonin in response to the signals from the SCN, and that's what tells us when it's time to sleep.","73":"Actually, it's a bit more complicated than that. While it's true that you have less time for melatonin to be released, your body is actually very good at adapting to changes in daylight. So, even though you have long days, your body is still able to produce melatonin at the right times, as long as you're getting enough exposure to darkness at night. In fact, research has shown that people who live in places with long days, like the Arctic or near the equator, can actually have more consistent sleep schedules than people who live in places with more moderate day lengths. So, it's not necessarily that you'll get less sleep, but rather that your body will just adjust to the new rhythm of the day.","74":"Yeah, but instead of a filament that gets hot and glows, a laser has a special kind of material called a gain medium that amplifies light.","75":"The reason we hit the big end is because it's heavier and the heavier part is at the front. That's why it goes in more easily.","76":"to be focused, to be able to actually do some damage to the wood","77":"Exactly, it's like a magnifying glass, but it's taking all the light and focusing it down to a point, rather than just a small area.","78":"so we get a new equation, the time dimension equation.","79":"But you wouldn't be able to see them because they're invisible.","80":"a beam, and then we can use that beam to do all sorts of things.","81":"we were all very excited about the possibility of detecting gravitational waves from a black hole merger.","82":"I mean, the way that the light behaves around a black hole, the way that the gravity warps space and time, it's all just so, so, so complex.","83":"Now that we have this wealth of data, we can finally get a better handle on the physical parameters of the black hole itself, like its spin, its mass, and its accretion rate, which is crucial for understanding the broader context of galaxy evolution.","84":"and dreaming, and just, like, recharging your body and mind, right?","85":"So, like, what's going on when we're sleeping?","86":"We can actually measure that by looking at the brain activity, and we can also measure it by looking at the sleep stages, so we can actually tell how much deep sleep someone's getting, how much light sleep they're getting, and how much REM sleep they're getting. So, yes, we can tell how much sleep someone's getting and what their sleep schedule is by looking at those things.","87":"text of the missing part","88":"So, does that mean that if I get a good night's sleep, I'll be able to focus better in class?","89":"That's why it's not recommended for people who work or have classes during the day.","90":"And how did you find it?","91":"I have. They're tiny crystals, like tiny little particles that have unique optical properties. They can emit light at different wavelengths depending on their size, right?","92":"Yes, that's correct. A 0D nanomaterial would be a quantum dot, a cluster of atoms, and a 1D nanomaterial would be a nanowire, and a 2D nanomaterial would be a nanosheet. And a 3D nanomaterial would be a bulk material.","93":"No, I've heard of it but never really understood what it is. Is it like a super-thin version of a carbon fiber?","94":"And that's exactly what we're trying to do with nanotubes. They have a lot of properties that make them really attractive for electronics. They're extremely conductive, they have high thermal conductivity, they're really strong. So we're trying to take advantage of all those properties to make new types of electronics that are faster, smaller, and more efficient.","95":"Yes, the lights behind me are actually a display of quantum dot technology in action. They're using tiny crystals to produce the light you see.","96":"Do you know what learning means? Have you heard that before?","97":"You know, it's kind of like how we teach machines to recognize pictures of dogs and cats using something called machine learning. We show the machine lots of pictures of dogs and cats, and it learns to look for things like whether they have four legs, a tail, or pointy ears. So, even though dogs and cats are very different, the machine can still learn to tell them apart. Does that make sense?","98":"So, how did you figure out that the cat is skinny and has pointy ears?","99":"I see, so the computer uses the pictures of cats and dogs it has learned about to figure out whether the new picture is a cat or a dog. But it also looks at other things like how the animal is moving and what it's wearing.","100":"But machine learning is a bit different. The training data is not just like practice problems. It's more like a collection of all the things that the machine needs to learn from, and the algorithm tries to find patterns in that data to make predictions or decisions.","101":"So, the test is like a review of what you already know, and you're showing that you know it.","102":"That's because machines can learn really quickly from a lot of examples, so they might be able to do it really fast even with 10 million examples.","103":"We're going to learn about the human brain and its connections.","104":" ","105":"You could, for example, cause the device to run a very slow math operation, but you don't have to actually do the math operation, you just have to be able to detect when it's done, and then you can inject a fault at that point.","106":"I mean, that's a really interesting application of, like, directed energy in a way. It's not like you're using it to heat up the chip or anything, it's actually very precise.","107":"So, I think it's really interesting because, like, it's one thing to know it's possible, but it's another thing to actually see it happen, right? And I think that's what's missing from a lot of the literature on this topic. People talk about it in theory, but they don't show you how to do it in practice. So, that's what I'm trying to do with this project, make it more accessible and tangible.","108":"I think we're going to see more of a push for, like, formal verification, and maybe some other types of verification, like fuzz testing, but also maybe some more physical attacks, like, on the power side, because it seems like that's one area where, like, the devices are getting more secure, but not as secure as they think they are.","109":"You know, the designers are just like, Oh, we know all the side channels, and we know all the attacks, and we're gonna make sure that they're all mitigated, and that's just not true.","110":"and that creates a huge amount of gravity that pulls everything towards it.","111":"like, it's just gonna pull in the air molecules that are right next to the vacuum cleaner, it's not gonna pull in the whole room, or the whole house, or the whole city, it's just gonna pull in the air molecules that are close by. And it's the same thing with a black hole, it's just gonna pull in the matter that's close by, it's not gonna pull in the whole galaxy, or the whole universe, it's just gonna pull in the matter that's close by.","112":"if you're close enough, it will divert your path more, if you're close enough still, then you will get what are called tidal forces, where the difference between, for example, if you're standing next to a black hole, the difference in gravity between your feet and your head actually becomes significant.","113":"Yeah, that's right. Because, by definition, black holes are invisible, right? They're regions of space where gravity is so strong that nothing, not even light, can escape. So we can't directly see them. But, we can see the effects they have on the surrounding space, like how they distort light, or how they pull on nearby objects.","114":"I think it's a little bit of both, because on one hand, it's great that people can now build models and experiment with data and all that, but on the other hand, I think it's led to a lot of people oversimplifying problems and not really understanding the underlying math and science behind it, which can lead to some pretty bad consequences.","115":"I think that's a great point, and one of the things that we're really struggling with in healthcare is the lack of standardization, especially when it comes to data collection. It's like, every single hospital and every single clinic has their own system, and it's really hard to get all that data in one place and make it usable. And even when we do get it, it's often in these really messy formats that are just hard to work with.","116":"You need to think about the data and the model as a system that can perpetuate and amplify existing biases, and you need to be very intentional about how you design and deploy it to mitigate those biases.","117":"And I think that's a really important shift for people who are coming from a more technical background, like you, to recognize that, actually, the technical skills are necessary, but they're not sufficient. You need to think about the broader context and the social implications of what you're building.","118":null,"119":"I think that's a great point, and it's something that I've been thinking about a lot lately, and I think it's one of the areas where we need to be careful about over-promising and under-delivering. We need to be honest about what machine learning can do and what it can't do, and I think that's one of the challenges we face in the field right now.","120":"I think there's a lot of room for optimism, and I'm optimistic about the next five to 10 years. I think we're going to see some real breakthroughs in terms of the way we apply machine learning to real-world problems. One area that I think holds a lot of promise is the use of transfer learning, where we can take models that have been trained on one task and apply them to similar tasks, which can help to reduce the need for large amounts of data. Additionally, I think we're going to see more emphasis on interpretability and explainability, which will help to build trust in machine learning models and ensure that they're being used in a way that's transparent and accountable.","121":"Origami is a traditional Japanese art of paper folding, which has become popular all over the world. It involves folding and shaping paper to create various shapes and designs, such as animals, flowers, and boxes.","122":"You can make tessellations with any kind of paper, but some papers are better suited for them than others. For example, if you're using a paper that has a lot of texture, like this one, it's going to make the pattern more interesting.","123":"They were folded, so you can see that they were one sheet of paper, but it looks like they're all these different pieces.","124":null,"125":"That\u2019s right, all the folds are reversible.","126":"The connectome is the brain's neural network, a complex web of connections between neurons. It's like a map of the brain's wiring, showing how different regions communicate with each other.","127":"But I don't think that's necessarily true. We have machines that can do calculus and other mathematical operations that are much more complex than yes or no questions. We can also program the computer to mimic the brain's processes, to simulate how neurons fire and how they connect. It's not just a matter of the computer's ability to communicate, it's also a matter of how we program it.","128":"Well, we use a variety of telescopes, including the Hubble Space Telescope and the Spitzer Space Telescope, to observe the black holes in the optical and infrared parts of the spectrum. We also use a technique called microlensing to observe the effects of the black hole on the surrounding stars and gas.","129":"So yes, you can get the size of the disk, and the size of the dust distribution, and even some of the radial structure of the disk, and the temperature distribution of the dust, but not the spatial resolution, because you're not resolving the disk itself.","130":"We see it in the infrared, it's a one dimensional one, so we're averaging, so we don't get the two dimensional, or even three dimensional one.","131":"because it's just so bright, it's like, it's like trying to see a tiny little candle in the middle of a very, very bright, very, very intense spotlight.","132":"You say it's a problem of detection, that we just can't see them yet? Or is there something specific about the supernova remnants that makes it difficult to detect black holes?","133":"I was thinking about that, and it seems like the matter is just being pulled in so quickly that it doesn't have time to be expelled.","134":"We've had some success with using word embeddings, like word2vec, to capture semantic meaning in text data, which can be really useful for certain types of analysis. But I think that's a great point about interpretability - we need to think about what kind of insights we're trying to get out of our analysis and choose the right tool for the job.","135":"and you're not really addressing the underlying causes of the problem, you're just kind of copying the patterns that you see.","136":"I think that's a good point, and it's also why some people are trying to develop more transparent and interpretable models, so that we can at least understand why a model is making a particular prediction or recommendation, even if we can't guarantee that it won't make an error or say something biased or uncomfortable. Do you think that's a promising direction, or are there other approaches you'd like to see explored?","137":"and how it relates to gravity, and that's a huge topic, we've made huge progress in understanding the gravitational force in terms of quantum mechanics, but we still have a lot to learn.","138":"You can just have the two states together as one state, which is the superposition of the two states, and that's the wave function, that's the state of the system, and that's a very simple way to get the wave function out of the two states.","139":"That's why I think the wave function, or the multiverse, or whatever you want to call it, is a more fundamental concept than space-time. It's like the space-time we experience is just a particular realization of that wave function, or a particular branch of that wave function, and not the fundamental thing itself.","140":"So, if you have a black hole, Hawking said, you can't just say that nothing escapes. In quantum mechanics, particles can pop in and out of existence all the time. So, even though the event horizon is a point of no return, Hawking said that virtual particles can be created in the vicinity of the event horizon, and one of them can be on the outside, while the other is sucked in. The one on the outside carries away some of the black hole's energy, and that's Hawking radiation. It's a way for the black hole to lose mass over time, and eventually, it will evaporate completely.","141":"and that's why it's called Hawking radiation.","142":"So, how does gravity affect the way we design buildings and bridges?","143":"So, you're saying that the uncertainty principle applies to the event horizon, just like it does to the position of an electron?","144":"I see what you mean, but isn't the holographic principle more related to the entropy of black holes rather than gravity?","145":"But we do have to be careful about how we think about limits, because if you're in a universe that's finite but unbounded, then it's possible to move indefinitely in one direction without ever reaching an edge.","146":"It looks like you're trying to force a non-equivalence between two theories that are actually equivalent, which is a little misleading.","147":"What's origami?","148":"What is origami?","149":"I have made a paper crane before with my mom, isn't it a symbol of peace?","150":"So it's kind of like it's trying to make a little triangle, right? And we want to keep it flat so it makes a nice triangle.","151":"That's it, you did it!","152":"What's a cootie catcher?","153":"You're saying that blockchain could help create a decentralized, peer-to-peer energy grid that's more resilient to outages and less dependent on centralized power plants.","154":"It's not about the technology itself, it's about how it's being used. People are still figuring out how to use it in a way that makes sense.","155":"We've had a lot of hype, but not a lot of actual results, so it's hard to tell what's working and what's not.","156":"It is a system that is based on trust. We have to trust the banks, the governments, the institutions. But what if we don't want to trust them anymore? What if we want to create a system where we can trust each other directly?","157":"I think we can say the same thing about blockchain. We have this very high standard in our minds, and we're comparing it to that, but it's hard to compare it to some perfect future. Just like you compare autonomous vehicles to this very high standard because machines are doing it. It should be perfect. There should be zero car deaths.","158":"and that's not always the case.","159":"They create barriers like firewalls or intrusion detection systems.","160":"They would probably fix the lock or tell the company to fix the lock so that no one else can get in.","161":"and that's a risk they take, but it's also a risk that we take when we use technology, because technology is constantly evolving and so are the hackers.","162":"I learned about it from my friend who is also a hacker.","163":"Yeah, I guess they did. But it's just for fun, and I'm not hurting anyone.","164":null,"165":"Actually, nanotechnology is used in a lot of everyday products. For example, did you know that some sunscreens contain nanoparticles that help protect your skin from the sun's UV rays?","166":"Your response here","167":"How does it work, exactly, with the electric field and voltage?","168":"If you make it smaller, you can fit more of them on the chip.","169":"Yeah, it's factories and stuff. They have these huge machines that can etch and deposit materials at the nanoscale. It's a really complex process, but basically, they use techniques like lithography and molecular beam epitaxy to create these tiny structures.","170":"Exactly! And sometimes we use money to trade for things we want, but with blockchain, it's a little different. We use something called cryptocurrency, like Bitcoin, and it's like a secret code that only we know.","171":"So what would you trade?","172":"I've heard it's not really a good thing, but I'm not really sure what it entails.","173":"The space bar is an input. Any button or key on the keyboard is an input. A mouse is an input. A microphone is an input. Anything that can be used to input information into a computer is an input.","174":"username, password, and all the other login credentials that you would normally use to get access to a system or a network.","175":"It can vary greatly depending on the complexity of the system, the skill level of the hacker, and the level of security in place. Sometimes it can take just a few minutes, while other times it can take days, weeks, or even months to gain access.","176":"That's a good analogy, but in a slingshot, the force is applied in a short burst, whereas with a rocket, the force is sustained over a long period of time, allowing it to accelerate to incredible speeds.","177":"Well, it's still falling, but it's falling so fast that it never actually gets any closer to the Earth. It's just kind of orbiting around it, and that's why it's not coming back down. It's not just floating, it's still falling, but it's falling in a curved path around the Earth.","178":"\u2013 like the G-Force on the ride, right? So the Earth is pulling them down, but they're going so fast that they're basically staying in orbit. It's like the force of the Earth's gravity is being counteracted by the force of their motion, so they don't feel like they're being pulled down.","179":"That's really cool, because it makes sense that you wouldn't be able to tell the difference between the two, because gravity is just like that acceleration, right?","180":"I know, right? It's like, our brains are tricked into thinking that we're stationary, but really we're moving really fast. And that's basically what Einstein said about gravity - that it's not a force that pulls us towards the center of the Earth, but rather the curvature of space-time that we're moving in.","181":"You know, it's not just crazy, it's actually the way the world is. The Earth is moving at about 30,000 miles per hour around the Sun, and it's also moving around its own axis, so if you were to throw a ball straight up, it would actually land a little bit east of where you threw it, because the Earth is moving underneath it.","182":"Gravity isn't just a force that pulls objects towards each other. It's actually a curvature of spacetime caused by massive objects like planets and stars.","183":"So, if Marina is racing towards the flash of light, the light pulse would appear to be coming from where she is, and she would see it at the same speed as you do, which is 300,000 kilometers per second.","184":"and helps your brain work better, like a computer restarting.","185":"They help us learn how to sleep better and feel rested in the morning.","186":"Just like humans, it recharges by going into a deep sleep, but instead of lying flat like we do, it has to rest its neck and head in a way that keeps its brain safe from injury.","187":"Why were you tired?","188":"They have a special valve in their nostrils that stops water from entering their lungs, and their bodies are very buoyant, so they can rest with just their eyes and nostrils above water.","189":"because you could sleep for a week and still be fine!","190":"So, did you know that dolphins sleep with only half their brain at a time?","191":"They sleep with only half of their brain at a time. It's called unihemispheric slow-wave sleep, which is a mouthful, I know. So one half of their brain is sleeping, and the other half is still awake and watching for predators, okay? It's like they're always on the lookout for something bad happening, even when they're sleeping.","192":"No, I don't think so.","193":"What's the smallest thing you can see with your eyes?","194":"Your answer here","195":"Exactly. They're the building blocks of everything around us. And when we get to the size of a nanometer, we're getting to a point where we're starting to see how those atoms are arranged and how they're interacting with each other.","196":"That would be really cool, like building with Legos but with atoms!","197":null,"198":"So, the idea is to create a more immersive experience for the users by using head-mounted displays and controllers that track the user's movements. This way, the user can feel as if they are actually inside the virtual world, rather than just looking at a screen.","199":"I think that's what's happening with virtual reality right now. We're starting to see some of the early adopters, some of the people who are really pushing the boundaries, and they're starting to make some of the more mundane, everyday experiences, like going to the grocery store or going to the dentist, into really interesting experiences. And I think that's where the real potential of virtual reality is going to be, not just in the flashy, high-end applications, but in the everyday, mundane experiences that we all go through.","200":"And it's not just the audio, it's also the sense of balance and spatial orientation. I've seen some demos where you can feel the sense of movement and weightlessness, it's quite disorienting but also very immersive. And I think that's where the real challenge lies, not just in rendering the visuals or the audio, but in creating a sense of presence and agency in the virtual world.","201":"I think that's a really good point, because people are often really surprised by how realistic the visuals are, but if the audio isn't up to par, it can really detract from the whole experience.","202":"So, if you're standing on the surface of the Earth, you feel a certain gravitational force because you're close to the Earth, but if you were to travel to the moon, which is much further away, you'd feel a much weaker force.","203":"and you'd be weightless.","204":"So, I was wondering, does gravity affect the curvature of spacetime in the same way on all objects?","205":"That's right. Because the Earth is pulling on it with its gravity. If you threw a ball straight up, it would go up and then come back down to the Earth. The Earth's gravity is what keeps it from going off into space. It's always pulling on everything with mass, like the ball, with an invisible force.","206":"I mean, we're living on a planet that's just floating in space, and we're all stuck to it. It's just, it's pretty wild when you think about it.","207":"But I'm not sure I understand what that really means.","208":"No, that's not an extra dimension. It's just a different way of looking at the same space. Think of it like a map. If you're looking at a map of a city, you can see the streets and the buildings, but you can't see the actual city itself. But if you were to walk through the city, you would experience it in a completely different way. You would see the streets and the buildings, but you would also experience the sounds, the smells, and the textures of the city. It's similar with the Kaluza-Klein theory. It's not an extra dimension, but rather a different way of experiencing the same space.","209":"In order to merge quantum mechanics and general relativity, you need to unify the two theories. The problem is that quantum mechanics is a theory of the very small, and general relativity is a theory of the very large. They don't work well together. So string theory is an attempt to unify the two. It says that the fundamental building blocks of the universe are not particles, but tiny, vibrating strings. And these strings can vibrate at different frequencies, giving rise to the different particles that we observe. But in order to make this work, you need to have more than the three dimensions that we're familiar with - you need to have six more dimensions that are curled up really tightly, so that we can't see them. That's where the extra dimensions come in.","210":"So, string theory proposes that the fundamental building blocks of the universe are not particles, but tiny, vibrating strings.","211":"I'm not sure. Maybe we can look it up in the literature on string theory.","212":"You can think of a string as one dimensional, but if you have a two dimensional surface that is vibrating, you call it a drumhead.","213":"Well, in string theory, the vibrations of the strings correspond to different particles, and the properties of the particles, like mass and charge, are determined by the vibrations themselves. For example, a string vibrating at a certain frequency might correspond to a particle with a certain mass, while a string vibrating at a different frequency might correspond to a particle with a different mass.","214":"String theory is an attempt to unify the forces, but it's not necessarily part of the Grand Unified Theory. The Grand Unified Theory is a bit of a misnomer. It's more of a catch-all term for the attempt to unify the strong and weak nuclear forces with electromagnetism. String theory is a more specific attempt to unify those forces with gravity as well.","215":"The string theory we have now is gravity plus the Grand Unified Theory, and it also predicts that the other forces, electromagnetism and the strong and weak nuclear forces, are all part of the same thing.","216":"Well, that's a great way to describe it. But you have to be careful, because people often get confused. They think that these extra dimensions are like the three we experience, like the three dimensions of space. But they're not like that at all. They're not like, 'Oh, I can see them, I can feel them.' No, they're much more abstract than that. They're more like, 'Oh, I can imagine them.'","217":"Exactly. And one of the key aspects of blockchain is that it's a decentralized system. There isn't a single central authority controlling the transactions. Instead, it's maintained by a network of computers around the world, all working together to validate and record the transactions.","218":"And it's not just any machines, it's machines that are smart enough to read and write the code, to verify the transactions, to keep the ledger updated, and to enforce the rules of the network.","219":"And how do we balance that with the potential benefits of blockchain technology, like transparency and decentralization? ","220":"Can you walk me through how the discovery of these new materials affects the design of the battery, and what kind of trade-offs you have to make in terms of cost and performance?","221":"One of the challenges is that the properties of the materials are so sensitive to the conditions in which they're made, that even small variations in the process can result in big variations in the material's properties. And then that makes it difficult to predict how they will perform in a real-world application, like a battery.","222":"I'm Robert Lang, a physicist, an engineer, and an origami artist. I've been folding paper for over 40 years and have been studying the mathematics of origami for over 30 years.","223":"Because origami is all about creating a 3D shape from a 2D sheet, it's a perfect fit for products that need to be compact and then expand into a usable form.","224":"And that's actually one of the challenges of using origami in this context, because when you scale up origami, it can get really floppy.","225":"And it's also got the ability to be used as a composite material, so if you were to add fibers like carbon fiber or glass fiber to the aramid fibers, you could create a material that's even stronger and lighter.","226":"I think the most exciting thing for us right now is the work that's being done in the area of origami-inspired robotics. There's a lot of interest in using origami to create robots that can fold themselves up and then deploy in various environments, like search and rescue situations or even just in space exploration. The idea is that these robots could be launched into space and then fold up into a compact shape, and then when they reach their destination, they could unfold and start doing their job. It's really cool stuff.","227":"It's a way for people to store and verify transactions without the need for a central authority.","228":"Right, because that's the whole point of it, to eliminate the need for these middlemen who are taking a cut of every transaction. It's like a decentralized marketplace where people can directly trade with each other without needing a third party to verify and facilitate the transaction.","229":"You've got some new research out on sleep patterns in teenagers.","230":"And what kind of animal studies have you seen that suggest sleep changes occur early in the disease process?","231":"So the sleep changes that are observed in these mice, they're not just due to the tau pathology, but they're also observed in the mice that only have the beta-amyloid pathology, right? So that's suggesting that there's a relationship between sleep and beta-amyloid as well.","232":null,"233":"You can fold it in half, then fold it in half again, and then you can make a triangle out of it.","234":"Now, can you see how the fifth circle is actually a part of the fourth circle, but it's a different part?","235":"Now, let's start with the basics. What do you know about origami?","236":"Can you walk us through how you would actually engineer a virus to do that? What are the key challenges that you face when you're trying to take a virus and turn it into a nanofactory?","237":"And then we can actually control the size and shape of the nanostructure by controlling the length of the DNA that we insert and by controlling the number of times that the virus replicates. So, for example, if we want to build a nanostructure that's 100 nanometers in length, we can insert a piece of DNA that's 100 nanometers long and then control the number of times the virus replicates so that it builds a structure that's the desired size. And we can also control the shape of the nanostructure by controlling the way that the proteins are arranged on the surface of the virus. So, for example, if we want to build a nanostructure that has a specific shape, we can insert a piece of DNA that codes for a protein that will bind to a specific molecule that will help to shape the nanostructure. And then we can use the virus to build the nanostructure and then we can harvest the nanostructure and use it in a variety of applications.","238":"I think that's really where the field is headed, because we're starting to see a lot of the older, more toxic materials being phased out in favor of more sustainable alternatives. It's an exciting time to be working in this field.","239":"That way, we can fit more components into the same volume, which can be very useful for spacecraft design.","240":"That's why origami is so important - it allows us to pack things down, but then they can expand in a very controlled way, which is crucial for space exploration.","241":"Now, let's take this first rectangle, and we're going to fold it over along this line, and then we're going to take this other rectangle and fold it over along this line, and we're going to continue doing this to demonstrate how the rigidity of the origami shape is affected by the folding process.","242":"So that's one of the key things that we find in origami that we don't find in other folding systems, that's because of the rigid foldability of these models.","243":"That's right, the panels fold up and then you just unfold them and they lock into place, so you don't need any motors.","244":"because the conditions are different, right?","245":"between compactness and the rate of opening.","246":"Minecraft is a great example of that, isn't it?","247":"And that was really cool, right? It looked like it was happening right in front of you.","248":"I am curious about the relationship between chord progressions and melody in music harmony.","249":"The circle of fifths is a tool that helps you navigate the relationships between chords and keys. It's like a map that shows you how to move from one key to another by following the pattern of perfect fifths. For example, if you're in the key of C major, you can move to the key of G major by going up a perfect fifth, and then from G major to D major, and so on. This can help you create harmonies that sound cohesive and connected.","250":null,"251":"So, let's try using the B flat as a major chord, with a major third and a perfect fifth.","252":"So, do you know what dimensions are? We can talk about what they are and how they work.","253":"We can't really say that. I mean, a line is one dimensional, but it's also part of a two dimensional plane. And a two dimensional plane is part of a three dimensional space.","254":"like towards the end, since my face is pointing that way","255":"So, we have one number, like one apple. We can count one apple. That's it.","256":null,"257":"I'm not sure what you mean by 'this'.","258":"we have no idea what they are like or how many there are.","259":"People would try to understand what those extra dimensions are and how they work.","260":"I'm sure it is. Machine learning is actually a really big part of how Gmail works, because it needs to figure out what spam is and what isn't, and it needs to do that based on a huge amount of data. So it's using machine learning to classify emails as spam or not spam, which is a classic example of supervised learning.","261":"I'd also look at the email's content and structure. Like, is it asking me to click on a link or is it just saying hi?","262":"Exactly, because the way that we train these machine learning models is to use something called a neural network, which is a really complex mathematical function that can take in a lot of different inputs, and learn to pick out the ones that are most important for making a prediction.","263":"In supervised learning, we're often using algorithms like decision trees, random forests, and support vector machines, which are all about trying to find the best set of features that can distinguish between classes. In contrast, unsupervised learning algorithms like k-means clustering and hierarchical clustering are designed to find patterns and structures in the data without any prior knowledge of the classes or labels.","264":"Reinforcement learning is more of a trial and error approach, you're just kind of trying everything and seeing what works.","265":"When you have a lot of data, a deep learning algorithm might be a better choice. Because with a lot of data, you can train a deep learning model to learn complex patterns in the data, whereas reinforcement learning algorithms are typically used when you don't have a lot of data and you need to learn from trial and error.","266":"You would likely end up with a system that is overfitting, which is a problem where the system performs well on the training data but poorly on new, unseen data.","267":"Yeah, exactly. So the model was predicting churn, but it wasn't actionable. So it was like, okay, you know, Sunny is going to quit, but what do you do about it? Do you offer them a better plan? Do you give them a discount? Do you offer them a free upgrade? The model wasn't providing any guidance on that. So it was a very accurate model, but it wasn't useful.","268":"One approach is to use techniques like feature attribution and model interpretability to understand the relationships between inputs and outputs, which can help improve the algorithms by identifying and addressing biases or errors in the data or the model itself.","269":"And if you don't include the actual function of the neurons, and the synapses, and the neurotransmitters, and the dynamics of the system, you're really not going to have a very good understanding of how the brain works.","270":"I think that's a great point, but the brain is a very powerful organ, and the research suggests that even if we don't consciously know a piece of music, our brain can still recognize it and create a connection to it.","271":"Are you still using the EM to look at the connectome of the musician's brain?","272":"Hi, good to see you too. I've heard a lot about your work on laser applications in medicine.","273":"I remember some of the projects we worked on together.","274":"We can then see the Schwinger limit being violated, and that's a very interesting result.","275":"or we can just calculate the energy directly in our own frame.","276":"That's where the phase-locking comes in. It's a very difficult problem because you have to be able to synchronize the phases of all these lasers, which are all independently running, and then you have to be able to stabilize them so that they stay in phase as they propagate through all the different optical components.","277":"So we'll have to see how that works out, but we're hoping that we can use a combination of all these technologies to make it work.","278":"That was a huge breach and it cost them millions of dollars, it's still considered one of the largest breaches in history.","279":"the deli scale was not properly updated with security patches.","280":"And the program would terminate, right?","281":"So how does that relate to network security or designing software for penetration testing?","282":"I'm really interested in how governments are using technology to spy on each other, and how that intersects with computer science and information security. It's a really complex and fascinating field, and I feel like there's always something new to learn.","283":"Exactly, and that's why it's so fascinating because it highlights the complexity of these issues. On one hand, you have the government wanting to promote freedom of information and access to the internet, but on the other hand, you have agencies that are looking to control or limit that access for security reasons. It's a delicate balance that raises a lot of questions about the role of government in regulating the internet and the potential consequences of such actions.","284":"I think they're cool!","285":"It's because the flashlight is making light everywhere, but the laser is making a tiny beam of light that we can focus on a single point.","286":"You can't even see it. It's invisible!","287":"Because we can see exactly where the light is going.","288":"The laser is used to cut through a variety of materials.","289":"How does that work?","290":"That's cool, I've also seen laser pointers.","291":"I've been thinking of exploring it further, but I don't know where to start. Do you think it's something that's worth looking into?","292":"The Rowhammer attack exploits a vulnerability in the way memory devices handle row refresh operations, where repeatedly accessing a row of memory can cause adjacent rows to become unstable and flip their bits, potentially allowing an attacker to modify sensitive data.","293":"I mean, if I buy a car, it's mine. I should be able to take it apart and see how it works, or at least, be able to inspect it without them trying to tell me I'm breaking some law.","294":"What about blockchain? Do you think it's more secure than eBay?","295":"So what blockchain does is it eliminates the need for those middlemen by allowing people to make transactions directly with each other.","296":"Well, blockchain is like a public ledger that records all of the trades, and it's maintained by a network of computers around the world. When a trade happens, it gets added to the ledger, and then it can't be altered or deleted. It's like a permanent record, and because it's public, anyone can see all of the trades that have happened.","297":"So, for example, imagine a digital ledger that records all the transactions, like Bitcoin, where all the nodes on the network have a copy of the ledger. If someone tries to cheat the system, the other nodes will notice and reject the fake transaction. It's a really secure way of keeping track of data.","298":"I'm interested in doing research with lasers, so I've been taking a few electives in the physics department, including your laser physics course.","299":"So, in my opinion, lasers are really a great way to explore a lot of physics concepts, like wave-particle duality, and the principles of quantum mechanics, and also how to build an incredibly precise device.","300":"So it's a technique that actually stretches out the laser pulse, amplifies it, and then compresses it back down to its original duration, allowing for the creation of high-energy, short-pulse lasers.","301":"Yes, it is the same premise. The laser is still a concentrated beam of light that can knock electrons off of atoms.","302":"the pendant is a device that helps to stabilize the laser and it's kind of like a stabilizer for your car, it keeps the laser on track and stable so that the mode locker can do its job effectively.","303":"The professor is explaining that the music harmony of the hymn is based on the triad of F major, which is a common chord progression in Western music.","304":"What's the relation between F and the notes in the key of C major?","305":"You're killing me. That's like a list of all the chords that can be played on a G7 chord.","306":"and then there's also the whole other side of harmony, the side that's not so bright, the side that's a little bit darker, a little bit more dissonant, and that's where you start to explore the negative harmony, the diminished seventh, the augmented sixth, all those types of chords that create tension and release, and that's where the magic happens, that's where the drama happens, that's where you can create a real sense of contrast and surprise in your music.","307":"But by changing the chord progression to a minor key, you've shifted the mood to something more melancholic and introspective. That's what makes music harmony so powerful - it can completely alter the emotional impact of a piece.","308":"You're saying the F major chord is like a shadow of the A major chord, because it's got a similar structure, but with a different tonal center.","309":"So, imagine your brain is like a city. There are roads that connect different neighborhoods, right? The connectome is like a map of all those roads and neighborhoods in your brain.","310":"But if we could replicate the brain's connections and processes inside a computer, would that mean that the digital version of you would still be you, or would it be a completely different entity? And what about the experiences and memories that make you who you are - would they be preserved in the digital copy, or would they be lost in the translation?","311":"So, the connectome, is it the study of the neural connections and the way they interact with each other over time?","312":"But how do we even know that the connectome is more than just a map of information passing between neurons? Can't we just reduce it to a series of electrical impulses and synaptic transmissions?","313":"So, let me try to give you an example of how this works.","314":"Exactly! It's like proving something without giving away any information about the actual thing you're proving. It's a way to convince someone that you know something without giving them any details about what that something is.","315":null,"316":"You're saying that I can prove I'm telling the truth without actually telling the truth?","317":"That's a really powerful memory.","318":"We're actually studying how memories can be both formed and lost, especially in the context of neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's. I think that's one of the most fascinating aspects of memory \u2013 how something that's so fundamental to our existence can also be so fragile.","319":"Are the connectivities that you're seeing using the FMRI in your studies, are they different when you look at the implicit and explicit memories? Are you seeing more activity in the striatum in comparison to the hippocampus or the prefrontal cortex?","320":"What's your favorite subject?","321":"If I say something, you can't know for sure if it's true or not, right? You have to ask me questions to figure it out.","322":"And you can see it, but you don't know how I got it there, right?","323":"Because it helps us keep some information secret, but still prove that it's true.","324":"They could just check that you're who you say you are, without knowing what you're doing online.","325":"like the number line, it just keeps going and going.","326":"So, what does this mean about the number of rooms in the hotel?","327":"They can't live together, that would be a different problem, we'd just need to find a bigger hotel.","328":"and so on","329":"Well, to me, infinity is more of a concept than a number, it's more of a limit than a quantity. It's a way to describe something that has no end, but it's not something you can put a value to. It's a bit hard to wrap your head around, but once you get used to it, it's actually really beautiful and powerful.","330":"It basically means that any advanced artificial intelligence will either be incredibly intelligent and able to solve complex problems, or it will be incredibly stupid and unable to solve even the simplest problems.","331":"No, it's more like planning. Planning is like the hardest thing for a robot to learn, because it's not just about moving around, it's about making decisions that take into account all the different possibilities and constraints.","332":"I think we're limited more by the complexity of the tasks and the difficulty of collecting data in a way that is useful for learning. For example, if you're trying to collect data on a robot tying its shoe, it's not just a matter of taking a video of it. The robot has to be able to perform the task in a way that is similar to a human, and the data has to be collected in a way that is useful for learning, which is a really difficult problem. ","333":"Well, one common algorithm used is reinforcement learning, where the robot learns from trial and error by receiving rewards or penalties for its actions. Another one is imitation learning, where the robot learns by mimicking the behavior of a human or another robot. And then there's also supervised learning, where the robot is trained on labeled data to learn specific tasks.","334":"because the Sierpinski triangle, which is a classic fractal, has three sides, and it's a very simple and intuitive example of a fractal.","335":"I think it's three dimensional because it's got a certain thickness to it, right? And it's got some curvature, too.","336":"If I cut it in half again, you'll need four boxes.","337":"That's because the coastline of Great Britain is a fractal, and fractals have a property called self-similarity, which means they look the same at different scales. As you zoom in on the coastline, you see the same patterns repeating over and over again, which is why the number of boxes grows faster than it would for a straight line.","338":"And that's where the fractal nature of the coastline comes in, because the box counting method is actually a way to quantify the self-similarity of the coastline, and how it's made up of smaller copies of itself at different scales.","339":"Yes, fractals are used in many areas, such as modeling the behavior of financial markets, modeling the spread of diseases, and even in the design of musical compositions.","340":"Perlin noise is a great example, right? It was one of the early ways of synthesizing additional texture at any level of detail that you needed to make things look natural and realistic.","341":"like balancing these cups - seems easy for you because you can feel the weight and adjust naturally, but it's actually a complex task for a robot because it needs precise calculations and control to prevent the cups from falling.","342":"and pick up the block","343":"and it didn't need to know where the cup was to do that.","344":null,"345":"and that's what's really cool about quantum computers, they can have those special quarters that can spin both heads and tails at the same time","346":"No, you won't understand that it's true because of anything you know about the operations themselves. In fact, you won't even know what operations were performed, or how they were performed. All you'll know is that I've convinced you that the statement is true, without giving you any information about how I did it.","347":"Let's say I know a number, and I want to prove to you that I know that number without telling you what the number is.","348":"Now, a zero-knowledge proof is a way of proving to someone that you know something, without actually telling them what that something is. And the way we're gonna use this, is we're gonna use the fact that it's really hard to solve a map three-coloring problem, to actually prove that you have at least 0.3 Bitcoins.","349":"So, to clarify, how exactly do we go from the statement about having at least 0.2 Bitcoins to the map of countries that can be proven three-colorable without revealing the account address?","350":"But what's the connection between these colors and zero-knowledge proofs?","351":"As I show you more countries, my confidence level increases, because I can see that the colors I've chosen so far are consistent with the colors of the countries I'm showing you now.","352":"Did you find the one you were looking for?","353":"the new colors, I added a new color, which is red.","354":"Well, I think they do both. They're more practical for implementation because they allow for more efficient and secure protocols, but they also structurally prove something, because they allow you to prove that a statement is true without revealing any information about how you proved it, which is a really powerful property.","355":"I think one of the challenges is that students may not have a clear understanding of what it means to be creative in a generative AI context.","356":"I think it's a fascinating area, and one that's been debated by philosophers and mathematicians for centuries.","357":"Because it's a statement about the size of the real numbers, which is the size of the continuum, and it's a very subtle question about whether there are any sets that are strictly between the size of the countable sets and the size of the continuum. And I think that's one of the things that makes it so hard to teach is that it's not just a question about infinity, it's a question about the nature of the real numbers, and how we think about them, and that's a very difficult thing to get across to students.","358":"Do you think it was one of those colors because you remember them, or because I told you they were in the pool?","359":"And it's not just that you're forgetting things, it's also that your brain is getting better at picking out what's really important to remember.","360":"Exactly! Our brain has different parts that help us remember different things. For example, there's a part that helps us remember things we see and hear, like pictures and sounds. And there's another part that helps us remember things we do and experience, like events and emotions.","361":"It's like your brain is saying, 'Hey, remember this time you cut yourself, so next time you see a sharp object, you'll be careful.'","362":"because it's made up of smaller versions of itself, so if you try to measure it, you're just measuring the same pattern over and over again.","363":"Well, it's possible that a planet or an asteroid could have some fractal properties, like a self-similar shape, but it's unlikely that they would be fractals in the classical sense. They're more like objects in space, so they wouldn't have the same kind of repeating pattern that we see in fractals like the Mandelbrot set or the Sierpinski triangle.","364":"Exactly. And if we keep doing this, we're gonna keep getting longer and longer measurements of the coastline. And that's because the coastline is a fractal, and it has a property called self-similarity. That means that it looks the same at different scales. And so if we zoom in on this coastline, we'll see that it looks just like the coastline of great Britain, but smaller. And if we zoom in on that one, it'll look like the coastline again, but smaller. And that's what makes it a fractal.","365":"I think that's a really good way to put it. Fractals are shapes that don't fit into our usual ideas of shapes, they're not like a circle or a square, they're more like a tree or a mountain, they have a lot of different parts that are similar to each other and they can go on forever.","366":"Hi Namina, what's your name?","367":"The way it works is that tiny particles like atoms or electrons can be used to sense changes in their environment, like temperature or pressure. It's like having a super-sensitive finger that can feel even the slightest changes in the world around it.","368":"We are trying to get information about the ball without touching it, without breaking it, without messing it up.","369":"I was working on a project with a colleague who was doing some work on magnetometry and we realized that the sensitivity of the magnetometers was limited by the thermal noise in the system. So we started looking into ways to use quantum sensing to improve the sensitivity.","370":"Well, one thing that comes to mind is the scale of the objects we're dealing with. In imaging, you're trying to reconstruct a macroscopic object, like a whole body, from the signals you get from the spins. In quantum sensing, you're trying to infer properties of a single spin or a few spins, so the signal-to-noise ratio is much more challenging.","371":"Yeah, the sensitivity is actually limited by the distance to the defect, so if you're too far away, the signal just becomes too weak to detect.","372":"Or even worse, into a mixed state. Which is not a pure state. So, you need to control the fluctuations very carefully to keep your system in a pure state.","373":"and we were like, okay, we need to shield the system because we can't change the frequency of the FM stations, so we just shielded it and that was the end of it.","374":"I think that's a really good point. Quantum sensing is already borrowing a lot from quantum computation, so why not take it further?","375":"And they're able to do that because they're using these quantum sensors, right?","376":null,"377":"That's the thing about quantum systems, they're not just noisy, they're also non-deterministic, which means that even if you had a perfect qubit, you'd still have to deal with the fact that the outcome of a computation can be affected by the act of measurement itself. It's like trying to build a house on a foundation that's constantly shifting.","378":"Adding more qubits actually doesn\u2019t solve the problem of decoherence, it just makes it worse because you have more things that can go wrong.","379":"I think people are misunderstanding the complexity of building a large-scale quantum computer, it's not just a matter of building a bigger quantum processor, it's about developing the entire ecosystem of quantum software, quantum algorithms, and quantum error correction.","380":"That's because Minecraft uses a process called chunking to render its world, which means it loads only a certain area around the player's location at any given time.","381":"Subdivision surfaces are a technique used in 3D modeling to create smooth surfaces by recursively subdividing a mesh into smaller pieces, allowing for more precise control over the surface's geometry. It's a key component in many modern computer graphics applications, like video games and film.","382":"by showing that if I keep doing this, eventually, I can get something that looks very smooth and round.","383":"Well, it depends on the complexity of the surface and the resolution of the image. For instance, a Pixar movie can take months to render. But we can also do this on the fly using some clever algorithms that allow us to generate the surface at the same time that we're drawing it.","384":"I think one of the cutting edge areas is actually in machine learning. Fractals are very useful in image processing, and they can be used to generate synthetic data, which is a big problem in machine learning. If you want to train a model to recognize a cat, for example, you need a huge amount of data, and generating synthetic data that looks like real data is a very challenging problem. Fractals can be used to generate realistic-looking images, which can be used to train models. So, I think that's one area where fractals are being used in computer science right now.","385":"It was actually the first operational packet switching network, developed by the US Department of Defense's Advanced Research Projects Agency in the late 1960s.","386":"What would packet switching enable? With packet switching, you can have multiple messages going over the same link at the same time, and they can be routed through different nodes on the network to get to their destinations. It's a much more flexible and efficient way of moving data around. It's the basis for how the internet works today.","387":"That's right, with a request-response structure, you can break up the communication into smaller packets and send them independently, so even if one packet gets lost or corrupted, the others can still get through and the communication can still work.","388":"I think there are seven layers to the internet, but I'm not sure what the seven keys are.","389":"How can that be possible on the internet?","390":"they get lost or corrupted along the way.","391":"That's a good start, but the field of quantum sensing is actually a bit broader than just using quantum computers. Quantum sensing involves using quantum systems, like atoms or photons, to measure and manipulate tiny quantities of things like temperature, magnetic fields, or even tiny forces, like gravitational waves.","392":"I'm working on a project to develop a new type of magnetometer that uses a quantum sensor to measure magnetic fields.","393":"The process of creating a diamond, specifically a nanodiamond, can take anywhere from a few minutes to a few hours, depending on the method used. It typically involves bombarding a diamond precursor with high-energy particles, such as ions or electrons, to create the nanodiamond.","394":"and then the fact that it decays from that superposition state is actually the information that you're using to sense the world.","395":"It allows two or more qubits to become correlated in such a way that the state of one qubit cannot be described independently of the others, even when the qubits are separated by large distances. This correlation can enhance the sensitivity of the quantum sensor.","396":"An atomic clock is a quantum sensor in the sense that it uses quantum mechanics to measure time, but it's not a sensor in the same way that a magnetometer is, which is used to measure magnetic fields. An atomic clock is more like a precision timekeeper.","397":"So, quantum sensing is one of the ways to make those clocks even more precise, by using the principles of quantum mechanics to sense things that are happening in the world around us.","398":"They connect to a larger network through a service provider, like your internet service provider, which is like a kind of superhighway that connects all of the local networks together.","399":"Yes, there are underseas cables that connect different parts of the world, allowing data to be transmitted between them.","400":"Well, the undersea cables are connected to big servers in each country. And those servers are connected to smaller servers in big cities. And those smaller servers are connected to even smaller servers in neighborhoods. And those smaller servers are connected to even smaller servers in houses. And those small servers are connected to your computer through Wi-Fi.","401":"The server actually sends you a list of the available servers and you choose one. The server then sends you the location of the chosen server and you connect to it. This way, the data is transmitted over the shortest possible path and it doesn't get scrambled.","402":"That sounds about right. For example, think of a simple function like f(x) = 2x. In this case, the input is x and the operation is multiplying it by 2. The output is then 2x. Does that fit with your idea of a function?","403":"Well, you see, when we talk about infinite sets, we're not talking about just any old endless list. We're talking about sets where the elements are in a specific order or structure, and that's what allows us to make these comparisons. So, for example, the set of natural numbers, 1, 2, 3, and so on, is an infinite set, but it's still a very specific and structured set. And that's what makes it possible to compare it to other infinite sets, like the set of integers or the set of real numbers.","404":"We can't match negative one with two, because we've already matched one with one. So we need to find a natural number that hasn't been matched yet. How about we match negative one with three?","405":"Yes, that's right. So we have all the positive integers as the odd numbers, and all the negative integers as the even numbers. And this is a good way to get a feel for the difference between natural numbers and integers.","406":"Exactly, and that's what I'm trying to illustrate with this picture. You can see that the rational numbers can be represented as pairs of integers, and we can label them in a systematic way.","407":"We also have an injective function the other way, which means we have a function that takes a rational number and maps it to a natural number in a one-to-one fashion, so this size of infinity is smaller than this size of infinity.","408":"Exactly, if I just added one to each of the diagonal elements, that would be a new real number that doesn't exist in any of the other ones. But what I'm actually going to do is more subtle than that.","409":"Now that we've proven this, we can conclude that there are uncountably many real numbers, which is a pretty mind-blowing result.","410":"and it's amazing to see how all these components work together to make this huge leap in computing power.","411":"Entanglement is a property of quantum mechanics where two or more particles become connected in such a way that the state of one particle can be instantaneously affected by the state of the other particle even if they are separated by large distances.","412":"they use active noise control, which involves playing a sound that's the exact opposite of the ambient noise to cancel it out.","413":"It's like the qubits are in a special kind of container that helps them maintain their quantum state, right? It's not like a regular container that you'd find in a kitchen, but more like a specialized lab equipment that keeps the qubits from interacting with the environment in a way that would collapse the superposition.","414":"It would change the way you think about algorithms and the way you structure your programs. You'd have to think about how to take advantage of quantum parallelism, which is a different way of thinking about how to solve problems.","415":"Yes, I have. My friend told me that it sucks up everything that gets too close to it.","416":"How much space is inside it?","417":"The core of the star becomes so dense and heavy that it warps the fabric of space and time around it, creating a point of no return called the event horizon. Once something crosses the event horizon, it's trapped forever, and that's when you have a black hole.","418":"Because the sun isn't dense enough, it's mostly made up of hydrogen and helium, and it's not heavy enough to create the kind of gravitational pull that would trap everything, including light, so it can't form a black hole on its own.","419":"That's right, it's like the gravity is so strong that it warps the space around the black hole, and that's what pulls the light in.","420":"so it's like it's warping space, and that's why things can get sucked in without actually having to touch them","421":"Actually, I've been studying some aspects of topology, particularly in the context of infinite-dimensional manifolds. It's interesting to see how the concept of infinity can be used to describe properties of these spaces that wouldn't be possible in finite dimensions.","422":"It selects an element from a set.","423":"So, if they're transmitting small amounts of data, you don't need to worry about the overhead of the network protocol being too high.","424":"I think that's a good point. For example, a temperature sensor might be sending a single byte every minute, which is 1 byte per second. And that's not even accounting for the overhead of the communication protocol, which could add another byte or two.","425":"Because in a zero-knowledge proof, the prover is not just conveying the fact that they know something, but also ensuring that the verifier learns nothing about the underlying information beyond the fact that the statement is true. It's about the relationship between the prover and the verifier, not just about the data itself.","426":"Can you give an example of something that's predictable in this context?","427":"They have to prove it without revealing the underlying data.","428":"without revealing any information about the input or the computation itself, except for the fact that the computation halts or not.","429":"The future of zero-knowledge proofs is looking very exciting, with applications in everything from verifiable secret sharing to functional encryption. It's a rapidly evolving field, and I think we'll see a lot of innovation in the coming years.","430":"Do you think it has one?","431":"Well, there are a couple of different ideas. One is that you could have had a very large population of smaller black holes, and then they merged together over time, eventually forming a supermassive black hole. That's one possibility. Another possibility is that supermassive black holes could have formed directly from the collapse of a gas cloud, maybe a giant gas cloud that was present in the early universe. But that's a bit more tricky to understand, because we don't really know how those kinds of clouds would collapse and form a black hole. So, it's still an open question, and it's something that people are still trying to figure out.","432":"focusing on the accretion of matter and energy onto black holes, rather than just how they form.","433":"And then we'll have a supermassive black hole that's just a huge fraction of the mass of the combined galaxies, which would be really interesting to study, but also potentially a real problem for the galaxy, because the supermassive black hole would likely have a huge impact on the stars and gas in the galaxy, potentially even ejecting them from the galaxy entirely.","434":"It's likely that the merger of the two black holes would create a supermassive black hole, which would then have a mass many times that of our current sun.","435":"One of the most interesting things that's been happening is the development of a new theory that suggests that black holes may not be as one-dimensional as we thought, but actually have a more complex structure, with multiple layers and even a kind of'skin' that can be probed by gravitational waves. It's a really exciting area of research that could have big implications for our understanding of these cosmic phenomena.","436":"Actually, if we could harness the energy of a black hole like our sun, the energy output would be exponentially greater than what we calculated with the moon and the strongest magnet. It's theoretically possible to extract energy from a black hole, but the technology to do so safely and efficiently is far beyond our current capabilities.","437":null,"438":"Because, I mean, we're talking about the ability to do certain kinds of calculations that are just completely intractable on a classical computer, so it's not just a matter of speeding things up, it's a matter of doing things that we just can't do at all on a classical computer.","439":"you have to change the magnetic polarization in a way that's not just a simple change from one to zero but you have to change the polarization in a way that's correlated with the polarization of some other bit in the system and that's kind of the fundamental difference between a classical bit and a quantum bit, a qubit, where a qubit is not just a binary value but it's a two-dimensional vector and you can have a superposition of the two values at the same time","440":"For example, in a quantum bit or qubit, you can have a superposition of 0 and 1, meaning the qubit is both 0 and 1 at the same time, until it's measured, at which point it collapses to one definite state.","441":"We use a process called quantum encoding, where we map the classical data onto the qubits using a combination of quantum gates and operations, such as Hadamard gates and Pauli-X gates, to create a superposition of states that represent the data.","442":"because otherwise, the outcome of the computation would depend on the quantum state of the machine, which is inherently probabilistic.","443":"They're going to be more heuristic, more noisy intermediate-scale quantum algorithms that are designed to take advantage of the noise in the system, rather than trying to suppress it.","444":"Yeah, and I think that's one of the biggest challenges is that we're still trying to figure out what the practical applications are going to be for quantum computing, and how we're going to get to that point where we can actually use it for real-world problems.","445":"I see what you mean about narrowing the task range and biased sampling, but I was thinking more about how to get robots to learn more efficiently or learn faster in terms of actually accelerating the learning process itself, rather than just optimizing the learning environment.","446":"I think one promising direction is to make the physics engines in the simulators more realistic. The current physics engines are quite simplified, which can lead to unrealistic simulations. By making the physics engines more realistic, we can get closer to the real-world behavior of the robots and the objects they interact with. Another direction is to incorporate more sensors and sensor noise into the simulators, which can help to make the simulations more realistic and robust. Additionally, we can also explore using machine learning techniques to learn the mapping between the simulated and real-world environments, which can help to bridge the gap between the two.","447":"Okay, so fractals are like patterns that repeat over and over again. Like how your hair might curl in a certain way and then repeat in the same way all the way down your head.","448":"So they use something called a fractal to tell the computer how to draw the tree.","449":"And that smaller branch also splits into two smaller branches, and so does that one, and that one, and so on.","450":"You have to make a thousand of them, that's why I'm telling you about fractals. They're a shortcut.","451":"Programming is a way to tell a computer exactly what to do, step by step, so it can draw fractals for you.","452":"I've been following your work on the history of the internet. What are your thoughts on the impact of the World Wide Web on the global economy?","453":"and the decentralization of it all, which is a double edged sword, because it makes it very resilient, but it also makes it very difficult to manage and maintain, and that's where the tension is.","454":"So, what are some of the implications of this lack of global regulation on internet freedom and security?","455":"It's like a big game of inference, where you're constantly trying to fill in the gaps.","456":"are starting to converge in a way that's really exciting, because if we can get all three of these things to work together, we can get a lot of the benefits of cloud, a lot of the benefits of wireless, and a lot of the benefits of networking, all in one place.","457":"and the other thing that's often overlooked is the fact that 5G has a lot of new features that allow for better security and better privacy.","458":"I've learned about black holes in my astrophysics class, but I still don't fully understand them. I know they have such a strong gravitational pull that nothing, including light, can escape once it gets too close to the event horizon.","459":"So, what that means is that for the person falling in, time becomes more and more stretched out as they approach the singularity. It's as if time is not just passing normally but is being stretched out in a way that's almost unimaginable. Meanwhile, the curvature of space around the black hole becomes so extreme that any sense of spatial direction or reference is lost. It's a truly mind-bending experience, and it's one of the reasons why black holes are so fascinating to study.","460":"They thought that because in quantum mechanics, the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle says you can't know both the position and momentum of a particle at the same time. So if you were to try to get to the singularity, you would have to know both the position and the momentum of the matter at the same time. And that would be impossible according to quantum mechanics.","461":"Exactly, it's inferred from the math and observations of the effects of black holes on their surroundings. We can see how stars and gas move around a suspected black hole, and that gives us clues about the black hole's mass and spin. We can also see the effects of black holes on the light around them, such as gravitational lensing and the emission of X-rays and other forms of radiation. So, while we can't directly observe what's inside a black hole, we can use the math and these observations to make educated guesses about what's happening.","462":"He showed that black holes actually have a temperature and entropy, and they emit radiation, which we now call Hawking radiation. This was a major breakthrough because it showed that black holes are not completely black, but rather they have a kind of glow, and that they can actually lose mass over time, which has a lot of implications for how we think about the information paradox.","463":"For example, we've got systems like ultracold atoms, where we can get very close to the conditions that are necessary for Hawking radiation, and see if we can actually observe the quantum effects that we expect to see in a black hole.","464":"I mean, think about it. In a multi-party computation, you've got multiple parties that want to collaborate on something, but they can't just share their private inputs directly because that would violate their privacy. So, they use zero-knowledge proofs to prove that they've done the computation correctly without revealing their inputs. But it's not just about the proof itself, it's about the fact that they can do the computation in such a way that they're only revealing what's necessary to achieve the outcome, without giving away any extra information.","465":"become useful for zero-knowledge proofs, allowing for the creation of proofs that are secure and efficient without revealing sensitive information.","466":"I think that's an area where we could see a lot of innovation and progress in the coming years, especially with the increasing adoption of homomorphic encryption and other related techniques.","467":"It's like your brain is trying to rationalize the decision after the fact.","468":"Have you seen it on the internet?","469":"and then to the computer that the person is using.","470":"That's a good point, but the thing is, the internet is made up of lots of different computers and routers, and they're all connected in different ways. So even if we wanted it to go from here to here, it's not possible because of how they're all connected. It's like a big web, and the path it takes is determined by the connections between the different computers and routers.","471":"And if one path is really slow, you might want to go the other way to get to where you're going faster.","472":"Lettuce is a type of leafy green vegetable.","473":"And just like a symphony conductor, our brains are constantly adjusting and fine-tuning the patterns of activity to create a cohesive and meaningful experience.","474":"I think that's a great connection to make, because the hippocampus is known to be involved in the formation of new memories, and the way it does that is by creating new connections between neurons, which is a very dynamic process. And I think that's what's so fascinating about the idea of a mental model, is that it's not just a static representation of the world, but it's a dynamic, constantly evolving model that's being updated and revised as new information comes in.","475":"I think that's where the concept of schema comes in - the idea that our brains are constantly trying to fit new information into existing frameworks or maps. And the way that we create those frameworks, the way that we choose to organize our mental spaces, it's going to affect how we navigate and respond to new environments.","476":"And I think that's a really important point about memory and mental models, that they're not just static things that we accumulate over time, but they're actually dynamic and they can be changed and updated and even deleted, and that's a really powerful insight into how our minds work.","477":"And I think that's a really interesting point, because if you think about it, our current understanding of memory is actually based on a lot of indirect evidence. We know that the brain is doing some kind of construction, but we don't really know how that construction works. So, in a way, our models of memory are actually based on our models of the brain, rather than the other way around.","478":"I think that's a great point, that it's not just a static record, but it's a dynamic process, and it's one that involves change and forgetting, as well as learning and remembering. And I think that's what's so fascinating about this, is that it's not just a matter of storing information, but it's a matter of how that information is used and transformed over time. And I think that's where the idea of a mental model comes in, because it's not just a matter of storing individual events, but it's a matter of creating a framework for understanding and navigating the world. And that's where the behavioral relevance comes in, because it's not just a matter of storing information, but it's a matter of how that information is used to guide our behavior and inform our decisions. So, I think we're on the right track here, in terms of thinking about memory as a dynamic and changing process, and one that's deeply connected to our behavior and our understanding of the world.","479":"Exactly! Black holes are incredibly dense objects with such a strong gravitational pull that nothing, including light, can escape once it gets too close. This is why they are invisible to us, as light cannot escape to reach our eyes. The theories you mentioned, such as the universe's origin and evolution, are indeed connected to black holes, as they are thought to play a crucial role in the formation and evolution of galaxies and stars.","480":"So the idea is that the guitar will act as a kind of detector for the waves that the black holes have produced. And I'd like you to play a few notes on the guitar to simulate the sound of those waves as they travel through the universe.","481":"We know that it's a black hole because the way the waves are behaving is exactly what we would expect if a black hole of that size were to merge with another black hole. It's like a fingerprint, it's a unique pattern that we can recognize and match to the event that we're seeing.","482":"But the waves are so weak by the time they reach Earth that they don't have any noticeable effect on our planet.","483":"I'd love to discuss your take on Moravec's paradox and its implications for AI research.","484":"Absolutely, it's frustrating because it highlights the limitations of our current approach to AI development. We're still struggling to create robots that can navigate the world in a way that's similar to humans, and it's not just about adding more sensors or processing power. It's about understanding the underlying cognitive and motor processes that allow humans to interact with the world so effortlessly.","485":"I think it's related to the way we understand the world and the way we understand intelligence. We tend to think that intelligence is about being able to do a lot of things, but actually, intelligence is about being able to do the right thing in the right context.","486":"I think the most promising approach is a hybrid one, where we combine the symbolic representations of the discrete and symbolic AI with the continuous representations of the sensory and perception systems, and then use that to inform the learning process of the AI.","487":"I'm particularly interested in how the way we report on our experiences is related to the way we process information in working memory, because I think that's a key part of how we make these social judgements.","488":"Oh, absolutely. And I think that's why the field of memory studies has always been so interdisciplinary, because it touches on so many different areas of psychology and neuroscience and sociology.","489":"And I think that's really interesting, because it suggests that our memories of positive experiences are not just stored in the same way as our memories of negative experiences.","490":"And that's what's really fascinating, that the brain is capable of reorganizing itself in response to injury or disease.","491":"I think one example of that is the work that's been done on memory and perception, and how our memory of a stimulus can influence what we perceive about that stimulus. And that's a really interesting question to me because it speaks to this whole idea of how our brain constructs our experience of the world, and how our memory is a part of that.","492":"But that's not what actually happens, is it? Sometimes things that are easy for humans are really hard for computers, and that's what Moravec's paradox is all about.","493":"I've got a little program here that's going to try to do a simple task, like solving a Rubik's cube.","494":"Now, imagine that I'm a robot, and I'm trying to do the same task. Would you expect it to be as easy for a robot to pick up the penny and put it into the other hand?","495":"I'm going to count to three, and then I'm going to ask you to throw the ball to me.","496":"And that's basically what's going on with Moravec's paradox - we think that the tasks that are hard for humans to do are the ones that are going to be hard for AI to do, but it turns out that the things that are hard for humans to do are actually the ones that are easy for AI to do, like picking up a ball from the ground.","497":"I think what you're getting at is the difference between how we can program a robot to do something, versus how a human can do it. For example, we can program a robot to pick up a ball, but we can't program it to play a game of catch, because that involves understanding the game, the ball, the other person, and all these other things. It's like the difference between programming a car to drive from point A to point B, versus programming it to drive from point A to point B while avoiding pedestrians, and taking the scenic route, and all these other things.","498":"No, they don't have the ability to know they messed up in the way that humans do.","499":"And that's how it learns to do the task. But the thing about this is that, in order for the robot to learn, it has to have some kind of goal in mind. It has to know what it's trying to achieve.","500":"That's a good question. A robot doesn't see like we do, it's more like it's processing visual information and using that to make decisions.","501":"No, I don't think so. Moravec's paradox is a big part of that. It's a paradox that was first proposed by Hans Moravec, who is a robotics expert. He said that it's actually easier to get a robot to do really hard tasks, like doing surgery or driving a car, than it is to get it to do simple tasks, like folding a towel or doing the dishes. It's because we've been programming the robots to do the hard tasks, so we're really good at that. But we haven't been programming them to do the simple tasks, so we're not good at that. So, I think it's unlikely that robots will take over the world, at least in the near future.","502":"and it's really amazing to see how easily they can create these intricate patterns.","503":"I think that's one of the things that's exciting about it, is that it's not just a mathematical concept, it's a very intuitive concept that shows up in lots of different places, like in the branching of trees, the flow of rivers, the patterns on a leaf, the way that coastlines work, and you can see it in lots of different ways, so I think that's one of the things that makes it so fascinating.","504":"when you see that self-similarity at all scales, you start to see it everywhere.","505":"then we can really get into the fractals.","506":"one of the things that I think is really interesting about fractals is that they're often described as having infinite detail, but that's only true at certain scales. And if you zoom in too far, they start to look very simple and very repetitive, which is kind of the opposite of the richness and complexity that we experience in the real world.","507":"because the world is infinitely complex and fractals show that complexity can be self-similar at different scales, so even if we could store the world in a computer, we'd never be able to explore it completely.","508":"he wanted to get away from the kind of the 'I'm a genius, I can make this incredibly complicated thing' kind of mentality, and instead just focus on making something that's beautiful and accessible.","509":"You know, like if you're counting, you can always count one more, and then one more after that, and so on. And that's kind of what infinity is, it's like you can always add one more, and never actually run out.","510":"You can't count all the way through infinity, it's like trying to count all the way through all the grains of sand on every beach on Earth, it's just not possible.","511":"We'd still be missing an infinite number of jars.","512":"So, does that mean it's not like a jar that's full and can't be added to?","513":"I think it's because of the way quantum computers work. They use qubits, which can exist in multiple states at the same time. This allows them to process a huge number of possibilities simultaneously, but it also means they can get stuck in a superposition of states. If the qubits are not properly calibrated, they can get out of sync, causing errors like the ones you're experiencing with your camera. It's like the qubits are trying to take a photo, but they can't quite get it right! ","514":"What does it mean?","515":"But what if I were to flip this penny and it landed on its edge? It would be both heads and tails at the same time, which is basically what superposition is.","516":"and that's kind of like what a quantum computer does, it can untangle the possibilities and find the answer to a problem.","517":"So, it's like they're 'talking' to each other in a way that we can't explain yet, and that's really what's so fascinating about quantum mechanics.","518":"But in quantum sensing, you're trying to measure things that are really hard to measure, like magnetic fields or temperatures, and you're trying to do it in a really precise way.","519":"That's totally fine! An MRI is a way for doctors to take pictures of the inside of your body. It uses a big magnet and some radio waves to make the hydrogen atoms in your body vibrate. When they vibrate, they send back signals that the machine can turn into pictures. It's kind of like how a guitar string vibrates when you pluck it, and the sound it makes is like a picture of the string. But instead of sound, an MRI makes a picture of the inside of your body!","520":"So, how do you think this relates to the real world?","521":"There are several other quantum sensors that are in the

brain machinery for sleep, how does your background in neuroscience inform your understanding of the sleep-wake cycle?","2":"Well, to be honest, amphetamines can provide a temporary fix for sleepiness, but they're not a reliable long-term solution. In fact, taking them for extended periods can even lead to rebound insomnia, making it harder to fall asleep at night. So, while they might help manage sleepiness, they don't really address the underlying issue.","3":"I'd say it's a bit more complex than that. While amphetamines can indeed help regulate the timing of sleep, their impact on sleep quality is still not fully understood. Research suggests that the effects of amphetamines on sleep can vary depending on factors such as the dosage, the individual's sleep schedule, and their underlying sleep disorders. For instance, some studies have found that high doses of amphetamines can actually disrupt sleep patterns and reduce sleep quality, while lower doses may have a more nuanced effect. Furthermore, the long-term use of amphetamines can lead to sleep problems, such as insomnia and sleep fragmentation, which can have significant consequences for overall health and well-being. So, while amphetamines may help regulate sleep timing in some cases, it's essential to approach this topic with caution and consider the potential risks and limitations of these interventions.","4":"We don't know the specifics, but research suggests that amphetamines can affect the transition between sleep stages, particularly the REM and non-REM cycles. This can lead to a fragmented sleep architecture, rather than just a reduction in sleep duration.","5":"And one thing that could be considered is how to assess that, so you might have them fill out a sleep diary or use actigraphy, which is a non-invasive way to track movement during sleep.","6":"You have to be willing to take risks, but it's not just about being reckless \u2013 it's about being intentional with the language of harmony, which can be both precise and nuanced, requiring a delicate balance between creativity and constraint.","7":"That's what I love about that song - the way the chord progression subtly anchors the melody to D flat major, creating a sense of stability that lets the lyrics take center stage.","8":"It adds a kind of brightness and tension to the sound, but also keeps it from feeling too resolved or final.","9":"I still remember the first time I heard that chord progression. It sent shivers down my spine, and I couldn't shake off the feeling that it was somehow... off.","10":"You seem to be on the same wavelength as me. Am I getting warm?","11":"Actually, I've always been curious about that. I've heard it's in the key of C major, but I'm not sure about the specific chord progression. What's your take on it?","12":"It's a classic hymn that's been around for centuries, and its enduring popularity is a testament to its timeless message and melody.","13":"The melody has a more balanced and soothing quality to it.","14":"That's a good start, but think about it like this: latency is the time it takes for the graphics card to render an image, and then for that image to actually appear on the display. So, it's not just about how long it takes for the graphics card to do its job, but also how long it takes for the signal to get from the graphics card to the display.","15":"because that's what game developers are actually interested in, and they have the resources to make it happen.","16":"Exactly, and it's not just limited to machines or robots, but can also be applied to other areas like image and speech recognition, natural language processing, and more.","17":"You could try using a music streaming service like Spotify, which uses machine learning to recommend artists based on your listening history. Keep in mind that these predictions are not always perfect, and you can always explore and correct them by rating or removing suggested artists.","18":"I'm guessing that's not it, though, because I don't recall that song being on any of the playlists I've listened to. Plus, I think Spotify's algorithms are more sophisticated than that. Maybe it was because the song's genre or tone somehow matched what I've been listening to lately?","19":"That's right, and it's not just about showing you ads that you're likely to click on, but also about creating a more personalized experience for you. For example, have you ever noticed how Facebook or Instagram can suggest friends or groups that you might be interested in based on your past interactions? Or how they can recommend videos or articles that are tailored to your interests?","20":"Well, I think we've made a lot of progress in teaching machines to do things that we can do, but we're still a long way from truly doing things that we can't do. And as for things that we can do that a machine might never be able to do, I think that's a really interesting question. For example, a machine can't experience emotions like we do, which are complex and multifaceted. But I also think that we're still in the process of figuring out what exactly it means to be human, so it's hard to say for certain what unique abilities we have that machines might not be able to replicate. What do you think? ","21":"That's the density of neutron stars, which are known to be incredibly stable, having survived for billions of years without collapsing.","22":"That's right, and one of the key ways that black holes differ from neutron stars is that they have such strong gravity that nothing, not even light, can escape once it gets too close. This is because the density of a black hole is so great that it warps space-time in extreme ways.","23":"That's a great point, and it's a bit of a tricky question. While space-time does indeed break down at the center of a black hole, it's not entirely accurate to say that there is no space-time inside. Instead, we can think of the space-time inside a black hole as being highly distorted and curved, to the point where our usual notions of space and time no longer apply. In this sense, we can still talk about the mass and angular momentum that's inside, as you mentioned, but we need to be careful not to think of it as being a fixed, three-dimensional space. Does that make sense?","24":"But what's even more fascinating is that these gravitational waves also carry information about the properties of matter that we can't directly observe, like the rotation rates and masses of the neutron stars or black holes that produce them. By analyzing these signals, scientists are gaining new insights into the behavior of matter in extreme environments, and that's a really exciting area of research right now.","25":"or an engineer, for that matter.","26":"So let's start by sketching out a spacetime diagram, and we can use it to visualize how different observers can experience time and space differently, depending on their relative motion.","27":"Because if you think of space and time as separate, you'd have to ask which events happen at the same time, and that's not as clear-cut as it seems, since time dilation comes into play.","28":"So, spacetime is similar to the two-dimensional space we're talking about, but it also includes time. When we think about moving through spacetime, we're not just thinking about how long it takes, but also about the shortest path we can take. It's kind of like finding the most direct route between two points.","29":"and that's why we draw it this way, because it's a helpful way to simplify a pretty complex idea, don't you think?","30":"because that person was moving really fast, and that's what caused time to pass more slowly for them compared to you, who was standing still. It's kind of like when you're on a train and you see a tree passing by really quickly, but for the person standing next to the tree, time is passing normally. Does that make sense?","31":"Exactly, that's a great analogy. Imagine you have a big sheet, and you put a heavy object, like a bowling ball, in the middle of it. It warps the sheet, right? And if you dropped a marble near the bowling ball, it would roll towards the bowling ball, following the curvature of the sheet. That's similar to what happens with spacetime and gravity: heavy objects warp spacetime, and other objects move along that curvature.","32":"The key to understanding relativity is to recognize that how we experience time and motion depends on our own perspective and where we are in the universe.","33":"It's like a journey, you're starting with a spark, you're navigating through different emotions, and you're coming back home with a newfound understanding of yourself and the music.","34":null,"35":"Well, in string theory, we have these mathematical tools called Calabi-Yau manifolds that help us visualize and understand the geometry of these extra dimensions. They're like complex shapes that wrap around each other, and they're used to describe the different ways that particles can interact with each other in these higher-dimensional spaces.","36":"I mean, do the extra dimensions just get compactified in a way that makes them too small to see, or is there something else going on that's actually shrinking them?","37":"I'm intrigued by the idea of compactifying extra dimensions, could you tell me more about how you and your co-authors came up with this new approach?","38":"You see, the name 'brane' comes from the idea that it's like a membrane, but instead of just a thin sheet, it's more like a higher-dimensional surface that can be thought of as a membrane, and the number of dimensions it has is what P represents.","39":"Yeah, it's crazy how these compactified branes can give you such different behavior in different dimensions. We've been playing around with them a lot, and it's been really fun to see how they change.","40":"That's how you get to a five-dimensional universe with compactified dimensions, and the balance between the cosmological constant and the electromagnetic field determines the radius of the compactified space.","41":"I see what you're getting at, but trust me, the physics behind quantum computing is way more fascinating than any movie plot. Let's talk about it!","42":"I've been reading up on some of the papers in that debate, and it seems like some researchers are exploring the idea that the dimensionality of spacetime could be emergent, rather than fundamental.","43":"It's a story about a group of characters who live in a world that's not our own, but it's a world that's similar to our own, in the sense that it has its own version of our planet, called Nova Terra, and its own version of our history, but with some key differences, like the fact that the Roman Empire never fell and instead merged with the Mongol Empire to create a vast, interconnected network of trade and culture. As they explore this idea, they start to see the world in a whole new way, one where the laws of physics are not fixed, but are instead determined by the actions of the characters themselves, and where the concept of time is relative and flexible, much like the concept of space.","44":"So, you see, gravity is like an invisible hug from the earth, pulling everything towards its center, from the tiniest atoms to the mightiest mountains. It's what keeps us grounded and what makes things fall towards the ground when we drop them.","45":"A black hole is different from the Earth because its gravity warps space-time, making it impossible for anything to escape once it gets too close. Unlike other massive objects, like planets and stars, black holes have such strong gravity that not even light can escape, making them truly unique and extreme.","46":"So, think of it like this: the continuous wave laser is like a steady stream of water, whereas the chirped pulse amplifier is like a huge wave that crashes down all at once. That's the main difference, right?","47":null,"48":"I was thinking, we could use a high-intensity laser to ablate the cell, but we'd need to be super careful not to damage the surrounding tissue, or it could lead to more harm than good. Maybe we could explore some other options, like using a lower intensity laser or a different type of radiation that's more targeted?","49":"I think that's a great point. VR can be isolating, but it can also be a powerful tool for social connection. For instance, we're seeing VR used in therapy and education to facilitate social interaction and empathy, making it a bit of a double-edged sword.","50":"I think one of the biggest challenges is to balance the sense of presence with the limitations of the technology, while also ensuring that we're not sacrificing the unique aspects of virtual reality that make it meaningful. For instance, if we focus too much on creating a realistic sense of immersion, we might lose the opportunities for creative expression and experimentation that VR offers. And as for embodiment, I'd love to explore how we can use VR to challenge our assumptions and biases, but we also need to be mindful of the potential risks and benefits, and have a clear understanding of how this technology can be used to enhance our lives, rather than just simulating them.","51":"I think you're saying that sometimes, it's not about how realistic something looks, but about how it feels. And in some cases, a more stylized or cartoonish look can actually make the experience more enjoyable. Is that what you mean?","52":"But what if we could harness the power of quantum computing to revolutionize rendering and overcome the bandwidth and streaming challenges in virtual reality? How might that change the landscape of immersive experiences?","53":"I think VR has a lot of potential to revolutionize the way we interact with technology and each other. By providing a more immersive and interactive experience, we can create new opportunities for people to learn, be creative, and connect with others in ways that aren't possible in the physical world. For example, we could use VR to create virtual classrooms, art studios, or even therapy sessions that are more engaging and effective than traditional methods. It's an exciting area of development that could have a significant impact on various aspects of our lives.","54":"One of the key hurdles we'll face is ensuring that this technology doesn't exacerbate existing social inequalities. As we work to make VR and AR more accessible, we need to consider how to bridge the gap between those who are already tech-savvy and those who are not. This might involve developing more user-friendly interfaces, providing education and training programs, or even implementing policies that promote digital literacy and access to these technologies.","55":"That's a great question. I think they could be connected in fields like bioinformatics, where computer science is used to analyze and interpret biological data, or in synthetic biology, where computer science is used to design and engineer new biological systems. I'm also interested in how machine learning can be used to understand and model complex biological systems.","56":"Those are the classic ones, but I've also heard of theories that suggest there could be more, like extra dimensions that are curled up or something. What do you think about that?","57":"Let's see if we can visualize this together, okay?","58":"By using distance and angle, we'd essentially be creating a 2D grid where each point is defined by its proximity to the origin and its orientation relative to the axes, right? What do you think about that?","59":"You think time is a dimension? That's a great guess. People have thought about that. In fact, that's one of the things we call the theory of general relativity. Einstein said that time is not separate from space, it's actually a dimension of space-time. But what we're really looking for are dimensions that are not directly accessible to us, like the dimensions that make up the fabric of space-time. For example, in string theory, there are six additional dimensions beyond the three we're familiar with, and one of time. Can you think of any way that these extra dimensions could be hidden from us?","60":"What do you mean by 'coordinates on the sky'? How does that work?","61":null,"62":"I think it's fascinating that scientists are able to do that. Can you tell me more about the technology and the specific project you're referring to?","63":"Gravity is what keeps us grounded, literally. Without it, we'd be drifting away, but thanks to the Earth's mass, we stay put.","64":"I think you're asking if we could get up if gravity was too weak, not too strong. If gravity was much weaker, it would be easier to jump or lift things, but if it was too strong, it would be much harder to move around, like on a planet with a very dense atmosphere.","65":"You're a bit taller than I am, aren't you?","66":"What's going on? You look like you've seen a ghost!","67":"When you're in space, the lack of gravity causes your spine to stretch, making you taller, which is what happened to the astronaut who spent time on the ISS.","68":"Actually, that's a pretty famous story, but it's not exactly how Newton discovered gravity. He was actually sitting under an apple tree when he noticed an apple fall, but that was more of a thought experiment that led him to formulate his law of universal gravitation. Did you know that he was also inspired by the way objects fall towards the Earth?","69":"I think that's what makes history so fascinating - there are multiple accounts and interpretations, and it's up to us to figure out what really happened.","70":"So, the force of gravity is so strong that it pulls them towards the heavy object, right?","71":"But what do you think about the idea that some research suggests that the quality of sleep is more important than the quantity for people in our age group? I've come across some studies that support this claim, and I'd love to hear your thoughts on it.","72":"That's right, but I think it's also influenced by other factors, like our lifestyle, stress levels, and overall health. For example, if we're under a lot of stress, our body might produce more cortisol, which can interfere with our sleep-wake cycle. And if we're not getting enough physical activity, it can affect our sleep quality. So, while the SCN and melatonin play a crucial role in regulating our sleep, it's not the only thing at play. What do you think?","73":"Actually, it's not just about the amount of time for melatonin release. Your body is very good at adapting to changes in daylight, so you can still produce melatonin at the right times even with long days. That's why people in places with similar daylight patterns to Hoi can have consistent sleep schedules.","74":"A gain medium, that's really cool. Can you tell me more about how it works? Does it use some kind of special crystal or something?","75":"The reason we hit the big end is because it\u2019s heavier and the heavier part is at the front, which helps it go in more easily, but that\u2019s not the main reason, it\u2019s actually because the smaller end is too thin and fragile to withstand the force of the hammer, so we hit the thicker end to distribute the force and prevent damage.","76":"to be focused, to have a high enough power density to create a controlled micro-explosion that effectively vaporizes the wood, and to be precisely controlled to avoid damaging the surrounding material.","77":"Yeah, that's a great analogy. But with a magnifying glass, you're still getting a bit of a spread of light, whereas a lens in a laser cutter is able to focus the light down to a tiny, precise point. That's what allows it to cut through the steel so efficiently.","78":"So, if time and length are interchangeable for light, how does that impact our understanding of space-time?","79":"Actually, that's not what I meant to say. I said they're invisible because they're infrared, not because you wouldn't be able to see them. They're still beams of light, just not visible to the human eye because they have a different wavelength.","80":"a beam of light, which we can then focus and use to do all sorts of cool things, like project images or even start a fire!","81":"I remember attending a seminar where Kip Thorne was talking about the prospects of observing these events.","82":"I mean, the way that the light behaves around a black hole, the way that the gravity warps space and time, it's all just so fascinating and mind-bending, but what I'm trying to get at is how that complexity affects our understanding of the event horizon.","83":null,"84":"I love that you mentioned resting and relaxing - it's amazing how our brains can just shut down and recharge. But what do you think is the most interesting part about sleep, the part that you're still trying to learn more about?","85":"So, like, what's happening physiologically when we're in different stages of sleep, such as non-rapid eye movement sleep and rapid eye movement sleep?","86":"Actually, I think I may have oversimplified things. We can't directly measure how much sleep someone's getting or their sleep schedule just by looking at REM sleep. REM sleep is one stage of sleep, and it's a part of the sleep cycle, but it's not the only thing we need to look at. We need to look at the entire sleep cycle, including the different stages of NREM sleep, to get a complete picture of someone's sleep. And as for measuring sleep schedule, that's a bit more complicated. We can use actigraphy, which is a device that people wear on their wrist, to track their movements and activity levels, but that's not the same as measuring brain activity or sleep stages directly.","87":"I think you're right, and that's why I try to avoid screens and loud noises before bed. It's harder to fall into a deep sleep when your brain is still active from all the stimulation. I'd say it's around N-2 or N-1, but it really depends on the individual and their sleep habits.","88":"So, does that mean that if I'm not getting enough REM sleep, I might struggle to pay attention in class and retain information?","89":"That's why it's not recommended for people who work or have classes during the day, and it's also not ideal for those who have other commitments or responsibilities that require them to be alert and focused during regular waking hours.","90":"What aspect of quantum mechanics did you find the most fascinating or challenging to grasp during the course?","91":"You know, they're these teeny-tiny crystals that have some really fascinating properties. One of the things that's pretty cool about them is that their optical properties are highly dependent on their size, which means they can emit light at different wavelengths depending on how big they are.","92":"Actually, I think there might be some confusion. You mentioned 0D to 3D dimensions, but we're discussing quantum dots, which are 0D nanomaterials, and they don't really fit into the 1D-2D-3D classification. Quantum dots are more of a standalone entity, whereas nanowires and nanosheets are typically 1D and 2D, respectively. Can we clarify the classification system you're using?","93":"I've heard of it, but I've never really understood what it's used for. Is it used in any products that I might be familiar with?","94":"We're actually exploring ways to leverage nanotubes' unique properties, such as their high conductivity, strength, and thermal conductivity, to create innovative electronics that surpass the capabilities of traditional silicon-based devices.","95":"Actually, those lights are just a typical LED display that I'm using to illustrate a point about the brightness and color capabilities of quantum dots, but they're not actually an example of quantum dot technology in action.","96":"That's okay, it's a pretty specialized topic. Have you ever used a calculator or a smartphone, though? Those things use some pretty cool technology that's related to machine learning.","97":"That's a great analogy, but let me try to simplify it. Imagine you're trying to teach a friend to tell the difference between a dog and a cat. You might say, 'Hey, dogs are often bigger and have floppy ears, while cats are usually smaller and have pointy ears.' We do something similar with machines, but instead of relying on size and ear shape, we use lots of pictures to teach the machine what characteristics are typical of dogs and cats. That way, it can learn to recognize them accurately.","98":"I was just thinking about how cats always seem to be slinking around, and their legs are so long and lean that they look like they're about to take off at any moment. Plus, their ears are always perked up, like they're listening for something. It's pretty cool, actually.","99":"I see, so the computer uses the pictures of cats and dogs it has learned about to figure out whether the new picture is a cat or a dog. But it also looks at other features like how the animal is moving, its size, and what it's wearing.","100":null,"101":"So, the test is essentially a validation of your existing knowledge, and you're demonstrating that you've got it down pat.","102":"That's a good point, but I think the key difference is that machines don't have the same kind of intuition or instincts that humans do, so even with a lot of examples, they might not be able to generalize as well.","103":"We're going to explore the fascinating world of neuroscience, where we'll delve into the intricate workings of the human brain, its neural connections, and how they impact our thoughts, emotions, and behaviors.","104":"So, what's really got you interested in this area of research?","105":"You could, for example, cause the device to run a slow math operation, but instead of waiting for it to finish, you could inject a fault at a specific point, like when it's about to authenticate, and then observe the device's behavior to see if it reveals any sensitive information.","106":"I mean, that's a really interesting application of directed energy, and it's great to see how it can be used in such a precise way to flip bits in flash memory.","107":"I think what's missing from the current approaches is a clear demonstration of how fault injection can be applied in practice. It's one thing to discuss the theoretical aspects, but showing concrete examples and making it hands-on would make a big difference in understanding and adoption.","108":"I think we'll see a shift towards more robust testing methods, like formal verification and fuzz testing. At the same time, as devices get more secure, attackers will find new ways to exploit them, like targeting the power side. It's a cat-and-mouse game, really.","109":"You know, the designers are often overconfident in their ability to anticipate and mitigate all potential side channels and attacks, which is not always the case.","110":"That's right, and what's really fascinating is how this intense gravity warps the fabric of space and time around the black hole, creating a kind of cosmic abyss that's almost impossible to comprehend.","111":"Just like a vacuum cleaner only pulls in air molecules that are close by, a black hole only pulls in matter that's near it, not the entire galaxy or universe.","112":null,"113":"That's correct, black holes are invisible because their gravity is so strong that not even light can escape, but we can see the effects they have on their surroundings, like how they bend light around them or affect the motion of nearby objects.","114":"I think it's a little bit of both, because on one hand, it's great that people can now build models and experiment with data and all that, but on the other hand, I think it's also led to a lot of people oversimplifying problems and not really understanding the underlying math and science behind it, which can lead to some pretty bad consequences. But I'm curious, what do you mean by 'bad consequences'? Can you give me an example?","115":"I think that's a great point, and one of the challenges we're facing in healthcare is getting all the different systems to talk to each other. It's like, every hospital and clinic has its own way of doing things, so it's really hard to get a clear picture of what's going on. And even when we do get the data, it's often in a format that's hard to work with.","116":"You have to consider the data and the model as a complex interplay where existing biases can be magnified, and it's crucial to be deliberate and proactive in addressing these issues through thoughtful design and deployment strategies.","117":"I see what you mean now. You're saying that technical skills alone aren't enough to ensure that the system is fair and unbiased. We need to consider the broader context and social implications of what we're building, and that's a really important shift for me to make as a programmer.","118":"I think we're seeing a lot of interest in industries like healthcare and finance, where data provenance is crucial. For example, in healthcare, being able to track the origin of medical data is essential for making accurate diagnoses and developing effective treatments. What do you think about the potential for data provenance to impact these industries in a positive way?","119":"I think you're spot on about the potential for machine learning in agriculture. It's an area that's really ripe for innovation, and I've been following some interesting projects that are using ML to optimize crop yields and reduce waste. But you're right, it's not just about throwing technology at the problem - we need to think about how to make it economically viable and sustainable in the long term.","120":"I think you're right to highlight the challenges we face, and I agree that there's a disconnect between academia and practical AI use. I've seen this firsthand in the way research is often focused on novelty over practical impact. To overcome these challenges, I believe we need to prioritize interdisciplinary collaboration and ensure that our research is driven by real-world needs. This might involve revisiting our educational approaches to better equip students with the skills and perspectives they need to tackle complex problems. I'm cautiously optimistic about the future, but I believe we must acknowledge and address these challenges head-on to make meaningful progress.","121":"Origami is a fascinating art form that has been a cornerstone of Japanese culture for centuries. Its intricate designs and precise folds have captivated people worldwide, and it's amazing to see how a simple sheet of paper can be transformed into a stunning work of art. What I find particularly intriguing is the connection between origami and mathematics, as the art form relies heavily on geometric principles and algorithms. Have you ever explored the mathematical side of origami, or would you like to learn more about it?","122":"If you want to create tessellations with a lot of visual interest, it's worth experimenting with different types of paper, such as textured papers or papers with subtle color gradients, as these can add depth and complexity to the patterns that emerge.","123":"Actually, they were folded, so it looks like they're separate pieces, but they're actually one continuous sheet of paper.","124":"That's a great start! Can you show me how you got from the dot to the fold? I'm curious to see the sequence of folds you used.","125":"Yes, every fold can be reversed. You can make a mountain fold into a valley fold, and vice versa.","126":"Let's focus on the basics. Can you tell me more about what you think is going on?","127":"I think that's a good point about the computer's limitations. But even if it can only ask yes or no questions, we can still program it to simulate complex processes. We've made progress in mimicking brain-like behavior with machines, and that's a promising area of research.","128":"Well, we use a variety of telescopes to observe black holes in different parts of the spectrum, like the Hubble Space Telescope and the Spitzer Space Telescope. One of the techniques we use is called microlensing, which helps us understand how black holes affect the stars and gas around them.","129":"So yes, you can get some information about the size and structure of the disk, as well as the temperature distribution of the dust, but not the spatial resolution of the disk itself, because the resolution is limited by the size of the telescope and the wavelength of the observation.","130":"We see the dust in the infrared, but since we're looking at it from one angle, we don't get a complete picture of where it is in 3D space. We're working on improving our understanding of the dust's structure.","131":"because it's so bright, it's like trying to spot a small flame in the middle of a very intense beam of light","132":"You say it's a problem of detection, that we just can't see them yet? Or is there a specific issue with the supernova remnants that makes it hard to detect black holes? I mean, are they just too small, or is there something else going on?","133":"That's an interesting point, but wouldn't the incredibly high temperatures and pressures during a supernova create some kind of outward force that might counteract the pull of the black hole?","134":"I think that's a really interesting question, and it's one we've been grappling with in our own work. We've found that deep learning can be incredibly powerful for certain types of tasks, but it can also be challenging to interpret the results. I'd love to hear more about how you're thinking about this trade-off and how you're approaching it in your own research.","135":"The model is essentially mimicking the symptoms of the problem rather than addressing its root causes. By doing so, it's not providing any meaningful insights or solutions, but rather perpetuating the status quo.","136":"I think that's a good point, and it's also why some people are trying to develop more transparent and interpretable models, so that we can better understand the reasoning behind a model's predictions or recommendations, even if we can't eliminate the risk of errors or biases entirely. Do you think that's a promising direction, or are there other approaches you'd like to see explored?","137":"Actually, that's a great point, and it's one of the biggest open questions in physics today. The reconciliation of quantum mechanics and general relativity is known as the quantum gravity problem, and it's a major area of research. Many theories have been proposed to address this issue, including loop quantum gravity, string theory, and Causal Dynamical Triangulation. Each of these approaches attempts to merge the principles of quantum mechanics with the geometric description of gravity provided by general relativity. However, a complete and consistent theory of quantum gravity remains an elusive goal, and much work is still needed to fully understand the nature of gravity at the smallest scales.","138":"You can just have the two states together as one state, which is the superposition of the two states, and that's the wave function, but I think I see what you're getting at - you want to combine the two states in a way that shows their relationship, like adding a plus sign between them, but that's actually a different concept, it's like a linear combination, not just a simple superposition.","139":"I think the wave function, or the multiverse, is a more fundamental concept than space-time, because it encompasses all possible realities, including our own, as a single, unified whole.","140":"So, in a way, Hawking's idea was that even though nothing can escape from a black hole, quantum mechanics says that particles can appear and disappear. He said that near the event horizon, these virtual particles can pop into existence, and one of them can end up on the outside, while the other gets sucked in. That outside particle takes some of the black hole's energy with it, which is what we call Hawking radiation. It's like the black hole is slowly losing mass over time, and eventually, it'll disappear completely.","141":"That's why it's called Hawking radiation, as it's a result of the black hole's energy being pulled out and emitted as particles, a key insight Hawking had.","142":"Actually, gravity plays a crucial role in the structural integrity of buildings and bridges. For instance, it influences the choice of materials, the shape and size of the structures, and even the way we distribute loads. In high-rise buildings, gravity affects the design of the foundation, the columns, and the beams, ensuring they can support the weight of the building and its occupants. Similarly, in bridges, gravity influences the design of the arches, the suspension cables, and the piers, which must be strong enough to withstand the weight of the traffic and the environmental loads. Furthermore, gravity also affects the way we design the drainage systems, the ventilation systems, and the electrical systems, as all these systems must be able to handle the weight and the pressure of the building or the bridge. So, gravity is not just a passive force; it's an active participant in the design process, shaping the very fabric of our built environment.","143":"Your revised turn of the conversation","144":"Isn't the holographic principle actually a fundamental concept that connects the information contained in the surface of a black hole to the information contained in the volume of spacetime, and isn't this connection a key insight that relates to the theory of gravity in more than four dimensions?","145":"That's a mind-bending idea, isn't it? If we're in a universe that's finite but unbounded, it raises questions about how we can ever truly know when we've reached a limit.","146":"I think you're trying to say that these two theories are related, but it's not clear how you're making that connection.","147":"I've always been fascinated by origami - I've tried making a few simple designs, but I've never mastered the art of creating a perfect crane.","148":"I've been fascinated by origami for a while now. I've tried making some simple designs, but I'm not very good at it yet.","149":"I remember making paper cranes with my mom when I was a kid, and I've always been fascinated by the story behind the origami crane - isn't it that it's supposed to bring good luck and long life?","150":"So it's trying to make a triangle, but we want to help it by keeping the edges aligned and the corners crisp, so it folds smoothly and makes a nice, sharp triangle.","151":"Great job! Now let's move on to the next step.","152":"I've heard of cootie catchers, but I've never actually made one. What makes this design so special?","153":"You're suggesting that blockchain technology could help create a more decentralized and efficient energy network, where power is distributed more locally and can be shared among neighbors, reducing the reliance on traditional centralized power plants.","154":"It's still in the early stages of widespread adoption and integration into different sectors and applications. That's why you haven't seen significant changes yet.","155":"What do you think is the biggest challenge in distinguishing between what's working and what's not in this field?","156":"It's based on trust, but what if we don't want to put our trust in institutions like banks and governments anymore? What if we want to build a system where we can trust each other directly?","157":"I think we're setting the bar pretty high for blockchain, aren't we? It's like we're expecting it to be flawless, just like self-driving cars. We're holding it to a standard that's hard to achieve, even in theory.","158":"Actually, hacking can also involve identifying and exploiting vulnerabilities in a system or network to gain access, which can sometimes be done for legitimate purposes like security research or penetration testing.","159":"They create barriers like firewalls or intrusion detection systems to prevent the bad hackers from getting in.","160":"They'd probably get in touch with the company to get the lock fixed or replaced, so it's secure again.","161":"I see what you mean, but isn't it also possible that the new lock is designed to prevent mistaken identity situations like that? Maybe it's not just a matter of risk, but also of security features being implemented to protect the user.","162":"That's so cool! What kind of hacking did you do when you were nine?","163":"I can see how you'd think that, but I was really just trying to make the game more interesting for myself and my friends. We were all bored with the default settings, and I wanted to see what else we could do with it. I started looking up tutorials online and learning about the game's code, and it was actually really cool to see how it all worked.","164":"I think so. I've been thinking about it a lot and I've been trying to come up with ways to make it more appealing to a wider audience.","165":"Nanotechnology may seem like something out of a sci-fi movie, but it's actually all around us, even in products we use every day. Take sunscreens, for instance \u2013 they often contain microscopic particles that help shield our skin from the sun's damaging rays.","166":"I'm not sure, but it looks like some kind of tiny circuit board or chip?","167":"I'd love to dive deeper into the physics behind it. Can you explain how the electric field and voltage interact with the transistor's structure to control the flow of current? For example, how does the voltage applied to the gate terminal influence the channel's conductivity?","168":"You can make them smaller and more efficient by shrinking the size of the transistors, which allows more to be packed onto a chip.","169":"They use massive machines that can precision-etch and deposit materials at the nanoscale, kind of like a super-accurate 3D printer, but instead of printing plastic or metal, they're building the tiny transistors and circuits that power your devices. It's a mind-bending process that requires incredible precision and control, but it's what allows us to create the tiny marvels that fit inside your smartphone.","170":"Exactly! And sometimes we use money to trade for things we want, but with blockchain, it's a bit more complex. We use something called cryptocurrency, like Bitcoin, which is a digital token that allows for secure, transparent, and decentralized transactions.","171":"That's an interesting approach. What's something that you feel you could live without, but would still be willing to trade with someone else?","172":"Well, computer hacking refers to the act of accessing or manipulating computer systems, networks, or data without authorization. It can be done for various reasons, including financial gain, espionage, or simply to cause chaos. Some hackers are malicious, while others are white-hat hackers who use their skills for security testing and improvement.","173":"Actually, that's a good start, Linda. But I think we can be more specific. The space bar is an example of a keyboard input, and a mouse is an example of a pointing device input. A microphone is an example of an input that captures audio. But we can also think about other types of inputs, like a touchscreen or a game controller. What do you think? Can you think of any other types of inputs that a computer might have?","174":"Your username, password, and other login credentials, such as two-factor authentication codes, are common inputs that attackers might try to exploit to gain unauthorized access to a system or network.","175":"Well, I'm trying to understand how long it takes to get into a system, but you're talking about the time it takes for a computer to cool down after it's been shut off. I think there's a bit of a misunderstanding here. Can you clarify what you're asking about?","176":"That's a great analogy, but with a rocket, the force is applied continuously, not just in a short burst, which is why it can achieve such high speeds.","177":"Well, it's still falling, but it's falling so fast that it never actually gets any closer to the Earth. To be more precise, it's constantly falling towards the Earth, but the curvature of the Earth means that the point it's falling towards is always moving away from it. So it's in a state of continuous free fall, but its orbit keeps it at a stable distance from the Earth.","178":"I think it's similar to that ride where you feel weightless because of the G-Force. The Earth's gravity is pulling them down, but their speed is strong enough to keep them in orbit, so it feels like they're not being pulled down.","179":"It makes sense that you wouldn't be able to tell the difference between the two, because gravity is equivalent to that acceleration.","180":"I know, right? It's like, our brains are tricked into thinking we're stationary because we're not feeling the motion, but really we're moving really fast. That's actually kind of similar to what happens when you're on a train, and it's also related to how we experience gravity - it feels like it's pulling us down, but really it's just the Earth's mass warping the fabric of space around us, which is what Einstein said.","181":"That's a great point, but I think you're getting a bit off track. We were talking about how motion is relative, not about the Earth's motion around the Sun. Let's get back to that. If you were on the train, and you threw a ball straight up, it would still land in your hand, because the train's motion is smooth and there's no way to tell you're moving at high speed. We were exploring the idea that, from a certain perspective, motion can be meaningless. ","182":"It warps the fabric of space and time, and that's what we feel as gravity.","183":"But that's not what's happening, is it? If Marina is racing towards the flash of light, the light pulse would appear to be coming from where she is, but that means we'd have to be moving towards each other at the same speed as the light, which doesn't make sense because we're not accelerating to that speed. So, what's actually happening is that the light is still traveling at 300,000 kilometers per second, and Marina is just seeing it from a different perspective.","184":null,"185":"That's fascinating! But what's the most surprising benefit you've found from using them?","186":"It's a bit different from how we recharge, actually. When a giraffe snoozes, it'll often rest its head on its hindquarters, or even just lean against a tree to keep its neck in a safe position. That way, it can get some shut-eye without worrying about getting its brain bashed in by a predator.","187":"I can totally relate to feeling exhausted. What was the most draining part of your day that left you feeling so tired?","188":"That's fascinating. How does this special valve work, and what's the purpose of it being so buoyant, exactly?","189":"Imagine being able to recharge like a superhero, and wake up feeling refreshed and ready to take on the world!","190":"That's so cool! I've always wondered how dolphins can sleep with half their brain awake. How does that even work? Do they have some sort of internal alarm system to make sure they stay safe while they're resting?","191":"I think I know what you mean by that. You're saying that dolphins have to be able to rest while still being able to come up for air, right? So, they've developed this unique way of sleeping, where they can shut down one half of their brain, but keep the other half awake and alert, so they can still swim and breathe. It's like they're in a state of'sleep-wake' or something, where they can rest but still be ready to respond to their environment. And that's what you meant by unihemispheric slow-wave sleep, right?","192":"Actually, I think I have. I remember learning about it in school. It's a field of science that deals with the manipulation of matter on a very small scale, typically on the order of nanometers. We're talking about things that are incredibly tiny, like individual atoms and molecules. I'm not sure how much I remember, but I think it has some pretty cool applications, like in medicine and electronics.","193":"Actually, I think it's a dust speck. You can see it if the sun is shining through a window and the air is really still.","194":"That's right, we're talking about incredibly small scales. A nanometer is a billionth of a meter, so it's one thousandth of a millimeter. To put it into perspective, if we were to line up a billion nanometers end to end, they would be just one meter long.","195":"Exactly, and that's a great example of how atoms are the building blocks of everything around us. But what's interesting is that when we get to the size of a nanometer, we're not just seeing how atoms are arranged, but also how they interact with each other at a scale that's relevant to their properties and behavior. That's why nanotechnology is so fascinating \u2013 it allows us to understand and manipulate these interactions in ways that can lead to new discoveries and innovations.","196":"Wow, that sounds like something out of a sci-fi movie! How does this microscope actually work, and what kind of things could you build with it?","197":"I study things that are really small because I want to learn about the tiny building blocks of everything around us. Like, did you know that everything is made up of tiny atoms and molecules? It's pretty cool!","198":"That's right, by tracking the user's movements, we can create a more realistic and interactive experience. It's like being inside the virtual world, rather than just looking at it from the outside.","199":"I think what's happening with virtual reality right now is we're seeing people take it out of the lab and into the real world, making it accessible to a wider audience, and that's where the real potential is \u2013 in making the mundane, like grocery shopping or a doctor's appointment, into something that's actually enjoyable.","200":"I think you're highlighting some of the key areas where we're making progress, like audio and spatial orientation. I've seen those demos too, and it's impressive how they can create a sense of immersion without requiring a huge amount of resources. But I still think that haptics is a tougher nut to crack, and I'm not sure we're making as much progress there as we are in other areas.","201":"I think that's a key challenge, because while the visuals can be really impressive, the audio is what immerses you in the experience. If it's not done well, it can be a major letdown.","202":"If you're on the surface of the Earth, the gravitational force is strong because you're close to it. But if you were to travel to the moon, the force would be much weaker due to the greater distance.","203":"You'd experience a state of zero-gravity, akin to floating in a spacecraft, as the elevator's descent would render the sensation of weightlessness.","204":"Actually, I was reading about this and it seems that the more massive an object is, the more it warps spacetime around it. Does that mean that objects with different masses would have different curvatures of spacetime?","205":"Actually, I think I see what you mean. If you threw a ball straight up on Earth, it would initially move upwards, but then it would start to fall back down due to the Earth's gravity. The Earth's gravity is what keeps the ball on the ground, and it's what pulls everything towards it with a force proportional to their mass. So, the ball's mass and the Earth's mass are what determine how strongly the Earth's gravity pulls it down.","206":"I mean, we're living on a planet that's just floating in space, and we're all stuck to it, but what's even more mind-blowing is the complexity and scale of our universe, with billions of galaxies and stars, and yet, we're still trying to wrap our heads around the basics of how it all works.","207":"So, you're familiar with the concept, but you're not entirely clear on it. Let's break it down \u2013 extra dimensions are essentially hypothetical spatial dimensions beyond the three we're familiar with: length, width, and depth. They're often visualized as a fourth dimension, where every point in space has a coordinate that represents time as well as the traditional three dimensions. Think of it like a graph where each point has an x, y, and z coordinate, but also a t coordinate for time. It's a mind-bending idea, but it's a key concept in theoretical physics and mathematics.","208":"It's more about perspective, like looking at a city on a map versus actually walking through it. You'd see the same streets and buildings, but the experience would be totally different.","209":"So string theory tries to bridge the gap between quantum mechanics and general relativity. The issue is that quantum mechanics works well at the tiny scale, while general relativity works well at the large scale. To merge these two theories, string theory proposes that the fundamental units of the universe aren't particles, but tiny, vibrating strings. These strings can vibrate at different frequencies, giving rise to the various particles we observe. However, to make this work, string theory requires the existence of more than the three dimensions we're familiar with \u2013 specifically, six additional dimensions that are compactified or curled up so tightly that they're not directly observable.","210":"So, string theory proposes that the fundamental building blocks of the universe are actually tiny, vibrating strings, which would explain why particles can have different properties and behaviors, right?","211":"I'm not sure, but we could try to figure it out together.","212":"Exactly, and just like how a string has a fundamental frequency, a drumhead also has its own unique pitch, depending on how it's tuned and what kind of vibrations it's producing.","213":"Well, in string theory, the vibrations of the strings correspond to different particles, and the properties of the particles, like mass and charge, are determined by the mode of vibration. For example, a string vibrating in a certain mode might correspond to a particle with a certain mass, while a string vibrating in a different mode might correspond to a particle with a different mass.","214":"String theory is a more specific attempt to unify the strong and weak nuclear forces with electromagnetism and gravity, and it's often considered a possible framework for the Grand Unified Theory, but it's not the same thing. The Grand Unified Theory is more of a historical term that refers to the original attempts to unify the strong and weak nuclear forces with electromagnetism, whereas string theory is a more modern and comprehensive attempt to unify all fundamental forces, including gravity.","215":"And, in fact, one of the key predictions of string theory is that it unifies these fundamental forces in a way that's consistent with the Grand Unified Theory, but also goes beyond it by incorporating gravity and providing a more complete and consistent description of the universe.","216":"Well, that's a great way to describe it, but it's easy to get confused. People often think of these extra dimensions as being similar to the three we experience in everyday life, like up and down, left and right, and forward and backward. But they're actually much more abstract and hard to visualize. They're more like concepts that we can understand with our minds, rather than physical spaces that we can see or touch.","217":"That's right. And because it's decentralized, it's also transparent. Anyone can see the entire history of transactions on the blockchain, which helps to build trust in the system.","218":"And it's not just any machines, it's machines that can learn from data, process complex transactions, and adapt to changing network conditions, making them increasingly autonomous and powerful.","219":"One way to balance trust issues with the benefits of blockchain is to focus on the security measures that can be put in place to protect users and their assets. This could include implementing robust protocols for transactions and data storage, as well as educating users about the risks and benefits of using blockchain technology.","220":"Let me break it down for you: when we discover new nanomaterials with unique properties, we need to figure out how to incorporate them into the battery design without compromising its overall performance. This often involves a delicate balance between cost, safety, and functionality. For instance, if a new material has excellent conductivity, we might prioritize its use in the anode or cathode, but we also need to consider the added cost of sourcing and processing that material. Similarly, if a material has enhanced safety features, we might need to redesign the battery's internal architecture to accommodate those features, which can affect its overall size and weight. So, it's a constant trade-off between pushing the boundaries of what's possible with these new materials and staying within the constraints of cost, safety, and practicality.","221":"One of the challenges we face is that the variations in material properties due to production conditions can make it difficult to predict how they will perform in a battery. This means we need to find ways to control and optimize these variations to ensure consistent battery performance, which is a significant challenge in the field.","222":"I'm Robert Lang, a physicist and engineer who's been fascinated by origami for decades and has written extensively about its mathematical underpinnings.","223":"Because origami involves creating a 3D shape from a 2D sheet, it's well-suited for products that need to be compact and then expand into a usable form.","224":"And that's actually one of the challenges of using origami in this context, because origami structures are typically designed to be rigid when folded, but when you scale them up, they can lose that rigidity and become floppy.","225":"And it's also got the ability to be mixed with other materials, like carbon fiber or glass fiber, to create an even stronger and lighter material. This is called a composite material, and it's used in all sorts of things, from sports equipment to car parts.","226":"Actually, I think one of the most promising areas of research right now is origami-inspired robotics. Scientists are exploring ways to create robots that can fold themselves up and then deploy in challenging environments, such as search and rescue missions or space exploration. The idea is that these robots could be launched into space, fold up into a compact shape, and then unfold and start working when they reach their destination. It's a really exciting field with a lot of potential.","227":"It's a way for people to securely store and verify transactions without needing a central authority, kind of like a digital ledger.","228":"Exactly, it's eliminating the need for intermediaries like banks, payment processors, and other third-party services that traditionally take a fee for facilitating transactions. Instead, this technology allows for peer-to-peer transactions, cutting out the middlemen and reducing costs for all parties involved.","229":"I heard that your study is looking at how sleep deprivation affects their brain development. Can you tell me more about it?","230":"Can you elaborate on the specific circadian abnormalities you've seen in transgenic models of AD, and how those might relate to the sleep disturbances observed in humans?","231":"So, the sleep changes observed in these mice models also occur in the mice with beta-amyloid pathology, but not tau, which suggests a link between sleep and beta-amyloid.","232":"You mean like origami? How do you make a crane from a single square of paper?","233":"You can fold it in half, then fold it into a smaller triangle, and then you can make a point out of it by folding it in a way that creates a sharp edge.","234":"Now, can you see how the fifth circle is actually an extension of the fourth circle, rather than a separate part?","235":"Let\u2019s begin with the fundamentals. I\u2019d love to hear what you know about origami, and we can build from there.","236":"Let's break it down step by step. First, we'd need to identify a virus that's capable of producing the specific materials we're interested in, like carbon nanotubes for a solar cell. Then, we'd have to engineer the virus to produce those materials at a scale that's useful for our application. That's where the real challenge comes in \u2013 we'd need to figure out how to control the virus's growth and production to get the desired outcome. It's like trying to build a factory with a tiny, unpredictable workforce. We'd also have to deal with the issue of specificity \u2013 how do we ensure that the virus only produces the materials we want, and not some other compound that's not useful for our purpose? And finally, we'd need to integrate the virus with other components to create a functional device. It's a complex puzzle, but if we can crack it, the potential rewards are huge.","237":"And then we can actually control the size and shape of the nanostructure by tweaking the length of the DNA we insert and by controlling how many times the virus replicates. For instance, if we want to build a nanostructure that's 100 nanometers long, we can insert a piece of DNA that's 100 nanometers long, and then we can control the number of virus replications to get the desired size. Plus, we can shape the nanostructure by playing with the arrangement of the proteins on the virus surface. If we want a specific shape, we can add a DNA piece that codes for a protein that binds to a molecule that helps shape the nanostructure. We can then use the virus to build the nanostructure, harvest it, and use it in various applications.","238":"I agree, and it's interesting to note that this shift towards sustainability is not only driven by environmental concerns, but also by economic and social factors, such as the rising cost of raw materials and the growing demand for green technologies.","239":"By doing that, we can pack more functionality into a smaller space, which is a major advantage in spacecraft engineering.","240":"I'm really fascinated by how origami can be used in space exploration - the idea that we can take something that's compact and then have it unfold in a precise way is just amazing. Can you tell me more about the specific challenges that origami solves for space missions?","241":"Now, let's take the first rectangle and fold it over along this line, and then take the second rectangle and fold it over along that line, to show how each fold contributes to the overall rigidity of the shape as we continue the process.","242":null,"243":"So how do the panels unfold and lock into place?","244":"because the conditions are different, which makes it challenging to find a common ground for comparison.","245":"between compactness and the rate of opening, and also how easily they can be adjusted to accommodate different design requirements.","246":"Minecraft is a perfect illustration of how immersive virtual reality can be, right? I mean, who needs to be on top of a mountain or in a dungeon when you can explore the blocky wonders of Minecraft?","247":"I think that's a great point, though. The glasses in 3D movies can create a sense of immersion, but it's still a trick of the mind. We're not actually seeing the scene in front of us, but rather a manipulated image. It's similar to what we were discussing earlier about how our brains can be fooled by static images on a screen. I'm curious, did you find yourself wondering if the 3D effect was just a clever illusion, or did you feel like you were actually seeing something real?","248":"That's a fascinating topic. To dive deeper, let's explore how chord progressions can either support or contrast with a melody, creating a sense of tension and resolution. For instance, a melody that follows a predictable chord progression can create a sense of familiarity, whereas a melody that deviates from the expected progression can add surprise and interest. This interplay between chord progressions and melody is a key aspect of harmony, and understanding it can help you write more engaging and effective music.","249":"The circle of fifths is a tool that helps you navigate the relationships between chords and keys. It's a circular diagram that shows how chords are related to each other through perfect fifths. For instance, if you're in the key of C major, you can move to the key of G major by going up a perfect fifth, and then from G major to D major, and so on. But what I was trying to say is that the circle of fifths isn't directly about harmonies, it's more about understanding how chords fit into keys. It can help you make informed decisions about which chords to use and how to move between keys, which can in turn help you create harmonies that sound cohesive and connected.","250":"So you're saying that 'G' represents a specific entity or concept within this framework, right? Can you tell me more about what that entity does or how it's related to the other components?","251":"So, let's try using the B flat major chord, which consists of the notes B flat, D flat, and F. What do you think about the emotional connotation of this chord, and how might it be used in a musical composition to evoke a particular mood?","252":"Actually, I think I have a basic idea. I've heard of dimensions in the context of space and time. Is that what you're referring to? I'd love to learn more about it.","253":"I'd say that's a good point. A line is one dimensional, but it's embedded within a two dimensional plane, and that plane is, in turn, embedded within a three dimensional space.","254":"because my face is angled in that direction","255":"So, we've got a single unit with a value of one. Imagine having just one apple \u2013 we can count that one apple, and that's the essence of it.","256":"I see, so in one dimension, we only need a single number to pinpoint our location, but in three dimensions, we need to use multiple points to capture the shape of an object like a sphere. That's a big difference. Can you think of any other shapes that would require more than one point to define in three dimensions?","257":"I'm not sure what you're referring to, could you clarify what specific topic or concept you'd like me to explain?","258":"we have no idea what they're like, how many there are, or even if they're still active today, which is pretty mind-boggling when you think about it.","259":"People would try to grasp what those extra dimensions are and how they would affect our understanding of the universe.","260":"I'm sure it is. Machine learning plays a huge role in Gmail's functionality, especially in filtering out spam emails. But what's interesting is that it's not just about classifying emails as spam or not. It's also about understanding the context and nuances of each email, like the sender's relationship with the recipient, the content of the email, and even the time of day it was sent. This requires a more sophisticated approach to machine learning, one that goes beyond just supervised learning. It's an area where deep learning and natural language processing come into play, allowing Gmail to make more accurate predictions and provide a better user experience.","261":"I'd also look at the content and structure of the email. For example, is it asking me to take an action or is it just a greeting?","262":"Exactly, and I think that's where the machine learning part gets really interesting, because the neural network can learn to identify patterns in the data that we wouldn't even think to look for. Can you tell me more about what you're thinking when you say 'the machine itself could learn'?","263":"In supervised learning, we're often using algorithms like decision trees, random forests, and support vector machines, which are all about trying to find the best set of features that can distinguish between classes. In contrast, unsupervised learning algorithms like k-means clustering and hierarchical clustering are designed to find patterns and structures in the data without any prior knowledge of the classes or labels. This is particularly useful when the data doesn't have clear boundaries or categories, and we want to uncover underlying relationships and groupings that aren't immediately apparent. For example, in customer segmentation, k-means clustering can help identify distinct customer groups based on their behavior and preferences, even if we don't have explicit labels for these groups.","264":"I think reinforcement learning is actually more similar to the kitchen sink approach, but in a different way. While the kitchen sink approach involves trying a lot of different techniques and seeing what works, reinforcement learning is more about experimenting with different actions in a specific environment to see what leads to the best outcome. It's a more targeted approach, but still involves a lot of trial and error.","265":"When you have a lot of data, a deep learning algorithm might be a better choice because it can leverage the abundance of data to learn intricate relationships and nuanced patterns, whereas reinforcement learning algorithms are often more suitable when data is scarce and the system must rely on trial and error to adapt and improve.","266":"If you choose the wrong approach, you might end up with a system that works well on the data it's been trained on, but struggles to generalize to new situations, which can be a big problem in real-world applications.","267":"I think that's a perfect example. A model can be great at predicting something, but if it doesn't offer any insights into what's driving that prediction, it's essentially useless. In this case, the model was accurate, but it didn't provide any guidance on how to address the issue, so it wasn't actionable.","268":"Another way to improve machine learning algorithms is to incorporate domain knowledge and expert feedback into the model, which can help to identify and address domain-specific issues and improve the overall accuracy and reliability of the model.","269":"I mean, if you just focus on the wiring diagram, you're missing the critical components that make the brain function, like the strength and timing of neural connections, the role of glial cells in supporting neurons, and the complex interactions between neurons, glial cells, and the environment.","270":"I think that's a great point, and it highlights how our brain's ability to recognize music is deeply rooted in our personal experiences and associations. This is actually one of the reasons why music can be so evocative and powerful \u2013 it taps into our existing knowledge and emotions.","271":"I was wondering, do you think the connection between the brain and the muscles plays a role in the learning process of music?","272":"Hi, good to see you too. I've been meaning to ask you more about your current projects, actually.","273":"I remember some of the projects we worked on together, especially the one where we had to think outside the box and come up with innovative solutions to a complex problem. That was a real challenge, but it was also a great learning experience for me. What do you think was the most significant outcome of that project?","274":"We can then see the Schwinger limit being approached, and that's a very interesting result.","275":"And actually, I think it's more intuitive to just calculate the energy directly in our own frame, since we're not actually moving that fast relative to each other.","276":"That's where the phase-locking challenge comes in \u2013 it's a notoriously tricky problem. To overcome it, you need to synchronize the phases of all these disparate lasers, which are operating independently, and then stabilize them so that their phases remain aligned as they pass through the complex optical system.","277":"I think we're underestimating the complexity of the challenge, though. The beam quality, the aperture size, the phase locking \u2013 all these factors will come into play. We'll need to carefully consider how they interact with each other and with the laser's characteristics. It's not just a matter of scaling up the technology, but also understanding how it will behave in this specific context.","278":"Actually, I think you might be thinking of Home Depot. Their breach in 2014 was one of the largest point-of-sale breaches in history, affecting over 40 million customers.","279":"the deli scale was connected to the internal network and had a default password that was never changed.","280":"So, what would happen to the program after it encounters a segmentation fault?","281":"Well, when you're dealing with buffer overflows in network security, you're essentially looking at how an attacker can manipulate memory to execute malicious code. This is exactly what we were discussing earlier, where the return address gets overwritten and the code gets executed. So, in the context of network security, buffer overflows can be used to inject malicious code into a system, which can lead to privilege escalation or even remote code execution. As a penetration tester, understanding how buffer overflows work is crucial in identifying vulnerabilities and designing software that's resistant to such attacks.","282":"I'm intrigued by the intersection of geopolitics and cybersecurity, especially how nations use technology to gain an advantage over each other. It's a delicate balance between security and surveillance, and I think computer science and information security play a critical role in understanding and addressing these issues.","283":"What's striking is that this dichotomy within the US government reflects the broader tension between promoting global internet freedom and maintaining national security interests. It underscores the need for a nuanced approach that weighs the benefits of open access against the potential risks of unregulated online activity.","284":"What's the most interesting thing you've learned about lasers recently?","285":"That's right! And because of that, we can make the laser beam really tiny and precise, so we can point it at a specific spot, like that dot on the wall.","286":"That's what makes it so special, right? It's like a secret treasure that only a few people get to see.","287":"And that's why lasers are so useful for things like inspecting hard-to-reach spaces or precision applications, right?","288":"I mean, think about it, this laser is basically a super powerful tool that can precision-cut through all sorts of materials, from metals to woods to even some types of plastics, it's pretty mind-blowing when you think about it.","289":"It's a safety feature to alert you when the system is about to shut down or when there's a critical issue with the process.","290":"That's amazing! Did you know that the technology behind shooting stars and laser beams is somewhat similar? It involves the interaction of light with the atmosphere.","291":"Actually, I'd be happy to help you get started. The Rowhammer paper is a great place to begin, but if you're looking for something more concrete, I'd recommend checking out the work by the Rowhammer team on GitHub. They have a lot of resources and tools available that can help you understand the basics of side channel analysis and how to apply it in practice. Additionally, have you considered looking into the more recent work on cache side channel attacks, such as the work by Bernstein and Osvik? It's a bit more advanced, but it could be a good next step if you're looking to dive deeper into the topic.","292":"The Rowhammer attack exploits a vulnerability in memory devices, where repeatedly accessing a row of memory can cause adjacent rows to become unstable and flip their bits, allowing an attacker to modify sensitive data.","293":"I completely agree with you, and it's not just about the vehicle itself, but also about the principle of ownership and the right to inspect and maintain one's own property.","294":"Actually, I'm not too familiar with blockchain, but I've heard it's a complex system. I think eBay's guarantees are what make me feel secure about trading on their platform.","295":"That's right, and it cuts out a lot of the costs associated with those middlemen, like bank fees.","296":"So, it's like a digital record book that keeps track of all the trades, and because it's maintained by many computers working together, it's very hard to cheat or alter the record. That way, we can trust that the trades are happening as agreed upon, without needing all those middlemen.","297":"So, think of it like a digital checkbook that all the nodes on the network have access to. If someone tries to make a fake transaction, the other nodes will catch it and reject it, keeping the data secure.","298":"Actually, I'm the one who taught the laser physics course this semester. I'm interested in doing research with lasers, so I've been taking a few electives in the physics department.","299":"That's really cool that you enjoy the math side of physics. Lasers actually involve a lot of complex calculations, especially when it comes to designing the resonant cavities and beam propagation. We'll definitely get into some of those calculations in the course, and I think you'll find them really interesting.","300":"So it's a technique that actually stretches out the laser pulse, amplifies it, and then compresses it back down to its original duration, allowing us to create high-energy, short-pulse lasers that can manipulate and even disrupt atoms, which is really cool!","301":"Yes, the fundamental idea remains the same. The laser hammer is still a concentrated beam of light that can dislodge electrons from atoms, but the way we achieve that concentration is different in the chirped pulse amplification method.","302":"the pendant is a device that helps to stabilize the laser, think of it like a governor on a car engine, it regulates the power to keep the laser stable and consistent, allowing the mode locker to do its job effectively.","303":"The professor is breaking down the harmony of the hymn, showing how it's built from the F major triad, a fundamental concept in music theory.","304":"Actually, since F is the note F, it's the dominant note of the key of C major. When we're in the key of C major, the dominant note is the note that creates tension and leads the listener's ear to the tonic note, which is C. In the key of C major, the dominant note is F, so F is like the note that's 'pulling' us towards the tonic note C.","305":"You're a chord master, but I have to ask, what's the most interesting or unique chord progression you've ever come across?","306":"You could also explore using dissonant chords like the diminished seventh or augmented sixth to create tension and contrast, which can add depth and complexity to your music.","307":"Exactly, and I think that's what makes this song so iconic - it's not just a happy, upbeat tune, but a nuanced exploration of emotions that resonates with listeners on a deeper level.","308":"You're suggesting that the F major chord has a similar harmonic function to the A major chord, but with a different emotional connotation, rather than a literal shadow.","309":"Think of your brain as a complex network of pathways, kind of like a city's roads and highways. The connectome is like a detailed blueprint of all those pathways, showing how they're connected and how they help us think, learn, and remember things.","310":"If we could transfer the brain's connections and processes into a computer, the question is whether the digital version of me would still be me, or if it would be a fundamentally different entity. And that raises another question: would the experiences and memories that make me who I am be preserved in the digital copy, or would they be lost in the process of translation?","311":"Actually, the connectome is a comprehensive map of the neural connections in the brain, which can reveal patterns and relationships between different brain regions and their corresponding functions, but it's still a relatively static representation, whereas the dynamic interactions between neurons over time are what we're trying to understand through techniques like functional connectivity and neuroimaging.","312":"What if the complexity of the connectome lies not in the individual components, but in the emergent properties that arise from their interactions? How might we distinguish between a mere map of neural connections and the dynamic, adaptive processes that underlie human experience?","313":"I'll give you a simple example. Suppose we want to prove that a particular number, let's say 17, is a prime number. We can use a zero-knowledge proof to convince someone that 17 is indeed prime without revealing the actual proof or the method used to prove it. Does that make sense?","314":"That's exactly right! A zero-knowledge proof is a way to verify that you know something without revealing what that something is. It's like a secret handshake, where you can prove that you know the combination without actually giving away the combination itself. The key idea is that you're not just proving that you know something, but you're also proving that you know it in a way that's unique to you. It's a bit like a digital fingerprint, where you can verify that someone is who they claim to be without giving away any identifying information. Does that make sense?","315":"So, how's life been treating you lately?","316":"You're saying that I can use some kind of evidence or proof to show that what I'm saying is true, without actually having to reveal the underlying facts?","317":"That's a beautiful memory. Can you tell me more about what it was like to see the impact of your aunt's illness on your family, and how it influenced your desire to pursue a career in science?","318":"I think that's one of the most fascinating aspects of memory \u2013 how something that's so fundamental to our existence can also be so fragile, and what I find particularly intriguing is the interplay between the neural mechanisms that underlie memory formation and the impact of neurodegenerative diseases on these processes, which can lead to the loss of memories and the erosion of personal identity.","319":"When we look at the connections between brain regions, we do see differences between implicit and explicit memories. For example, when people are learning a new skill, like mirror tracing, we see more activity in the striatum and less in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex. In contrast, when people are forming an episodic memory, like recalling a recent event, we see more activity in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex. This suggests that different memory systems are indeed connected and work together to support different types of memory, but with different patterns of brain activity.","320":"That's really interesting, especially how you mentioned small problems can be big and complicated. Can you give me an example of a particularly challenging math problem you've worked on?","321":"That's the beauty of secrets, isn't it? They're like puzzles, and you have to piece together the clues to figure out the truth. So, I'm curious, what makes you think I'm not telling you the truth?","322":"Exactly, you're seeing the puffin, but you still have no idea how I managed to get it in front of you without giving away its actual location, do you?","323":"Because zero-knowledge proof can be used to protect people's privacy and security, especially in situations where sensitive information is involved, like online transactions or medical records. It's a powerful tool in cryptography that allows us to have a sense of trust without revealing too much.","324":"They could verify your identity without snooping on your activities.","325":"I mean, think about it - the number line is just a human construct, a way to understand and describe the infinite. But what about the infinite in nature, like the stars in the universe? Or the fractals that repeat infinitely in a snowflake? That's what I find really mind-blowing.","326":"So, what does this mean about the hotel's capacity?","327":"Exactly, but what if they're in a crisis situation and they need a place to stay temporarily, how would we accommodate them in our hotel?","328":"and so on, following a clear and predictable sequence, where each guest is moved to a room that is two positions ahead of their original room, effectively creating a new space and maintaining the pattern of movement.","329":"Infinity, for me, is more about the idea that there's no end to something, rather than a specific number. It's a mind-bending concept, but once you get the hang of it, it's actually really fascinating and has a lot of interesting implications.","330":"It's a concept that suggests advanced AI will either excel in solving complex problems or struggle with simple ones, often referred to as the 'intelligence explosion' or'singularity'.","331":"I'd say it's more about planning and decision-making, like figuring out the best course of action given all the variables and potential outcomes, rather than just navigating physical space.","332":"I think we're limited more by the complexity of the tasks and the difficulty of collecting data that's both relevant and useful for learning. For instance, collecting data on a robot tying its shoe isn't just about capturing a video of the task. It's also about ensuring that the robot can perform the task in a way that's comparable to a human, and that the data is collected in a way that captures the nuances of the task. One potential approach to accelerating data collection is to focus on tasks that are more easily replicable and observable, such as assembly or pick-and-place tasks, where the data can be more easily collected and annotated. Additionally, we could explore using simulations or virtual environments to collect data, which could help us to generate more diverse and controlled datasets.","333":"Well, in the context of accelerating data collection, reinforcement learning can be particularly useful. For instance, we can design a reward system that encourages the robot to explore new environments and collect data in areas that are difficult for humans to access. This can help overcome the challenges of Moravec's paradox by allowing the robot to learn from its own experiences and adapt to new situations. Imitation learning can also be applied to teach robots to mimic human behavior in data collection tasks, such as following specific protocols or using specialized equipment. And while supervised learning is typically used for tasks with clear labels, we can also use it to pre-train the robot on basic data collection skills before moving on to more complex tasks.","334":"I think that's a great connection to make, but let's explore why three is a significant number in the context of fractals, like the Sierpinski triangle, and how it relates to the other numbers we were discussing.","335":"I'm not sure I agree with that - I think we're getting a bit sidetracked by the physical properties of the paper. Can you help me understand why you think it's three dimensional, given that it's still just a flat sheet of paper when we uncrumple it?","336":"If I cut it in half again, you'll need only two boxes, because we've already established that two boxes are needed to cover the line, and cutting it in half again doesn't change the total number of boxes required.","337":"That's because fractals, like the coastline of Great Britain, have a repeating pattern at different scales, which makes them harder to measure precisely. As you zoom in, the same shapes keep appearing, so you need more boxes to cover the same amount of coastline.","338":"So, the box counting method helps us see how the coastline is made up of smaller versions of itself, which is what gives it that fractal quality. It's like looking at a big picture and then zooming in to see the same patterns repeating themselves over and over again.","339":"Yes, fractals have many interesting applications, such as modeling complex systems, simulating real-world phenomena, and generating aesthetically pleasing patterns.","340":"I think you're referring to Ken Perlin's work on noise functions, which is a great example of procedural texture synthesis. His noise functions helped create more realistic and detailed environments in computer graphics.","341":"like balancing these cups - it's easy for you because you can feel the weight and adjust naturally, but it's challenging for a robot because it needs precise control to prevent the cups from falling.","342":"and then pick up the block with the robot","343":"because it was already facing us, so it could just follow the arm to get to the spot.","344":"Well, I'm not sure what it's thinking, but I think it's just processing some kind of data. Can you tell me more about what you're trying to do with it?","345":null,"346":"No, you won't understand why the statement is true because I'm not revealing any information about the proof itself. I'm simply convincing you that it's true without giving away any details.","347":"So, to clarify, I'd like to prove to you that I have a number in mind, without actually revealing what that number is. Is that a fair understanding of what we're trying to accomplish with a zero-knowledge proof?","348":"Now, let's talk about zero-knowledge proofs. So, you can prove to someone that you know something without actually telling them what it is. And here's how we can use that: we can use the fact that it's really tough to figure out how to color a map with just three colors, without any two countries with the same color sharing a border, to prove that you have at least 0.3 Bitcoins.","349":"So, let's break it down: we need to figure out how to connect the dots between having a certain amount of Bitcoin and the three-colorability of a map of countries. What if we use some kind of cryptographic protocol that allows us to prove the statement about the Bitcoin without revealing the account details, and then use that proof to demonstrate the three-colorability of the map? Does that sound like a possible approach?","350":"I was thinking, if we can use colors to represent different concepts, maybe we can use a similar approach to visualize the process of zero-knowledge proofs.","351":"And I'm guessing that's why you're looking at the map with such interest, because you're starting to see a pattern emerge, right?","352":"What did you think of the other one you had? Was it a good fit?","353":"I added a new color, which is red, and now you can see the colors are all over the place, aren't they?","354":"I think what you're getting at is that zero-knowledge proofs can be used to prove the existence of something without revealing what that something is, which is a big deal in cryptography and privacy. But to be honest, I'm not entirely sure what you mean by'structurally prove something'. Can you clarify what you're trying to get at with that?","355":"I think one of the challenges is that students may not have a clear understanding of what it means to be creative in a generative AI context, so educators need to help them understand the capabilities and limitations of these tools and how they can be used to augment, rather than replace, human creativity.","356":"What specific philosophical perspectives on the nature of mathematical existence would you say are most relevant to this debate?","357":"You know, one of the toughest things about the continuum hypothesis is that it's not just about infinity, it's also about how we think about the real numbers. Like, are there sets that are 'in between' the countable sets and the continuum? It's a super subtle question, and I think that's what makes it so hard to teach. I mean, even I struggle to explain it in a way that makes sense to students, because it's not just a math problem, it's also about how we understand the world.","358":"Actually, I'm not sure if it was because I remember or because you told me, but what I do know is that we didn't have any teal towels, right?","359":"And it's not just that you're forgetting things, it's also that your brain is getting more efficient at storing and retrieving what's truly significant, making it easier to recall the essential details while letting go of the rest.","360":"That's right, but I think there's more to it than just different parts of the brain. What I mean is, how do those different parts actually work together to create this sense of a memory, like a movie in our minds? It's not just a matter of one part storing pictures and another part storing sounds, but how do they collaborate to make us feel like we're reliving the experience?","361":"It's like your brain is sending a warning signal to itself, saying, 'Hey, remember what happened last time you got too close to something sharp, so next time you see something like that, let's be more careful.' This helps us learn from our mistakes and avoid potential dangers in the future.","362":"because it's made up of smaller, self-similar patterns that repeat at different scales, which means that if you try to measure it, you'll be capturing the same structural features multiple times, rather than a unique, absolute length.","363":"I'm not sure about that. Could you elaborate on what you mean by a fractal in this context? Are you thinking of the surface features of a planet or an asteroid, or something else entirely? That might help me understand how you're thinking about it.","364":"Exactly! And the more closely we space our measurements, the more detail we capture, and the longer the coastline seems to get. It's like the coastline is a never-ending puzzle, with each piece fitting into the next one, and the more pieces we add, the more intricate and complex it becomes.","365":"Fractals are like the weird cousins of shapes - they don't fit into our neat little categories, like circles or squares. They're more like the wild stuff nature throws at us, like trees, mountains, or even the coastline we were just talking about. They've got a lot of repeating patterns that make them look super complex, and they can just keep going on forever in a really cool way.","366":"Nice to meet you, Namina! What brings you here today?","367":null,"368":"We're using a non-invasive technique to gather data about the ball's internal structure without causing any damage or disruption.","369":"I was working on a project with a colleague who was doing some work on magnetometry, and we were struggling to achieve the desired sensitivity. That's when we started exploring the potential of quantum sensing to overcome the limitations of traditional magnetometry.","370":"When you're imaging large biological objects, you're dealing with a much bigger scale, trying to reconstruct the entire body from the signals from individual spins. In contrast, quantum sensing is all about working with a tiny scale, trying to extract information from just a few spins or even a single spin, which makes the signal-to-noise ratio a much more critical issue.","371":"That's right, the sensitivity is distance-dependent, but it's not just about being close \u2013 it's also about being in the right orientation relative to the defect, otherwise the signal can be really hard to pick up.","372":"Or even worse, into a superposition of states, which isn\u2019t what we want.","373":"so we had to take some extra steps to block out the interference from the radio signals, and it was as simple as wrapping the whole setup in some aluminum foil to create a Faraday cage, which did the trick and allowed us to continue our experiment.","374":"I think that's a great idea, though - have you seen any research on how they're applying quantum computing principles to sensing applications?","375":"And they're pushing the boundaries of what's thought to be possible with these sensors, aren't they?","376":"I'm curious, what kind of breakthroughs do you think we'll see in the next 10 years with this increased collaboration among scientists?","377":"That's the thing about quantum systems, they're really tricky because even if you had a perfect qubit, you'd still have to deal with the fact that the outcome of a computation can change just by looking at it. It's like trying to build a house on shaky ground.","378":"But if you add more qubits, don't you end up with more opportunities for things to go wrong, and therefore more decoherence?","379":"I think people are underestimating the complexity of building a large-scale quantum computer. It's not just about scaling up the processor, but also about developing the supporting technologies, like software and error correction, that make it all work.","380":"That's interesting, so when you get close to a shape, Minecraft doesn't have enough information to render the details, so it just shows it as a block. Is that correct?","381":"I might have used a more technical term, but basically subdivision surfaces are a way to make 3D models look smoother by breaking them down into smaller pieces. Have you worked with 3D modeling software before, or is that not really your area of expertise?","382":"So, by gradually removing these sharp corners, I'm illustrating the process of creating a smooth shape from a mesh of polygons. It's a bit like how, in computer graphics, subdivision surfaces work by iteratively refining the mesh to produce a more rounded and detailed representation of the shape.","383":"Actually, it's not that the process takes months to render, but rather that the rendering of complex scenes can take months. The algorithms we use can indeed generate the surface in real-time, but the overall process of rendering the entire image can be quite time-consuming. For example, a Pixar movie might take months to render, but that's because it involves rendering many complex scenes, not because the individual rendering of each scene takes that long. Does that clarify things?","384":"I think one of the cutting-edge areas is actually in using fractals to improve the accuracy of subdivision surfaces. By incorporating fractal patterns, we can create more realistic and detailed models of complex shapes, which is particularly useful for subdivision services like Pixar's. This could potentially lead to more efficient and effective rendering of complex scenes.","385":"That's really interesting! Can you tell me more about how ARPANET was used and what its impact was on the development of the internet as we know it today?","386":"That's a great question! With packet switching, you can break down a message into smaller packets of data, and then those packets can take different routes through the network to reach their destination. This allows for a more efficient use of bandwidth, as well as increased reliability and flexibility in the network. It's a key innovation that enabled the development of the modern internet, and it's still the fundamental technology behind how data is transmitted over the internet today.","387":"Exactly, with a request-response structure, you can break up the communication into smaller, independent parts, so if one part gets lost or messed up, the others can still get through and the communication stays intact.","388":"Actually, there are seven layers to the internet's protocol stack, which is a bit different from the seven keys. The seven layers are the physical layer, data link layer, network layer, transport layer, session layer, presentation layer, and application layer. The seven keys, on the other hand, are a reference to the seven 'choke points' or critical infrastructure components of the internet, which are often cited as being the backbone of the internet's infrastructure. These seven keys are the undersea cables, the internet exchange points, the network access points, the data centers, the domain name system, the routing protocols, and the network protocols.","389":"I'm surprised, because I thought companies like Google or Facebook controlled what we see and do online.","390":"I imagine they get misplaced or misrouted during some kind of transition or handoff between different systems or people.","391":"That's a good start, but quantum sensing is a bit more than just using quantum computers. It's actually about using quantum systems, like atoms or photons, to measure tiny things like temperature, magnetic fields, or even tiny forces like gravitational waves.","392":"I'm studying quantum sensing and its applications, including the development of new magnetometers.","393":"That's a great question! The process of creating a nanodiamond is actually a bit more complex than just putting energy into it. We use a technique called high-pressure high-temperature (HPHT) or chemical vapor deposition (CVD) to create the nanodiamond. HPHT involves subjecting a diamond precursor to extremely high pressures and temperatures, while CVD involves depositing carbon atoms onto a substrate using a gas. The resulting nanodiamond is then purified and characterized to ensure its quality and properties.","394":"<model-generated>That's right, and in fact, the decay rate of the superposition state can be used to infer information about the environment it's interacting with. For example, if the superposition state decays more quickly than expected, it could indicate the presence of a certain type of particle or field that's affecting the system.<\/model-generated>","395":"Entanglement creates a connection between qubits that lets them share a common state, so even if they're really far apart, you can't describe the state of one qubit without considering the other qubits. This connection can make the quantum sensor more sensitive, but it also makes it more delicate.","396":"An atomic clock is indeed a type of quantum sensor, as it relies on the principles of quantum mechanics to maintain its timekeeping accuracy. However, its primary function is to measure time, not to sense external physical quantities like magnetic fields, which is what most people would consider a sensor to do.","397":"That's really interesting, because I've heard that quantum sensors can also be used to measure things like temperature and pressure, which could have a big impact on fields like medicine and manufacturing.","398":"They connect to a larger network through a service provider, like your internet service provider, which is like a kind of superhighway that connects all of the local networks together, but to be honest, I'm not sure I'm explaining this very well. Can we break it down further?","399":"Actually, there are extensive networks of undersea fiber-optic cables that crisscross the globe, enabling the rapid exchange of data between continents and regions. These cables are a crucial part of the internet infrastructure, allowing information to be transmitted efficiently across vast distances.","400":"The signals from the undersea cables get transmitted to a central location, where they're distributed to smaller networks that connect to homes and businesses through Wi-Fi, allowing devices to connect wirelessly.","401":"The server actually sends you a list of nearby servers to choose from. You pick one, and then it sends you the content directly. This way, it's faster and less likely to get interrupted.","402":"Actually, I think I see what you mean now. You're saying that a function is a rule that takes an input and gives a specific output, like in the case of f(x) = 2x. But what if the function is more complex, like f(x) = 2x^2 + 3x - 4? In that case, the operation is not just a simple multiplication, but a combination of different operations. Does that still fit with your idea of a function?","403":"Well, you see, when we talk about infinite sets, we're not just dealing with an endless quantity, but rather with sets that have a particular arrangement or pattern. This arrangement is crucial because it allows us to establish a meaningful relationship between these infinite sets. For instance, the set of natural numbers, which progresses in a well-defined sequence, can be compared to other infinite sets, such as the set of integers or the set of real numbers, because their structures are comparable, even if they are endless.","404":"How about we match negative one with the next natural number that hasn't been used yet?","405":"That's a great insight, and it's fascinating to see how the natural numbers and integers can be paired up in this way. By matching each natural number with a corresponding integer, we can start to appreciate the unique characteristics of each set. The odd numbers, in particular, seem to be the domain of the natural numbers, while the even numbers appear to be the realm of the integers. This pairing also highlights the fact that integers can be both positive and negative, which is a key distinction from natural numbers.","406":"Exactly, and as you can see from the picture, each rational number is associated with a unique pair of integers, which allows us to label them in a systematic way, making it easier to understand and work with the set of rational numbers.","407":"And what's really cool is that we can also go the other way around, so we can take any natural number and map it to a unique rational number. That way, we're showing that these two infinities are actually equivalent, which is a pretty mind-blowing result.","408":null,"409":"I see what you mean - that's a really interesting implication. Can you tell me more about what this means in practical terms?","410":"I mean, it's like a symphony of quantum mechanics and engineering wizardry, all coming together to create this quantum computing orchestra that's capable of solving problems that were previously unsolvable.","411":null,"412":"That's really cool! So, how exactly does active noise control work? Is it like playing a sound that's the opposite of the noise, or is there more to it?","413":"Think of it like a special box that helps keep the qubits stable, so they can exist in many states at the same time.","414":"It would change the way you think about solving problems, and you'd have to learn to use quantum computers to do things in parallel, which is a different way of working than what we're used to with classical computers.","415":"Yeah, I've heard of black holes. Apparently, they're regions in space where gravity is so strong that nothing, not even light, can escape once it gets too close. My friend who's into astrophysics explained it to me, and it's pretty mind-blowing.","416":"How much liquid is inside it?","417":"The core of the star collapses into an incredibly small, extremely dense point called a singularity. At this point, the gravitational pull becomes so strong that not even light can escape, and that's when you form a black hole.","418":"Actually, if the sun were to collapse on itself, it would form a white dwarf, not a black hole. The reason it wouldn't form a black hole is that the sun isn't dense enough, it's mostly made up of hydrogen and helium, and it wouldn't have enough mass to create the kind of gravitational pull that would trap everything, including light. That's a great question, by the way, and it gets to the heart of how stars like the sun end their lives.","419":"That's right, the gravity of the black hole is so strong that it warps the space around it, creating a region from which nothing, not even light, can escape. That's what's happening here.","420":"That's a mind-bending concept, isn't it? I think Einstein's idea is that the black hole is warping the fabric of spacetime, creating a kind of gravitational well that pulls everything towards it. It's not just that it's taking other stuff, but rather that it's distorting the very geometry of space itself.","421":"That's fascinating! I've been exploring how infinite-dimensional manifolds can exhibit topological features that are not present in their finite-dimensional counterparts. I'd love to hear more about how you're applying the concept of infinity in algebraic geometry, especially in projective space.","422":"It's a function that picks one item from a collection, kind of like choosing a random book from a shelf.","423":"That's a good point - if they're sending tiny amounts of data, it's not like the network traffic is going to get out of hand.","424":"That's a good point. For example, a temperature sensor might send a single byte every minute, which is 1 byte per second. But that's just the payload, and when you factor in the protocol overhead, you're likely looking at 4-6 bytes per second, not even considering any additional metadata that might be sent.","425":null,"426":null,"427":"That's right, it's a classic problem in data science - how to balance transparency with security, so that we can understand how AI models are making decisions without putting sensitive information at risk.","428":"That's right, and this idea has some really interesting implications for privacy and security.","429":"I think it's fascinating that zero-knowledge proofs have such a wide range of potential applications, from verifiable secret sharing to functional encryption. It's an area that's really pushing the boundaries of what's possible in cryptography and computer science.","430":"What's your take on the current understanding of the LMC's central region?","431":"I mean, there are a few theories. One is that you could've had a bunch of smaller black holes that merged over time to form a supermassive one. That's one possibility. Another idea is that these supermassive black holes could've formed from the collapse of a giant gas cloud in the early universe. But that's a bit more complicated, because we're not really sure how those kinds of clouds would behave and form a black hole. It's still a mystery that scientists are trying to crack.","432":"Would you say that's because the process of accretion is more complex and harder to grasp, or is it because it's more relevant to understanding the behavior of black holes in the universe?","433":"That's right, and the resulting supermassive black hole could have a profound impact on the galaxy, potentially disrupting the orbits of stars and even triggering a burst of star formation or quenching it altogether, depending on the specifics of the merger.","434":null,"435":"Actually, I've been following some research on the connection between black hole mergers and the emission of gravitational waves. It's been fascinating to see how scientists are using these observations to learn more about the properties of black holes, such as their mass and spin. This could potentially lead to a better understanding of how these cosmic objects form and evolve over time.","436":"However, if we could tap into the energy of a black hole on the scale of our sun, the power output would be mind-bogglingly greater than what we estimated with the moon and a superconducting magnet. Theoretically, it's feasible to extract energy from a black hole, but the technological hurdles to doing so in a controlled and sustainable manner are substantial and far beyond our current technological grasp.","437":"What kind of computational resources are we talking about here, and are there any specific techniques that can help speed up the training process?","438":"Because, if we can harness the power of quantum computing, we might be able to tackle complex problems in machine learning that are currently unsolvable or require an unfeasible amount of computational resources, potentially leading to breakthroughs in areas like optimization, simulation, and data analysis.","439":"You see, in a quantum computer, you don't just flip a bit from 0 to 1 like you do in a classical computer. Instead, you need to manipulate the magnetic polarization in a way that's connected to another bit in the system. That's what makes a qubit special \u2013 it's not just a 0 or a 1, but a mix of both at the same time, like a two-state vector. That's what allows quantum computers to do things that classical computers can't.","440":"Think of it like a coin that's both heads and tails at the same time, but as soon as you look at it, it decides which one it wants to be.","441":"We use a technique called quantum encoding to map the data onto the qubits. It involves applying specific quantum gates, like the Hadamard gate, to create a representation of the data in a superposition of states.","442":"that would mean the computation would be highly susceptible to decoherence, rendering the whole process unreliable.","443":"They're going to be more heuristic, flexible, and adaptable, designed to work with the noisy intermediate-scale quantum computers we have now, rather than waiting for perfect ones.","444":"I think that's one of the biggest challenges is that we're still trying to understand the underlying physics of quantum computing and how it interacts with real-world systems, which is a major hurdle in developing practical applications. We need to better grasp how quantum noise and error correction impact the reliability of these systems, and then we can start to think about how to scale up to more complex problems.","445":"I see what you mean about narrowing the task range and biased sampling, but I was thinking more about how to get robots to learn more efficiently or learn faster in terms of actually speeding up the learning process itself, rather than just optimizing the learning environment. Can you think of any algorithms or techniques that could help with that?","446":"I think a promising direction is to make the simulators more realistic by incorporating more complex physics, such as friction, gravity, and collision detection. Additionally, we can also explore using sensorimotor learning to learn the mapping between the simulated and real-world environments, which can help to bridge the gap between the two. Furthermore, it would be beneficial to include more realistic sensor data and noise in the simulators, such as camera noise, motor noise, and sensor drift, to make the simulations more robust and reflective of real-world conditions.","447":"That's a great starting point! Fractals are actually mathematical sets that display self-similarity, meaning they appear the same at different scales. Think of the Romanesco broccoli, have you seen it? It's a vegetable that looks like it's made up of tiny, repeating spheres. That's a classic example of a fractal in nature. I find them really fascinating, and there are so many cool examples out there.","448":"So they use a mathematical concept called a fractal, which is a geometric pattern that repeats itself at different scales, to tell the computer how to draw the tree. This allows the computer to generate a tree with a realistic branching structure and texture, mimicking the way trees grow in nature.","449":"So every branch splits into two smaller branches, just like you said.","450":"You have to make a thousand of them, that's why I'm telling you about fractals. They're a mathematical concept that helps us create self-similar patterns, like the branches on your tree, but with a much simpler formula. By using fractals, we can generate similar patterns quickly and efficiently, which is exactly what we need to make a thousand trees like yours.","451":"So, basically, you gotta teach the computer what to do, and it can make these crazy-cool fractals for you.","452":"I've been meaning to discuss that with you, actually. I've been reading a lot about the dot-com bubble and its effects on the stock market. What are your thoughts on the role of venture capital in funding internet startups during that time?","453":"However, the decentralization aspect of it all does pose a challenge for management and maintenance, as it can make it harder to ensure consistency and security across the network.","454":"Well, it means that people in certain countries might not have access to the same information or online services as people in other countries, and that can have real-world consequences. It also means that individuals may have to rely on their own country's laws and norms, which can be restrictive, and that can impact their online security and freedom.","455":"It's a bit like being a detective, where you're constantly trying to piece together clues to figure out what's going on.","456":"But what's really interesting is that as these technologies converge, we can start to unlock new use cases that were previously impossible or impractical, like real-time control and monitoring of industrial equipment, or smart cities that can respond to changing conditions in real-time.","457":"And I think one of the most interesting aspects of 5G is its potential to enable new use cases that were previously impossible, like widespread adoption of IoT, remote healthcare, and smart cities. It's not just about faster speeds, but about creating a more connected and interactive world.","458":"I'm not entirely sure I understand them either, but from what I've learned in my astrophysics class, I think the event horizon is actually the point of no return around a black hole, where the gravitational pull is so strong that any matter or radiation that crosses it will get pulled in and can't escape. Is that right?","459":"So, what that means is that for the person falling in, time becomes more and more distorted as they approach the singularity. It's as if time is not just passing normally but is being warped in a way that's almost unimaginable. Meanwhile, the curvature of space around the black hole becomes so extreme that any sense of spatial direction or reference is lost. It's a truly mind-bending experience, and it's one of the reasons why black holes are so fascinating to study.","460":"They thought that because in quantum mechanics, the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle suggests that the more precisely you try to measure a particle's position, the less precisely you can know its momentum, and vice versa. So, if you were to try to get to the singularity, you'd have to know both the position and the momentum of the matter at the same time, which would be impossible according to quantum mechanics, and that's why they thought the singularity might not actually form.","461":"Exactly, it's inferred from the math and observations of the effects of black holes on their surroundings. We can see how stars and gas move around a suspected black hole, which gives us clues about the black hole's mass and spin. This is similar to how astronomers use the motion of planets and other celestial objects to infer the presence of a massive, unseen object like a star. By combining the math with these observations, we can make educated guesses about what's happening inside the black hole, but we can't directly observe it.","462":"Hawking realized that black holes aren't as one-way as they seem. He showed that they actually have a temperature and can even radiate, which we now call Hawking radiation. This was a big deal because it means black holes aren't completely dark, but actually have a kind of glow. And if they radiate, that means they can lose mass over time, which has implications for the info paradox. It's like, if black holes are losing mass, where's the information going?","463":"For instance, researchers are exploring the possibility of simulating black hole environments using tabletop experiments, such as ultracold atoms or even ion traps, to study the effects of Hawking radiation and potentially validate the theory. Additionally, some scientists are proposing the use of analog systems, like optical lattices or superfluids, to mimic the behavior of black holes and observe the emergence of quantum effects. These experiments could provide valuable insights into the physics of black holes and potentially pave the way for more direct tests of Hawking's theory in the future.","464":"I mean, think about it. In a multi-party computation, you've got multiple parties that want to collaborate on something, but they can't just share their private inputs directly because that would violate their privacy. So, they use zero-knowledge proofs to ensure that the computation is done correctly without revealing their inputs. The key idea is to only reveal what's necessary for the outcome, without giving away any extra information.","465":"become instrumental in enabling secure multi-party computation, facilitating the sharing and processing of private data among parties without compromising its confidentiality.","466":"I think that's an area where we could see a lot of innovation and progress in the coming years, particularly with the advancements in homomorphic encryption, secure multi-party computation, and other related technologies that are being developed and refined.","467":"It's like your brain is trying to make sense of the decision after the fact, and that's what's interesting because research suggests that people often experience 'buyer's remorse' or'regret aversion' when they can't make a clear choice between two equally appealing options.","468":"Have you watched any of the adaptations, like the play or the musical, or do you prefer the original film version?","469":"And then it would be transmitted through the fiber optic cables, which crisscross the network, to the server that's connected to the person's device.","470":"That's a good point, but the internet's routing system is designed to find the most efficient path between two points, even if it's not the most direct one. So, while it might seem simpler to go from here to here, the routers and computers along the way are constantly communicating with each other to determine the best path to take. This is known as dynamic routing, and it allows the internet to adapt to changing conditions and find the fastest route to the destination.","471":"That's a great point. And in the context of our network, if one path is congested or has a lot of traffic, going the alternative path could actually help us reach our destination faster.","472":"Ah, you're asking for a name? Let me tell you, there are so many varieties of lettuce out there, like romaine, iceberg, and butter lettuce, each with its own unique flavor and texture. It's a fascinating world of greens!","473":"That's a beautiful way to put it \u2013 the brain as a dynamic conductor, constantly refining and reharmonizing the orchestra of neural activity to create a rich and ever-changing symphony of experience.","474":"I think that's a great connection to make, because the dynamic updating of mental models is closely tied to the way the hippocampus forms new connections between neurons. This process allows our mental models to adapt and evolve in response to new experiences and information.","475":"I think that's where the concept of schema comes in, which suggests that our brains are engaged in a continuous process of updating and refining our mental representations of the world. This involves integrating new information into our existing cognitive frameworks, which are essentially mental maps that guide our navigation and decision-making. The way we construct and organize these mental frameworks has a profound impact on how we perceive and respond to new environments, and it's precisely this dynamic interplay between spatial processing and memory that makes the hippocampus such a fascinating region of study.","476":"I think that's a really important point about memory and mental models - that they're not just static things that we accumulate over time, but they're actually dynamic and they can be changed and updated, and what's more, this dynamic nature of mental models can sometimes lead to mental models that are incomplete, outdated, or even contradictory, which can have significant implications for our perception of reality and our decision-making processes.","477":null,"478":"I think that's a great point, that memory isn't just a static snapshot, but a dynamic process that's constantly evolving. It's not just about storing information, but about how that information is used and transformed over time. And I think that's where the mental model comes in \u2013 it's not just a collection of individual events, but a framework for making sense of the world and navigating its complexities. That's why behavioral relevance is so important, because it's not just about remembering what happened, but about how those memories inform our decisions and guide our actions.","479":"Actually, I was thinking more about the information paradox. You know, the idea that nothing, including information, can escape a black hole, which seems to contradict the second law of thermodynamics. It's a pretty mind-bending concept, and it's still an open question in the field of cosmology.","480":"So the guitar will act as a kind of antenna, picking up the faint vibrations in spacetime that the black holes have created. I'd like you to play a few notes on the guitar, and I'll show you how to tune it to resonate with the frequency of the gravitational waves. This will give us a sense of what it would be like to 'hear' a black hole merger, and it's a really cool way to visualize the data that scientists use to study these events.","481":"We know that it's a black hole because the waveform matches the theoretical prediction of what a black hole merger should look like, and the mass of the black holes involved is consistent with what we'd expect from a merger event of that type.","482":"Actually, that's not entirely accurate. The gravitational waves from those massive objects do have a minuscule effect on Earth, but it's not directly noticeable. They cause a very tiny change in the length of the day, and some scientists have even detected these effects in extremely precise measurements.","483":"I've been following the work of Hans Moravec and his concept of Moravec's paradox, which suggests that it's relatively easier for AI systems to perform tasks that require physical capabilities, such as playing chess or Go, but much harder for them to replicate human-like capabilities in more complex areas like common sense, intuition, and emotional intelligence. I think this paradox has significant implications for the field of AI research, as it highlights the need for a more nuanced understanding of human cognition and the development of AI systems that can better mimic human-like intelligence.","484":"Absolutely, it's frustrating because it highlights the limitations of our current approach to AI development. We're still struggling to create robots that can navigate the world in a way that's similar to humans, and it's not just about adding more sensors or processing power. It's about understanding the underlying cognitive and motor processes that allow humans to interact with the world so effortlessly, and that's a much more complex and nuanced challenge than just scaling up computing power or collecting more data. ","485":"It's all about how we perceive intelligence and its role in our lives. But often, we assume that intelligence means being able to accomplish many tasks. But the truth is, intelligence is about making smart decisions in the right situations.","486":"I think a more promising approach is to integrate the symbolic and continuous representations, so that the AI can learn from both the high-level abstractions and the low-level sensory inputs. For example, imagine a robot that can not only understand the rules of a game, but also perceive the physical environment and adapt its strategy accordingly. This integrated approach could lead to more robust and flexible AI systems that can handle complex tasks and unexpected situations.","487":"I'm particularly interested in how the way we report on our experiences influences the way we form and store memories of social interactions, because I think that's a key part of how we make these social judgements.","488":"And I think that's why memory plays a crucial role in shaping our perceptions and social judgments.","489":"I think that's a great point, and it makes me wonder if the reason it's harder to study positive emotions is because they're more context-dependent, and our memories of positive experiences are influenced by the specific circumstances in which we experienced them. Maybe we need to develop new methods to account for that complexity.","490":"I think what's even more remarkable is that this ability to adapt and compensate for damage is not unique to humans. Other animals, like birds and monkeys, also show similar neural plasticity, which suggests that this is an evolutionarily conserved mechanism.","491":"I'm particularly intrigued by the intersection of memory and perception, as research has shown that our recollection of a stimulus can significantly impact how we perceive it. This raises fundamental questions about how our brain shapes our understanding of reality, and the role of memory in this process.","492":"But you know, it's funny, because people often assume the opposite \u2013 that things that are easy for computers would be hard for humans. But Moravec's paradox flips that on its head.","493":"I've got a simple program here that's going to attempt to solve a Rubik's cube, which is a classic puzzle that's notoriously tricky for humans to solve.","494":"Now, let's think about how a robot might handle this task. Would you expect it to be easy or challenging for a robot to pick up the penny and move it to the other hand?","495":"Okay, I'm ready. But can you clarify what you mean by 'throw the ball' since I don't see a ball in front of me?","496":"I see, so you picked it up because you heard it fall and thought it might be the ball. That's a great example of how our brains can make connections between different sensory experiences. It's actually quite similar to how AI systems can learn to recognize patterns in data, like the sound of a ball hitting the ground.","497":"I think what you're getting at is the difference between how we can teach a robot to do something, versus how a human can do it. For example, we can teach a robot to pick up a ball, but we can't teach it to play a game of catch, because that involves understanding the game, the ball, the other person, and all these other things. It's like the difference between teaching a kid to ride a bike, versus teaching them to navigate through a busy city.","498":"Actually, robots don't have the same sense of self-awareness or introspection that we do, so they can't really recognize when they've made a mistake or not. It's not like they're thinking, 'Oh no, I messed up!' ","499":"But what's really cool is that the robot figures out how to do the task on its own, kind of like how a kid learns to ride a bike \u2013 it needs to know what it's aiming for, or in this case, what it's trying to accomplish.","500":"A robot doesn't see like we do, it's more like it captures and interprets visual information from the environment.","501":"I don't think robots will take over the world anytime soon. The idea that robots could surpass human intelligence and become a threat is often based on a misunderstanding of how robots work. In reality, robots are programmed to perform specific tasks, and their capabilities are limited by their programming and design. While it's true that robots can be very good at complex tasks like surgery or driving, they still struggle with everyday tasks like folding a towel or recognizing emotions. This is known as Moravec's paradox, and it highlights the challenges of creating robots that can interact with the world in a more human-like way. So, while robots are certainly becoming more advanced, I think it's unlikely that they'll become a threat to humanity in the near future.","502":"I'm curious, what kind of fractals did this kid manage to create, and how did they compare to the ones you've seen before? Did they use any specific techniques or software to achieve those intricate patterns?","503":"I think what's really fascinating about fractals is how they show up in the natural world. Take the branching of trees, for example - the way the main trunk splits into smaller branches, which then split into even smaller ones, creating a pattern that's repeated at different scales. Or think about the flow of rivers, how they wind and twist through the landscape, creating a fractal pattern in their path. Even the patterns on a leaf are a great example of fractals in nature. And then there's the way coastlines work, with their intricate patterns of bays, inlets, and headlands. These are all great examples of how fractals can be seen in the world around us.","504":"It's like your brain is wired to recognize patterns, and once you see it, you can't unsee it. It's a pretty mind-blowing experience!","505":"But first, let's make sure we're on the same page about scaling.","506":"I think that's a really astute observation, and it speaks to the limitations of fractals as a model for reality. One way to think about it is that fractals are great at capturing certain kinds of patterns and structures, but they can be very poor at capturing the nuances and complexities of human experience. For example, they often struggle to account for the way that our experiences are shaped by context, culture, and individual perspectives, which are all things that add richness and depth to the world around us. Does that make sense?","507":"because the world is infinitely complex, with patterns repeating at different scales, making it impossible to fully explore or map, even if we could store it in a computer.","508":"he wanted to shift the focus from creating complex, show-off pieces to crafting something that's not only beautiful but also easy to use, kind of like how Bob Ross made painting accessible to everyone.","509":"Yeah, like if you're counting, you can always count one more, right? But I think what's tricky about infinity is that it's not just about adding one more, it's like, what if you're counting really, really fast?","510":"You can't count all the way through infinity, it's like trying to count all the way through all the grains of sand on every beach on Earth, but what's interesting is that even though we can't count all the way through infinity, we can still talk about the concept of infinity in a meaningful way, like how it relates to the number of Skittles in this jar.","511":"That's a mind-bending concept - if we have an infinite number of jars, does that mean we can't even define a 'full' room in this scenario?","512":null,"513":null,"514":"That's a broad question, but I'd love to give you a quick rundown. Quantum refers to something that's related to the smallest units of energy and matter, like atoms and subatomic particles. It's a branch of physics that tries to understand how these tiny things behave and interact with each other.","515":"But what if I were to flip this penny and it landed on its edge? That would be an interesting situation, but in quantum mechanics, we're talking about something more abstract. Superposition is when a quantum object, like an electron, can exist in multiple states simultaneously. For example, it can spin both clockwise and counterclockwise at the same time, which is a fundamental property of quantum systems.","516":"Think of a quantum computer like a super-smart hairdresser, it can take a messy situation and find the perfect solution.","517":"That's right, it's like they're connected in a way that transcends space and time, and that's what makes quantum mechanics so mind-blowing.","518":"But in quantum sensing, you're trying to measure things that are really hard to measure, like magnetic fields or temperatures, at the smallest scales and with incredible precision, which is pushing the boundaries of what we thought was possible with technology.","519":"Yeah, no worries! So, an MRI is basically a super powerful tool that lets doctors see inside your body. It uses a huge magnet and some radio waves to get the hydrogen atoms in your body moving, kind of like how a DJ spins tracks to get the crowd dancing. When those atoms start vibrating, they send back signals that the machine can translate into images. It's a bit like how a camera takes a picture of the world outside, but instead, an MRI takes a picture of the inside of your body!","520":"So, let me ask you, have you ever thought about how this concept of cells and their interactions might apply to something as complex as a city or a society? For example, just like how cells work together to form tissues and organs, could we say that different communities or groups within a city work together to form a functioning society? It's a pretty mind-blowing idea when you think about it!","521":"Several other quantum sensors are in development, such as superconducting qubits and diamond sensors, but they face significant
