So this term comes from engineering, and the idea is that in sleep, you basically have kind of this all of nothing experience. Certainly people kind of drift off to sleep, but then all of a sudden you're unconscious, right? So it seems like it's this flip flop between the arousal system and the sleep promoting system, and it's certainly regulated, and we'll get a little bit into that, but they're certainly kind of made up of two reciprocally inhibitory processes. Okay, so we have the ascending reticular activating system. It originates in the brain stem, and there's a dorsal and a ventral arm to this, and so the dorsal arm has neurons, cholinergic neurons, that go up to the thalamus and then it projections into the fore brain, and then there's the ventral arm, and this is comprised of a whole bunch of different types of neurons, so there are monominergic, so there's kind of dopaminergic neurons that come from the periaqueductal gray, serotonergic ones from the dorsal raphae nuclei, histaminergic neurons that come from the tuberomammillary nucleus of the hippothalamus, and then noradrenergic neurons from the locus coeruleus, and so all of those are kind of working in tandem to kind of drive wake within the brain. So if we just think about drugs that are available inducing wakefulness, we can certainly, kind of the dopaminergic ones jump out, right? So we have amphetamines that kind of drive those signaling, and then modafinil, which is a wake promoting drug for people that have kind of excessive day-time sleepiness that maintains alertness throughout the day.","2":"For the role that they play with respect to the sleep-wake system is really kind of amping up the wake system, right? And so certainly that has like down stream consequences for the sleep system, because now the flip flop switch is kind of pushed in a much stronger direction, and we have to kind of rely on what regulates sleep to get it pushed back to sleep.","3":"And do we know much about why, or which stages of the sleep cycle are affected? You know, if you take amphetamines, is it then when you go to sleep, that you're not able to transition through each of the sleep periods, or is that less clear?","4":"You know, so I think that's less clear. In some ways, you know, getting back to this idea of this wake-sleep system, we have this sleep system that is kind of the counterpoint to this wake arousal system, and so the primary nucleus region is the ventral lateral pre-optic nucleus, also called VLPO, and that has particular neuron outputs that release GABA and galanin, which work in an inhibitory way on kind of the wake promoting ones. And so, it's kind of this delicate balance of these two systems that are ongoing. In your cognitive neuro-science training, right, it sounds like it's pretty specific and focused in a particular part of the brain, the cerebellum, and one thing that I'm interested in is you bring a participant into the study, have you ensured that they got a good night's sleep? Have you asked them about their sleep?","5":"You know, what we do in our studies, is we actually track people, for say a week, and they have to get in within this range of amount of sleep and then it has to be both amount of sleep and how stable it is. That variability can kind of impact it and certainly might have an impact on the machinery that's happening in the brain.","6":"A lot of people will see you as somebody who's drank in harmony their whole life. They've seen so much harmony, heard so much harmony. How do you make the choices, there's so much that's possible when you know stuff. How do you have the courage to make a choice?","7":"Yeah, yeah, yeah. I find it fascinating in music to think about, you know, say I arrive in a place, if I'm going, say I'm going to D flat major. And there's something you once taught me. You taught me this song Don't Follow the Crowd.","8":"And there's that chord. It's not a Dennerman chord, but it functions as a dominant chord. But it doesn't matter, because you're still going to the place you're going to.","9":"But at that moment, I'm coming from here, and I wanna forge some, some solution. I get myself in a situation. (keyboard music)","10":"'Cause, you know, I just wouldn't think to use that chord in that situation. And there it was! And, you know, if you read the rule book, it's, that not in it.","11":"Something like that. And that's not 'cause like emotionally, it's almost like I'm here, I'm arriving here. But, if the base note is the same, it's like this inevitability about it, it's like I was there all along.","12":"Yeah, yeah. It's like one thing is moving in one direction and one thing has arrived, so it's this tension and it's glorious. I love thinking about these things emotionally, just because that's a feeling, I know that feeling in my life.","13":"And so, we could play a bit of that if you want to. And we could talk about some stuff. I've been doing it in F. (keyboards playing Amazing Grace) (laughing) Thanks Herbie, that was a trip.","14":"It's a good one. The melody on its own just goes. (hums Amazing Grace) That melody on its own is kind of lonely, right? And no one really knows how it feels. (plays and hums Amazing Grace) So which one did you prefer?","15":"Yeah, ah, that's great. I can decide how I want this melody to feel and the more notes there are, the more exciting it is. That's what musical harmony is. Does that make sense?","16":"Its basically a delay and it happens in all parts of the system: monitors can be a big one. Like consumer televisions can often have 15 milliseconds or more of latency just in the TV part. And then you've got the processing and the computer and all of these add up to the total latency.","17":"30 years ago, you had desktop PCs which were, you spent whatever on that, but there was always this idea well you could spend a million dollars and buy a super-computer and its gonna be a lot faster. And that's not really true today. For scalar processing, when you just do one thing after another, a high-end, overclocked, cool gaming PC is about the fastest thing in the world. It is within a very small delta, yeah for some things you'll get some IBM power system that might be a little bit faster, but not a whole lot. So if I'm looking at this and saying we need to be five times faster. What do you do? You can't just say make each thing faster. As a developer you're making a trade-off, I can put my effort into making this more efficient or making it more fun. And more fun usually wins out for very good reasons. So there's some good judgment and trickery that goes into the design of things. But you can always just design a game that will just not work well. (laughing) I mean in the old days, games had to be so precisely designed. Nowadays you've got a ton more freedom. You really can--","18":"That's right. When we teach machines to learn from data, to build a model from that data or a representation of that, and then to make a prediction. One of the places we often find machine learning in the real world is in things like recommendation systems. So do you have an artist that you really like?","19":"So I'm gonna look up Melanie Martinez. And it says here, If you like Melanie Martinez, one of the other songs you might like is by Au\/Ra. Do you know who that is?","20":"It's a great question. The machine can understand whatever we tell it to understand. So there might be a person thinking about things, like the pitch or the pacing or the tone, or sometimes machines can figure out things about music or images or videos that we don't tell it to discover, but that it can learn from looking at a lot of different examples. Why do you think companies might use machine learning?","21":"Sometimes, the ads you see are really uncanny. And I think that's because they're based on so much data. They know where you live. They know where your device is. It's also important to realize that people in aggregate are actually pretty predictable. Like when we talk to each other, we like to talk about the novel things, like here, we're having this conversation. We don't do this every day. But we probably still eat breakfast. We're gonna eat lunch. We're gonna eat dinner. You probably are going to the same home you go to most of the time. And so, they're able to take that data that we already give them and make predictions based on that as to what ads they should show us.","22":"So there are things that machines are really great at that humans are actually not great at. And imagine watching every video posted to TikTok every day. So we just don't have enough time to do that at the rate at which we can actually watch those videos. But a machine can analyze all of them and then make recommendations to us. And then thinking about things that machines are bad at and people are good at, people are really great with only one or two examples of learning something new and incorporating that into our model of the world to make good decisions. Whereas machines often need tens of thousands of examples, and that's not even getting into things like good judgment because we care about people, because we can imagine a future that we want to live in that doesn't exist today. And that's something that is still uniquely human. Machines are great at predicting based on what they've seen in the past, but they're not creative. They're not going to invent. They're not gonna, you know, really change where we're gonna go. That's up to us.","23":"Now, that makes the gravitational field incredibly strong around the neutron star. So what would happen if we were on a neutron star, because of the gravity?","24":"Black holes are so amazing that when the neutron star stops and there's something actually there. There's material there. If it's so heavy it becomes a black hole, so it keeps falling, once the event horizon of the black hole forms, which is the shadow, the curve that's so strong that not even light can escape, the material keeps falling. And like you said, maybe space-time breaks down right at the center there, but whatever happens, the star's gone, that black hole is empty. So in a weird way black holes are a place and not a thing.","25":"There isn't a sensible way to talk about it yet, and that probably means that's where Einstein's theory of gravity as a curved space-time is beginning to break down, and we need to take the extra step of going to some kind of quantum theory of gravity. And we don't have that yet. So even though the black hole isn't completely understood, we do know that they form astronomically, that in the universe things like neutron stars form and things like black holes form. The consequences are very much speaking to this curved space-time. So, for instance, if two black holes orbit each other, they're like mallets on a drum, and they actually cause space-time to ring, and it's very much part of gravitation. The ringing of space-time itself, we call gravitational waves. And this was something Einstein thought about right away in 1950-1960, he was thinking about that.","26":"[Janna] Yes, they ring space-time also like a drum, and you can record the sound of that ringing after a billion years, when it's traveled through the universe. But then the next thing that happens is those neutron stars collide, and because of this incredibly high energy state of matter, which you study, it becomes this firework of different explosions. It's really quite spectacular.","27":"So when the gravitational waves were recorded and they realized, oh this sounds like, you can reconstruct the shape and size of the mallets of the drum from the sound, these sounds like neutron stars colliding, not black holes. And so, like you said, there was a trigger for satellites and experiments all over the world to point roughly in the direction that the sound was coming from. So, from your point of view, they're like two super-conducting giant magnets colliding, an experiment you could never do on Earth. That's just the most tremendous scales and peculiarities of matter.","28":"Not an experimental one. So, our theme here today is dimensions. So this is great that you have some math background because mathematicians think about dimensions in a different way.","29":"Now, in some sense that's kind of trivial to you and me, because of course you have space, which is three dimensional, you have time which is one dimensional, so spacetime is four dimensional. But it didn't turn out, it didn't occur to anyone that that was a sensible way to talk until really relativity. This is the crucial thing, right? Is that what Einstein realized is that sure there's both time and space, but how we divide spacetime into time and space can be different for different people, and really there's a real sense in which four dimensional spacetime is kind of a generalization of three dimensional space. And I think to really explain this we're gonna need a blackboard.","30":"Let's bring one in. All right. The thing about relativity is that they really want you to think of spacetime as one four dimensional thing, right? It's kind of like space. It's not just three dimensions of space and one dimension of time.","31":"Why? This is a very good question. So, let's just start with space, right? We know a little bit about space. So here's my simple minded way of drawing space two dimensions, because that's how many I can draw on the blackboard. Let's say X and Y. And what is special about space, there's many things, but one is that if I have a curve or a path between two points, there's a distance that you can calculate, right? And the distance between those two points doesn't depend on your coordinates. It doesn't depend on whether you're in radial coordinates or Cartesian coordinates, or whatever. I'm allowed to imagine a curve that does something like this between those two points, and if I were a person walking on that curve, I would have an odometer with me maybe, and I would know, you would know, even without having done that, this path is always gonna be longer than that path. There's a formula, Pythagoras' Theorem that tells you what the shortest distance path is. That's the point. The physical-ness of what is real is the distance along a certain curve. So spacetime is like that. That's why it is useful to think about spacetime.","32":"When people ask me can you travel through time? I say yes, yesterday I traveled 24 hours into the future and here I am, a day later. So that's just this. Okay, you're moving through time, like it or not. So what Einstein says is look, I can travel through spacetime in different ways, like I could hop in a rocket ship and fly out and then fly back, and then I could meet you there. So this is a different trajectory through spacetime, right?","33":"And it's almost exactly like the space story. The space story says there's a distance, distance is different along different curves. Einstein says there's something that measures the length of these curves, and we call it the proper time. It is literally the time that you would read on your wristwatch.","34":"And the crucial difference is that time is not the same for this person who stayed behind and sat in their chair, and this person who zoomed out there.","35":"There is what we call a metric on spacetime, and when we talk about Euclidean space versus a curved space, versus a sphere or something, that's a different metric. And spacetime has its own metric which says the following thing, that the path between two events in spacetime that is a straight line, will always be the longest time.","36":"So when Einstein had this idea, oh gravity could be related to the curvature of spacetime, he did some equations, so he got it, that's a long story, we'll put that aside. What he figured out was that rather than gravity living on top of spacetime, it's a manifestation of the curvature of spacetime so when you have like the earth, the sun, the moon, they cause a gravitational field, they're actually warping the spacetime around them. They're giving it a different geometry.","37":"Yeah, exactly. If you had a sheet that was originally flat, and you set a marble on it, it would go in a straight line, but then if you put something on it so it warps it, that marble is now gonna be deflected.","38":"Yeah, that's right. And it goes exactly back to what we drew on the board where how those two people in the train and on the ground would divide spacetime up differently to space and time.","39":"So in Amazing Grace, you start with F. You know, if I go (melodic humming) \u266a How sweet the sound \u266a (scat singing) (laughs) Where am I right now? I don't know where I am. (scat singing) And my job is to get back home, but to make this chord make sense.","40":"You know, a lot of people, a lot of string theorists, they care a lot about all the different ways in which we could hide the extra dimensions. As someone who cares about cosmology, I wanna start asking why are the extra dimensions small at all? How did that happen? Is this something you think about yourself?","41":"The thing I want to talk about is this paper I wrote with Matt Johnson and Lisa Randall where we realize there's another way to compactify extra dimensions spontaneously, dynamically. If you imagine starting with this big piece of paper you couldn't wrap up everything, but within some region of space you could make a tube.","42":"Yeah. So we certainly assume that they're all large as a starting point, and it's worse than that. So in our paper we imagine you start in de Sitter space. You start in a universe with no matter, no anything like that, just empty space but with an energy that is positive and all the dimensions are large.","43":"Yeah, I've been trying to explain this to lower levels, and they always look at me like, are you pulling my leg here a little bit? Or is this the real thing that they use? Yes, it is the real thing they use. We study these branes in de Sitter space, and so what we found is that there are black brane solutions which instead of having a singularity inside are non-singular, and stable, and compactified. Is this a familiar thing? I know things like this have been discussed, right?","44":"Right. Imagine that rather than going down to a point, it just asymptotes to some fixed radius that continues infinitely far down there. But then you can ask, okay what about the rest of the universe? You have some sphere, some two dimensions compactified, and the balance between the cosmological constant and the electromagnetic field keeps it at a fixed distance.","45":"But then the other dimensions, the transverse dimensions, don't need to be anti-de Sitter. They can have either positive, zero, or negative cosmological constant. So you can basically get any sort of cosmological solution times a compactified sphere.","46":"I guess. I mean, maybe you'd think otherwise. Again or maybe you could change my mind, I think that as long as it can happen it will happen some of the time, right?","47":"Someone probably wrote it for him. So it's possible that if you do have this starting point of an empty de Sitter space with positive cosmological constants and fields lying around you inevitably get a multiverse. It just happens, you know, it's just part of quantum nucleation to different things, and then maybe you need to explain why we live in this universe rather than some other one via the anthropic principle or something like that. So how does our kind of, you know, low-tech old fashioned way of making new universes intersect with the kinds of things you'd think about.","48":"And if we put aside for the second the concerns of our colleagues in other parts of physics, and it's just amongst us chickens, what do you think about the future of cosmology and string theory, and the dynamics of these extra dimensions?","49":"And I just wrote a book called Something Deeply Hidden about many worlds, quantum mechanics, and how spacetime can emerge from it. Plenty of reading material for the audience out there.","50":"The reason we're not just flying off the earth is because earth has gravity, so if we throw something up, it comes back down, so that's why when we're walking on the earth, we don't fly off the earth because the earth has gravity, and it keeps us down.","51":"The main thing about black hole to remember is that it's just, like I said, how the earth holds you down, the black hole pulls you in, as well. Now, try and take the ball from me, black hole--","52":"Alright, so, at some point, you can probably see it right now? So without moving your eyes, this is kind of hard, tell me how many fingers I'm holding up?","53":"You can just barely tell. And you can see that even, like if you hold out your hand and you focus on your hand, then your foot would be blurry because there's that difference there. And you can change between that, like you can then focus on your foot and your hand gets blurry. Because your eyes can see different amounts of detail in different places. So we're hoping in the future, that hardware can be like that. Where we can make a display that puts lots of detail right where you're looking. And every time you look someplace else, it moves the detail over to there. So we don't need to render a hundred times as much as we've got right now. Figuring out where you're looking is a pretty hard problem. What we try to go about this, is by taking a camera and looking at people's eyes and then try to figure out is the eye looking over here or up here. We're working hard on stuff like this right now so we hopefully can have a virtual reality that's as detailed and realistic feeling as the reality that we've actually got around us. But its going to be a long time before we get to where we can really fool people.","54":"Okay. So this is about high intensity lasers. Not only how do you make them, but what was really stopping them being made in both cases is non linear optics. We wanna do something that requires a huge photon density application, and so that's how come we came up with chirped pulse amplification, so that we could stretch the pulse, safely amplify it, then compress it at the end, and then we're ready to do whatever we want at the end. So what do you think the main difference is between the continuous wave laser that you have that runs at 10 watts and a chirped pulse amplifier?","55":"And so we get the power with a lot less energy 'cause its power is energy per unit time. So we aren't depositing much energy in comparison. Can I just ask, 'cause you are using the thermal process of it heating up, but have you ever had the opportunity to use laser tweezers?","56":"So chirped pulse amplification took us sort of from, we were at 10 to the 12, but when I was working the 10 to the 12 sort of sat on a football sized field. It was a kilojoule laser with a nanosecond pulse. And we brought it down to something we call tabletop terawatt. So it was the same terawatt but now it was one joule and one picosecond, so it could fit on a basic optical bench like you would have in your lab. We were able to take that up to, I think the record is right around somewhere between 10 to the 22 and 10 to the 23 watts per square centimeter. So then in going forward, one of the holy grails is can we reach 10 to the 29 watts per square centimeter? So we still have six orders. So we've gone from 10 to the 12 to 10 to the 23. So we've done 11 orders, so you think six isn't so much harder. I have to tell you, over time, it's rolling over. We need another Nobel Prize winning idea. But if we get out there, that's where, if you focus the intensity, the energy in that volume is enough to break the vacuum.","57":"I don't know if people are working on that because I'm not so much in the medical field, but I should look into that and see if that's a possibility. So after hearing about high intensity lasers, can you think about next time you go back to the lab and you're wondering how to do something in the lab with lasers, can you see how short pulses might help you?","58":"Mostly today, I've been talking a lot about what can we do, what's possible. We think might be possible in the next couple of years. But really at the professional level its more the question of wisdom of what should we be doing.","59":"As an engineer of course, I love quantifiable things. I like saying here's my 18 millisecond motion to photon, here's my angular resolution that I'm improving. I'm doing the color-space right. But you can look not too far back where you say we have blu-ray DVDs at this amazing resolution, but more people want to watch Youtube videos at really bad early internet video speeds. Where there are things that if you deliver a value to people then these objective quantities may not be the most important thing. And while we're certainly pushing as hard as we can on lots of these things that make the experience better in potentially every way or maybe just for videos or for different things. I don't think that its necessary. I've commented that I think usually my favorite titles on mobile that are fully synthetic are ones that don't even try, they just go and do light-mapped, black-shaded. And I think its a lovely aesthetic. I think that you don't wind up fighting all of the aliasing. While you get some other titles that, oh we're gonna be high-tech with our specular bump maps with roughness. And you've got aliasing everywhere, and you can't hold frame rate and its all problematic. While some of these that are clearly very synthetic worlds where its nothing but these cartoony flat-shaded things with lighting, but they look and they feel good. And you can buy that you're in that place. And you want to know what's around that monolith over there.","60":"The end goal of reality, of course in computer graphics people chase photo-realistic form for a long time. And basically, we've achieved it. Photo-realism, if you're willing to throw enough discreet path traced rays at things, you can generate photo-realistic views. And we understand the light really well. Of course it still takes a half hour per frame like it always has, or more, to render the different things. So its an understood problem and given infinite computing power we could be doing that in virtual reality. However, a point that I've made to people in recent years is that, we are running out of More's Law. Maybe we'll see some wonderful breakthrough in quantum structures or whatever--","61":"You know there's tons of opportunities for the synthetic case where you want to be able to have your synthetic fantasy world where everybody is a creature that's created by the computer and simulated reasonably. But of course we've got, you know we still don't do people well simulated. That's a hard problem, we've been beating our heads against it for a long time. I do think we're making progress and I wouldn't bet on that being solved in 10 years, but maybe 20 years. Because it is going to take a lot of AI. Its going to take a lot of machine-learning, where its not going to be a matter of us dissecting all the micro-expressions that people do. Its gonna be lets take every youtube video ever made and run it through some enormous learner that's going to figure out how to make people realistic.","62":"I'm still a believer that the magic's out there. We haven't found it yet, so somebody's going to happen upon the formula. I feel like I've felt little pockets of magic.","63":"All right, you're in the wrong place. [laughs] We're not gonna be talking about biology or computer science. So we wanna talk about the idea of dimensions. Do you know what dimension is? How we would define dimensions?","64":"Well, we could also say how far we are away from the center, just the distance. And then the angle that our little line makes with let's say the X axis.","65":"Time. Yes, Einstein said that we can think of time as a fourth dimension, and that's a very fascinating thing that we could talk about all by itself. But what about space? What about the solar system? Like, if you wanted to tell me where a certain star was in the sky, do you know how we do that?","66":"So astronomers call them right ascension and declination, which are two terrible words, but basically you've seen on the globe where you draw latitude and longitude, what it looks like.","67":"We don't know. You know, the optimistic view is that there are six, but the thing is, some of them might be really, really, really, really, really small, like way too small for us to ever see.","68":"You know, honestly out there, if you go out onto campus and talk to the physicists, half of them will say probably extra dimensions exist, and half of them say no, that's just nonsense.","69":"So we've been, we've had, now, effectively two different ways of getting more direct measurements, one is the LIGO, which is the Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory, which is where, getting the ripples in space time, coming off of the merging of black holes. The other one that you're mentioning is actually called the Event Horizon Telescope, where they're using radio waves to actually image the event horizon, that region where light cannot escape from the black hole at the center of our galaxy, which I know they're working on it right now. It's an amazing thing, but that'll be the most direct imaging of a black hole. LIGO is a direct detection of the consequence of the merging of black holes. The critical part has been, like, for the super massive black hole at the center of our galaxy, we've seen the stars orbiting it, and we've measured the mass, so that way, so if you look at a spinning black hole, it actually fundamentally alters the emission that's coming off the stuff that's falling into it. These are discovered as what are called X-ray binaries, that is, you know, there's an X-ray member of the binary that is emitting in the X-rays, and it's really not very bright in the optical (mumbles) at all, so there's always, people are looking at these X-ray binaries.","70":"For my studies, I actually, when I started at UCLA in graduate school, I worked with a professor named Matt Malkin who was, gotten a lot of data observations from the Hubble Space Telescope, so that was one of my very first projects to work on, so any, space-based observatories have been a really big advantage, and then I've moved on now to the Spitzer Space Telescope. In addition to that, then there's other people who've used a lot of X-ray telescopes, NuSTAR, Chandra have used data from that. It's been a combination of both ground-based observatories, as well as space-based ones, and going everywhere from X-ray observations, not done by me, but certainly ultraviolet, and then optical, and infrared, particularly, those are the ones that I've been most involved with.","71":"That's pretty good. So gravity wants to attract us to the Earth, and the Earth to us. But the Earth is so much bigger that even though we're actually pulling the Earth a little bit to us, you don't notice it so much. You know, the Moon pulls on the Earth a little bit.","72":"[Janna] Exactly, the Moon is such a big body compared to anything else very nearby that it has the larger effect, pulling the water of the Earth. But more than the Moon, think about the Sun pulling on the Earth. We orbit the whole Sun, just the way the Earth pulls on the Moon and causes the Moon to orbit us. All of those things are acting on you and me right now.","73":"That's such a good question. No, we actually couldn't. In the Moon, gravity is weaker, you can almost float between footsteps if you look at the astronauts on the Moon. On the Earth, it's harder, 'cause it's bigger. If you go to a bigger, heavier planet, it gets harder and harder. But there are stars that have died that are so dense that there's no way we could lift our arms, no way we could step or walk. The gravity is just way too strong. Do you know how tall you are?","74":"Maybe four three. People think that while you're sleeping, your body has a chance to stretch out and gravity isn't crunching you together, but when you're standing or walking or sitting, the gravity contracts your spine ever so slightly, so that in the morning you might be a little bit taller than in the evening. See if it works for you. [Woman] Wow.","75":"They say that astronauts in space, definitely their spine elongates. There were two twin astronauts, one who stayed here on Earth and the other who went to the International Space Station. He was there for a long time, and when he came back, he was actually taller than his twin brother.","76":"But it's a good story. So Isaac Newton realized that even if you're heavier, you will fall at the same rate as something much lighter, that that's the same. Once you hit the ground, if you're heavier, you'll hit the ground with much greater force, but you will hit the ground at the same time.","77":"They look the same, but this is much heavier, right? Okay, so try it, just try holding your arms up front, a little higher maybe, give them a chance to drop, and then drop them. [balls thud] [Janna laughs] Did they fall at the same time? Did they hit at the same time? So, Isaac Newton, he was also the one who realized that that's the same force that keeps the Moon in orbit around the Earth and the Earth in orbit around the Sun, and that's a huge leap. Here he is, looking at just things around him, and then looks at the stars and has this really big realization, that that's actually the same force. So, what have you learned today talking about gravity?","78":"It turns out, for people that are between the ages of 18 and 65, the agreed upon amount of sleep that people should get is between seven and nine hours, and it's really at least seven hours per night, to maintain optimal health as an adult. So at least seven hours. When we look at across all of the data that is available on like sleep and health, and sleep and psychiatric illness and those types of things, the largest risk is when people get five hours or less. What do you think is responsible for driving how much sleep you need, and things like that?","79":"Right. You can do part of this level, and you can do the other part, clearly. Got some expertise under your belt, and that's awesome, because I think that everyone should know more about sleep. And so the way that we think about what drives sleep are two independent but related processes and so they have kind of lame names. Process S and process C, and what you've kind of described is process C, and that's the master clock, right? And it helps regulate kind of the rhythms like all over your body, all your cells, and all those kind of things. It drives the release of melatonin from the pineal gland, and melatonin comes online under darkness, so when the sun goes down, your brain knows okay it's time to start getting ready for sleep, and so you start releasing melatonin, which really kind of sets the table for sleeping.","80":"So yeah it's a light bulb and there's a couple of mirrors. Now the light bulb has to be a little bit special. It has to be a type of material that can store the energy in an excited state right? It has to stay up there really energetic and sit there for a while so that when the light comes along, it takes that energy and becomes stronger light and then the mirror sends it back and it does it again and again and again and between these two mirrors, it makes the light come out in a nice beam. In a laser, it comes out as a single color. They all come out with their waves at the same time. Every wave peaks at the same time which then makes it a giant wave and it's this giant wave that has a tremendous amount of power. So it can do something like cutting steel. But when you cut steel, or if you were cutting this floor, it's gray, it actually will absorb the light. That's why the light, you don't see it because the light isn't bouncing back or through it. So I like to use demos to explain how my laser works. So I've brought basically a hammer and a nail. I'm sure you've probably hammered a nail before into a piece of wood but the question is, if you asked yourself why it is we hit the big end and it's the tiny end that we put on the piece of wood. We could never pick up a hammer and hit the sharp end and hope this would go in to the piece of wood.","81":"That's right. All the force that we apply here, goes all the way through but then it can only basically come out when it contacts the wood in that one tiny spot. And so sometimes it's the force that you push something with but sometimes it is that force per unit area. But sometimes it's not even the force per unit area 'cos, you know, push down as hard as you can on that and see if we can get it pushed in. See it doesn't really work does it?","82":"Well it depends. So if you're cutting steel, you need to have the nail. You need to have it concentrated all of the light, not going in all directions but you need it into as small a point as possible. And for that we use a lens. For a lens, the light's coming down as a column, you put in a lens, it all focuses it down in the same way as the nail and then it starts cutting that steel. Okay so that force per unit area--","83":"Exactly. You know sometimes you want to have all of your energy not just in a small area but in the small volume and so one of the other dimensions is time or length. But with light, time and length are the same thing because light always travels at the speed of light.","84":"But if you send a one second long light pulse out into the skies there, the beginning of the pulse is actually two thirds of the way to the moon. It's 300,000 kilometers long. So now, if you talk about light being concentrated, that doesn't seem very concentrated. The type of lasers I play with in my lab will be no thicker than this piece of paper. So we take that energy that might be in three hundred thousand kilometers and we squeeze it all the way down into just this piece of paper and actually the beams are more the size of this piece of paper and so, in my lab, pieces of paper like this would be flying through the sky but we can't see them. 'Cos they don't come in our eyes, they fly by us and they're infra red.","85":"Exactly. And so now, if we have light like that that we wanna machine with. I bring this funnel and so, if we had a lens here and the light was coming down--","86":"Into a spot. So here would be my light coming from my laser and it would just be coming down, down, down, down, down. Hit a lens and it would have to focus down. But now, all the light started out with this big of a spread so concentrated this much. Eventually it would be here, more concentrated. But by the end, right at the focal spot, that's when I get all of my light, all of the energy has been squeezed down into fitting inside this piece of paper and that's why I say that I built a laser hammer. Because when this hits a piece of glass, it just smacks hose electrons right off the atoms and there's nothing else for them to do, they have to fly away. So can you tell me what you learned and maybe about the focusing of the light?","87":"It does seem to be that it may not even, in parts, it may not be even connected to this tiny, little torus at all because part of the work that I did, and others have done, is that type twos preferentially live in different kinds of galaxies than type ones, which should not in any way have to do with something such a small scale. They tend to be in smaller bulged, SB and SC type spiral galaxies. So there's something also having to do with environment that gets you to be a type two, and you can still maybe, timing wise, but there's something else that's going on on a larger scale because the type of the AGN should not really correspond to the host galaxy, but it seems to. And that was one of the things that we were finding out, and that was one of the early little ideas that the, individually, just as the torus model, the unified model, can't explain everything that we were observing at the time. But it is one of those things that it's, they're super luminous, they're all over the place, and we don't have a really good picture of it, which makes it exciting to study.","88":"You try, we all gotta try. You've probably heard about sleep as this kind of, you know, it's a biological process that happens in your brain. It's really important for your body, but it's a lot more complex than that. Sleep is made up of different parts. You know, when you think about sleep, what do you think about?","89":"But being off is not just being off. There's lots of things that are happening. We're gonna kind of talk about those different pieces of sleep.","90":"So our sleep is made up of different types, okay? The first one is called non-rapid eye movement sleep, or non-REM, okay? Or NREM. And then the other one, which might not be a surprise, is called REM. Rapid eye movement sleep. And those are the two main types of sleep that happen. The way that we measure that as a sleep scientist is that we'll actually bring people into the lab where they can do this at home, where we put electrodes on their scalp while they're sleeping, and that allows us to measure the brain activity that's going on during the night.","91":"When we measure all of that, we're able to see how much time someone's asleep, and how many times they wake up and stuff during the night. You know, we're also really interested in kind of, the amount of non-REM sleep someone gets and the amount of REM sleep that someone gets, because each part of those types of sleep do different things for the body. And so it's important to get both of those. And so within non-REM sleep, there are three stages ranging from N-1 to N-2 to N-3. So not particularly clever in our naming, but that's how we know what stages they are. And what they do is it moves from lightest to deepest sleep, okay? N-1, it's more kind of light, wakefulness sleep, kind of in and out of sleeping. Then you go into N-2, which is where we spend 45 to 55 percent of our sleep. And it's more this kind of light sleep, but then we get into kind of the really restorative sleep, and that's N-3. And in N-3, when we look at someone's EEG wave, we see these big slow waves, and it's called slow wave sleep. And so we spend about 20% of our sleep in slow wave sleep, though it can vary on a day to day.","92":"You know, some of that is totally accurate, that like when your brain's more engaged by being on your phone or doing things that you really enjoy or things that stress you out or any of those types of things, it's harder to get to sleep and to kind of fall into that deeper levels of sleep. Most of the REM sleep, this dreaming sleep, happens in the second half of the night.","93":"Okay? So we wake up a lot during the night, and we just don't remember it. And you'll go back down into deep sleep, and then up again into REM, you know, in kinda these cycles.","94":"Okay. Usually we want to keep naps, like 20 to 30 minutes. When people drop into deep sleep, and then they're woken up out of a nap, most people report that they feel way worse than they did before they took the nap, and that's because you've been in deep sleep, and it's this term called sleep inertia. So what are the stages of sleep?","95":"I think to really get deep into nanomaterials and nanoscale devices, you really have to understand to some level, quantum mechanics. What it teaches us as we make these devices smaller and smaller, their properties begin to now depend on the size and the orientation of these devices. There are materials, and you're taking a 2D materials class, you know about this, that are intrinsically thin. As they're grown, as they're fabricated, they're already at the nanoscale and they possess these quantum confinement properties that as a nanotechnologist, you try to exploit. And so the first ones I wanted to talk to you about are quantum dots, have you heard of quantum dots before?","96":"That's correct. Yeah. Because of quantum confinement, once you get below this 15 nanometer range, the band gap of the material depends completely on the size of the material. So in bulk materials, if you want to change the band gap, you have to change the material, right? But in these quantum dots specifically, just by changing the size, you can change their band gap. And because their band gap is changing, their optical properties are different. And you can precisely tune the wavelength of light that they emit just by changing their size.","97":"The optical applications are in development. The science has really been worked out. The health stuff, because of all of the things you have to consider when you're putting something in someone's body is definitely further out there. For example, some of them are made from cadmium. Cadmium's toxic. You would never put that in someone's body. But there are other materials like gold and silver and titanium dioxide, which are less toxic and people are exploring using those. So have you learned about graphene?","98":"Carbon nanotube, right. So if you roll up graphene, depending on how you roll it and the angle, you roll it with, it has different properties. So if I roll it one way, it'll act like a metal. If I roll it a different way, it'll act like a semiconductor. The one that gets everyone most excited is that the electrons and holes move very fast through graphene. And so there's a lot of interest in using these for certain types of high-speed electronics. The other interesting application is because it's one atom thin, it's very sensitive to changes in the environment. And so there's a lot of interest in using them as diagnostics. It's on us researchers to find ways to A, control that process and then B, to actually build some sort of interesting technology from them.","99":"You're speaking my language. This is what I spent many years of my life working on. You don't physically roll up graphene. You grow nanotubes by basically taking nanocrystals and you deposit them on a surface. And then you do a CVD process, chemical vapor deposition. So you basically flow in a carbon source, the carbon dissolves in a nanocrystal and then once nanocrystal is saturated, the nanotubes precipitate out of them in tubes. Then you have to develop ways to go into this pile of nanotubes and pull out exactly the ones that you want. So I have to find ways to program them to go exactly in the places that I want. I modify the surface of the nanotube with specific molecules that recognize one type of surface over another. And then I just pattern the surface and the tubes just land exactly where we want them to. And it's still very much in the research stage. The ultimate goal is to build functional high-speed electronics using these new materials.","100":"So machine learning is a way that we teach computers to learn things about the world by looking at patterns and looking at examples of things. So can I show you an example of how a machine might learn something?","101":"That's true. Do you think, if we look at these pictures, do you think maybe we could say, Well, they both have pointy ears, but the dogs have a different kind of body and the cats like to stand up a little different.? Do you think that makes sense?","102":"This one's a jackal. And it's actually a kind of dog. But you made a good guess. That's what machines do too. They make guesses. Is this a cat or a dog?","103":"And so, you did something pretty amazing there. Because we asked the question, Is it a cat or a dog? And you said, I disagree with your question. It's a human. So machine learning is when we teach machines to make guesses about what things are based on looking at a lot of different examples. And I build products that use machine learning to learn about the world and make guesses about things in the world. When we try to teach machines to recognize things like cats and dogs, it takes a lot of examples. We have to show them tens of thousands or even millions of examples before they can get even close to as good at it as you are. Do you have tests in school?","104":"So machines work the same way. If you show them a lot of examples and give them practice, they'll learn how to guess. And then when you give them the test, they should be able to do that. So we looked at eight pictures and you were able to answer really quickly. But what would you do if I gave you 10 million examples? Would you be able to do that so quickly?","105":"So one of the differences between people and machines is that people might be a little better at this, but can't look at 10 million different things. So now that we've been talking about machine learning, is this something you want to learn how to do?","106":"Yes, we're gonna talk about science and we're gonna talk about a very specific kinda science, about people who study brains. Do you know what a brain is? What is it?","107":"Okay, well there's more cells in your brain, like way more cells, than all the stars we can see. (Daniel gasps) (Bobby laughs) And so what the connectome is, is we'd like to know where every cell in your brain is and how it talks to every other cell in your brain.","108":"Maybe a mutual acquaintance of ours, Jasper gave a example of fault injection, and I like to use that as, when I'm trying to explain fault injection, he shows a pinball machine and the pinball machine, obviously the two inputs are the two plungers when you're playing a pinball machine, but fault injection, you can tilt the entire pinball machine, right? You're just introducing some external variable that's outside of the traditional inputs that you're used to and you've now controlled the environment in a advantageous way to the user or the player. Can you give an example of some type of fault injection that you're doing or working on?","109":"We're also scratching the surface of, like, what is possible? It's not necessarily just the system itself and not necessarily that algorithm itself. Like you said, you don't necessarily need to attack the math in some cases. You can just attack that check. And I think something that's been pretty cool is looking at higher energy particles. It's going to be maybe hard to entirely confirm, but I think it'd be really, really cool to actually see. Like, I want to see one of these faults because I haven't seen it myself. And also, how do you know that you've seen it? I've started playing with, like, setting up a cloud chamber. A cloud chamber lets you actually view high energy particles going through sort of like in a small jar with some evaporated alcohol. And I thought it'd be really cool if we put some memory chip in there, like a basic memory chip and we just fill it with some data, but then you put a camera on that area and you just watch. Assuming that there is a high energy particle that actually hits that memory, that should potentially flip the energy state of that bit. The outside microcontrollers should be able to read that and actually say, Oh wait, the data, even though I'm not changing data, I'm only reading data, and we should be able to visibly or optically see it. What I'm wondering is could that be a next area of research? Because I don't think anyone's actually looking at intentionally injecting high energy particles to take over a computer, when really, you know, that's another technique for fault injection, technically speaking.","110":"The thing is, even if you know about that, then there's so many others that someone won't necessarily know about, because there's so many, I guess, potential areas for a fault to occur. Where do you think security is going or new research is going? Are there any new areas you think are coming out or are going to be more interesting, you know, pretty soon?","111":"For me, I think the things that have been recent and super interesting are typically down to physics-level effects that maybe we haven't seen before. I think my mind was blown with the, there was the light commands research, and they were able to modulate sound, although it's purely over light using a laser, they would hit the MEMS microphone, and it was picking that up and was able to then interpret it and essentially take control over light.","112":"You got, pretty much, you got a very good idea about it. Basically you have a star, at the core its generating energy, which is countering the pressure of all that mass trying, being pulled in by gravity. Once it can't generate that energy anymore, the core collapses, once the core is collapsing, it keeps collapsing, and collapsing, and collapsing, and that's the critical thing that makes a black hole. You have enough mass in the volume, such that the escaped velocity becomes the speed of light, once light can't escape, hence the black part. (laughs) But that's the thing, is that just because there's an intense amount of gravity very close to a black hole, things don't start behaving differently. And my favorite analogy is a vacuum, everybody thinks, like, if you point a vacuum cleaner at something, it's just gonna suck everything in--","113":"Right, you will feel the gravitational pull, and it'll redirect you in some way, and if you're far enough way, it's just like you're very far away from the sun, or something else. If you're close enough, it will divert your path more, if you're close enough still, then you will get what are called tidal forces, where the difference between, for example, if you're standing next to a black hole, the difference in gravity between your feet and your head actually becomes significant. Next time you see a science fiction movie, if somebody says, Oh, my god, we've been caught in the gravitation field of a black hole, and we're gonna fall in, it's like, no, no, just, if you're far enough away, just thrust a little bit this way, and then you'll slingshot around the black hole.","114":"I wouldn't call them educational, but the movie Interstellar actually had, as one of the people involved in both writing it, and as a science advisor, Dr. Kip Thorne, who's a Professor at Caltech, who was part of the team that detected gravitational waves, and just won a Nobel Prize for it. So he made sure to try and get it as accurate as possible, so Interstellar, I think, is one of the best examples of getting black holes right.","115":"Well, you're absolutely right that the attention machine learning gets has grown dramatically. 20 years ago, going to gatherings and telling people what I was working on and seeing the blank face or the like, Where's the turn? and walk away. Like, Oh, no. The accessibility of the tooling, like, we can now do in, like, five lines of code something that would have taken 500 lines of very mathematical, messy, gnarly code even, you know, five years ago. And that's not an exaggeration. And there are tools that mean that pretty much anyone can pick this up and start playing with it and start to build with it. And that is also really exciting.","116":"And part of the challenge of it is not the mathematics of building models, but the challenge is making sure that the data is sufficiently representative, potentially high quality.","117":"Right. And so, to say that another way, when you're collecting data from the real world and then building machine learning systems that automate decisions based on that data, all of the biases and problems that are already in the real world then can be magnified through that machine learning system. And so, it can make many of these problems much worse.","118":"These are great questions. So things like actuarial science, operations research, where they actually are not using machine learning as much as you might think. And then you have other sorts of companies or on the FinTech side, or even the ad tech side of things where they perhaps are using machine learning to the point of even absurdity.","119":"So when we think about the next five to 10 years, the things that are really still holding us back are these uneven applications of resources to problems because the problems that get attention are the high value ones in terms of how much money you can make or the things that are fashionable enough that you can publish a paper on it. So what do you think is holding us back?","120":"A lot of origami is animals, birds and things. There's also a branch of origami that is, it's more abstract or geometric, called tessellations. Tessellations, like most origami, are folded from a single sheet of paper but they make patterns, whether it's woven patterns like that, or woven patterns like this. If you hold them up to the light you can see patterns.","121":"The thing that makes them cool is they're sort of like tilings, it looks like you could put this together by cutting little pieces of paper and sliding them together, but they're still one sheet.","122":"Mm-hmm. Each of these folds is peaked like a mountain and we call these mountain folds but if I made it the other way, then it's shaped this way and we call it a valley fold. In all of origami there's just mountains and valleys.","123":"So they're all reversible and it turns out that in every origami shape that folds flat, it's going to be either three mountains and a valley or, if we're looking at the backside, three valleys and a mountain, they always differ by two.","124":"That's a rule of all flat origami no matter how many folds come together at a point and I'm going to show you a building block of tessellations, it's called a twist because that center square, as I unfold it, it twists, it rotates.","125":"If I had another twist in the same sheet of paper I could make these folds connect with that, and these folds connect with that. And if I had another one up here, I could make all three. And if I had a square array and all the folds lined up I could make bigger and bigger arrays, like these, because these are just very large twists. In this case it's an octagon rather than a square, but they're arranged in rows and columns. And let's just try going along. All right, there is our tessellation with squares and hexagons. So you have now designed and folded your first origami tessellation and perhaps you can see how just using this idea of building up tiles and small building blocks you could make tessellations as big and complex as you want.","126":"We have to use electron microscopes and then what we have been developing a way to slice the brain into really thin slices, use an electron microscope to take a picture of each slice, and then use computers to put it all back. Imagine that we could get a map of every connection, right? And we knew how neurons fire. Do you think we could put that in a computer, that map, and then therefore, that computer should be able to think just like the brain that we extracted it from?","127":"Neurons are also digital. Meaning a Neuron either fires or it doesn't fire, so that's either one or zero. And it's the combination of those ones or zeros that actually produce the 10 thousand different answers that you say.","128":"So fortunately there's, I'm also doing it from space with the Spitzer Space Telescope, so particularly in the infrared, and my main interest has been to try and study the environment around the super massive black holes, not as close as where the X-rays are coming from, but clearly there's something from the X-ray corona that illuminates the rest of the accretion disk, and the dust that's further out. And so fundamentally, that's one of the key things that I'm trying to use, is trying to see how long, once you've got this sort of pulse that's generated close to the black hole, it propagates out, and so you can use optical wavelengths to see that the accretion disk lights up in the optical a little bit as it gets heated up from the X-ray, and then later on, the infrared dust, the dust absorbs it, and emits it in the infrared. And so that, I love that, the ability to exchange time for resolution, because these structures are so far away that we're never gonna get a telescope big enough where that has the resolution to see the accretion disk, or the dust distribution around--","129":"It's a weird thing to be sitting in your own galaxy, but not be able to separate all these, four million solar mass black hole creating, next to, how massive, it's like two to three solar masses for the X-ray binaries?","130":"Which is great, although it still doesn't help us in the AGN community, because we don't know how the millions to billions solar mass black holes came to be. But it's, at least we're building up, or hopefully that at some point, and by understanding these lower mass, how these lower mass black holes came to be, then we can see where there are a large scale number of mergers can potentially give us this, or you really need something, other, another corridor to fundamentally get us something that's a million solar masses, you know, on the minimum side, but definitely, you know, we've gotten those which are billion. So we know we can merge the million solar mass black holes to get the bigger ones, but how do you get to those in the beginning, particularly so early in the universe, when you get quasars at really high red shifts, so they're really early on.","131":"And this goes to the idea that you don't have a core balance, that a supernova with a black hole as its final result, actually never has any kind of expulsion, that it all just goes. (imitates sucking)","132":"Which was one idea, but again, it's, I'll leave this to your theoreticians, I think there are problems with that, as well. I call it job security. That's right. (both laugh) We have a lot of things about black holes, both in terms of their formation, or even how they exist as they are, and how they're interacting with their environment that we're still not understanding.","133":"Do you think there are going to be general principles that guide those decisions? Because right now, it's generally up to the machine learning engineer to decide what tools they want to apply.","134":"If you train a model off of language off the internet, it sometimes says uncomfortable things or inappropriate things and sometimes really biased things. Have you ever run into this yourself? And then how do you think about that problem of potentially even measuring the bias in a model that we've trained?","135":"So when we think about quantum mechanics, we think about particles and their quantum charges in the Feynman way, the way that Feynman taught us. They come in and they exchange a force carrier and then they come out again, so that's how we think of an electron and light scattering, for instance, or something like that. And the language that Einstein gave us is so different. It's completely geometric, it's all this space-time. And it's also unnecessary.","136":"So do you think there's some sense in which we shouldn't be thinking about individual universes, individual space-time, so we should be thinking about superpositions of space-times?","137":"So when we're talking about the multiverse or the Big Bang, we are really talking about gravity ultimately, and we're talking about how a theory of gravitation which we know think of as a theory of space-time has a quantum explanation, has a quantum paradigm imposed on it that will help us understand these things, and we don't have that yet. One of the things that I think is so amazing is that the terrains in which we're going to understand quantum gravity are very few. It's the Big Bang, because that's where we know that quantum and gravity both were called into action. And there's black holes. One of the most interesting discoveries is of course Hawking's discovery, kick-started a kind of crisis, right? In thinking about why quantum mechanics and gravity were so knocking heads. It was one of the most beautiful examples.","138":"This is the Heisenberg's uncertainty principle in reality. You can't precisely say where the electron is, and you can't precisely say how quickly it's moving.","139":"This idea that the darkest phenomenon in the universe actually is forced to radiate quantum particles is pretty wild. I think everyone understood that it was a correct calculation, but I don't think a lot of people understood the implications, that it meant something really terrible was happening. Because this black hole, which could have been made of who knows what, is disappearing into these quantum particles which, in some sense, have nothing to do with the material that went in. So do you think that's a big crisis? The black hole evaporates, the information is lost?","140":"So this is a huge crisis 'cause either quantum mechanics is wrong, and as you described it, it's the most accurately-tested paradigm in the history of physics, how could it be wrong, right? Or the event horizon is letting information out and violating one of the most sacred principles of relativity.","141":"That's a nice way of looking at it. So that you're not actually violating classical relativity once you're in a regime where the wave function has really peaked around a very well-defined stage.","142":"Yes, so one of the things I like to think of with holography is that I can pack a certain amount of information in a black hole. I mean, you can literally think of it as throwing things into it. So let's say I have information in some volume and I'm under the illusion that I can just keep packing information in that volume, as much as the volume will contain. Eventually I'll make a black hole and I'll find out that the maximum amount of information I can pack into anything in the entire universe is what I can pack on the area. And since area is projecting the illusion, maybe, of volume, maybe the whole world is just a hologram. It's not a principle that only applies to black holes. It's saying that, if this theory of quantum gravity is correct, then this while three-dimensionality is an utter illusion and really the universe is two-dimensional. That's crazy.","143":"Do you think it's possible that gravity is really ultimately just quantum mechanics and doesn't exist at all in the fundamental ways that we've been talking about so far, like the Newtonian way and the space-time way, that those are just these kind of macroscopic illusions? Sometimes I talk about it in terms of temperature. Temperature is not a thing. There is no single thing called temperature. It's a macroscopic illusion that comes from the collective behavior, really quantum behavior of random motions of atoms. And is it possible that the whole of gravity is some kind of emergent illusion from what's really quantum phenomenon underlying it?","144":"I mean, temperature is still great to talk about. It doesn't mean we shouldn't talk about temperature. I mean, we should absolutely adjust our thermostats and talk about temperature. But if we look at it closer and closer and closer, we realize there's not a thing in the world that has as a quantum value temperature, isolated. And so maybe there is no such thing as gravity isolated from quantum mechanics.","145":"So that's just like saying there's the idea of a dual description. It's just saying there's a perfect dictionary between these two descriptions, and so to belabor which one's real is silly. It's like saying, is French or is English real?","146":"Okay, so we'll do some, but I want to tell you a little bit about origami. Most origami follows two, I'll call them customs, almost like rules. It's usually from a square and the other is it's usually folded with no cuts. So these guys are folded from an uncut square.","147":"Okay. We're going to start with a model that every Japanese person learns in kindergarten, it's called a crane, traditional origami design, it's over 400 years old. So, people have been doing what we're about to do for 400 years.","148":"Let's fold it in half from corner to corner, unfold it and then we'll fold it in half the other direction, also corner to corner but we're going to lift it up and we're going to hold the fold with both hands. We're going to bring these corners together, making a little pocket and then, this is the trickiest part of this whole design, so you're going to put your finger underneath the top layer and we're going to try to make that layer fold right along the edge. Now you see how the sides kind of want to come in as you're doing that?","149":"It's called a petal fold, it's a part of a lot of origami designs and it's key to the crane. Now we're ready for the magic. We're going to hold it in between thumb and forefinger, reach inside, grab the skinny point that's between the two layers, which are the wings, and I'm going to slide it out so it pokes out at an angle. We'll take the two wings, we spread them out to the side and you have made your first origami crane.","150":"Now, this is a traditional Japanese design but there are origami designs that have been around so long we're not entirely sure where they originated. We're going to learn how to fold a cootie catcher.","151":"So we'll start with the white side up and we're going to fold it in half from corner to corner, in one fold and now we're going to fold all four corners to the crossing point in the center. We'll fold it in half like a book. On the folded side we'll take one of the folded corners and I'm going to fold it up through all layers. There's a pocket in the middle. We're going to spread the pocket and bring all four corners together. Where you have original corners of the square, we're gonna just pop those out. This is one of the most satisfying moments, I think-","152":"There's thousands of other origami designs but these are some of the first people learn and this was, in fact, one of the first origami designs I learned some 50 years ago.","153":"A lot of people are seeing blockchain in the news and maybe seeing a lot of sort of initial coin offerings (laughs) and sort of monetization opportunity around blockchain and getting very excited about it. And some of that excitement is real and should be, you know, encouraged, but some of it is also hype. How do you feel about the hype cycle around blockchain today?","154":"And it's because we've had a lot of PR, a lot of proof of concept, but truthfully, this is more like a science, right?","155":"It will develop. It will take five years. It will take 10 years. That kind of time is necessary. One of the areas that brought me to supply chain research is the fact that we're not just gonna see blockchain emerge. We're gonna see artificial intelligence continue to evolve. We're gonna see connective devices and this sort of growing internet of things and machinery that can do a lot more and have a wallet and transact on their own. And so I actually think a lot of where blockchain and other technologies are headed is this interesting synergy that will help us elevate the kinds of institutions we've used in the past and cobbled together to create that identifiable, verifiable trust.","156":"When you say, well, there's hundreds of thousands, millions of car deaths on the road due to human error today. I think we're in a similar place. We're going to see problems with this technology, and we are going to need to develop multiple kinds of standards that also have some flexibility. But it's going to also be a version, a system, that allows us to fix some of the things that are broken today.","157":"Yeah, it's crazy. They're really a lot of bad or malicious hackers out there who are doing just that. They're going into people's accounts and they're stealing money, but there's also another side of computer hacking where there are people who are trying to learn how those bad hackers are actually breaking in to the bank accounts.","158":"Yeah, exactly. They're looking for ways that they can create protection. It's kind of like the lock on your front door. That lock is to essentially prevent bad people from coming in or people accidentally coming in when they shouldn't. A hacker is essentially looking at a way, how can I get into this lock? But then there are the good ones who are trying to unlock it so that they can tell the company that made the lock, hey, we can actually protect people by making the lock a little harder.","159":"In many cases, they'll send them a new lock. So it's an upgraded, better version. Sometimes that's new features, but sometimes that's bug fixes and ways to protect you as well.","160":"I started going on the computer and playing video games, but I had some ideas of my own, and that's where I started to learn how to hack. I wanted to play with my friends on this video game and just change the way that things look.","161":"That's entirely possible. They may have done it for a reason, but you may have come up with a really good idea that, do you think there are other people who might like the idea that you came up with?","162":"When you have creative ideas like that, hacking can actually allow you to change the way a system works, and that means you can change a game and how the game is played, and then you can share that with your friends and other people who like that game. Once I started learning how to do it, I found that, things that were harder for me, I could make easier.","163":"You know, you're right. When you read about some of these technologies, it does feel like science fiction. But the part of nanotechnology I wanted to talk to you about is stuff that you probably use every day, most of your day, all of the time. Can you guess what aspect of nanotechnology I'm gonna talk to you about?","164":"So this is a silicon wafer, and they're embedded in basically almost every object that you use, from a laptop, to a phone, to cars, television sets, appliances. We ended up cutting these into little squares and those repeating patterns, each of those is a processor. And those chips are what goes into all of these objects. What I want to talk to you about is how we got from where we started, and how we're able to actually fit 18 billion of these little devices in a little one inch by one inch area. They're called transistors. It's a switch. Very simply, think of it as a light switch that turns on and turns off using an electric field by applying a voltage.","165":"You have to make it smaller. Exactly. But here's the problem. So about 10 to 15 years ago, the devices got so small that if you shrunk them this gate, that actually turns it on and off loses its ability to control the channel. And so what they did, was they took devices like this into these things, we call them, FinFETs, kind of like a fin on a fish. So they're very thin transistors. The width of these fins is only six nanometers. Okay? So 6 nanometers is 25 to 30 atoms across. And they repeat this over the entire wafer just about perfectly. It's just a huge feat in engineering. But these types of devices are exactly the kind of devices that your phones and computers either have, or will have in the near future. And it's a way that nanotechnology is directly impacting you right now.","166":"Exactly. So these are made using a technique called lithography. You basically coat the silicon wafer with a polymer. Then you put a mask on it and then you shine light through it. And the features of the mask, the size of those holes determine the feature size in the chip. It's not just the size of the mask that matters. It's the wavelength of the light that's used. We talked about nanotechnology being science fiction before, but this is real stuff that's being produced, that's being made, that's being used every day by people.","167":"When you give up most of what you want? Well, sometimes that definitely happens for sure. What if I told you that this is the kind of technology that I work on that means you could trade with any kid all over the world?","168":"That's probably a good idea, maybe somebody else likes it more than you do. So normally, when people trade, they have to go to the store, or they have to know the person so they can get what they asked for. With blockchain, you can make that exact same trade, but you don't need the store, and you don't even necessarily need to know the other person.","169":"So on code.org, one of the things you've been doing is actually building a game or that they have a game and then you can actually rewire some of the inputs and outputs of that. Is that right?","170":"Okay. With computer hacking, it's actually the same thing. Really, you have some sort of system and you have a bunch of inputs and you have some sort of output, and actually you, as the designer, you're essentially designing games and software. You're saying, well, I will only allow a user to really control these inputs. Can you think of any inputs the computer might have?","171":"Yep, there's also things like your mouse and there's even things like the microphone itself is actually an input device. It's taking something from you, which is the sound and it's then transmitting that, ad it's actually sending it to me. Are there any other things that you can talk to a computer? You can give it information.","172":"That's absolutely another input that exists on your computer. That's how I try to think of things is there's just a bunch of inputs. Often, if you're trying to break something or hack something, you're really saying, okay, how can I control these inputs in a way that wasn't necessarily expected?","173":"It just depends what you're trying to do. In some cases, it could literally be seconds because you already know how the system works, and other times, it could be years. So what have you learned about hacking?","174":"Well, that's true, we do use slingshot technology once things are out in the solar system. So, for instance, we use Jupiter and other planets so that when some of the spacecraft gets close, it'll slingshot around and it'll cause it to speed up. But mostly, around the Earth, gravity pulls things down, so when we want to send a rocket into space, when we wanna go to the Moon, when we wanna send supplies to the International Space Station, the trick is to get something moving fast enough that it escapes the gravitational pull of the Earth. Have you heard the expression what goes up must come down? It's actually not true. If you throw it fast enough, you can actually get something that doesn't come back down again, and that's basically how rocket launches work. You have to get the rocket for the Earth to go more than 11 kilometers a second. Think of how fast it is. Just one breath and it's gone 11 kilometers. If you get it to go that fast, it's not gonna come back down again. So you know the International Space Station which is orbiting the Earth? That's going around the Earth at 17,000 miles an hour. It has no engines anymore, the engines are turned off. So it's just there falling forever. So once it's out there, it's not coming back down as long as it's cruising like that.","175":"In a weird way, that is gravity pulling it. So have you ever had a yo-yo where you swing it around like this? The string is pulling it in at all times, but you've also given it this angular momentum. And as long as you give it the angular momentum, pulling it in actually keeps it in orbit. And so the Earth is pulling it in at all times, so that's why it doesn't just travel off in a straight line. It keeps coming back around. So it's funny, people think that the International Space Station is so far away that they're not feeling gravity, and that's not the case at all. They're absolutely feeling gravity. They're just cruising so fast that, even though they're being pulled in, they never get pulled to the surface.","176":"Yeah, you feel pinned to that. It's exactly like that. There's something called the equivalence principle where people realized, especially Einstein, that if you were in outer space in a rocket ship and it was dark and painted and it was accelerating at exactly the right rate, you actually wouldn't know if you were sitting on the floor of a building around the Earth or if you were on a rocket ship that was accelerating.","177":"Yeah. You ever had that experience where you're sitting in a train and the other one moves and for a second you're not sure if you're the one moving?","178":"That's because in some sense, you're really not. Imagine you're in this train and it's going near the speed of light relative to the platform, but it's so smooth, then you should be in a situation in which there's no meaning to your absolute motion, there's no absolute motion. So that if you throw a ball up, you might think from the outside of the platform, be confused that when gravity pulls that back down, it's gonna hit you or something, but it'll land in your palm as surely as if you were in your living room.","179":"So imagine you were an astronaut and you were floating in empty space. You can't see anything. There's no stars, there's no Earth. You can ask yourself, am I moving? There's really no way for you to tell. So you would probably conclude, well, I'm not moving. So then your friend Marina comes cruising past you, and maybe she's going thousands of kilometers a second, and you say, Marina, you're cruising at thousands of kilometers a second, you're going so fast. But she had just done the same experiment. She was just floating in space thinking, Am I moving? There's no way to know which one of you is moving and there's no meaning to the absolute motion. The only thing that's true is that you're in relative motion, that's true. You both agree you're in relative motion, and that's clear. But neither of you can say it's actually you who's moving and I'm stationary.","180":"So, let's say you and Marina are floating in space and you can't tell who's moving. Let's say you both see a flash of light. A flash of light comes from somewhere, you don't know where. So you measure the speed of light to be 300,000 kilometers per second. But here comes Marina and she's racing at the light pulse, as far as you can tell. Two cars driving towards each other seem like they're going faster towards each other than somebody who's standing still relative to one of the cars, right?","181":"[laughs] That's exactly right. It kinda is like recharging your battery, right? And sleep is so critical for so many parts of our body and our mind, right? It plays a really important way that we learn, and it helps us kind of recover from the day before. It affects our immune system and our metabolism, all of these things that we need to kinda be healthy.","182":"And so what's really cool about this is that giraffes need to sleep like everybody else, and so the way that it does is it kind of slumps over and it gets down on its legs and it kind of becomes this ball, but what's crazy about the whole thing is they only sleep for like 30 minutes a day. 30 minutes! Because it can't waste any more time, because it can't be vulnerable for any longer. It can get eaten by lions and that kind of thing. It has kind of evolved in a way that it can still survive and still get all the restoration it needs under such a short period of time.","183":"So we think it works the same way, but maybe just like more efficiently. And so we're still really learning about how this works. Sleep science itself is kind of a new field.","184":"Really tired. Do you think you were a little crankier than usual? Yeah. That's actually really interesting, because what happens is humans and everything needs to sleep eventually, and so you can't stay up indefinitely, right? What do you think happens if you don't sleep?","185":"Right, right! So how do they do it? In the area that they live in, they need to stay cool, right? And so they spend a lot of time in the water, and so then as a consequence, they need to sleep in the water, but how do they do it? So it's really fascinating. What they do is while they're sleeping, they actually float back up to the surface and breathe without waking up. They're able to go about their whole sleep cycles but still able to breathe, because their body has adapted in a way that they can still get the oxygen that they need. It's a really amazing thing. What do you think?","186":"So now I want to talk about our last animal, and I think this one is probably the most amazing of all. Okay, so what's this?","187":"A dolphin! Yes. So dolphins, kind of like hippos, have to sleep in the water, okay? But because they're mammals, right, they need to breathe. Dolphins breathe air. They have to go up to the surface and breathe, right? And for an animal like that, it needs to figure out a way that it can sleep but also still survive, right? You know how dolphins sleep?","188":"Nano is kind of a funny word, right? It's a word that's used before another word, and it means one billion. What's the smallest object you can think of?","189":"A baby ant? Very good. So I have over here a meter stick, let me show it to you. And so that's a meter and if I divide it by 1000, I get a millimeter. So milli just means 1000. There's all these little lines on the ruler. And each of those little lines is one millimeter. So a baby ant is probably a couple of millimeters. So even the thing, that's the smallest thing you can think of, it's a million times bigger than a nanometer. Tiny, tiny, tiny.","190":"That was a perfect explanation. But what if I told you that scientists invented a special type of microscope that not only lets you see atoms, but also lets you move them around and build things with them. Would you think that would be pretty cool?","191":"So it's called a scanning tunneling microscope. And not only can you see the atoms, but you can move them around. Atoms are kind of sticky. You can actually build things using this instrument with actual individual atoms. So if I gave you that machine, would you want to make something? Would you want to look at something very carefully?","192":"I study it because objects that are that small have really interesting properties. They behave completely different than objects that are big. And because of that, we can build really cool things with them. Like really fast computers, for example, or new types of batteries or new types of solar cells. And a lot of nanotechnology is kind of like playing with Legos. You take these small objects and you put them together to build something new. Something interesting that no one's built before. It's like Legos for scientists.","193":"You know an interesting topic is: what are the limits to what we can do with virtual reality? Where I'm pretty pleased with what we have today. What we can show people and say virtual reality, its cool. People get an amazing response from it. But we're still clearly a very, very long ways from reality.","194":"Mostly in VR we talk about the display and optics, the visual side of things, but we should at least tick off the other senses. And haptics is an interesting thing about virtual reality really doesn't have that aspect of touching things. You can move your hands around, you can do everything but its a disconnected experience because you know you don't have an actual solidity there. And I am pessimistic about progress in haptics technology. Almost all other areas I'm an optimist and I'm excited about what's coming up, but I don't have any brilliant vision about how we're going to revolutionize haptics and make it feel like we're touching the things in the virtual world.","195":"Yeah, that is one potential quality improvement that is still on the horizon is when we do spatialization, we use HRTF, the Head Relative Transfer Function, to make it sound like its in different places. But usually we just use this one kind of generic, here's your average human, HRTF function. Its possible, that of course, if you are right in the average then its perfect for you. But there's always people off to the extremes, that it doesn't do a very good job at. And there may be better ways to allow people to sample their own perfect HRTF which can improve the audio experience a lot. It all comes down to all these trade-offs.","196":"There was a huge concern about that at Oculus. And the term internally that went around was poisoning the well. They were very, very concerned. I mean for a long time there was a fight about whether gear VR should even be done, because the worry was if we let a product go out, like gear VR that didn't have those things. That if somebody saw it and it was bad, made them sick, made their eyes hurt, then they would be like I'm never going to try VR again. I tried it that time and it was terrible. And there was legitimate arguments about whether it was even a good idea to do that. And it turned out that yes, its obviously better to have all those things, but you can still do something that's valuable for the user without it. Its weird being at the beginning of a medium like this.","197":"So, when you say it's an inverse-square law, that means that the closer you are, the more strongly you feel the gravitational pull. And that makes sense. There's very few things that are stronger when you're further apart.","198":"So you can also think of a gravitational field, something that permeates all of space. Even though the earth is three stories below us, it's not as though it's pulling at us from a distance. We're actually interacting with the field at this point and there's a real interaction right here at this point. And that's nice, because people were worried that if things acted at a distance, that the way that old-fashioned inverse-square force law describes it, that it was as spooky as mind-bending a spoon, that it was like telekinesis. If you don't touch something, how do you affect it? And so the first step was to start to think of gravity as a field that permeates all of a space. And it's weaker very far from the Earth and it's closer very close to the Earth. So one way to think of this field as a field that's really describing a curved space-time that is everywhere. Forget the difficulty of the math, just the intuition comes from two kind of simple observations. One was what Einstein described as the happiest thought of his life. So, right now, you might feel heavy in your chair, and we might feel heavy on the floor and our feet, or standing in an elevator cab. And Einstein said, what does the chair have to do with it, or the floor, or the elevator? Those aren't gravitational objects. So he wanted to eliminate them, and one way to do the thought experiment is to imagine standing in an elevator that you can see out of, a black box. And imagine the cable is cut and you and the elevator begin to fall.","199":"You're in total free fall. Now, because things fall at the same rate, including the elevator and you, you can actually float in the elevator. If you just floated in the elevator, the two of you would drop, and you might not even know you're falling. You could take an apple and drop it in front of you, and it would float in front of you. You would actually experience weightlessness. It's called the equivalence principle. It was Einstein's happiest thought that what you're really doing when you're experiencing gravity isn't being heavy in your chair, it's falling weightlessly in the gravitational field. And that was the first step, to think of gravity as weightlessness and falling.","200":"You can make somebody look like they're in the International Space Station by flying up in a plane and then just free-falling, the plane just drops out of the air. And while it's falling, they will float weightlessly, and there's been a lot of experiments about it, but you don't want it to end unhappily, so the plane has to scoop back up, and then you see them become pinned to the floor of the plane, because then the plane is interrupting their fall. So that's the first thought, and then the next is, what is the shape that's chased? So if you were floating in empty space, really empty space, and you had an apple, and you threw the apple, what shape do you think it would chase, the path?","201":"Yeah, it would chase a curve, it would chase an arc. And the faster you throw it, the kind of longer the arc. So the second step to think about curved space-time is to say that when things fall freely around a body like the Earth, they trace curved paths, as though space-time itself, space itself was curved.","202":"You went, Oh. [Janna and Lisa laugh] So, that's the intuition, that's how Einstein gets from thinking that space-time is curved from the idea that, well, there's this field that permeates all of space, and what is really describing is the curves that things fall along. And from there, it's a very long path to finding the mathematics and the right description, that's really hard. But that intuition is so elegant and so beautiful and just comes from these two simple thought experiments.","203":"So you described learning in a class about light the theory of special relativity where Einstein is really adhering to the constancy of the speed of light and questioning the absolute nature of space and time. And it seems like that has nothing to do with gravity, but he later begins to think about the incompatibility of gravity with his theory of relativity. So suppose the Sun were to disappear tomorrow. Some evil genius comes and just figures out a way to evaporate the Sun. In Newton's understanding of gravity, we would instantaneously know about it all the way over here at the Earth. And that's incompatible with the concept that nothing can travel faster than the speed of light. No information, not even information about the Sun, could possibly travel faster than the speed of light. So we shouldn't know about what happened to the Sun for a full eight minutes, which is the time it would take light to travel to us. And so he begins to question why gravity is so incompatible with relativity, but he already knows he's thinking about space and time in relativity. So then he gets to his general theory of relativity where he realizes if I eliminate everything but just the gravitational field of let's say the Earth and I look at how things fall and I see that they follow curves, well, then he realizes that space and time don't just contract or dilate, that they can really warp, that they can bend and that they can curve. And then he finds a way to make gravity compatible with relativity by saying if the Sun were to disappear tomorrow, the curves that the Sun imprinted in space-time would actually begin to ripple, and those are the gravitational waves, and they would change and they would flatten out, 'cause the Sun was no longer there. And that would take the light-travel time to get to us to tell us that the Sun was gone, and then we would stop orbiting and just travel along a straight line.","204":"It does. In fact, one way that different universes might be created and be different from each other is that different universes could have effectively different numbers of dimensions. Like we have three dimensions around us, but there's people out there, aliens, who could live in five dimensional universes.","205":"We think that it would be, no all of this is incredibly speculative, and we don't know for sure. But the idea is that there is some deep down underlying laws that are universal and the same, but they show up differently, so they appear different. So the specific particles and forces and masses would be completely different in different parts of the multiverse.","206":"Mm-hmm. So we have quantum mechanics, right? The theory of atoms and so forth and how those work, and then we have gravity, and gravity doesn't seem to fit in. It's the one force of nature that we can't really easily fit into this quantum mechanical framework, so string theory is one of the best ideas.","207":"That's the good news. The bad news is that it only seems to work if spacetime is ten dimensional. [chuckles] So you would say well then it's wrong. It can't be right. Spacetime is not ten-dimensional. Spacetime is four dimensional. We've observed that. But instead, we say if spacetime looks four dimensional to us, but string theory, which might be the best theory we have of quantum gravity says it must be ten dimensional, maybe we can hide those extra six dimensions somehow. So here's how we could get lucky. We could imagine that there are extra dimensions of space that are curled up somehow that are so small that we can't see them. This is actually an old idea. It goes back to Kaluza and Klein right after general relativity was invented in 1915. But there's a more recent idea that says there could actually be relatively large extra dimensions. There could be extra dimensions that are actually that big, like a millimeter across that you would not have noticed. But here's the new, exciting idea. So let's imagine, okay. This is a piece of paper. But let's imagine this is our entire world. So, in other words, our real world is three dimensional, but let's imagine that we're just idealizing it down to two dimensions, so we all live here. You and I live here. But let's imagine that we're embedded in this bigger space. So there are extra dimensions that are actually big, okay? And let's imagine that. When I say we live on this three dimensional world what I mean is imagine that the particles that you and I are made of, right, the quarks, the leptons, the electrons and everything, all the forces we know about, electromagnetism, the weak nuclear force, the strong nuclear force, imagine they can't leave this surface. This is what we call a brane. B-R-A-N-E. Have you heard this word before?","208":"From membranes, you know. We have lines, one dimension. We have two dimensional surfaces. So if you have a line that is a vibrating physical thing, you call it a string, right?","209":"If you have a two dimensional surface that vibrates and is a physical thing, we call that a membrane. Membrane theory goes back, it never was as popular as string theory, but it's been around for a while. But if you had extra dimensions of space, then you can three dimensional vibrating things, and four dimensional vibrating things.","210":"Well basically the strings are the particles that we see. It's exactly the same thing as we said for the straw, if you look at it far away it looks one dimensional. A little loop of string, so a little one dimensional circle that is vibrating. If you look at it from very, very far away, it just looks like a particle. So in string theory, an electron is a little string. A photon is a little string.","211":"It's even better. It's the theory of everything. What would you tell a friend of yours if they asked you what dimensions are, what extra dimensions are, what a brane is?","212":"Yeah, that's exactly right. And you can append it. You can sort of add new information that's more current, but you can't actually go erase anything.","213":"We're gonna have to create entire new concepts of how they do trade and how they work with us, too. What kind of barriers or road blocks would you imagine are gonna happen in the blockchain space?","214":"Yeah. One of the problems that Bitcoin has faced is Bitcoins getting stolen or lost. But a lot of that actually comes from people trying to recentralize Bitcoin in different ways making themselves actually a pretty easy target.","215":"Yeah. To actually transition into the mainstream and make it useful for average people to use, we're going to need to make sure we have a lot more education, a lot more standards and probably work with a lot of enterprises to create sort of a user experience around this being a technology that is safe and usable and understandable. What is the current state of blockchain in your understanding? What's gonna have to happen next?","216":"Well, we have a lot of public blockchains. Like we have Bitcoin. We have the Ethereum network and XT, but a lot of companies and consortiums are getting together to build private blockchains, so ones that are more closed off at first and then may evolve into a public network where people feel comfortable using it. And some are also proof of concept out in the real world, projects in energy and in pharmaceuticals and in retail and lots of different fields are starting experiments. And we'll see in the next few years how all of those interact and what we learn about the best use cases for blockchain and what it means for trade.","217":"Because the materials are so small, they're at the nanoscale, their properties are dominated by quantum mechanics, which means that even slight changes in their size, in their orientation give profound changes in their properties. And while that's very scientifically interesting, and it allows you to tune their properties by making subtle changes, from a technology point of view, it's a bit of a headache in the sense that in technology want to optimize for a property and then repeat that over and over again. So what are some of the challenges that you face in the lab related to working with these materials and then trying to incorporate them into the batteries?","218":"That's actually, I think a very common problem. We can build a device in the lab it could be a transistor, can be a battery. And then you ask the question, okay, so what's the next step? How do we take it from that lab demonstration into a technology? The kind of work that I'm very interested in is developing tools to make the exact type of materials that you want. The tools that we've used in the past for conventional fabrication just don't work with these materials because they're all grown from the bottom up. They're intrinsically small, and you have to find ways to either use chemistry or some other means to get them to assemble into the structures that you want to actually either grow specifically what you want or after you grow them, to pull out the ones that you want. You need to be able to build that same thing over and over again, with the exact same properties. No one institution, no one research lab, no one national lab is gonna solve all of these problems on their own because they are difficult problems. And there is a real important payoff at the end. And it's gonna take all of us, making our contributions to push this field forward.","219":"The first thing I want to show you is origami in the real world. This is the origami lamp. It comes shipped flat but it folds, clip holds it together. The lamp has LEDs on the inside so when we power it up we get light, we have a lampshade and we get the base.","220":"Origami applications have in common, is that at some stage the thing is flat and so whenever you need to either start from a flat state and then take it to a 3D state, or conversely, for deployables like space, you want to have it in a fully folded flat state but then take it to a 3D state, or possibly an unfolded flat state. Whenever a flat state is involved, origami is a really effective way of making the transition between those states.","221":"New problems arise when we try to make origami out of things other than paper, but also new opportunities. An example here which is a kind of a variant of the Miura-Ori. It's got a three-dimensional structure. If I stretch it one way, it expands the other but because it has these S-bends in the pattern, if you squeeze it, it doesn't go all the way flat. This is a epoxy impregnated aramid fiber and so if I put this fold pattern into it and then compress it and then put a skin on the top and bottom, this becomes incredibly lightweight but incredibly strong.","222":"Another origami challenge that comes up with these patterns is if we're going to make an aircraft out of this thing we're going to need hundreds of yards of folded origami. We're not going to do it by hand and this might be the new frontier in origami engineering, which is the design of machines that can fold patterns that have applications.","223":"When we were much smaller societies, you and I could trade in our community pretty easily. As the distance in our trade grew, we ended up inventing institutions, right? If you Uber or you use Airbnb or you use Amazon even, these are just digital marketplaces and platforms that help us facilitate an exchange of value. But today, we actually have a technology that allows us to trade one to one but at scale, and it's called blockchain technology. There is some kind of interface for it. You could have an app, or you could use a computer to do it, but instead of there being a company in the middle that's helping you make that transaction, it's a bunch of software code.","224":"And so it's being run by all of these different computers that have like a node. So they're all running the same software and guaranteeing your transactions as they happen.","225":"In some cases, yeah, it is. And a lot of people in the financial industry, in particular, are looking at it from the banking side of how do we use this technology to trade things like Bitcoin or other tokens that are easier to use instead of today's currency. A lot of people think about blockchain as Bitcoin because it's sort of in the news a lot, and it's this new cryptocurrency. And it's kind of exciting. But we're actually seeing a lot more use cases for blockchain that aren't around the currency side. They're more around, how do you take any asset and be able to trade that using this same technology.","226":"So today, a lot of people are working on how to create identity structures that leverage blockchains. And one of the tools for doing that is being able to cryptographically sign for a given attribute. So your government could sign that you have a US passport or a university could sign that you are a currently enrolled student. And you could then dole out that information and control it yourself and be able to show people those certifications on an as needed basis.","227":"Really glad that you could join us. So we've been talking about sleep today, various levels of complexity. But now with you, I really want to talk about what do we know about sleep and the aging brain. Can you tell me a little bit about some of the work that you've been doing in that area?","228":"So it's interesting, so I also saw that there was also a recent meta-analysis around sleep disturbances and dementia risk, and in that study, they looked about 250,000 people in this meta-analysis, and they followed them around for 10 years, and you know, when they pulled all the samples together, they found there was a 1.2 fold increased risk for developing all caused dementia, so it sounds like both sleep apnea and then maybe sleep disturbances more generally are associated with increased risk for dementia. When I think about that, I think about how sleep lives in the brain, these neurodegenerative diseases live in the brain, and so what do we know about the causality of this? Could it be that individuals who have early onset of say, Alzheimer's, have then poor sleep kind of as a consequence of that?","229":"So within dementia risk in particular, Alzheimer's for instance, there are kind of two clear features that seem to be part of the pathology, right? So there's beta-amyloid which accumulates in the brain, and then there's kind of these tangles, this tauopathies, right? And so it sounds like sleep seems to be related to the tauopathies. What about kind of beta-amyloid?","230":"Okay, so there is this bio-directional piece, but I think perhaps the most exciting thing that happened in the sleep field, at least in my view, has been understanding the role of sleep and its clearance of beta-amyloid in the brain. This idea that sleep is kind of the dishwasher of the brain, it seems like, that you know A betta accumulates as we kind of use energy, and you know it's kind of a waste product, and the idea that if you don't clear it out, that it's going to build up and accumulate.","231":"I'm excited about the future of sleep medicine. I think there are incredible innovations that are happening in the basic sciences, kind of really starting to understand what are the clear biological processes that underly some of these things as they relate to disease risk, and what is the true function of sleep, kind of the why we sleep phenomenon, right?","232":"To figure out how to do that we need to learn a little bit about what makes a point. So, let's come back to the crane. You can probably tell that the corners of the square ended up as points, right?","233":"Yeah, exactly. Actually you've discovered something pretty neat because you made your point not from a corner so you've already discovered one of the key insights. Any flap, any point, leg of the ant, takes up a circular region of paper. Here's our boundary. To make your point from an edge you use that much paper and the shape, it's almost a circle. If we take the crane we'll see if the circles are visible in the crane pattern. Here's the crane pattern, and here's a boundary of the wing, and here's the other wing.","234":"The crane has four circles but, actually, there's a little bit of a surprise because what about this? There's a fifth circle, which is like that, but does the crane have a fifth flap in it? Let's refold it and put the wings up. Well, yes, there is, there's another point and that point is the fifth circle of our crane.","235":"And to do that we use a new technique called circle packing in which all of the long features of the design are represented by circles. So, each leg becomes a circle, each wing becomes a circle and things that can be big and thick, like the head or the abdomen, can be points in the middle. Now we have the basic idea of how to design the pattern, we just count the number of legs we want. We want a spider, if it's got let's say eight legs, it's also got an abdomen, that's another point, and it's got a head, so maybe that's 10 points. If we find an arrangement of 10 circles we should be able to fold that into the spider. So in this book, Origami Insects II, it's one of my books and has some patterns, and this is one of them for a flying ladybug and, in fact, it is exactly this flying ladybug. We've got the crease pattern here in the circles and you might now be able to see which circles end up as which parts, knowing that the largest features like the wings are going to be the largest circles, smaller points will be smaller circles. So any thoughts which might be?","236":"Origami artists all around the world now use ideas like this to design, not just insects, but animals, and birds, and all sorts of things that are, I think, unbelievably complex and realistic but most importantly, beautiful.","237":"I remember reading your papers when I was a student and we're all trying to create these materials and finding ways to exploit their properties. What I love, and I'm delighted that you're here to talk to us about is how you took inspiration from nature and sort of recognize that nature's figured out a way to both synthesize incredibly complex nanostructures with high functionality and how you sort of were inspired by that to do the research that you're doing now.","238":"It's really fascinating work, especially now we're all familiar with the viruses and how they act. And I'm not aware of any viruses that build nanostructures. So how did you come to that? And then how do you actually program a virus to do your bidding?","239":"So you've evolved, and I suppose, trained these viruses to build the materials that you want them to build by exposing them to the raw materials and then evolving their function. We're talking about the electronics from nanomaterials. That critical issue that we're facing is how do you go from those single experiments with a single material, understanding its properties, how do you scale that to the billions of devices that you need in a technology? It is a chemistry driven approach. We're not going to grow them exactly where we want them, but to take that one step, and to tie into what you're doing, tt sounds like there could be an area of collaboration where instead of using conventional chemistry, that we can train some of these biological elements to do that work work for us.","240":"Whenever there's a part of a spacecraft that is shaped somewhat like paper, meaning it's big and flat, we can use folding mechanisms from origami to make it smaller.","241":"Telescopes, solar arrays, they need to be packed into a rocket, go up, but then expand in a very controlled, deterministic way when they get up into space.","242":"These are the building blocks of many, many origami deployable shapes, it's called a degree-4 vertex. It's the number of lines. So in this case, we use solid lines for mountain, we use dash lines for valley. We're going to fold it and use these two to illustrate some important properties of origami mechanisms. It's important in the study of mechanisms to take into account the rigidity. So what we're going to do to help simulate rigidity is to take these rectangles and we're going to fold them over and over so that they just become stiff and rigid.","243":"So this is what's called a single degree of freedom mechanism. You have one degree of freedom, I can choose this fold, and then if these are perfectly rigid every other fold angle is fully determined. One of the key behaviors here is that with the smaller angles up here, the two folds that are the same parity and the folds that are of opposite parity move at about the same rate but with this, as we're getting closer to 90 degrees, we find they move at very different rates and then at the end of the motion, the opposite happens. This one is almost folded but this one goes through a much larger motion so the relative speeds differ.","244":"So when we start sticking together vertices like this, if they're individually single degree of freedom then we can make very large mechanisms that open and close but with just one degree of freedom. So, these are examples of a pattern called the Miura-Ori. When you stretch them out they're pretty big.","245":"Yeah, so typically the mechanism will run from corner to corner, to diagonally to opposite corners because then you can stretch it out that way. Notice some differences between the one you have and the one I have in how this one sort of opens out almost evenly but this one opens out more one way and then the other.","246":"And it's exactly the difference between the motions of these two vertices. So these angles are closer to right angles and the closer you get to a right angle the more asymmetry there is between the two directions of motion. And then the other difference is how efficiently they pack, so these started at about the same size but when they're flat notice that yours is much more compact. So if I were you making a solar array, I'd say, oh, I want that one. But if I say, well, I want them to open at the same rate, then I want this one.","247":"There's an engineering trade-off to get them both to work. And there's another place that shows up in deployable structures in a very cool structure. This is a folded tube, it sort of pops out like this but it has this neat property that if you twist it quickly, it changes color. There's a Mars Rover application where they need a sleeve that protects a drill and as the drill goes down, the sleeve is going to collapse and they're using a pattern very much like this.","248":"There are many open mathematical questions and so room for mathematicians, like yourself, to have a big impact on the world of origami and mechanisms. And even though those studies are mathematically interesting, they're going to also have real-world applications in space, solar arrays, drills, telescopes, and more. Any questions or thoughts about this?","249":"That's actually a really good description. The idea is that if you've got a system here that can make you see whatever we want you to see, then we can make you believe that you're anywhere else, like on top of a mountain, or in a dungeon or under the ocean.","250":"Yeah, or in Minecraft. When you look at a TV on the wall there showing like a picture of a mountain or something, how can you tell that its not just a window and there's something else behind it. Because it always doesn't look quite right if you have a static picture of a person on a screen and you move around like this, its not really changing. And its interesting, those are things we have to figure out We need to figure out when you look at something in reality how can you tell whether its real or not. Have you been to a 3-D movie where you put on the little glasses?","251":"Essentially what harmony is, is like a language, right? And so as with any language, the more words you're capable of speaking in a language, the more you can say. All right, so in harmony, this might be how many notes you can think to add to a chord to make it feel a different way. Have you ever heard of the circle of fifths?","252":"Okay, that's great. On one side, we have a lot of the notes which make us feel brighter, you know, like these kinds of, (keyboard music) these really bright sounds. And the other side is a lot more to do with the darkness of a key center. So we're home in F, but imagine we're taking a quick visit to B-flat, but then the sun comes out.","253":"You got it. Ooh! Yeah? Yeah, yeah. So this is really, this is like a gleaming glade or something, you know? Let's play this tune, Amazing Grace. Let's play it in its simplest form.","254":"Just to see how things feel. Yeah. All right, lets do it. (both playing Amazing Grace) So it's F major seven, but its over A. Which is F seven over A. (both playing) B flat major seven with an A and a G in it. F major seven with an E and a D and a G, yeah. (laughter) D minor seven with a G in it. C softs, or minor, nice. B flat major. G seven, F sharp major seven. Home, yeah! I like that. So what harmony does is just gives us even more tools to tell those stories. Cool, yeah. Nice, man.","255":"Oh, very good. You've come to the right place. So we're gonna think about physics. Have you heard the word physics before? Do you know what that is?","256":"Okay. I just think of physics as the study of everything. What stuff is, what stuff does. So today we're gonna talk about space, and in particular the idea of dimensions. Have you heard about dimensions?","257":"We need one number to tell you where we are. That's one dimension. That's what it means to be one dimensional. I only need to tell you one number to figure out where we are.","258":"There you go. Exactly. We're gonna build a little two dimensional space. You wanna do it? You wanna do the honors here? Why don't you put those two lines together?","259":"So those are the dimensions. That's how we think about dimensions. Remember, we just needed one number to find ourselves on the line, we need two numbers to find ourselves on the plane.","260":"This is why physicists think about things we don't know about. We're wondering whether there could be extra dimensions you've never seen. Yeah. That are tinier than atoms. So, okay. So what have you learned? What do you know about dimensions now? How do you think about dimensions in a slightly different way than you did before?","261":"Absolutely. And that's a great example because you have models that are operating to do things like figure out if a new email is spam or not. So what would you think about if you were looking at an email and trying to decide if it went in one category or another?","262":"So these are things we would call features. And we go through a process where we do feature engineering, where somebody looks at the example and says, Okay, these are the things that I think might allow us to statistically tell the difference from something in one category versus another. So for example, perhaps you don't speak Russian, you start getting a lot of email in Russian.","263":"This is a great question because it really gets to the difference between some of our different tools in our machine learning tool belt in addressing problems like this. So if we were to use a supervised learning classic classification approach, a person would need to think about those features and creatively come up with them in approach we call the kitchen sink approach, which is just try everything you can possibly think of and see what works. Unsupervised learning, where we don't have labeled data and we're trying to infer some structure out of the data is you're projecting that data into a space and looking for things like clusters. And there's a bunch of really fun math about how you do that, how you think about distance and by distance, I mean that if we have two data points in space, how do we decide if they're similar or not?","264":"Supervised learning, we have our labels and we're trying to figure out what statistically indicates if something matches one label or another label. Unsupervised learning, we don't necessarily have those labels. That's the thing we're trying to discover. So reinforcement learning is another technique that we use sometimes. You can think about it like a turn in a game and you can play, you know, millions and millions of trials so that you're able to develop a system that by experimenting with reinforcement learning can eventually learn to play these games pretty successfully. Deep learning, which is essentially using neural networks and very large amounts of data to eventually iterate on a network structure that can make predictions.","265":"It is, but it also thrives in environments where you have a decision point, a pallet of actions to choose from. And it actually comes historically from trying to train a robot to navigate a room. If it bonks into this chair, it can't go forward anymore. And if it falls into that pit, you know, it's not going to succeed. But if it keeps exploring, it'll eventually get to the goal.","266":"So typically, you would choose deep learning if you have sufficient high quality data, hopefully labeled in a useful way. If you really are happy not to necessarily understand or be able to interpret what your system is doing or you're willing to invest in another set of work afterwards to understand what the system is doing once you've already trained it. And this also comes down to the fact that some things are actually really easy to solve with linear regression or simple statistical approaches. And some things are impossible.","267":"You build a system that could actually be useless. So years ago, I had a client that was a big telecom company and they had a data scientist who built a deep learning system to predict customer churn. It actually was very accurate, but it wasn't useful because nobody knew why the prediction was what it was. So they could say, you know, Sunny, you're likely to quit next month. But they had no idea what to do about it. And so, I think there are a bunch of failure modes.","268":"Yeah. This is actually a good example of a very real world kind of machine learning problem where the solution to this was to build an interpretable system on top of the accurate predictions not to throw it away, but to do a bunch more work to figure out the why.","269":"It's actually fairly new that we're able to solve all of these problems and start to build these products and apply it in businesses and apply it, you know, everywhere. And so, we're still developing good practices and what it means to be a professional in machine learning. We're really developing a notion of what good looks like.","270":"Sometimes when people get, they worry about connectomics, I think what they're actually worrying about is that it's the end of the that we used to do neuroscience.","271":"So and a musician, how much of it do you think is in your hands versus in your brains? Meaning like, you do have connections in your muscles from the nerves that are from your spinal cord, what if some of the learning is there?","272":"Yeah. We do a lot of X-ray in addition to EM and this is actually, I'm not saying it's the only problem, but it's the only problem that needs to be solved right away, is that the data analysis, right? In fact, I think we calculated that there aren't enough humans ever to map a mouse brain where you collect every connection and et cetera so the problem is to get algorithms to trace, to recognize things in brains the way humans would recognize things in brains, or map things, trace things in brains. It's gonna cost a lot of money to imagine setting the gold standard for the wiring diagram even once and those are the kinds of ethical concerns that I'm worried about.","273":"Good to see you Mike, nice to have you here with me. So we go way back. 1991, the year I got married, I moved across the country, left my husband in New Jersey, to work with you in Livermore.","274":"And I've been talking sort of, started with sort of what is a laser through linear optics, non linear optics, high intensity laser physics, and saying that you know, we're trying to get to that Schwinger limit of 10 to the 29 watts per square centimeter. We're about somewhere just shy of 10 to the 23 I think at this point. But even if we get to 100 petawatts and focus that down to a wavelength, we're not at 10 to the 29. So you're hoping to build the biggest laser.","275":"Okay, but that's kind of cheating. That's not getting to 10 to the 29. If you could do it with 100% efficiency that's all we need.","276":"And that's, like you said, we're stuck a little bit, we're not up to that kind of acceleration, so that would be a Nobel Prize winning possible idea.","277":"Or we need, going around and giving my talks now, I show how we're plateauing. I showed how there was a plateau, CPA raises it up, but we're sort of starting to plateau again and we need another Nobel Prize winning idea. And so do you think it's on the horizon? Do you see anything out there that really says, oh yeah that's a good way to go? 'Cos we're gonna have to get out to the x-rays right? We can't stay in the visual.","278":"And right across the beam. Don't you think that's gonna be the challenge? 'Cos it's not like our beams are as perfect as we like to think they are.","279":"Okay so there's a lot of us working around the world on these high intensity lasers and so, what do you think the real fun is? What do you see the real excitement being?","280":"So where people are swiping credit cards, those credit card numbers were stolen. They hired a company to come in and perform a penetration test to see, can the good guys essentially break in again to prevent this sort of thing in the future? And when this team came in, they found they actually were able to get pretty much to the same point of sale system, and the way they did that was by exploiting an internet-connected deli meat scale. Once the company was able to essentially get into the deli scale, because the deli scale was on the internal network, then they were able to really escalate privilege and find a vulnerability within another system. Essentially, that just got them into the network. and once you're in the network, it's often really easy to then escalate from there.","281":"Yeah, that's another interesting concept. It's really just different layers that we have for protection, because often when you're talking about something like a corporate network, or even your home network, you typically have sort of one level of defense, right? If someone can break that or it can get in through some other system that is connected or exposes some other protocol, like Bluetooth, right? You can connect to a Bluetooth device without being on the wireless network, without being on the LAN. That potentially gives you another place that you can pivot on and then access other devices, because if something has both Bluetooth and also Wi-Fi, well, if you can get in through Bluetooth, then you can then access the Wi-Fi and get to other devices on the network. Are you familiar with buffer overflows?","282":"If we were to write a program that asked for your name and you typed in your name, but before you could type in your name, in a low leveling, which is like C or C++, you'd have to allocate some memory. So you might allocate a buffer of a hundred bytes because whose name is going to be longer than a hundred bytes or a hundred character? But what happens if you were to not really check that they limited to a hundred bytes? Do you know what happens if they essentially start typing over that hundred bytes?","283":"But what's really cool about that is, when you're going into memory, you're starting to cross over that boundary of that hundred byte allocation, and now you're starting to write over additional memory. That other memory is really important stuff. So you have your name, the hundred bytes there, and then right next to your name is the return address, and that's the address that the code is gonna execute and it's going to return to after that function is done, and it's going to jump to that address, but after you type your hundred bytes, the next few bites that you type, you're actually going to overwrite that return address. So that return address could essentially be another address in memory. So what you end up doing is you type a name and it's not really a name, it's really just code. And that code, you keep typing until you get to the return address, and you start typing an address, which is really the beginning of your name and your computer or your processor is actually going to read that address and it will jump back to the beginning and then execute that payload. So that was sort of the very first thing that I think was super exciting to me when I started learning about really reverse engineering.","284":"Ever since buffer overflow started many years ago, there been a lot of protection mechanisms built to make it difficult to exploit. More and more, we're actually using smaller and smaller computers with smaller amounts of compute power. If you take a car, you have hundreds of microcontrollers that are all running there. So they don't really have a sophisticated operating system that can try to prevent attacks like buffer overflows. So how do we keep these low cost computers in here while adding layers of protection to prevent malice and these types of attacks? Sometimes it actually is, how can we write software or how can we build a system that prevents these types of attacks from entering? But oftentimes, it's really looking for how can we find new attacks that we haven't even necessarily thought of? What got you interested in computer science and information security?","285":"You brought up China and Iran, and something that's interesting about those areas is really censorship, right? They have essentially censored internet. In the US, we have a really interesting internal struggle here where we actually have government agencies like the state department that are funding software to evade censorship, like Tor and other mechanisms. While then we also have an internal struggle where we have other organizations like the NSA who are specifically looking to break that exact same system that the US government is also funding.","286":"It's good for us to understand how these systems can really break down. Although, I think one thing that I see is that some of, let's say, the organizations that are looking to break this are not necessarily going to share once they actually learn that information. They might actually sort of hold that in their back pocket and use it when it's advantageous to them.","287":"You haven't got to play with lasers. So I brought one. It's my friend's cat toy. Do you ever use a laser as a cat toy?","288":"Well one of the fun things people do with lasers, the cat will try to grab that dot. I'm sure what you have at home is a flashlight. I brought a cute little one. So the question is, do you see any difference between what a flashlight does and what a laser does?","289":"One of the things that lasers are great for is that because it's a directed beam, we can actually put that light where we want the light to go and sometimes you maybe just want to see something around the corner and you can't see it. But with a laser, you can actually and this is a smoky one so you can actually watch it go. You see it actually bending the corner?","290":"And that's because the light will go through this glass and, when it hits that corner, it has to bend. And we actually send laser beams down glass fibers, the size of your hair.","291":"You don't have a cat. So you don't need a cat toy no. Have you ever gone to a grocery store and just scanned your objects over?","292":"That's a laser. We cut steel with them now. We actually do surgery with lasers. You know when some people have either scars or birth marks that they don't want to see? We can actually remove those with lasers now. Never seen a laser light show? When they light up the sky with lasers, it's almost like fireworks.","293":"Oh you got to see a shooting star? Well that's cool, that's nature giving you the show there. So what do you think about lasers? You think they're fun?","294":"So the side channel analysis is really looking not at a vulnerability within a system, but really unintended consequences of what the system is built on. A very simple example of a side channel is putting your ear to the ground to hear if there are horses coming towards you, and the same thing applies to technology. So you can have something like a CPU, it's executing instructions, certain instructions that use a little bit more power, and power is reserved in these capacitors, which are like tiny batteries next to your CPU. And as they're pulling power, there's something in physics called the electrostrictive effect where the capacitor will move in a very, very tiny amount. And then although we can't hear it, the microphone on a mobile device can actually listen to that. If you then listen to that and you say, oh, I see a pattern here, and you can go all the way down and then extract and reveal the full password, the full key, even though it could be argued that the algorithm itself, there's no problem with it.","295":"Yeah, I suppose the physical adjacency of the underlying transistors and capacitors that are holding that storage. That's crazy. I think the first time I heard of an interesting attack like that was learning about the cold boot attack. Being able to, you know, someone enters their password on their computer and that decrypts their hard drive and then they walk away. Being able to extract that password is really difficult. If I can pull that memory chip out and extract that memory, put it in my own device, except the problem is memory is volatile, so it'll erase as soon as I pull it out. You can take something like canned air, turn it upside down, cool that computer, make it real nice and cool. Then you have a minute or two to pull out the memory, put into your own device, extract the memory, and then you're good. It's such a simple method to really extract something kind of critical. Like Rowhammer, it's such a low level of vulnerability and you could argue that it's not necessarily a vulnerability in the architecture itself, but rather exploitation of physics at that point.","296":"The risk right now, just during this quarantine, is actually massive now that we think about it, because you might have these legacy systems. You know, they were built 20, 30 years ago, and it's too costly to upgrade, but now you can't actually have a lot of people in a single location, so potentially, they actually do have to now add some sort of remote capabilities to these systems that were never meant to be on the internet. Have you ever had any ethical concerns with the stuff you're interested in or the work you do?","297":"Especially now that we're seeing more and more companies who are trying to make it illegal for you to inspect the vehicle that you've purchased, right? Something that you actually own.","298":"What if it were illegal? Would you then do it? Fortunately it's not today, right? It hasn't been, you know, despite their attempts, none of that has been passed, but if you had a vehicle and you wanted to inspect it, but all of a sudden, it passed, I mean.","299":"We have a lot of companies that sort of help us make sure that our trades happen, but if we could guarantee the same trade using technology as sort of a technological trust, then we wouldn't really need all those middlemen in between.","300":"It's basically a network of computers that all have the same history of transactions. And so instead of sort of there being one company with one database that holds all the information, the same sort of list is held by all these different people. Like, you could have it on your computer. And then it gets validated by everyone, and basically, that turns into the next part of the list. So it's sort of constantly updating itself.","301":"So it use cryptography, and that helps it basically encode all of the transactions. So you can't really see exactly what happened, but you can know it happened because it's like a marker.","302":"So it's kinda this like really big ledger or accounting system for all sorts of things that get traded, but instead of being owned by one company, it's owned by everybody.","303":"Okay. As opposed to the experimental side and seeing things? Okay so I'm much more, I like to see the things happening. So then the question is, what's so special about making a light that's intense enough to actually possibly blow things up? Certainly we can blow atoms up with the laser hammer and when the laser light comes in and just smacks the electrons right off the atom. And so the question really is how do you make that? Back in the 70s and into the 80s, I know that was a long time ago for you, we had big energy lasers and we had short pulse lasers, we couldn't have big energy, short pulse lasers and actually it was my supervisor and I that figured the way around that and we got something called chirped pulse amplification. Have you heard of chirped pulse amplification by any chance?","304":"Well I brought a little bit of a prop to explain how chirped pulse amplification works. Our short pulses are made of different colors. So I've got a colored slinky here. We probably could've called it stretched pulse amplification but that's kind of boring so we used the word chirped. The word chirped comes around because birds chirp. When the birds are singing, the notes are actually changing audio frequency with time and that's a chirp. The point is is that when all the light is squeezed together like this, it's a short pulse. And that's when it's a hammer because all of the light is now concentrated and you can imagine if this was coming along and also using a lens to focus it small, then all of that light at the focal spot, concentrate. And so that was the laser hammer. So we can't have that in the laser. So the question is what could we do? The fact that it's different colors and different colors because of dispersion, travel different speeds inside material. So we used a long fiber, 1.4 kilometers of fiber but, in fiber, the red colors really haven't got that much in common with the glass atoms and so they spend very little time interacting and they travel fast. The red is going to start traveling faster than the green, faster than the blue and, as you travel down the fiber, next thing you know, you have a long pulse and it's chirped from red at the beginning to blue at the back. And so the frequencies go hoo! Like this okay? So this is a chirped pulse and now it's a long pulse. And so, first this is what we did, we chirped it, we stretched it, then we can safely amplify it because it's not all concentrated and, after we amplify it, then we use something called a compressor and we put all of the colors back together and it was back being a short pulse but a high energy pulse. And then we really had what I like to call a laser hammer. When this laser pulse goes inside, it smacks those electrons right off the atom.","305":"Well a lot of lasers and when lasers first came along, they were only single color. Your cat toy, would only be a single color, probably a red one and so that's just one color. And one color means that it has to really be there for the whole time. One color is one wave length of light and so it's just one wave that goes on and on and on. If you want a short pulse, you actually have to have all the colors. And if you can imagine that one point in time, and I like to say it's like a conductor of an orchestra. When you're listening to an orchestra warm up, they sound terrible, they're all playing their own notes. But when the conductor conducts them, they all play different notes but, together, it's beautiful music. So we have something in the laser called a mode locker and it's like the conductor and it says go now. And all the colors will start together but some colors are long wave length and others are shorter. So next thing you know, you have peaks meeting valleys and they cancel each other. And the more colors you can bring in, the faster that happens and the shorter the pulse you can make.","306":"The necklace is something that was designed for my Nobel prize. It's sold at the Nobel museum and it is a chirped pulse. So we've been talking a lot about lasers and applications, what have you learned about chirped pulses?","307":"One nice emotional device when it come to harmony is just thinking about how to arrive somewhere. You know, it can be so sparse, it can be so rich, and it can be really emotional. So this idea of the overtone and the undertone in the harmonic series, how much do you know about this?","308":"Yeah. The amazing thing about harmony is that it exists in nature. So, take the harmonic series of the note F, for example. Okay. You have the ups on the fifth and the fourth and then the, (hums) That seemed a little bit sharp, but that's fine. And then tones get increasingly small. Beneath that note, you have the undertone series, which essentially is like a reflection of something. In the same way that when a tree grows in nature, you have the branches which grow upwards and the roots which go downwards. So it's quite a nice thing to thing about, this being the key center, the floor, the ground, and then these two different directions of ways in which it can express itself, and the differences in the sensations with that. Lots of the time I think when it comes to reharmonization or harmonization, people think that the solution to the problems come when we add more notes.","309":"I think that people forget that you can work with the notes you already have by just rearranging them, just the simple idea of inversion, inversion of the simple triad, of F major. \u266aI once was lost and now I'm found \u266a \u266a Was blind \u266a \u266a But now I see \u266a Now how home do I want to go here, you know? Is there another verse to come?","310":"Because I can delay the gratification of going home. First of all, just by using inversions, even before we add the notes to the chord. One thing that I was very joyful to discover is that every single melody note works with every single base note.","311":"F major, F minor, D flat major seven G flat diminished, G flat minor major seven, G minor seven, G soft, G seven, G seven sharp 11. And then, G seven with a flat 13","312":"That's it! (laughs) A flat soft, A flat major seven. A flat major seven sharp five, with a sharp 11. Essentially, what that demonstrates is that every note and every base note are compatible. So once we realize this its like, that's great! Now what should we do? What, how, what should we, what should we, how, what am I supposed to do? What to do, right. And sometimes the paralyzing thing when it comes to arranging, there are too many options, too many things are possible. So that's when it becomes super, super important to be aware of what you wanna try and say emotionally.","313":"So essentially, the way I'd apply negative harmony would be this idea of polarity, you know, between the overtone series and the undertone series, or you know, the one side and the other side. The perfect and the play goal. The feeling of a minor perfect-- (keyboard music) Resolving, it's so moving, you know? And it's a good alternative to something like, (keyboard music)","314":"So, there's a lot about context, I think. Once you have a language, it's about using it and applying it in those emotional ways. I think that's what makes the difference.","315":"That's good, that's a great place to start. There are cells in your brain. Those brain cells are connected by wires to each other. Electricity travels down those wires and communicates from one part of the brain to the other part of the brain, and each of those brain cells makes, you know, a thousand connections, it's something like a hundred trillion connections.","316":"I would say that that map also has your feelings in it because, here's why, your feelings, most neuroscientists think, come from your brain anyway, and amazingly, whether when you feel happy or sad or angry or scared, that's just brain cells communicating with each other.","317":"This is where it gets really crazy. Could we simulate that map inside a computer and would that computer then be thinking like that original brain from which we made the map?","318":"Huh. It would be like if you simulated a hurricane. Imagine we could keep track of every variable of a hurricane. Ever. Wind speed, every water molecule, et cetera, et cetera. Temperature. And we put that inside a super-fast computer and we simulated it, right? I don't think anyone would think that the inside of the computer would get wet. Even though we had simulated the hurricane perfectly, that wetness is consciousness, it's what we are. Is it ethical to imagine mapping a male brain versus a female brain to look for differences between those, to explain alleged behavioral differences between them?","319":"Like how can that possibly be? What I wanna do is prove to you that I know this combination without revealing the combination to you. And what you could do is you could write a little note, a secret that I definitely wouldn't know. Fold it up, stick it in here. And then, if I know the combination, I should be able to open it and tell you what you wrote. All right. There we go. All right. So,My dog is named Doug. Did you figure out what the combination was?","320":"So you're asking like, why shouldn't I just share my secrets with somebody? People don't trust each other. And if I was able to prove that I've done something correctly to someone without having to reveal my secrets, then that person would trust me more.","321":"But it's not. You wouldn't use like, a physical lock, or a physical box. We would instead use mathematics to do these kinds of things. You could take a message and encrypt it using mathematics. And then, I could prove to you that I know the key, I could open it up, and send it back to you. That way I would be proving to you that I know the mathematical key to the mathematical lockbox. So based on what we've discussed today, in your own words, what is a zero-knowledge proof.","322":"Is there any particular memory for you that you feel has been either kind of influential in your, in deciding which areas to pursue or that you feel is sort of emblematic of what it is to have a memory?","323":"I've got one too. I was nine and we were at the science expo in San Francisco. Two scientists were dissecting an eye, a cow's eye. And I was like that is the coolest thing I've ever seen. And something about that that carried me forward. Something happened so long ago, it left some long lasting trace through neural circuits and it continues to shape the decisions we make about what to study and what to do.","324":"Yeah, you know things are kind of breaking down in unexpected ways I'd say. I think there's been a lot of really great work out of multiple labs showing hippocampal activity related to behaviors that don't look anything like episodic memories, but which might depend on episodic memories right? So for example also when you're making a decision about how to choose between two good options that suddenly you might see activity in the hippocampus related to the choice itself, others have found that you find activity in the hippocampus not only when people are forming memories, but also when they're imagining events that are gonna happen in the future. So it kind of forced us to rethink the way we define what the hippocampus might be doing in a way that can account for creating memories, thinking about the future, making decisions and other kinds of behaviors that involve what we would refer to you in the field as relational processing. And that raises all kinds of new questions about what memory really is. Reminiscing about our early influences that made us want to be scientists is that, you know, of course we know, we know better than to think that those are necessarily accurate memories. You know this reminds me of sort of the classic example from literature when people talk about memory of course is Marcel Proust's Madeleine in Remembrance of Things Past. Where in the book it's this taste for the, for the protagonist this taste of the crumbs of the Madeleine cookie and the tea that bring him back to his childhood. You know, seven volumes then emerge of memories of, of that childhood. Digging further into earlier drafts of Proust's novel that initially it didn't describe a Madeleine at all.","325":"You know I think these imperfections, I interpret them as an indication that the role of memory is much less about being accurate representation of the past and much more about being kind of a flexible compass into the future.","326":"I love math for the same reason. Today, I'm gonna tell you about a thing called zero-knowledge proof. So in a zero-knowledge proof, there are two people. There's a prover and a verifier. And I wanna prove that something is true to you. But the weird thing is, I wanna prove to you that it's true without telling you any reasons why. I remember when I first heard about it, I was like, wait, what? How can that possibly be? Right?","327":"But what if I could prove to you that I know where the puffin is without revealing to you where it is? Let me show you. I took that photo that we showed you. And I put it behind this poster here. Why don't you go take a look through that hole?","328":"So when you look at this board, we don't know where the photo was, right? Was the photo like with the corner here? In which case the puffin would be all the way at this side. Or was the photo with the corner here? In which case the puffin would be on the other side. So this is a really simple example of a zero-knowledge proof. I convinced you that I knew where the puffin was, but you didn't learn anything else.","329":"When I first learned about them, I just thought they were so cool. But it turns out they're also really useful, not just for finding like, puffins. If you just type in your password and the hacker hacks into the computer, they can just get your password. Right?","330":"Because then even if the hacker hacked into the computer, he wouldn't learn anything. Because even the computer doesn't learn anything. So Chelsea, in your own words, what is a zero-knowledge proof?","331":"Yeah, that's absolutely right. So infinity gets used a lot of different ways in mathematics. There's a way that mathematicians think of infinity as a number, just like the number 13, just like the number 10 million. So the reason that mathematicians consider infinity to be a number is that it is a size of a set. So the first example of an infinite set in mathematics is the set of all counting numbers. So one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, et cetera. That list goes on forever. That is an infinite set. And to be a little bit more precise, it's a countably infinite set. But as a number, infinity is pretty strange.","332":"Adding infinities. Multiplying infinities. And there's a sense in which it's very similar to the arithmetic that you learned about already. But it's also totally different. It has some very weird properties. Welcome to Hilbert's Hotel. Unlike an ordinary hotel, has accountably infinitely many rooms. Suppose a new guest shows up, you might think that the new guest could take the room that's all the way down at the end of the hall, all the way at infinity, except there isn't a room like that. The rooms each have a number, and even though there's infinitely many rooms, each room is only a finite distance away. So here's how we're gonna make room for the new guest. I'm gonna ask the guest in room one to move into room two, and then we're gonna ask the guest in room two to move into room three, and we'll continue this all the way along. It looks to me like there's space for the new guest. Where is it?","333":"Absolutely. So now I'm gonna make this story a little more complex. That there's another Hilbert's Hotel down the street and they're having plumbing issues and we need to find room for them.","334":"Yeah, I'm increasing by one more each time. So I'm doubling the room number in fact. So this is some of the strange arithmetic of infinity. So we have two Hilbert Hotels, each of which have infinitely many guests, then this is equal to?","335":"Infinity, great. Hilbert's Hotel is a story that mathematicians have been telling themselves for almost 100 years because it's a really visceral way to think about some of the counterintuitive properties of the arithmetic of infinity.","336":"So when I'm teaching calculus and talking about concepts like limits and derivatives, those are only defined precisely with infinity. Teaching algebra, which is meant in a different sense about number systems, we deal with infinite families of numbers in their operations. Infinite sets are somehow very exotic. They're not found so commonly in their real world, but they're all over mathematics.","337":"It describes something in AI, which is that things that are really intuitive and easy for humans, are actually really difficult to build into AI systems. And on the flip side, picking up an object, really simple for people, but it's actually really difficult to build that into robotic systems. So do you have any experience working with robots or other AI systems?","338":"Yeah, exactly. One thing that my research has been looking into is, if we can have robots learn from data, we'll collect data from the robot sensors. And if the robot has sensors in its arm, to figure out the angle of one of its wrist, for example, then we'll record that angle. And all of the robots experience will go into a data set, that if we wanted a robot to solve a task, like, I don't know, picking up a cup, and then maybe you want to pick up a different cup, if it only had the data of picking up the first cup, do you think it would be able to perform well on the second cup?","339":"So you can think of robotics as having two core components. One is perception, being able to see and feel and so forth, and action, where the robot actually figures out how to move its arm. And both components are really essential, and both components are quite difficult. If you train a perception system independently of how to choose actions, then it might make errors in a way that mess up the system that selects actions And so if you instead try to train these two systems together, to have it learn perception action for the goal of solving these different tasks, then the robot can be more successful. One thing that's really difficult about robotics is, there actually isn't that much data of robots in the world. On the internet, there's all sorts of text data, all sorts of image data that people upload and write. But there isn't a lot of data of doing a simple thing, like tying your shoe, for example, because it's so basic. One challenge is even just getting data sets that allow us to teach robots to do these simple kinds of tasks.","340":"That's a great question. I think we should be able to accelerate the data collection process by having robots collect more data autonomously on their own. And by doing that, we might be able to overcome some of the challenges of Moravec's paradox.","341":"The Mandelbrot set or the Julia set, you know, the idea is always, oh, I'm gonna apply some polynomial over and over again. Z squared plus C or something like that. When I think about fractals, I try to get away from these very specific examples and ask, what is it fundamentally that makes a fractal, a fractal. And one thing that I think you can be precise about, even if you can't really say exactly what a fractal is, is you can talk about this idea of fractal dimension. Have you ever heard of that?","342":"Yeah, great. So, so the real physical paper has some amount of thickness, but when we model this mathematically, we might ignore the thickness and say, yeah, this is really just kind of a two dimensional sheet of paper. And then you have your apple, how many dimensions is the apple?","343":"Totally, now, as a little experiment, take your piece of paper and just crumple it into a ball. So what is it? Is the paper three dimensional or is it two dimensional?","344":"So it's not quite as solid as the apple, but it's also not quite as two dimensional as the original sheet of paper. And so for this reason, people associate this crumpled ball with a fractal dimension, maybe something like 2.5 dimensions instead of two or three, there are a lot of different definitions, precise definitions of fractal dimension. But I think the one that's easiest to understand is this thing called box counting dimension. You have, let's say an image and you want to decide what's the fractal dimension of this image. So what you're gonna do is you're gonna count the number of boxes, or you can imagine big pixels of this image that cover the boundary of this shape. And you're gonna see how does that counting compare with how the counts work for just an ordinary shape? So, so if I have a straight line and I start out with one big box that covers the whole line, and now I shrink my boxes by a factor of two, I just make boxes half as big. How many boxes will I need to cover that line?","345":"But if you take a more interesting shape, some kind of fractal shape, like let's say the coastline of great Britain and you start doing this box, counting experiment, something really interesting happens as you make these boxes smaller, the number of boxes you need to cover the coastline grows faster than it would for just a straight line.","346":"And so what this box counting is getting at is saying, well, I still can never decide what the length of the coastline is, but what I can do is I can see how quick does the number of boxes grow relative to how it would grow just for an ordinary one dimensional curve, like a line or a circle.","347":"So procedural computer graphics, which kind of came out of thinking about fractals is one answer to this question about how do you add more detail without for instance, consuming tons of memory or requiring artists to paint ultra detail the textures. So if, if you can instead describe at least some aspect of what you're looking at in a procedural or recursive way, then you can add as much detail as you need when you get close to objects.","348":"Yeah like perlin noise is a great example, right? Perlin noise was one of the early ways of synthesizing additional texture at any level of detail that you needed to make things look natural and realistic. I have a, a random question. Do you know how the research into fractals began? You can look pretty far back in history to see kind of glimmers of this idea of fractals in science in the 19th century, people were trying to look for examples of things in mathematics that were very unnatural. So there was, for instance, this guy named Georg Cantor, who was showing that you can have these sets with really strange properties, or you can have functions with really strange properties. This thing called the devil staircase and so on. And it wasn't until about a century later where someone named Mendel Brock said, Oh, actually this strange mathematics that was meant to show how unnatural things can happen is actually a perfect description of things that really do happen in nature. And from there, people really ran with it and said, Oh, okay, well, if these fractal descriptions are good for nature, we can also use that for creating really realistic and believable pictures in computer graphics.","349":"It's still pretty easy, right? It turns out that stacking these two cups, it's actually really hard for robots to do that. So, let's think about how we might have a robot stack these two cups. You could program the robot to move its hand right here and then program the robot to close its hand around the cup.","350":"Exactly, right? That seemed pretty simple for the robot to do. Say we even just move the cup over here. Do you think the robot would still be able to stack the cups?","351":"Exactly. So, Moravec's paradox is something that means that these really simple things, like stacking cups, is really, really hard for robots, even though it's really easy for us. While robots are actually really good at really complicated and really difficult things. Think about the task of multiplying two really big numbers together.","352":"this really specific combination of zeros and ones everything that your computer does showing you pink panther videos on youtube calculating things searching the internet it does all of that with a really specific combination of zeros and ones which is crazy right that would be like saying your computer only understands these quarters for each quarter you need to tell it that you're going to use heads tails and you assign it heads or tails so i can switch between heads and tails and i can switch the zeros and ones in my computer so that it represents what i wanted to represent like an a and with quantum computers we have new rules we get to use too we can actually spin one of our quarters so it doesn't have to choose just one or the other","353":"yeah they can especially if doing your homework involves calculating something or finding information but what if your homework was to discover something totally new a lot of those discovery questions are much harder to solve using the computers we have today so the reason we're building these kinds of computers is because we think that maybe one day they're going to do a lot of really important things like help us understand nature better maybe help us create new medicines to help people","354":"So actually, in the blockchain space is one of the spaces where we are seeing zero-knowledge proofs being implemented. And I think it's just the beginning. Let's talk about zero-knowledge proofs. At its core, a zero-knowledge proof is an interaction between two people. Then I should be able to convince you that some statement is true, but you won't have any idea why it's true.","355":"What you're basically asking is, wait, what? Right? Right. So this is what makes zero-knowledge proof so fascinating, and so counter-intuitive. And I think the best way I can explain it to you is by means of an example. But before we do that, I have to decide what I'm gonna prove to you in a, with a zero-knowledge proof.","356":"And the way we're gonna approach this is through something called NP-completeness. What an NP-complete problem is, it's a problem that's really hard to solve. But if you can solve it, you can solve any problem that's in the class NP. And that includes a vast number of problems. And what we're gonna do is we're gonna use an NP-complete problem to actually prove an incredible variety of statements through a zero-knowledge proof. And the specific Np-complete problem that we're gonna be looking at is called map three-coloring. Okay, so here we have a map. Okay. And these are a bunch of countries. And we've arranged them so that no countries that have the same color share a border. That's what makes a map like this validly colored. And now you might think, well, why should we care? It turns out that whether or not a map can be three-colored in this way is an example of an NP-complete problem. And it turns out that, you know, maybe what you really wanna do, is you wanna give a zero-knowledge proof that you have at least 0.3 Bitcoins, right? That would be cool.","357":"Of course, the first step is we have to erase all the colors. What I've done is I've put a color inside each of these envelopes. Now, how do you know that it's a valid coloring? You don't. Right? You have to pick any two neighboring countries. You can pick them however you like. At random.","358":"Right? So now, of course, one way to get more confidence is to open up more of them for you, but that would be revealing information to you. I don't wanna do that. So instead, I'm gonna ask you to please turn around. And now, let's change up these colors. Can you pick two countries at random and we'll reveal two of the colors again.","359":"But as you'll see, now it's not green, it's blue. And this one on the other hand, is green. Okay. The colors I showed you last time, don't work with these new colors, right? This wouldn't have worked before.","360":"Exactly. Right. But it works for this coloring that I'm showing you right now. So what we've done is we've made it impossible for you to put the pieces together. And if you do this, let's say, a thousand times. And if I correctly showed you different colors, each thousand times, you'd be really convinced. And that's it. That's the entire zero-knowledge proof.","361":"It's not about making something more efficient. It's about doing things that we just didn't know how to do before. I can actually prove to you without revealing to you any of my secrets that I use to behave honestly. Right? I could prove to you that I signed some encrypted document correctly. Right? Without revealing to you what that secret document was. That ability to change the game. Like, really just change what we can do is what zero-knowledge brings to the table.","362":"One great example is like in elections. If you could prove that an election was correctly conducted. That every vote was counted, and it all added up to one person winning with a particular total, in zero-knowledge, then you don't have to give up the actual votes of any person. And yet everyone could see that, hey, yeah, it was done correctly.","363":"I'll grant you that Hilbert's Hotel does not exist. For me, infinite objects absolutely exist. And I can't read the thoughts in your head, but I have a high degree of confidence that we have a lot of the same ideas about infinity.","364":"I mean I think that's another common misconception about mathematics is that it's so far removed from the humanities, for instance. I mean it's hard to ignore some of these philosophical questions, particularly when we're talking about certain things like infinity. And I think one of the most difficult things to really be precise about and to explain to students is the continuum hypothesis. What do you say to students about the continuum hypothesis?","365":"It's pretty amazing, right? Because it happened like a year or two ago. Our memory is basically a record in our brain of something that happened in the past, but that record it created isn't perfect. So that day, do you remember was the pool at your hotel?","366":"When you were telling me about the sandbox, it felt like you didn't have to make that guess, that you could just see the sandbox in your eyes. I asked you about the towel. It doesn't come to mind immediately, but you can stop and think about it and kind of make a good guess because there are things you know about the world. And for those of us who study memory that's a really strong hint as to how memory works. And so for you your memory kept all the fun stuff and all the stuff that was important to you, but the details like did you have to have a ticket to get in or how you got there, all these other less interesting, less exciting aspects, your brain kind of decided letting go of all that information.","367":"Yeah, that's a great insight. Basically we can't remember everything. So when you tell us this memory of that vacation and your brain is able to kind of play almost this movie of a memory, a moment, a day that you had in your life a while ago, where do those memories come from?","368":"The hippocampus is a part of your brain that if you kind of took it out and looked at it, it looks a lot like a seahorse and it plays a really important role in creating those kinds of memories that help you two years after your vacation share with me what happened that day, all these details of that day. There's another part of the brain. It's actually also important for memory and it's called the amygdala and it is important for keeping all the kind of emotional processing going for memory. So memory for things that are really scary, it's gonna talk to the hippocampus now and get that memory to be really strong. Why do you think it might be important to remember scary things?","369":"Right? Yeah. So that's already a really good idea of what a fractal is. It has some really, really interesting detail at all, scales that makes it hard to talk about standard quantities like lengths and areas and volumes.","370":"Yeah, so if you look at kind of the wrinkly surface of an asteroid, each one of those little wrinkles adds a little bit to the surface area. And so it's really hard to say, what is the area of an asteroid? Let's take a look at a little example of where fractals actually show up in nature. What we're gonna try to do is we're gonna try to say what the length of the coastline of great Britain is. So we're gonna start out with the blue ones, which are spaced further apart. We're gonna ask you to connect the blue pins with a piece of string so we can get a measurement of the coastline. So we have our first measurement of the length of the coastline, and we're gonna do it over again. But this time we're gonna use the white pins, which are spaced closer together. So we measured the coastline again. And what do you think happens?","371":"I think I agree with you, but I think to really validate our scientific experiment, we should probably compare the length of the string. A lot of extra slack in that pig of string. So what we noticed with great Britain is we were never able to measure it's length. It just kept getting longer and longer. This is called the coastline paradox where there's not really one definite number you can assign to the length of the coastline, but it depends on how you measure it. Like if we kept going to really get this to be accurate, we might have to like actually go down the beach and start measuring these tiny little details along the coastline. But really there's so much detail. We would probably never get a definite answer for how long the coastline is. Fractals also give us a really nice language. We're talking about how smooth or rough some kind of shape is. And actually a lot of people, engineers and scientists use this idea of fractals and this language of fractals to compare different shapes, not in terms of their size, but in terms of their roughness. So based on everything we talked about today, how would you describe a fractal to somebody in your own words?","372":"Our topic today is quantum sensing. So quantum is about the study of stuff that's really, really, really small and sensing is about measuring. So the word sensing comes from kind of like our senses. So do you know what your five senses are?","373":"Touch, exactly. So it's kind of really important for us to be able to have these senses, so we know what's happening in the world around us, right? In doing quantum sensing is we're trying to measure things that can be hard to see. Let me show you. Can you see inside it with your eyes?","374":"You wouldn't be able to see into the middle. If you had the right tools, you could start to think about ways to look inside the ball without cutting it open. That would then, you'd still have your ball. We could still play with it.","375":"For example, we want to go inside, let's say the human body and see what's happening. Sometimes we can look under the surface of the Earth and see what's underneath it. We can make really, really precise clocks that will tell us, that can measure time really, really accurately. And we can make very, very fine measurements that'll tell us about the rules of science and how the world works around us. But we need to build better tools that allow us to do that.","376":"Yeah, I started out doing magnetic resonance, studying things like bone and biomedical magnetic resonance. Ended up playing with spins for a long time and the physics of spins just fascinated me.","377":"You have to be close to it. You can detect it optically because if we tried to detect the magnetic moment of the electron, we wouldn't be able to do that because there, the energy is too low compared to thermal energies. But what the diamond system gives you is a natural up conversion in energy. So you can couple into an optical photon, which is then much easier to detect a single optical photon than it is to detect a micro wave.","378":"I would tend to agree that I think, in some sense, anything that uses superposition could be a quantum sensor, but then spectroscopy uses superpositions and has been around for 60, 70 years. I think what excites me most now is the idea that can we push the boundaries of how sensitive one can make this technique? How improving sensitivity, specificity, what other limits and we define it better, are there fundamental physical limits?","379":"So do you think you can integrate multiple NV centers or multiple optical sensors? So are there ways in which you can overcome this question of there's a spot size and that limits how many NVs I can pack into a certain region?","380":"Right. People bring in very different perspectives into what used to be a very niche field. I remember in physics, you'd only talk to people in your subfield and now we're picking up the phone and talking to people in the different departments, completely different areas and we're forced to learn different languages.","381":"it's something that we've already figured out for classical computing like something that amazes me is all the parallels between what we're going through now for quantum computing and what we went through for classical computing","382":"exactly so i think something that frustrates a lot of people about quantum computing is the concept of decoherence right you can only keep your information quantum for so long right and that limits how many operations you can do in a row before you lose your information","383":"Yeah it looks really blocky. And it's the same thing not only with shapes and games, but also colors and textures. And this is an especially a big problem in virtual reality because you have no control over where people are gonna go. What they're gonna look at, how close they're gonna get to various objects. So fractals on the other hand are these things that have infinitely, you know, nice details you get closer and closer and closer. And so this is something that can help us solve this problem in computer graphics of generating more detail. One of the reasons why fractals are really nice for computer graphics is because the algorithms that we use to draw images also have this kind of recursive flavor. What's recursion?","384":"They're easy for a computer to execute, right? It just has to run this recursive procedure over and over and over again. We can kind of get as much detail as we want or need. When I think about fractals and kind of what they've done for computer graphics. The example I think is subdivision surfaces. Did you, did you encounter subdivision surfaces in your graphics class at all?","385":"So subdivision surface is a way of describing a smooth shape on a computer rather than some complicated fractal shape. So meshes and computer graphics are usually made of these flat polygons with kind of sharp edges. And so the question is how can I get something nice and round and smooth out of these sharp looking polygons? What I can do is I can start cutting one at a time, the corners of this paper off, it still looks very angular. I still have these really sharp points.","386":"Because I want to draw a smooth curve on the screen, but all my computer can do is draw straight lines. And that's actually too true of GPUs. It's kind of interesting. GPUs are basically really fast machines that can only draw one thing and that's a flat triangle. And so if we keep doing this with our paper, you kind of get pretty quickly the idea of what's gonna happen. So when you go to see a Pixar movie, for instance, every surface has been subdivided down. So you have tiny little triangles called micro polygons that are even smaller than the size of a pixel.","387":"Well, because people who really need to use these subdivision services for everything, people who worked hard over the years to make this super, super fast. In fact, subdivision services were invented basically at Pixar. There's this guy, Ed Capel, and he was harshly responsible for one of the most famous kinds of subdivision surfaces called Capel Clark subdivision surfaces. And in fact recently won the touring award for these subdivision services.","388":"So we've, talked a little bit about the positive features of fractals and procedural graphics, which is you can write one simple recursive program and the computer creates a lot of detail for you. So that's really nice, right? It's saving you a lot of work, but the downside is you lose a lot of control. So because the only thing you're describing is this short little program, you don't have complete control over how this is gonna end up. And so adding more controllability to procedural graphics is something people have been thinking about for many years. So how has our conversation changed your understanding of what fractals are all about?","389":"Okay, back into the 1960s, there was a research agency in the United States called DARPA, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency. Actually, it was called ARPA at the time. They wanted to build this notion of a packet-switching network. Not a circuit switch network like a phone network where you get a dedicated path and a dedicated set of bandwidth and links from source to destination.","390":"There's a lot big, right? And so remember, this was a Department of Defense, was they wanted to have forms of of communication that were very robust, that were survivable. Packets could all find their own ways, be routed differently through the network. So if parts of the network failed, you could route around failures.","391":"So you can sort of see how the network architecture that wasn't designed to be 100% reliable inside the core of the network, and had that complexity built into the edges of the network. And to me, the really cool thing is you put this infrastructure in place, and then all these super creative people think about amazing things to build on top of it. And you see this proliferation of amazing applications.","392":"Ah ha! Spoken like a real computer scientist, right? You're a computer scientist. I'm a computer scientist. We talk about APIs, application programming interfaces. The API for the internet is something called a socket. And a socket simply says, I can communicate if I know your internet address, you know, 128.119.40.186, that number is the IP address of my server, the University of Massachusetts. If you know that, you can write a program anywhere in the world and send a message, and it'll pop out at my end.","393":"That's 98% true. And if you own a network, like you're att.com, or your verizon.com, you can do, within that network, you can do what you want, right? So in that sense, the internet is very decentralized, that the control of the network is up to whoever owns the network. The 2% where you said there's nobody in control, there's a little bit of centralized control. There's an organization called the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers. Its responsibility is to handle, as the name ICANN suggests, names and numbers. It's that little bit of centralization, central authority that you need.","394":"Exactly, right. And maybe they're dropped in your apartment, but much more likely, they're dropped because of congestion somewhere between the Hulu or the Netflix or the Disney server, if you're watching a video, and your home. So even though you've got 200 megabits per second on that last hop, you don't have 200 megabits per second from the server into your apartment.","395":"Yeah. It is exactly using quantum phenomena to sense and measure things and the idea is that, if I can harness quantum phenomena and I can push the limits that are possible, I can get something that's ultimately more precise and potentially more accurate over time too.","396":"So I study spins. And so, spins are one of the platforms that people have suggested is a useful platform for building quantum technologies and I study spins on the solid state. And one of the platforms I work on is nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond.","397":"So in some sense, the phenomena we're studying essentially is nuclear magnetic resonance or electron spin resonance which is a very similar phenomena, but uses the spin of the electron rather than the spin of the nuclei.","398":"So rather than trying to build a lot of complex algorithms and gates with it, what you do is, you take these quantum bits and you take them out into the world and say, what do you see? What are you sensitive to? So you can use an idea called entanglement to make an even more sensitive quantum sensor, but it's even more fragile. So there's always this trade-off between being super fragile and being super sensitive at the same time.","399":"So entanglement is the idea that two particles are correlated. They're essentially in the same quantum state, so that you can't disturb one particle without disturbing the second particle. And so, if I have a large number of quantum sensors that are entangled, then they're all going to interact much more strongly than if I just had one of them interact at a time.","400":"So some ways, you know, when atomic clocks were designed and built, we didn't necessarily think of GPS, but technology often works that way is that, there are new discoveries and then someone else comes along and says, hey, this is a great tool for some other application.","401":"Well, we're gonna be talking about computers here today, and we're gonna be talking about the internet. I always like to think of the internet by analogy to say road systems for example, where you have roads in your neighborhood. You have state roads, you have the Interstate Highway System. And so the internet is a lot like that. It's an interconnection of local roads, local networks like the network in your house for example.","402":"Wow. Great question. Often, it's a little blue wire called an ethernet cable. So that cable is able to bring bits of information up into your apartment at say, a billion bits per second. That's pretty fast, right? Literally a wire that goes between a box in your apartment, sometimes called a router or a modem in your apartment that comes from an internet service provider come into this first network and then that network connects to another network connects to another network connects to another network.","403":"We could talk about that by analogy to a road system. It's not just one big, super highway. It's a lot of smaller super highways that are all interconnected. And those interchanges are what are called routers. That's where the links come together. You're talking about talking to a friend in Australia. So oh, it's coming in from the East Coast of the United States to this router, and it's going out say, that routers in San Francisco, it's going out on an underseas cable over to Australia rather than in this direction up to Japan.","404":"The underseas cables are so cool! They're these big cables that are laid down by switches. They cross both the Atlantic, the Pacific, the Indian Ocean. So the undersea cables are how the networks in Europe, United States, Asia are all connected together.","405":"That's really what we call the first hop. It's like from your phone, from your tablet, from the computer that you're on, there's no cables coming in. You go over a wireless connection. Wi-Fi is the protocol that allows your computer to talk to that first hop router over a wireless communication link.","406":"Ah, you said they're all in one spot. In fact, they're in lots of spots in Netflix. And so most applications would like to connect you with a server that's close to you. Server is really just a big computer with a lot of memory, a lot of discs that store all the Netflix movies, and also so that you don't have to cross over too many internet links to get from where the server is to the TV or the device in your home.","407":"Ah, another great question. There's a couple of things that could happen inside the internet. Information is sent in these little packets of information from the Netflix server to your display device. And literally, each packet that arrives says, This is the first packet for Jenna. This is the second. This is the third. This is the fifth. This is the fourth. And they're reordered for you. Matter of fact, your computer will say, using the TCP protocol to the server, Hey, I didn't get packet four, can you resend it again? And again, the Netflix server is very happy to send you packet four again. The other is the internet protocol. If you think about sending letters through the US Postal Service, how you've got an address on it. So every packet that flows from the Netflix server to you has an address on it. It says, This is going to Jenna. It's going to the what's called the Internet Protocol address of your device. Think of all the range of devices that are hooked up to the internet. It's totally amazing, right? Every single one of them has one thing in common, and that is they speak the IP protocol, the Internet Protocol. That was a great question.","408":"That's the computer science brain thinking right there. So we wanna think of a function as procedure or mapping between sets. So a function defines a one-to-one correspondence if it defines a perfect matching between the elements of its domain set and the elements of its output set. We call such functions bijections or isomorphisms. So the reason I'm so interested in this idea of a bijective function or a one-to-one correspondence that guarantees that every element of one set gets matched with an element of the other set, no matter how many elements there are, these bijections or these one-to-one correspondences as they help mathematicians reason about infinity.","409":"Today we're gonna think about infinity as a cardinality, which is a technical term for a number that could be a size of a set. And we're gonna use this idea of one-to-one correspondence to try and investigate the question of whether all infinite sets have the same size. So what I've drawn here are some pictures of some of the infinite sets that appear in mathematics. So the natural numbers are the prototypical example of an infinite set. So the natural numbers are clearly a subset of the integers. Both of these are infinite sets. Are they the same size infinity or different size infinities?","410":"I'm gonna now try and convince you that they are in fact the same size infinity. And this is using this idea of a one-to-one correspondence which was applied in this context by Georg Cantor. What he says is if we can match up the elements of the integers with the elements of the natural numbers so that there's nothing left over, so that there's a bijective function between them, then that's a proof that there's exactly as many natural numbers as there are integers. Start by matching zero with zero and one with one. But then we wanna include the negatives in the list. So which natural number would we match with negative one?","411":"Maybe two. Why not? Because now we're starting to make progress on matching all the negatives. We can match the natural number three with the integer two, the natural number four with the integer minus two. And do you see a pattern?","412":"Great. So now I have a much harder question. So we have the same challenge, again, evidently there are way, way, way more rational numbers than there are integers. Does that mean this is a larger infinite set than the integers? What do you think?","413":"Yeah, that's exactly right. And now for each pair of integers, I'm gonna represent it by a corresponding natural number. That's what's going on with this counting. And when I compose those operations, what I've done is I've encoded rational numbers as natural numbers in a way that reveals that they can be no larger, there are no more rational numbers than natural numbers.","414":"Exactly. That's exactly right. So we were hoping to compare the size of infinity of the rational numbers with the size of infinity of the natural numbers. What we've done is introduced an intermediate set, these pair of integer points, and this proves that this size of infinity is smaller than this size of infinity. Since we also have an injective function the other way, this size of infinity is smaller than this size of infinity so therefore they must be the same size.","415":"Yes. You see the idea right away. So I'm gonna form a new real number whose first digit is different from this one. And you've already convinced yourself that this number is not on this list anywhere. Why is that?","416":"Great. That's exactly right. So what we've proven is that this number is missing, and therefore it is impossible to define a bijection between the natural numbers and the real numbers.","417":"So we've started to explore some of the counterintuitive properties of infinity. On the one hand there are infinite sets that feel very different like the natural numbers, the integers, the rational numbers that nevertheless have the same size or the same infinite cardinality. While there are other infinities that are larger. So there's more than one size of infinity, not all infinities are created equal.","418":"okay so it's this idea that you have two objects and when you entangle them together they become connected and then they're sort of permanently connected to each other and they behave in ways that are sort of a system now so superposition is one quantum property that we use entanglement is another quantum property and a third is interference how much you know about interference","419":"so you can have constructive interference and you can have destructive interference we have constructive interference you have amplitudes wave amplitudes that add until the signal gets larger and if you have destructive interference the amplitudes cancel by using a property like interference we can control quantum states and amplify the kinds of signals that are towards the right answer and then cancel the types of signals that are leading to the wrong answer so given that you know that we're trying to use superposition entanglement and interference for computation how do you think we build these computers","420":"so step one is you need to be able to have an object or physical device we call it a qubit or quantum bit that can actually handle those things can actually be put into superpositions of states you know two cubit states that you can physically entangle with each other that's not really trivial right and things in our classical world you can't really entangle things in our classical world so easily we need to use devices where they can they can support a quantum state and we can manipulate that quantum state atoms ions and in our case superconducting qubits we make qubits out of superconducting materials","421":"I can also ask how big it is, which is a question about its volume. If I make it smaller, then what's happening is it's becoming more dense. So imagine I crushed this really, really small. It would weigh the same, it would have the same mass, but it would be much more dense.","422":"If a star is heavy enough to explode into supernova what's left begins to collapse under its own weight. And if that's heavy enough, the core will not be able to stop collapsing, 'cause it no longer has the thermonuclear fuel, it's run outta fuel. And if it's run outta fuel, it's no longer shining and pushing outward. And without that it itself begins to go dark and there's nothing fighting the collapse anymore. And that's when you form a black hole.","423":"Well, that's a really good question. So interestingly, the sun itself isn't heavy enough. So it has to be heavy enough that when it begins to collapse, it just overcomes all attempts to fight it. If you made something really dense, you would have to travel faster than the speed of light to actually escape. That's 300,000 kilometers per second.","424":"So it goes so fast that it goes completely dark. Any light that veers too close will fall in, will not be able to make it back out again. If a light is shining from the sun near a black hole, the black hole's not touching it. Why does the light get pulled in? Why does that happen?","425":"It is taking other stuff, but the funny question was like, if I wanted to move your chair, you'd think it was really strange if I didn't have to come near you and actually grab the chair and move it. One of the things Einstein thought about is he imagined that what the black hole is doing is it's changing the shape of space around it. What do you think of that idea?","426":"Isn't it crazy? And then Einstein goes a step further and thinks, well, what black holes must be doing is curving the space so strongly that even light gets caught. Sometimes you can get light caught into a whole orbit, literally the light going round and round in an orbit.","427":"So one of my main research areas is something called category theory, it's been described as the mathematics of mathematics. It's a language that can be used to prove very general theorems. And an interesting aspect of being a researcher in category theory that doesn't come up as much in other areas is that we have to really pay attention to the axioms of set theory in our work. When you're proving theorems, have you ever used the axiom of choice?","428":"So the way I think about it is if you have an infinite or an arbitrary family of sets and you know for sure that none of these sets are empty, then a choice function would allow you to select an element from each set sort of all at once. When you've used the axiom of choice in proofs, do you know which incarnation of this you've used?","429":"So there are three well-known famous equivalent forms of the axiom of choice. The well ordering principle is the assumption, the axiom that any set can be well ordered, but there are lots of subsets of real numbers that do not have a minimal element. So that ordering is not a well ordering. So here's the key question. Do you believe the axiom of choice?","430":"That's right. So a rigorous way to work with a category of sets is to demand that it's a category of sets whose size is bounded by this cardinality, Alpha say. That is then an example of a category that fits into another even still larger Grothendieck universe Beta. So implicitly in a lot of my research, I have to add an additional assumption that there exists maybe countably many inaccessible cardinals.","431":"We're used to ethernet cables that can handle many hundreds of gigabits per second over a wired device. What are the typical data rates for IoT devices? I mean, not hundreds of gigabits.","432":"My sense is you're spot on, that they'll produce over time, a lot of data. And that a lot of IoT is about computing on that data. That computation happened mostly at the edge, or somehow a combination between the edge and something happening in a far away data center.","433":"I think for a long time, the internet hasn't grappled with, but now has with IoT and also with cellular networks, generally is the question of mobility. Do you imagine in the future that it might be possible for mobile devices not to always have to connect through the same provider to go from one network to another?","434":"Absolutely. I don't think we still have a completely satisfactory answer to that question. What was so, such a beautiful insight, as I'm sure you know, is that the idea of zero-knowledge","435":"If you can already predict the answer, then you must not be gaining any knowledge by that interaction. This insight of being able to predict the future accurately, and that being an evidence of a lack of new knowledge,","436":"Right. Sometimes. I mean, for example, in medical research, how amazing would it be, right, to be able to have a drug, and be able to prove that my drug works in this model.","437":"in a zero-knowledge way, without any interaction, right. I can just take the program, convert it to a zero-knowledge program, or an obfuscated program, and then just send it to you.","438":"It's a great question. I wish I could see the future. I can't actually, but let me try. The part of that that I'm the most comfortable answering is of course the mathematical side.","439":"Yeah, and probably nobody is. Have you heard a lot in your studies about these super massive black holes that we think lurk in the centers of very nearly every galaxy?","440":"Yeah, I think it's a really good question. The only mechanism that we know for sure can form black holes is to collapse of very massive stars. So it's sensible to think, well maybe some very massive stars in a young universe collapsed under their own weight and then they merged and after some time they got big enough, but the black holes from stars can be tens of times the mass of the sun, maybe hundreds of times to the mass of the sun if they merge. To get to millions and billions, and if you just do the simple arithmetic of how many years that would take, there aren't enough years in the 14 billion years of the universe's lifetime. So they must have come from somewhere else.","441":"Yeah, I think that's right. I think people are really perplexed about how you make something so big in such a short period of time. It's kind of funny, the bigger you make a black hole, it seems maybe counterintuitive, but the less dense the material has to be out of which you make it. So you can, out of something the density almost of air, you can make a supermassive black hole. You can't make a star out of that, but weirdly, if you skip the star phase altogether, it's conceivable that they directly collapse. And so there's suddenly a new way to make black holes that nature has figured out.","442":"Yeah, and it's very possible that as you said, the collision won't be so severe that it'll be very disruptive. So our entire solar system could stay intact and here we would go with the sun and all the other planets in orbit around a new black hole.","443":"We work a lot right now on thinking of black holes as batteries. So a black hole that can take, like a giant magnet, astronomical magnet in the form of another collapsed star, like a neutron star, and flip it around so fast, near the speed of light, that it actually creates an electronic circuit out of this moving magnet. And so that the power that can come out of these electronic circuits created by these batteries can be tremendous.","444":"So Claire, we've had this pretty fascinating conversation about supermassive black holes in particular. And after our discussion, what is it that has changed for you in your perspective or what is it that excites you?","445":"and actually machine learning is one research direction where we're really hoping that we're going to find um key parts of the machine learning computation that can be sped up using quantum computing","446":"if you think about even just classical information like bits right at the end of the day when you store a bit in your hard drive there's a magnetic domain and you have a magnetic polarization right","447":"so you need a chip with qubits each qubit is a carrier of quantum information and the way we control the state of that qubit is using microwave pulses you send them all the way down these cables and we've calibrated these microwave pulses so that we know exactly this kind of pulse what this frequency and this duration will put the cupid into superposition or we'll flip the state of the qubit from zero to one or if we apply a microwave pulse between two qubits we can entangle them","448":"i'm glad you're interested i think the place where lots of people can get involved right now is by going and trying it out and thinking about what they could do with it there's a lot of opportunity to find these near-term applications that are only going to be found by trying things out","449":"One thing I find really fascinating about robotics is that the things that are so simple for us, like feeding yourself broccoli, so second nature to us, are really hard for robotics. When you try to take a robot and train it to do a task and simulation, and the simulation isn't perfectly accurate, it's really hard to actually model the physics of how tofu crumbles.","450":"I think I have a somewhat similar perspective to you in that, if we provide more structure and support, and sort of forms of prior knowledge or experience in the algorithm, that should make it more efficient. And so if we can acquire those kinds of priors about the world and about interaction from previous data, maybe offline data, then I think we should be able to make learning of new tasks more efficient.","451":"It's a really, really hard problem. A lot of simulators, they don't simulate the world as a fine enough time granularity to really accurately capture things like skewing an object, for example. One thing that I think is promising is to try to not build simulators entirely from first principles, from our knowledge of physics. But instead to look at real data and see how real data might inform our simulations and try to build, allow robots to build models of the world, build simulators of the world, based on data and based on experiences. There's a little bit of a chicken and egg problem, because if we wanna use simulators to get lots of data, and we also need data to get good simulators, then there's no way to get around this.","452":"So a fractal is something that we see every day, but it's a little bit hard to describe. It's it's a shape that if you look at it really far away, or you look at it really up close, it has kind of a similar appearance. And actually that word fractal sounds a little bit like fraction.","453":"So your tree is totally beautiful, but it took a long time to make, right. How would you feel if I said, now you have to make a thousand of those trees.","454":"We're in level five now. So you're the expert-expert. I'm a huge fan of the work that you did in RCP, the Routing Control Platform being a precursor to software-defined networking and the notion that rather than having protocols actually always compute things, that we could compute things in data centers. I'd be interested if you could sort of just reflect back on that time and sort of the beginnings of SDN and where it's come since then.","455":"Right, so some people have called that the flattening of the internet, right? I think it used to be on average, you would go through 10 different networks to get from a source to a destination.","456":"And certainly, we've heard about some countries that impose firewalls that don't let certain kinds of traffic out, or certain kinds of traffic in. So there's no global body that is regulating that?","457":"You're one of the most awesome networking researchers that I know. I'm curious, just to pick your brain, what do you think are some of the hot topics in networking research? Where do you think the field is heading?","458":"You know, we've had cellular networks now for 20, 30 years. So when we hear about 5G, what's trumpeted the most is the fact that oh, super high bandwidth, right? But I sense that the exciting things are more than just the network being faster.","459":"Coming back again to the softwarization. SDN and softwarization is a maybe a little bit behind the covers, that you wouldn't normally see it as a user going from 3G to 4G to 5G. You just see an increase in speed. But yet, the way the network is now being managed again, I think is bringing the cellular networking world sort of into the internet world in terms of the softwarization-","460":"So that's a great definition and I wanna pick that apart a little bit. So what you described is just right. Stars, when they run out of thermonuclear fuel are gonna collapse under their own weight. It'll explode in a supernova, it'll leave a core, and if the core itself is heavy enough, it will keep collapsing. It does, as you say, reach this point where not even light can escape. But the amazing thing is it leaves that point, you called it rightly the event horizon, it leaves it behind kind of like an archeological record because the start itself can no more sit at the event horizon than it can race outward at the speed of light. So the core of the star keeps collapsing and where it goes nobody knows. So in a weird way, the black hole isn't anymore a crush of matter. It left it behind in its wake, but the stuff of the star is gone.","461":"It turns out that there are only three quantities that define a black hole, its electric charge, its mass, and its spin. So the most general black hole can also spin and it can also be electrically charged. Whether or not they are has to do with how they formed. If a star collapses, it will likely be spinning when it collapses and the remnant black hole that formsbwill likely be spinning. A black hole of a certain mass, charge, and spin is indistinguishable from any other black hole with those same properties. So in some sense, they're like fundamental particles, which makes them absolutely exceptional for any other astrophysical object. Have you heard the stories about what happens inside a black hole?","462":"So from the outside, if you're an astronaut, you're watching your friend, another astronaut going into the black hole, it's as though your times become rotated relative to each other. So the profound thing is as an astronaut on the outside, looking at this round event horizon, you think of the center of black hole as a point in space, but to the person who's fallen in, it's not a point in space at all, it's a point in time. The singularity, or the end of it all, the crush in the center of a black hole is in their future. So they can no more avoid the singularity than you can avoid the next instant of time coming. So the death in the singularity is inevitable. Although we don't really think the singularity necessarily exists.","463":"So the singularity is definitely predicted in Einstein's general theory of relativity and that's purely a theory of spacetime. And in the theory of spacetime, there is no question that a singularity would form when the star collapses catastrophically inside the black hole. Now, even when people talked about singularities back in the '60s, they thought, you know, quantum mechanics is part of the story of the whole of physics. It's not just gravity. And if we understand quantum gravity we'll realize that singularity probably doesn't ever actually form.","464":"I would say to some extent we don't know for sure. What we have found is that the mathematics is so unbelievably powerful that we're able to disprove wrong ideas just in pen and paper. Just very recently, within the past couple of years, the first ever human-procured image of a black hole showed us what we expected to see of the event horizon. So Jayda, after our conversation today, what would you say a black hole is?","465":"The beauty of being a student of something like black holes is you never stop having new impressions of what this enigmatic phenomena is. So in a year, I'll tell you what I learned that's new.","466":"There's this domain of black holes in astrophysics where we see stars collapse, and we know that they exist and there's whole observational astronomy around them. And then there's this domain that we're talking about, where, as you said, black holes are so special because they're kind of guiding us in the right direction to understand the very nature of reality. And that makes them really unusually special. And one of the things I wanted to draw out is that we talk about the fundamental forces of nature. So there's the matter forces, and then the outlier is gravity. We've quantized all the matter forces in a way that we're rather comfortable with. Gravity keeps resisting quantization of gravity itself. And now we're thinking in a way that you're describing that, well, maybe it's only the quantum forces altogether.","467":"It is amazing in the numerical simulations of two black holes merging, you really see the event horizons bobble around. And we were talking earlier about how really black holes are flawless, they don't tolerate those kinds of imperfections. And so you can so quickly watch the system wring away that misshapen merger. And it comes out in the gravitational waves, which is literally the ripples in the shape of spacetime until it settles down, and then it's utterly flawless again. It really happens fast. It's quite amazing.","468":"And on one hand memory is like a record of something that happened in the past that we can carry with us and we can like bring it back to mind. And on the other hand we need to be a little bit suspicious sometimes because we might get it wrong. In what world would that memory of the orange juice maybe be useful?","469":"Sometimes, you know, memory is doing something much simpler but no less important for us, which is it's helping us figure out what's good and what's bad. And if we can remember what's good and what's bad from what we did in the past, that can help us make decisions about what to do next time. So Dylan, you may be surprised to learn this, but we asked your mom what some of your favorite candies are. So you have to make a decision between these two candies and whichever one you pick, you actually get to take with you.","470":"Everything you just said is exactly what we know from research. All the thoughts running through your mind, were really at kind of about a prediction into the future, right? You're like, how, how will this taste if, when it's in my mouth or how will I feel about my decision down the road? You know we think of memory as something in the past, but it's an example of how you use your memories of these two candies to predict what's gonna happen in the future so that you can make a decision in the present. But you did it, you made your way through that torture. And now you've got to keep the candy.","471":"Matilda. All right. We're gonna actually build an internet. I've got a couple of things here that I wanna show you, or a couple of toys, actually. Okay, let's pretend that these round balls are computers. And the internet is something that connects them. And right now, the internet is just one communication link. And Matilda is sent over the internet from this computer to your computer. So the internet is a network for carrying information from one computer to another. Now this network here looks pretty simple, doesn't it? Right? It's just one thing. Should we add some more friends in?","472":"That's right. So that's pretty cool. There are actually lots of different ways to actually go through the internet to get from what we call a source, the place that's sending the information, to the receiver, the place that's actually gathering the information together. And that's something we actually call routing.","473":"Yeah. So that's a really good observation. In most pieces of the internet, that's exactly what would happen. We want to take what's called a shortest path. But still, there are multiple paths. And why do you think that might be valuable?","474":"Exactly. So, Skylar, that was a great discussion about what we just built. And I wanted to talk to you about, or ask you about maybe one other really important part about networks. And it's not so much the thing itself, the physical thing, but more about the rules about communication. That's governed by something that are called protocols. Are you up for one?","475":"It's a great analogy. You know I remember when I first learned of your work, for me as somebody who studies learning and memory, which are processes that are all about rapid updating that to me was really mind blowing that we can now start asking questions about dynamics of circuits on a timescale that's much closer to the timescale of human thought than anything we had before.","476":"We now think of the hippocampus so much in terms of memory but really some of the earliest work in neuroscience on the hippocampus talked about the role of the hippocampus in spatial navigation. And it really exposed I think one of the deepest questions in memory research, or at least from the neuroscience perspective is like, well what is the connection? What is the connection between spatial processing and memory? And why is it that neurons in the hippocampus when an animal is navigating a maze, why is it that there's spatial specialization there? I really do think that this notion of a mental model, a generative model is where those, where memory and space meet.","477":"Memories as models or models first and memory as part of what helps build the model starts generating new predictions. Exactly the kind you just brought up or other ways of thinking about things because an efficient model needs to let go of information, right? I just heard a colleague of mine joking about the fact that the principles of neuroscience textbook keeps growing and growing. And that if we had enough strength in theoretical neuroscience, if our models of neuroscience were good enough, that book should shrink back. We know that memory retrieval is essentially construction. And so you don't need to store all those separate memories. You need to construct them. But if you have a good model, let go of all those details and just construct them to feel as if it's a memory. But really all you're doing is using the model to fill the details. It's kind of like the matrix, you know.","478":"I agree. I think, you know, as you were speaking I was thinking maybe the most important word to replace there is record. Record implies an etching of something as it was. And maybe what we need instead is that it's a model, it's an approximation, it's an abstraction that can help us create the illusion of constructing your record. But that it's the model that's the important thing that drives the whole thing.","479":"So a lot of times stars are born together in two star systems and when they die, if they're heavy enough, they will collapse under their own weight and form a black hole. So here you have a black hole and a big fluffy star. And what will happen is it'll start to tear apart its neighboring star. Literally parts of the star will begin to spill onto the black hole and splatter on the black hole. But let's say both those stars formed black holes. And what these black holes do is they are like mallets on a drum. They create literally waves in the shape of spacetime as they're moving. So imagine mallets on a drum, how the drum ripples. Depending on how the mallets are moving you hear different sounds. So effectively these black holes, as they get very close together in the final stages of their life together, they're orbiting each other at hundreds of times a second. It's this really crazy event, but it's happening in complete darkness. Eventually they bobble together and they merge and then they wring out, the spacetime's going crazy around them, it's this storm in spacetime, and they settle down to a quiet black hole. Then those waves that they created travel through the universe, basically undisturbed. For a long time people thought, well, even if black holes are out there, they're impossible to observe. And then they got very clever. You might wonder how we could possibly hear black holes, that sounds crazy. So I'm gonna show you, but I'm gonna need your help. This demo involves an electric guitar. Do you play at all?","480":"Okay, you wanna do the demo for me? So the LIGO instrument electronically records the ringing of the shape of space with its very complicated instrument. It stands for Laser Interferometric Gravitational-Waves Observatory and the design was incredibly difficult and they didn't know if they would succeed. I think of the instrument as like the body of the electric guitar. And then they take the readout of the motions of the waves that they're recording, just like that guitar is recording the motions of the waves on the string. Now just play it like a little bit. And you can't hear anything, right? You're not meant to hear an electric guitar when it's not plugged in. What's happening is the guitar strings are ringing, but so quietly that we can't actually hear the sound. And this is like the gravitational waves, which are ringing the drum of spacetime, but so quietly that they're not move the air and we're not hearing them. So now play and I'm gonna turn the volume up a little bit. While I can't actually hear the ringing of the strings themselves, I can hear the data of the shape of the string recorded and played through this amplifier. And that's kind of the idea behind the LIGO instrument.","481":"It's a really good question. Only this instrument, and that's why it was so hard to build. And by the time it gets here, it's so weak that it's only squeezing and stretching space at like the fraction of a nucleus over very large distances. Has your understanding of black holes changed over the course of our conversation?","482":"So over the past four levels, we've been talking about Moravec's paradox. I'm curious to get your perspective. There are still a lot of open questions for how to leverage previous experience and learn cumulatively over time.","483":"I think it's interesting. And also a huge challenge. I think that it's interesting that if a person sees a robot doing something that seems very capable, they assume that the robot can do all sorts of other capable things. It's a huge challenge, because that's actually not the case.","484":"I like that description, because it conveys how much complexity there is to these really basic tasks that we're doing. Is there a definition for the simple tasks that we do versus things that are more complex, like playing chess?","485":"That notion of hierarchy is really interesting, because it is these higher level things, like playing chess, for example, that are easier for AI systems. And the reason why they're easier is that we're providing the abstraction for the system already, then when we give the game of chess to an AI system, we abstract away all the challenges of like picking up pieces and moving them, and we say, 'Okay, there's this board of however many boxes on it.' And you just need to figure out within that very narrow, small world, what to do. But handling and learning what those abstractions should be and handling everything from low level sensory inputs to that higher level processing is really, really hard.","486":"I suspect that we'll start by doing whatever is most convenient, 'cause that's whatever we can get. But I think that for robots to be capable alongside humans, in a world with humans, I think that we may need to actually use human experience, human learning, to inform how robots learn, if we want them to follow the same kind of mistake pattern as humans, so that humans can interpret robots, and humans can understand what robots will and will not do.","487":"What I love about what you were describing is like you didn't use the word memory, were how you were talking about kind of perceptions and social judgments but I think probably we'd both agree that memory is a big part of that.","488":"Right, like it reminds me so much of, you know, what we in the field would refer to as statistical learning. On one hand we might have like a one-shot memory, a memory of something that we saw yesterday, like what we did or what we ate or where we were. But a lot of our memories and our knowledge instead are based on many, many, many experiences.","489":"Some of those examples really remind me also some of the questions about kind of abnormalities in, in memory or trauma or disruptions in memory and how they also play out in terms of not just what people remember but what they do with those memories right?","490":"I think what we're still kind of trying to understand as a field is the more kind of detailed and bigger picture of where does this model live? How does it get updated based on experiences? Why does that sometimes happen and sometimes not? There are actually people who are born without a hippocampus. They have disruptions to episodic memories. They have trouble after this conversation remembering what the conversation was about, but they do have pretty good semantic information. They have a good sense of knowledge about the world. And that's interesting for two reasons. One, it shows this association between the role of the hippocampus and these two forms of memory, episodic memories and semantic memory. The other reason it's interesting is that people often assume that we get to semantic memory through episodic memory, that we encounter one dog and then another dog, and then another dog and then we learned the concept, the semantic notion of a dog. And these people, their profile suggests that you can learn semantic information. You can learn general knowledge about the world, even without ever having the capacity to build those individual memories.","491":"You know when I look back at, some of the work for my own lab and in the field in general, I really feel like some of the most exciting discoveries were not an answer to a question that was around before, but they were discoveries that made us realize we weren't asking the right question. I think one example of that even has to do with the connection between memory and decision-making. There was a discovery about how the striatum responds to rewards and to learning that just all of a sudden flipped the way we thought about the role of reward and learning and memory, and may force us to realize there was something fundamentally connected between these processes. And that discovery just raised a whole new set of questions that didn't exist before.","492":"Each project should be very focused and rigorous and know what a study is designed for. But at the same time we have to keep our minds open, our eyes open for what else is happening. Some of the most interesting discoveries didn't make sense at first.","493":"And things that are hard for humans should also be hard for robots and humans to do. But it turns out that it's actually the opposite. I wanna try a little demo.","494":"So I have a penny in my hand and I'd like you to pick it up with your right hand and put it into your left hand. So that was pretty easy, right?","495":"We're gonna make this a little bit harder now. So, can you put these on? And we'll try to do the same thing again with your eyes closed. There you go. Let's try that one more time, and see if you can do any better. So close your eyes.","496":"Yeah. So that you're able, with a bit more practice, you're able to figure it out. When it fell on the ground, how did you know to pick it up off the ground?","497":"So when a robot tries to do something, like pick up an object, not only do you need to program exactly like what the motors should do, the robot also needs to be able to see where the object is. Then this is what's called a perception action loop in robotics. So if the object moves, the robot can then adapt what it's doing and change what it's doing to successfully pick up the object. It's really important for robots to be able to leverage, not just like the past hour of experience, but also ideally many years of experience, in order to do the kinds of things that you did.","498":"Yeah. It's really unintuitive. In order to survive, we need to pick up objects and everything. Basically many, many, like billions of years of evolution actually created humans and the ability to manipulate objects like that. So, it actually turns out that things that are really basic for us are actually just really complex tasks in general.","499":"That's a great question. So in reinforcement learning, the robot tries the task, and then it gets some sort of reinforcement, some sort of feedback. It's similar to how you might train a dog.","500":"So you could give it feedback like that. So it won't necessarily know itself, especially on the first few tries, but it's trying to figure out what the task is even.","501":"It depends on how you program the robot. If you program the robot to follow exact motions and follow a very specific program, then it won't go off that program. It will always do those actions. But if something unexpected happens, that the program wasn't designed to handle, then the robot might go off court.","502":"I think that robotics is really, really hard. Having robots do even really basic stuff, like pick up objects, is really, really hard. So if they do take over the world, I think it'll be a very, very, very, very long time from now.","503":"Or you don't even need computers. Like I remember when I was a kid, I played electric guitar and I had all these guitar pedals with different effects and oh, what happens if you put the output back in the input and just run it through itself, you're gonna start hearing this kind of fractal sound, right? So today we've been telling people, fractals are things that are somehow self-similar, they have detail at all scales. Are there other ways you might introduce fractals to somebody or are there other things you might say, this is what a fractal is?","504":"I think about like the scale and variance of different physical equations, like navier-stokes is, you know, kind of scale and variant, you know, this Reynolds number that tells you how viscous things are, but you can have the same kind of fluid behavior at all different scales. And that's why you get turbulence at all different scales.","505":"I think that's also, what's so beautiful about fractals is that, you know, if you think about sort of the history of geometry as well, Felix Klein was looking at geometry by saying, well, geometry is all about in variance. I have some group of transformations and I look at objects that are sort of in variant with respect to these transformations. So if you just look at translations, okay, what kinds of shapes remain the same under translations? Will you get tiling? You get wallpaper. And if you start asking that same question, what if I allow scaling in my transformations then boom, you have fractal.","506":"Now you work on kind of the future of virtual reality and augmented reality and extended reality. But it's kind of interesting because I think if I think about exploring these infinite fractal landscapes in some way, they still feel a little bit lonely or they feel a little bit poor of the kind of richness that we have in the real world.","507":"People outside of computer graphics and engineering and science and so forth have also thought a lot about and used fractals as a language for talking about nature, for characterizing shapes and behaviors and so forth tissue or friction, or all sorts of really important phenomena. Do you think that computer graphics has kind of dropped the ball in terms of saying, you know, this is not something that's exciting anymore to work on procedural descriptions and we're, we're moving on from that?","508":"So one of the things I guess that touches on is this question about controllability or the ease of, with which everybody can create these worlds. Not just people, not just mathematicians, not just, you know, trained computer scientists. One thing when I think about Ken Musgraves working about this program, Bryce, this one I felt like I could really use, what do you think we still need to do in terms of putting these kinds of tools in, in people's hands, making it easier for people to use procedural machine learning, to build these kind of worlds?","509":"That's a great way to think about it. Infinity is something that never ends, where finite, the opposite of infinity, refers to a process or a quantity that we could actually count all the way through, at least in theory if given enough time. So if you had to guess, how many Skittles are in this jar?","510":"217. And if we wanted to figure out the exact number, how would we find out? We could put them all out and divide them into pieces of five and then we could use that. Yeah, absolutely. In fact, I did that before you got here, and it's 649 Skittles. Here's a much harder question. How many pieces of glitter do you think are in that jar?","511":"Yeah, absolutely not. Because this room holds only a finite amount of space. And in fact, infinitely many jars would not even fit in something called the observable universe, which is the portion of the universe that astronomers can see. Really how does that make you feel?","512":"You have very good intuition. So there are ways that mathematicians can build infinite collections of things. And if you repeat those processes, it's in fact possible to build even bigger and bigger sizes of infinity. So what have you learned today about infinity?","513":"okay so quantum mechanics is a branch of science just like any other branch of science it's a branch of physics it's the study of things that are either really really small really really well isolated and really really cold and this particular branch of science is something we're using to totally reimagine how computing works so we're building totally new kinds of computers based on the laws of quantum mechanics that's what a quantum computer is","514":"i don't know what it's worth but uh i can put it face up right in that heads i can put it face down right so at any given time point in time if i ask you is my penny heads or tails probably you could answer it right","515":"it's sort of it's sort of a combination of heads and tails right would you say so superposition is this idea that my penny is not just either heads or tails it's in this state which is a combination of heads and tails this quantum property is something that we can have in real real physical objects in the world so that's super position and the second thing that we'll talk about is called entanglement so now i'm going to give you a penny","516":"but in the quantum world when we entangle things they're really now connected it's much much harder to separate them again so using the same analogy we spin our pennies and eventually eventually they both stop right and when they stop it's either heads or tails right so in my case i got tails and you got heads you see how they're totally disconnected from each other right our pennies in the real world now if our pennies were entangled and we both spun them together right when we stopped them if you measured your penny to be ahead i would measure my penny to be ahead and if you measured your penny to be a tails i would measure my opinion to be a tails if we measured it at exactly the same time we would still find that they were both exactly correlated","517":"the way that we are able to actually see these quantum properties is by making our quantum chips really really cold so that's what this is all about actually this is called a dilution refrigerator and it's a refrigerator it doesn't look like a normal refrigerator right but it's something that we use actually there's usually a case around it to cool our quantum chips down cold enough that we can create superpositions and we can entangle qubits and the information isn't lost to the environment","518":"And at some level, there's different set of rules that seem to come into play 'cause you can have particles at very microscopic scales seem to do really strange things. But one of the quests of quantum sensing is to harvest some of these unique properties at the micro scale. We are really interested in quantum sensors because we think they can give us the ultimate limit of sensitivity. So they're really, really sensitive to small changes, but they're also gonna be really reliable. Every time I make that measurement, I'll always get the same results.","519":"And what the MRI scanner is doing is, it's measuring the signal from all the water molecules that are present and specifically the hydrogen atom. In our bodies, we have these hydrogen atoms that are essentially spinning around magnetic fields all the time and we just don't know them. So in some sense, you've already used a quantum sensor.","520":"We can do it on tissues right now or on the surface, but we can't actually do it inside the body. So right now, we're struggling to figure out which scenarios can we use this to get better information and when can we not do it."},"dialogue":{"0":"Explainer: Great.\nExplainee: I'm biased because I study one of the other sub-critical parts of the brain, the cerebellum.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Great.\nExplainer: Okay. The best way to think about this transition is really called, it's a flip flop switch, okay? So this term comes from engineering, and the idea is that in sleep, you basically have kind of this all of nothing experience. Certainly people kind of drift off to sleep, but then all of a sudden you're unconscious, right? So it seems like it's this flip flop between the arousal system and the sleep promoting system, and it's certainly regulated, and we'll get a little bit into that, but they're certainly kind of made up of two reciprocally inhibitory processes. Okay, so we have the ascending reticular activating system. It originates in the brain stem, and there's a dorsal and a ventral arm to this, and so the dorsal arm has neurons, cholinergic neurons, that go up to the thalamus and then it projections into the fore brain, and then there's the ventral arm, and this is comprised of a whole bunch of different types of neurons, so there are monominergic, so there's kind of dopaminergic neurons that come from the periaqueductal gray, serotonergic ones from the dorsal raphae nuclei, histaminergic neurons that come from the tuberomammillary nucleus of the hippothalamus, and then noradrenergic neurons from the locus coeruleus, and so all of those are kind of working in tandem to kind of drive wake within the brain. So if we just think about drugs that are available inducing wakefulness, we can certainly, kind of the dopaminergic ones jump out, right? So we have amphetamines that kind of drive those signaling, and then modafinil, which is a wake promoting drug for people that have kind of excessive day-time sleepiness that maintains alertness throughout the day.\n","1":"Explainer: So that's good, because that's why you're here, and so we're talking about sleep today, and really about kind of what is the brain machinery through which we go through consciousness to unconsciousness and that transition.\nExplainee: Great.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: In terms of the dopamine, if you're taking amphetamines, that's usually to promote, as you said, wakefulness, but does that actually improve the quality of your sleep? How reliable are those kinds of interventions?\nExplainer: For the role that they play with respect to the sleep-wake system is really kind of amping up the wake system, right? And so certainly that has like down stream consequences for the sleep system, because now the flip flop switch is kind of pushed in a much stronger direction, and we have to kind of rely on what regulates sleep to get it pushed back to sleep.\n","2":"Explainer: Okay. The best way to think about this transition is really called, it's a flip flop switch, okay? So this term comes from engineering, and the idea is that in sleep, you basically have kind of this all of nothing experience. Certainly people kind of drift off to sleep, but then all of a sudden you're unconscious, right? So it seems like it's this flip flop between the arousal system and the sleep promoting system, and it's certainly regulated, and we'll get a little bit into that, but they're certainly kind of made up of two reciprocally inhibitory processes. Okay, so we have the ascending reticular activating system. It originates in the brain stem, and there's a dorsal and a ventral arm to this, and so the dorsal arm has neurons, cholinergic neurons, that go up to the thalamus and then it projections into the fore brain, and then there's the ventral arm, and this is comprised of a whole bunch of different types of neurons, so there are monominergic, so there's kind of dopaminergic neurons that come from the periaqueductal gray, serotonergic ones from the dorsal raphae nuclei, histaminergic neurons that come from the tuberomammillary nucleus of the hippothalamus, and then noradrenergic neurons from the locus coeruleus, and so all of those are kind of working in tandem to kind of drive wake within the brain. So if we just think about drugs that are available inducing wakefulness, we can certainly, kind of the dopaminergic ones jump out, right? So we have amphetamines that kind of drive those signaling, and then modafinil, which is a wake promoting drug for people that have kind of excessive day-time sleepiness that maintains alertness throughout the day.\nExplainee: In terms of the dopamine, if you're taking amphetamines, that's usually to promote, as you said, wakefulness, but does that actually improve the quality of your sleep? How reliable are those kinds of interventions?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainer: And do we know much about why, or which stages of the sleep cycle are affected? You know, if you take amphetamines, is it then when you go to sleep, that you're not able to transition through each of the sleep periods, or is that less clear?\nExplainer: You know, so I think that's less clear. In some ways, you know, getting back to this idea of this wake-sleep system, we have this sleep system that is kind of the counterpoint to this wake arousal system, and so the primary nucleus region is the ventral lateral pre-optic nucleus, also called VLPO, and that has particular neuron outputs that release GABA and galanin, which work in an inhibitory way on kind of the wake promoting ones. And so, it's kind of this delicate balance of these two systems that are ongoing. In your cognitive neuro-science training, right, it sounds like it's pretty specific and focused in a particular part of the brain, the cerebellum, and one thing that I'm interested in is you bring a participant into the study, have you ensured that they got a good night's sleep? Have you asked them about their sleep?\n","3":"Explainee: In terms of the dopamine, if you're taking amphetamines, that's usually to promote, as you said, wakefulness, but does that actually improve the quality of your sleep?

So what did you learn about sleep today?\n","6":"Explainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: It comes from just your life experience. And that moves you in a certain direction. How it gets expressed, many times, is sudden. Complete surprise. (laughs)\nExplainer: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

And it says here, If you like Melanie Martinez, one of the other songs you might like is by Au\/Ra. Do you know who that is?\n","19":"Explainer: That's right. When we teach machines to learn from data, to build a model from that data or a representation of that, and then to make a prediction. One of the places we often find machine learning in the real world is in things like recommendation systems. So do you have an artist that you really like?\nExplainee: Yeah, Melanie Martinez.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: I do not.\nExplainer: So let's listen to a hint of this song.\n","20":"Explainer: And that's actually a really interesting thing to think about because that creepy vibe is something that you can perceive and I can perceive, but it's actually really hard to describe to a machine. What do you think might go into that?\nExplainee: Pitch of the music. If it's really low or if it's super high, it could know that. What can the machine understand?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Well, I think things like Facebook or Instagram, they probably use it to target ads.\nExplainer: Sometimes, the ads you see are really uncanny. And I think that's because they're based on so much data. They know where you live. They know where your device is. It's also important to realize that people in aggregate are actually pretty predictable. Like when we talk to each other, we like to talk about the novel things, like here, we're having this conversation. We don't do this every day. But we probably still eat breakfast. We're gonna eat lunch. We're gonna eat dinner. You probably are going to the same home you go to most of the time. And so, they're able to take that data that we already give them and make predictions based on that as to what ads they should show us.\n","21":"Explainer: It's a great question. The machine can understand whatever we tell it to understand. So there might be a person thinking about things, like the pitch or the pacing or the tone, or sometimes machines can figure out things about music or images or videos that we don't tell it to discover, but that it can learn from looking at a lot of different examples. Why do you think companies might use machine learning?\nExplainee: Well, I think things like Facebook or Instagram, they probably use it to target ads.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: So, you're saying I give them enough data as it is about what I might be talking about or thinking about that they can read my mind,\nExplainer: [Hilary laughs]\n","22":"Explainer: That's right.\nExplainee: So do you think that we've been able to teach machines enough so that they can do things that even we can't do? And on the opposite side of that, do you think there are things that we can do that a machine might never be able to do?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","23":"Explainer: [Janna] They're about the size of a city. So you're imagining something more than the mass of the Sun.\nExplainee: [Will] Yeah, or about the mass of the Sun, condensed to the size of a city. It's dense enough that one teaspoon-full would weigh about a billion tons here on Earth.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: We would immediately be crushed into the ground, I think our bodies would be shred into their subatomic particles.\nExplainer: So what's the connection between neutron stars and black holes?\n","24":"Explainer: So what's the connection between neutron stars and black holes?\nExplainee: So, as I understand it, a black hole is sort of like a neutron star's big brother. It's more intense, though. If you have so much matter when a star is collapsing that it can't hold itself up, it collapses to a black hole, and those are so dense that space-time breaks down in some way or another.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: So is there a sensible way to talk about what's inside a black hole, or is that, should you think of it as there is no space-time inside?\nExplainer: There isn't a sensible way to talk about it yet, and that probably means that's where Einstein's theory of gravity as a curved space-time is beginning to break down, and we need to take the extra step of going to some kind of quantum theory of gravity. And we don't have that yet. So even though the black hole isn't completely understood, we do know that they form astronomically, that in the universe things like neutron stars form and things like black holes form. The consequences are very much speaking to this curved space-time. So, for instance, if two black holes orbit each other, they're like mallets on a drum, and they actually cause space-time to ring, and it's very much part of gravitation. The ringing of space-time itself, we call gravitational waves. And this was something Einstein thought about right away in 1950-1960, he was thinking about that.\n","25":"Explainer: Black holes are so amazing that when the neutron star stops and there's something actually there. There's material there. If it's so heavy it becomes a black hole, so it keeps falling, once the event horizon of the black hole forms, which is the shadow, the curve that's so strong that not even light can escape, the material keeps falling. And like you said, maybe space-time breaks down right at the center there, but whatever happens, the star's gone, that black hole is empty. So in a weird way black holes are a place and not a thing.\nExplainee: So is there a sensible way to talk about what's inside a black hole, or is that, should you think of it as there is no space-time inside?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Those waves are very exciting for me too because neutron stars orbiting each other also give off gravitational waves and we might be able to get some data about neutron star material from that kind of signal.\nExplainer: [Janna] Yes, they ring space-time also like a drum, and you can record the sound of that ringing after a billion years, when it's traveled through the universe. But then the next thing that happens is those neutron stars collide, and because of this incredibly high energy state of matter, which you study, it becomes this firework of different explosions. It's really quite spectacular.\n","26":"Explainer: There isn't a sensible way to talk about it yet, and that probably means that's where Einstein's theory of gravity as a curved space-time is beginning to break down, and we need to take the extra step of going to some kind of quantum theory of gravity.

I've heard statistics like many Earth masses worth of gold were created, forged in the neutron star collision that caused that. We used to think that most elements in the universe were created in supernova, which is when stars explode, because there's so much violent activity at the center that you need that kind of energy to create new elements.\nExplainer: [Janna] The way you do in a bomb. It's basically nuclear fusion.\n","28":"Explainer: Usually if it's math and physics, you end up as a theoretical physicist, right?\nExplainee: Yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Hopefully, yeah.\nExplainer: So how would you explain to your friends who are not math and physics majors, like what is a dimension, yourself?\n","29":"Explainer: [Sean] Being four dimensional, right?\nExplainee: Mm-hmm.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Okay.\nExplainer: Let's bring one in. All right. The thing about relativity is that they really want you to think of spacetime as one four dimensional thing, right? It's kind of like space. It's not just three dimensions of space and one dimension of time.\n","30":"Explainer: Now, in some sense that's kind of trivial to you and me, because of course you have space, which is three dimensional, you have time which is one dimensional, so spacetime is four dimensional. But it didn't turn out, it didn't occur to anyone that that was a sensible way to talk until really relativity. This is the crucial thing, right? Is that what Einstein realized is that sure there's both time and space, but how we divide spacetime into time and space can be different for different people, and really there's a real sense in which four dimensional spacetime is kind of a generalization of three dimensional space. And I think to really explain this we're gonna need a blackboard.\nExplainee: Okay.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Why though?\nExplainer: Why? This is a very good question. So, let's just start with space, right? We know a little bit about space. So here's my simple minded way of drawing space two dimensions, because that's how many I can draw on the blackboard. Let's say X and Y. And what is special about space, there's many things, but one is that if I have a curve or a path between two points, there's a distance that you can calculate, right? And the distance between those two points doesn't depend on your coordinates. It doesn't depend on whether you're in radial coordinates or Cartesian coordinates, or whatever. I'm allowed to imagine a curve that does something like this between those two points, and if I were a person walking on that curve, I would have an odometer with me maybe, and I would know, you would know, even without having done that, this path is always gonna be longer than that path. There's a formula, Pythagoras' Theorem that tells you what the shortest distance path is. That's the point. The physical-ness of what is real is the distance along a certain curve. So spacetime is like that. That's why it is useful to think about spacetime.\n","31":"Explainer: Let's bring one in. All right. The thing about relativity is that they really want you to think of spacetime as one four dimensional thing, right? It's kind of like space. It's not just three dimensions of space and one dimension of time.\nExplainee: Why though?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Okay.\nExplainer: So let me draw spacetime. Here's how we usually draw it. I'll just say X, but all of space is condensed in this one direction, and this is time, okay? So if you're a little person and you started some event, so you start, you're located somewhere in space, somewhere in the three coordinates of space, and whether you like it or not, you're moving through spacetime just by getting older.\n","32":"Explainer: So let me draw spacetime. Here's how we usually draw it. I'll just say X, but all of space is condensed in this one direction, and this is time, okay? So if you're a little person and you started some event, so you start, you're located somewhere in space, somewhere in the three coordinates of space, and whether you like it or not, you're moving through spacetime just by getting older.\nExplainee: Yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Yeah.\nExplainer: And it's almost exactly like the space story. The space story says there's a distance, distance is different along different curves. Einstein says there's something that measures the length of these curves, and we call it the proper time. It is literally the time that you would read on your wristwatch.\n","33":"Explainer: When people ask me can you travel through time? I say yes, yesterday I traveled 24 hours into the future and here I am, a day later. So that's just this. Okay, you're moving through time, like it or not. So what Einstein says is look, I can travel through spacetime in different ways, like I could hop in a rocket ship and fly out and then fly back, and then I could meet you there. So this is a different trajectory through spacetime, right?\nExplainee: Yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: So it's kind of like our fundamental time? Or our base time?\nExplainer: Well kind of. What Einstein wants to get across is there's no such thing as fundamental, like there's the universe's time, this big letter T that might tell you how old the universe is, but then every individual has a clock with them, and they measure their own time depending on how they're moving through the universe.\n","34":"Explainer: Well kind of. What Einstein wants to get across is there's no such thing as fundamental, like there's the universe's time, this big letter T that might tell you how old the universe is, but then every individual has a clock with them, and they measure their own time depending on how they're moving through the universe.\nExplainee: I see.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Why is that, that this one's shorter then?\nExplainer: There is what we call a metric on spacetime, and when we talk about Euclidean space versus a curved space, versus a sphere or something, that's a different metric. And spacetime has its own metric which says the following thing, that the path between two events in spacetime that is a straight line, will always be the longest time.\n","35":"Explainer: And the crucial difference is that time is not the same for this person who stayed behind and sat in their chair, and this person who zoomed out there.\nExplainee: Why is that, that this one's shorter then?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: I see. Oh, okay.\nExplainer: [Sean] That's the difference.\n","36":"Explainer: [Sean] That's the difference.\nExplainee: All right.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Would it be if I had like a spring or not a spring, but like a sheet, and I dropped a book in the sheet, curves down?\nExplainer: Yeah, exactly. If you had a sheet that was originally flat, and you set a marble on it, it would go in a straight line, but then if you put something on it so it warps it, that marble is now gonna be deflected.\n","37":"Explainer: So when Einstein had this idea, oh gravity could be related to the curvature of spacetime, he did some equations, so he got it, that's a long story, we'll put that aside. What he figured out was that rather than gravity living on top of spacetime, it's a manifestation of the curvature of spacetime so when you have like the earth, the sun, the moon, they cause a gravitational field, they're actually warping the spacetime around them. They're giving it a different geometry.\nExplainee: Would it be if I had like a spring or not a spring, but like a sheet, and I dropped a book in the sheet, curves down?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: I see.\nExplainer: Einstein says that gravity is just like that.\n","38":"Explainer: But there are no straight lines, because spacetime itself is curved. So do you think if you had to explain relativity what would you say?\nExplainee: I think I'd go with kind of the train paradox. Let's say I'm stationary, and someone's moving past me on the train, they think they're stationary on the train. Like they think that they're not accelerating, but if they start walking through the train cars, then they are accelerating in their frame, but then from my outside frame where I'm completely removed, I see they are accelerating. So I guess that relativity is all about perspective, I guess in a way.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: That was pretty good.\nExplainer: [Sean] Yeah. I learned a lot. [Sean] It's a lot of fun stuff to talk about.\n","39":"Explainer: Yeah, I like that, yeah.\nExplainee: Yeah, yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Yeah.\nExplainer: So I might go (hums Amazing Grace)\n","40":"Explainer: And so when you think about extra dimensions, you put them together with brains and different fields wrapping around the extra dimensions and so forth, right?\nExplainee: Yes.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Yes, well ultimately we'd like to understand the observable universe. If string theory turns out to be the thing that the universe cares about, we'd like to know, with all of these possibilities that are in string theory, how do we get the one that looks like the world we live in?\nExplainer: The thing I want to talk about is this paper I wrote with Matt Johnson and Lisa Randall where we realize there's another way to compactify extra dimensions spontaneously, dynamically. If you imagine starting with this big piece of paper you couldn't wrap up everything, but within some region of space you could make a tube.\n","41":"Explainer: You know, a lot of people, a lot of string theorists, they care a lot about all the different ways in which we could hide the extra dimensions. As someone who cares about cosmology, I wanna start asking why are the extra dimensions small at all? How did that happen? Is this something you think about yourself?\nExplainee: Yes, well ultimately we'd like to understand the observable universe. If string theory turns out to be the thing that the universe cares about, we'd like to know, with all of these possibilities that are in string theory, how do we get the one that looks like the world we live in?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Okay.\nExplainer: Right? And down there in the tube it looks like your long thing that is compactified in one direction and infinitely extending in the other direction, so there's one less macroscopic dimension of space.\n","42":"Explainer: [Sean] You think that sounds plausible to you?\nExplainee: It sounds like fun. What I would immediately ask is where do the large dimensions come from in the first place? Is that something you address, or you just assume that all the dimension are large as a starting point?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: But where do they come from?\nExplainer: It was always there.\n","43":"Explainer: Why don't you explain to us what a black brane is?\nExplainee: Well in some ways, it's very much like a black hole in that you have far away from it you have these large just flat dimensions. As you move in, there's something in the interior. It has, itself, higher dimensions, and so because physicists love to joke they thought, well it's like a membrane but it can have many different dimensions. Let's use P to stand in for those number of dimensions, and so they called them P-branes.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Yeah. Yeah. So, a lot of the branes that are relevant for studying things to do with anti-de Sitter spacetimes in various dimensions actually start out as these non-singular type brains, and then you find in the core, there's actually an anti-de Sitter spacetime.\nExplainer: Right. Imagine that rather than going down to a point, it just asymptotes to some fixed radius that continues infinitely far down there. But then you can ask, okay what about the rest of the universe? You have some sphere, some two dimensions compactified, and the balance between the cosmological constant and the electromagnetic field keeps it at a fixed distance.\n","44":"Explainer: Yeah, I've been trying to explain this to lower levels, and they always look at me like, are you pulling my leg here a little bit? Or is this the real thing that they use? Yes, it is the real thing they use. We study these branes in de Sitter space, and so what we found is that there are black brane solutions which instead of having a singularity inside are non-singular, and stable, and compactified. Is this a familiar thing? I know things like this have been discussed, right?\nExplainee: Yeah. Yeah. So, a lot of the branes that are relevant for studying things to do with anti-de Sitter spacetimes in various dimensions actually start out as these non-singular type brains, and then you find in the core, there's actually an anti-de Sitter spacetime.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Right. Good, good.\nExplainer: But then the other dimensions, the transverse dimensions, don't need to be anti-de Sitter. They can have either positive, zero, or negative cosmological constant. So you can basically get any sort of cosmological solution times a compactified sphere.\n","45":"Explainer: Right.

Good, good.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Is it that these have the lowest action of all the things that could possibly, all the possible solutions?\nExplainer: I guess. I mean, maybe you'd think otherwise. Again or maybe you could change my mind, I think that as long as it can happen it will happen some of the time, right?\n","46":"Explainer: But then the other dimensions, the transverse dimensions, don't need to be anti-de Sitter.

[laughing] It's a loud, it's of a loud it's gonna happen.\nExplainee: I still laugh from Keanu Reeves I'm afraid. [laughing]\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Well, it's interesting because there's a lot of activity going on inspired by things we learned from working in anti-de Sitter space where the cosmological constant has the wrong sign. So you will find that there are a number of papers as many of which you've probably read, probably you've read more of them than I have, which try then to take the different kinds of brains, these extended solutions, and they're many different kinds doing different things, we understand well enough now that we can put them together in various ways. They intersect, they dissolve inside each other, they wrap each other.\nExplainer: They overlap, they wrap around.\n","48":"Explainer: I know not everyone buys that, right?\nExplainee: Not everyone buys it. There's a big discussion in the literature right now.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: I think it's gonna get way more interesting than we're currently able to grapple with right now, and I think there are hints of it. There could be a description of the physics that might be our early universe that is like that molecular description. And then from that emerges flat spacetimes maybe four, maybe some mechanism tells you it's four and not something else. I think that's where we're going.\nExplainer: If the viewers wanted to know more about how spacetime can emerge from quantum mechanics, they could read the graphic novel you just wrote.\n","49":"Explainer: If the viewers wanted to know more about how spacetime can emerge from quantum mechanics, they could read the graphic novel you just wrote.\nExplainee: Right, yes. I wrote and drew a graphic novel called The Dialogues: Conversations About the Nature of Universe.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Excellent.\n","50":"Explainer: It's what keeps us on the earth.\nExplainee: What?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Nice.\nExplainer: The main thing about black hole to remember is that it's just, like I said, how the earth holds you down, the black hole pulls you in, as well. Now, try and take the ball from me, black hole--\n","51":"Explainer: The reason we're not just flying off the earth is because earth has gravity, so if we throw something up, it comes back down, so that's why when we're walking on the earth, we don't fly off the earth because the earth has gravity, and it keeps us down.\nExplainee: Nice.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Why do you hold it so tight?\nExplainer: I'm holding it tight to show you then when you're trying to pull it, a black hole will really hold onto it with its gravity.\n","52":"Explainer: Try look over there and concentrate on his face over there. Can you see me waving my hand without turning your eyes?\nExplainee: No.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Uh, three?\nExplainer: You can just barely tell. And you can see that even, like if you hold out your hand and you focus on your hand, then your foot would be blurry because there's that difference there. And you can change between that, like you can then focus on your foot and your hand gets blurry. Because your eyes can see different amounts of detail in different places. So we're hoping in the future, that hardware can be like that. Where we can make a display that puts lots of detail right where you're looking. And every time you look someplace else, it moves the detail over to there. So we don't need to render a hundred times as much as we've got right now. Figuring out where you're looking is a pretty hard problem. What we try to go about this, is by taking a camera and looking at people's eyes and then try to figure out is the eye looking over here or up here. We're working hard on stuff like this right now so we hopefully can have a virtual reality that's as detailed and realistic feeling as the reality that we've actually got around us. But its going to be a long time before we get to where we can really fool people.\n","53":"Explainer: Alright, so, at some point, you can probably see it right now? So without moving your eyes, this is kind of hard, tell me how many fingers I'm holding up?\nExplainee: Uh, three?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","54":"Explainer: Do you know a lot about lasers? Or just about the laser that you use.\nExplainee: Not a lot, just a little bit.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: I feel like the continuous laser delivers power at a continuous rate, whereas you want all that power to be delivered in a really, really short time with your amplification.\nExplainer: And so we get the power with a lot less energy 'cause its power is energy per unit time. So we aren't depositing much energy in comparison. Can I just ask, 'cause you are using the thermal process of it heating up, but have you ever had the opportunity to use laser tweezers?\n","55":"Explainer: Okay. So this is about high intensity lasers. Not only how do you make them, but what was really stopping them being made in both cases is non linear optics. We wanna do something that requires a huge photon density application, and so that's how come we came up with chirped pulse amplification, so that we could stretch the pulse, safely amplify it, then compress it at the end, and then we're ready to do whatever we want at the end. So what do you think the main difference is between the continuous wave laser that you have that runs at 10 watts and a chirped pulse amplifier?\nExplainee: I feel like the continuous laser delivers power at a continuous rate, whereas you want all that power to be delivered in a really, really short time with your amplification.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: I have, yeah. We use optical tweezers to trap particles in solution.\nExplainer: And twirl the motors or not twirl the motors?\n","56":"Explainer: You haven't? Okay.\nExplainee: So I was always curious, how much further, like what higher power can we go now?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: We could probably use this to drive chemical reactions at a very, very specific spot. Like if we want to target just a single cell in the body.\nExplainer: Yes. And maybe what, do pump-probe spectroscopy and watch the cell? Or to ionize it?\n","57":"Explainer: Yes. And maybe what, do pump-probe spectroscopy and watch the cell? Or to ionize it?\nExplainee: I mean I was thinking more on the lines of if we want to, let's say destroy one cell, like a tumor cell or something like that. So that the neighboring areas are not affected but just the cell burns.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: I think short pulses might help in my experiment in the sense that if I drive my swimmers with a continuous wave as opposed to a pulsed wave, maybe a continuous wave would heat up the sample too much and a pulse laser would deliver power exactly where I need it so that I could run my experiment longer.\nExplainer: That's true. Thank you very much.\n","58":"Explainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: That's one of the things we're trying to figure out, from an artist and storytelling perspective, what are the things that will make this meaningfully different from what we're used to, like a television on our wall. And we've been finding a lot of things, aspects of virtual reality that very much do that in my opinion. Things that allow you to feel presence, first and foremost, where you get lost, and you have to remind yourself, this isn't actually happening. And things that ultimately allow you to embody other characters. Things where you can actually change your own self-perception and play with neuro-plasticity and teach yourself things that are bizarre and unique.\nExplainer: As an engineer of course, I love quantifiable things. I like saying here's my 18 millisecond motion to photon, here's my angular resolution that I'm improving. I'm doing the color-space right. But you can look not too far back where you say we have blu-ray DVDs at this amazing resolution, but more people want to watch Youtube videos at really bad early internet video speeds. Where there are things that if you deliver a value to people then these objective quantities may not be the most important thing. And while we're certainly pushing as hard as we can on lots of these things that make the experience better in potentially every way or maybe just for videos or for different things. I don't think that its necessary. I've commented that I think usually my favorite titles on mobile that are fully synthetic are ones that don't even try, they just go and do light-mapped, black-shaded. And I think its a lovely aesthetic. I think that you don't wind up fighting all of the aliasing. While you get some other titles that, oh we're gonna be high-tech with our specular bump maps with roughness. And you've got aliasing everywhere, and you can't hold frame rate and its all problematic. While some of these that are clearly very synthetic worlds where its nothing but these cartoony flat-shaded things with lighting, but they look and they feel good. And you can buy that you're in that place. And you want to know what's around that monolith over there.\n","59":"Explainer: Mostly today, I've been talking a lot about what can we do, what's possible. We think might be possible in the next couple of years. But really at the professional level its more the question of wisdom of what should we be doing.\nExplainee: That's one of the things we're trying to figure out, from an artist and storytelling perspective, what are the things that will make this meaningfully different from what we're used to, like a television on our wall.

We were let's embrace low-poly aesthetic and just simple vertex shading. And we ended up realizing, you can embody these various creatures and transform yourself. And when you do that with co-presence of another creature, another human, it makes for a totally magical journey. You don't even think for a second, you actually dismiss the whole idea of photo-realism and embrace that reality for what it is. I think it actually helps put you at ease a little bit.\nExplainer: The end goal of reality, of course in computer graphics people chase photo-realistic form for a long time. And basically, we've achieved it. Photo-realism, if you're willing to throw enough discreet path traced rays at things, you can generate photo-realistic views. And we understand the light really well. Of course it still takes a half hour per frame like it always has, or more, to render the different things. So its an understood problem and given infinite computing power we could be doing that in virtual reality. However, a point that I've made to people in recent years is that, we are running out of More's Law. Maybe we'll see some wonderful breakthrough in quantum structures or whatever--\n","60":"Explainer: As an engineer of course, I love quantifiable things.

We will run into atomic limits on our fabrication. So given that, I'm trying to tell people that, start buying back into optimization, start buying back into thinking a bit more creatively. Because you can't just wait, its not going to get to that point where it really is fixed to those highest degrees just by waiting for computing to be advanced.

I do think we're making progress and I wouldn't bet on that being solved in 10 years, but maybe 20 years. Because it is going to take a lot of AI. Its going to take a lot of machine-learning, where its not going to be a matter of us dissecting all the micro-expressions that people do. Its gonna be lets take every youtube video ever made and run it through some enormous learner that's going to figure out how to make people realistic.\nExplainee: Absolutely, there are these crucial thresholds where you pass a technological hurdle and all of a sudden that unlocks a whole world of creative potential.

And a lot of it is just picking those, putting them together in a meaningful way and then crafting something that's really bigger and intentional. But I've now been joining with real people in virtual reality. I think we also have different levels of connection. Like the audio side is leaps and bounds above in terms of the nuance and personality and humanity. When I hear people laughing and joking and really enjoying something. Soon we'll get into that.

They were discussing a project in which multiple radio telescopes of some sort, like, are, like, pinpointed all across, from Greenland to South America, and, like, and they're trying to get an image of the black hole in the center of our galaxy because, as opposed to just recording its impact on the surrounding stars and planets.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: What sort of technology and, like, I guess tools have you been using in your studies, or, like, just in general, in the study of black holes?\nExplainer: For my studies, I actually, when I started at UCLA in graduate school, I worked with a professor named Matt Malkin who was, gotten a lot of data observations from the Hubble Space Telescope, so that was one of my very first projects to work on, so any, space-based observatories have been a really big advantage, and then I've moved on now to the Spitzer Space Telescope. In addition to that, then there's other people who've used a lot of X-ray telescopes, NuSTAR, Chandra have used data from that. It's been a combination of both ground-based observatories, as well as space-based ones, and going everywhere from X-ray observations, not done by me, but certainly ultraviolet, and then optical, and infrared, particularly, those are the ones that I've been most involved with.\n","70":"Explainer: So we've been, we've had, now, effectively two different ways of getting more direct measurements, one is the LIGO, which is the Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory, which is where, getting the ripples in space time, coming off of the merging of black holes. The other one that you're mentioning is actually called the Event Horizon Telescope, where they're using radio waves to actually image the event horizon, that region where light cannot escape from the black hole at the center of our galaxy, which I know they're working on it right now. It's an amazing thing, but that'll be the most direct imaging of a black hole. LIGO is a direct detection of the consequence of the merging of black holes. The critical part has been, like, for the super massive black hole at the center of our galaxy, we've seen the stars orbiting it, and we've measured the mass, so that way, so if you look at a spinning black hole, it actually fundamentally alters the emission that's coming off the stuff that's falling into it. These are discovered as what are called X-ray binaries, that is, you know, there's an X-ray member of the binary that is emitting in the X-rays, and it's really not very bright in the optical (mumbles) at all, so there's always, people are looking at these X-ray binaries.\nExplainee: What sort of technology and, like, I guess tools have you been using in your studies, or, like, just in general, in the study of black holes?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","71":"Explainer: Do you know what gravity is?\nExplainee: It's something that, so, right now, we would be floating if there was no gravity, but since there's gravity we're sitting right down on these chairs.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Mm-hmm, just like the ocean tides.\nExplainer: [Janna] Exactly, the Moon is such a big body compared to anything else very nearby that it has the larger effect, pulling the water of the Earth.

After a while here on Earth though he'll readjust, he'll go back to the same size. Have you ever heard of how gravity was discovered?\n","76":"Explainer: Isaac Newton would ponder, how does the Earth cause things to fall? There's a famous story that Isaac Newton was sitting under a tree and the apple fell from the tree and hit him on the head and he had an epiphany and understood this law, this mathematical law for how that works. I don't actually think that's a true story, though.\nExplainee: Yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: So, if we both dropped down from a plane, we would both land at the same time, but you would land heavier?\nExplainer: Yep, so like a penny from the Empire State Building will fall at the same rate as a bowling ball.\n","77":"Explainer: And a heavy object.\nExplainee: Oh my God.

You can do part of this level, and you can do the other part, clearly. Got some expertise under your belt, and that's awesome, because I think that everyone should know more about sleep. And so the way that we think about what drives sleep are two independent but related processes and so they have kind of lame names. Process S and process C, and what you've kind of described is process C, and that's the master clock, right? And it helps regulate kind of the rhythms like all over your body, all your cells, and all those kind of things. It drives the release of melatonin from the pineal gland, and melatonin comes online under darkness, so when the sun goes down, your brain knows okay it's time to start getting ready for sleep, and so you start releasing melatonin, which really kind of sets the table for sleeping.\n","79":"Explainer: It turns out, for people that are between the ages of 18 and 65, the agreed upon amount of sleep that people should get is between seven and nine hours, and it's really at least seven hours per night, to maintain optimal health as an adult. So at least seven hours. When we look at across all of the data that is available on like sleep and health, and sleep and psychiatric illness and those types of things, the largest risk is when people get five hours or less. What do you think is responsible for driving how much sleep you need, and things like that?\nExplainee: I mean, I know sleep is kind of regulated by the thalamus and the suprachiasmatic nucleus sending signals to the pineal gland to which kind of secretes melatonin, which tells us when it's time to go to sleep.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: I'm from Hoi, so we have very long days. We have early sunrises, late sunsets. Does that signify less sleep, because we have a shorter amount of time for melatonin to be released?\nExplainer: Yeah, no, that's a really great question, and the same is true in places where the sun never goes down during the summer, and when it's dark all the time during the winter, and it turns out light isn't the only thing that kind of gates your circadian rhythm. But I think the thing that's really important, again there are two processes, that the other one is the S process, and that one's just kind of a really important driver of sleep. One name we call it is the homeostatic sleep drive. Kind of the longer you're awake, the sleepier you get. You stay up, you get sleepy. Time goes by, you get sleepier. Time goes by, you get sleepier. But it's actually kind of a fundamental principle for how sleep is regulated, and it's really kind of akin to like a balloon, okay? So you wake up in the morning and your balloon is flat. You've kind of like drained out all of the sleepiness. But then as you kind of go throughout the day, it kind of fills up, so you use your energy, it gets filled up. And then it gets filled up more as you get towards nighttime, right? And then when it's at this optimal amount is when you kind of go to sleep and let out all of the sleepiness again. And this is really what underlies why napping can also be bad for you. So napping's not inherently bad, but if you actually let out some of this air during the day, it's going to take longer for the balloon to get bigger, right, I see to where you feel sleepy, right?\n","80":"Explainer: What is a laser made out of? Well really it's sort of the same thing as a light bulb. Right?\nExplainee: So it's a beam?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Because it needs to be centered so it can more easily just go in.\nExplainer: That's right. All the force that we apply here, goes all the way through but then it can only basically come out when it contacts the wood in that one tiny spot. And so sometimes it's the force that you push something with but sometimes it is that force per unit area. But sometimes it's not even the force per unit area 'cos, you know, push down as hard as you can on that and see if we can get it pushed in. See it doesn't really work does it?\n","81":"Explainer: So yeah it's a light bulb and there's a couple of mirrors. Now the light bulb has to be a little bit special. It has to be a type of material that can store the energy in an excited state right? It has to stay up there really energetic and sit there for a while so that when the light comes along, it takes that energy and becomes stronger light and then the mirror sends it back and it does it again and again and again and between these two mirrors, it makes the light come out in a nice beam. In a laser, it comes out as a single color. They all come out with their waves at the same time. Every wave peaks at the same time which then makes it a giant wave and it's this giant wave that has a tremendous amount of power. So it can do something like cutting steel. But when you cut steel, or if you were cutting this floor, it's gray, it actually will absorb the light. That's why the light, you don't see it because the light isn't bouncing back or through it. So I like to use demos to explain how my laser works. So I've brought basically a hammer and a nail. I'm sure you've probably hammered a nail before into a piece of wood but the question is, if you asked yourself why it is we hit the big end and it's the tiny end that we put on the piece of wood. We could never pick up a hammer and hit the sharp end and hope this would go in to the piece of wood.\nExplainee: Because it needs to be centered so it can more easily just go in.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: So the laser needs ultimately many things. It needs to be centered, it needs time to actually penetrate and then it needs--\nExplainer: Well it depends. So if you're cutting steel, you need to have the nail. You need to have it concentrated all of the light, not going in all directions but you need it into as small a point as possible. And for that we use a lens. For a lens, the light's coming down as a column, you put in a lens, it all focuses it down in the same way as the nail and then it starts cutting that steel. Okay so that force per unit area--\n","82":"Explainer: That's right.

It needs to be centered, it needs time to actually penetrate and then it needs--\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: So it's kind of like a magnifying glass? Like it magnifies the light down to a point?\nExplainer: Exactly. You know sometimes you want to have all of your energy not just in a small area but in the small volume and so one of the other dimensions is time or length. But with light, time and length are the same thing because light always travels at the speed of light.\n","83":"Explainer: Well it depends. So if you're cutting steel, you need to have the nail.

It's 300,000 kilometers long. So now, if you talk about light being concentrated, that doesn't seem very concentrated. The type of lasers I play with in my lab will be no thicker than this piece of paper. So we take that energy that might be in three hundred thousand kilometers and we squeeze it all the way down into just this piece of paper and actually the beams are more the size of this piece of paper and so, in my lab, pieces of paper like this would be flying through the sky but we can't see them. 'Cos they don't come in our eyes, they fly by us and they're infra red.\n","84":"Explainer: Exactly.

And so now, if we have light like that that we wanna machine with. I bring this funnel and so, if we had a lens here and the light was coming down--\n","85":"Explainer: But if you send a one second long light pulse out into the skies there, the beginning of the pulse is actually two thirds of the way to the moon.

So here would be my light coming from my laser and it would just be coming down, down, down, down, down. Hit a lens and it would have to focus down. But now, all the light started out with this big of a spread so concentrated this much. Eventually it would be here, more concentrated. But by the end, right at the focal spot, that's when I get all of my light, all of the energy has been squeezed down into fitting inside this piece of paper and that's why I say that I built a laser hammer. Because when this hits a piece of glass, it just smacks hose electrons right off the atoms and there's nothing else for them to do, they have to fly away. So can you tell me what you learned and maybe about the focusing of the light?\n","86":"Explainer: Exactly. And so now, if we have light like that that we wanna machine with. I bring this funnel and so, if we had a lens here and the light was coming down--\nExplainee: It funnels into--\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Well what I learned, lasers they aren't like particles. They're more like a super concentrated beam of light that can be any color. They get really concentrated and that's what makes them lasers and that's why they cut things and break things because they just move the electrons out of the way.\nExplainer: So do you think that lasers are fun enough to talk with your friends about or?\n","87":"Explainer: You know, everybody's been just coming at it from different wavelengths at the optical infrared, and, but definitely the X-rays has been one of those things where it's like, oh, finally.\nExplainee: And we've come a long way by seeing a wider range of the spectrum, we can elucidate more about the circumnuclear geometry, and there's just been so much progress made with all these new spectral models that we use to fit AGN spectra, and the different types of classes of AGN, like type one and type two are believed to be just a viewing angle effect of seeing this torus at different angles.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Yeah, and I think, you know, pushing towards the future, that, like, this whole multi-messenger era, and like, you know, utilizing all the different wavelength telescopes that we can is really the way to go. We cannot just build up a picture purely from X-rays alone, or purely from infrared, and, you know, I think there should be increased effort to try and have more coordinated observations with the different telescopes, like NuSTAR--\nExplainer: Oh, that makes sense, but it's always so difficult to get that.\n","88":"Explainer: And sleep science. Do you sleep?\nExplainee: I do, I try. [laughs]\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Resting, relaxing, really shutting down your brain, taking some time off of a busy schedule and work day.\nExplainer: But being off is not just being off. There's lots of things that are happening. We're gonna kind of talk about those different pieces of sleep.\n","89":"Explainer: You try, we all gotta try. You've probably heard about sleep as this kind of, you know, it's a biological process that happens in your brain. It's really important for your body, but it's a lot more complex than that. Sleep is made up of different parts. You know, when you think about sleep, what do you think about?\nExplainee: Resting, relaxing, really shutting down your brain, taking some time off of a busy schedule and work day.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Okay.\nExplainer: So our sleep is made up of different types, okay? The first one is called non-rapid eye movement sleep, or non-REM, okay? Or NREM. And then the other one, which might not be a surprise, is called REM. Rapid eye movement sleep. And those are the two main types of sleep that happen. The way that we measure that as a sleep scientist is that we'll actually bring people into the lab where they can do this at home, where we put electrodes on their scalp while they're sleeping, and that allows us to measure the brain activity that's going on during the night.\n","90":"Explainer: But being off is not just being off. There's lots of things that are happening. We're gonna kind of talk about those different pieces of sleep.\nExplainee: Okay.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Okay. Are you like able to tell how much sleep someone's getting or what their sleep schedule is by REM?\nExplainer: When we measure all of that, we're able to see how much time someone's asleep, and how many times they wake up and stuff during the night. You know, we're also really interested in kind of, the amount of non-REM sleep someone gets and the amount of REM sleep that someone gets, because each part of those types of sleep do different things for the body. And so it's important to get both of those. And so within non-REM sleep, there are three stages ranging from N-1 to N-2 to N-3. So not particularly clever in our naming, but that's how we know what stages they are. And what they do is it moves from lightest to deepest sleep, okay? N-1, it's more kind of light, wakefulness sleep, kind of in and out of sleeping. Then you go into N-2, which is where we spend 45 to 55 percent of our sleep. And it's more this kind of light sleep, but then we get into kind of the really restorative sleep, and that's N-3. And in N-3, when we look at someone's EEG wave, we see these big slow waves, and it's called slow wave sleep. And so we spend about 20% of our sleep in slow wave sleep, though it can vary on a day to day.\n","91":"Explainer: So our sleep is made up of different types, okay?

Are you like able to tell how much sleep someone's getting or what their sleep schedule is by REM?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Oh wow.\nExplainer: Okay? When do you think you experience the most REM?\n","92":"Explainer: Okay? When do you think you experience the most REM?\nExplainee: Well I've heard that you don't really go into like a deeper sleep, so I'm guessing like N-3, or really any of the N's at all, really, if you are on technology right before you sleep. And also if there's too much light, or if you're listening to music while you're asleep or anything like that, you're not experiencing deep sleep, right?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Oh.\nExplainer: Okay? So we wake up a lot during the night, and we just don't remember it. And you'll go back down into deep sleep, and then up again into REM, you know, in kinda these cycles.\n","93":"Explainer: You know, some of that is totally accurate, that like when your brain's more engaged by being on your phone or doing things that you really enjoy or things that stress you out or any of those types of things, it's harder to get to sleep and to kind of fall into that deeper levels of sleep. Most of the REM sleep, this dreaming sleep, happens in the second half of the night.\nExplainee: Oh.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Oh wow.\nExplainer: Do you ever take naps?\n","94":"Explainer: One to six hours? That's a long nap.\nExplainee: It is a long nap.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: So N-1 being like light sleep, still a lot of brain activity going on. I can imagine that happens right after you fall asleep. Asleep. And then N-2 being light, moderate activity in your brain, still sleep, but still kind of consciously aware, and N-3 being the deepest form of sleep.\nExplainer: I want to know if you agree, sleep is the coolest thing you've ever heard of.\n","95":"Explainer: So have you taken a quantum mechanics course?\nExplainee: I have. I took that last year.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Yes.\nExplainer: So these are typically semiconductors. They can be cadmium selenide cadmium sulfide, zinc selenide and they're small clusters of atoms. They can be from 2 to 10 nanometers. What's interesting about these materials?\n","96":"Explainer: So these are typically semiconductors. They can be cadmium selenide cadmium sulfide, zinc selenide and they're small clusters of atoms.

So all the way from like 0D to 3D. If I remember correctly, my professor labeled it as 0D?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: What are the applications of these quantum dots?\nExplainer: There are people that are exploring using these materials for diode lasers. There are companies that are building displays from these materials. And there're even people thinking about if I take these quantum dots, and I change the chemistry on the outside so they stick to specific types of cells or tissue, that I could really do some interesting imaging and therapeutic work to track disease, even maybe to treat disease, if you can very precisely control the chemistry.\n","97":"Explainer: There are people that are exploring using these materials for diode lasers.

So how do you go about building and controlling these nanotubes in terms of their diameter?\nExplainer: You're speaking my language. This is what I spent many years of my life working on. You don't physically roll up graphene. You grow nanotubes by basically taking nanocrystals and you deposit them on a surface. And then you do a CVD process, chemical vapor deposition. So you basically flow in a carbon source, the carbon dissolves in a nanocrystal and then once nanocrystal is saturated, the nanotubes precipitate out of them in tubes. Then you have to develop ways to go into this pile of nanotubes and pull out exactly the ones that you want. So I have to find ways to program them to go exactly in the places that I want. I modify the surface of the nanotube with specific molecules that recognize one type of surface over another. And then I just pattern the surface and the tubes just land exactly where we want them to. And it's still very much in the research stage. The ultimate goal is to build functional high-speed electronics using these new materials.\n","99":"Explainer: Carbon nanotube, right. So if you roll up graphene, depending on how you roll it and the angle, you roll it with, it has different properties. So if I roll it one way, it'll act like a metal. If I roll it a different way, it'll act like a semiconductor. The one that gets everyone most excited is that the electrons and holes move very fast through graphene. And so there's a lot of interest in using these for certain types of high-speed electronics. The other interesting application is because it's one atom thin, it's very sensitive to changes in the environment. And so there's a lot of interest in using them as diagnostics. It's on us researchers to find ways to A, control that process and then B, to actually build some sort of interesting technology from them.\nExplainee: So you've been talking about the different ways you can say, roll these nanotubes. So how do you go about building and controlling these nanotubes in terms of their diameter?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: In my nanomaterials class, actually just a couple of days ago, we were talking about different applications of nanotechnology and things we know. And we touched on the topic that right now, silicon is down to the smallest level that it can get. And so we have scientists out there researching other materials, to replace silicon.\nExplainer: Yeah. 100%. That's right. And that's the motivation for looking at these emerging materials. But I would never bet against the innovation and the creativity in this nano electronic space. Tens of thousands of scientists, every time they hit a barrier, at least historically, as a guide, they have found a way to overcome it. It's a real marvel in ingenuity.\n","100":"Explainer: Do you know what machine learning means? Have you heard that before?\nExplainee: No.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Sure.\nExplainer: [Hilary] So is this a dog or a cat?\n","101":"Explainer: And what makes a dog, a dog and a cat, a cat?\nExplainee: Well, dogs are very playful, I think, more than cats. Cats lick themselves more than dogs, I think.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Yeah. Yeah.\nExplainer: What about this one?\n","102":"Explainer: What about this one?\nExplainee: A dog. A cat. I think, a cat? Because it's more skinny. And also, its legs are like really tall and its ears are a little pointy.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: [Brynn] None.\nExplainer: [Hilary] None. What is it?\n","103":"Explainer: And how did you know that it's not a cat or a dog?\nExplainee: Because cats and dogs... Because they walk on their paws and their ears are like right here, not right here, and they don't wear watches.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Yeah, I have. After every unit, we have a review and then we have a test.\nExplainer: Are those like the practice problems you do before the test?\n","104":"Explainer: Which means that in the test, you're not seeing any problems that you don't know how to solve. As long as you did all your practice, right?\nExplainee: Yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: No.\nExplainer: So one of the differences between people and machines is that people might be a little better at this, but can't look at 10 million different things. So now that we've been talking about machine learning, is this something you want to learn how to do?\n","105":"Explainer: So machines work the same way. If you show them a lot of examples and give them practice, they'll learn how to guess. And then when you give them the test, they should be able to do that. So we looked at eight pictures and you were able to answer really quickly. But what would you do if I gave you 10 million examples? Would you be able to do that so quickly?\nExplainee: No.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Kind of. Because I kind of want to become a spy. And we used to do coding, so I may be kind of good at it.\nExplainer: And machine learning is a great way to use all those math skills, all those coding skills, and would be a super cool tool for a spy.\n","106":"Explainer: Do you know why we're here today?\nExplainee: Because we're talking about science.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Um, something that helps you remember things.\nExplainer: Definitely.

And yeah, what are you working on?\nExplainee: Lately I've been doing, you know, always a little bit of side channel analysis. So what I really do, you know, is all hardware layer. So I've been looking, you know, at some various devices lately, at how susceptible they are to fault attacks, what that sort of means in real life. You know, not just purely the research side, but also how much should you care about it.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: One of them was looking at, like, a little hardware Bitcoin wallet, and you could use fault injection to actually recover secrets from it, and a lot of devices. I mean, the whole idea is pretty cool, right? Because you tell the device, Hey, I want to authenticate, and it's supposed to run some really crazy math that authenticates it, but instead of doing that crazy math and attacking the math, you just attack the check at the end.\nExplainer: We're also scratching the surface of, like, what is possible? It's not necessarily just the system itself and not necessarily that algorithm itself. Like you said, you don't necessarily need to attack the math in some cases. You can just attack that check. And I think something that's been pretty cool is looking at higher energy particles. It's going to be maybe hard to entirely confirm, but I think it'd be really, really cool to actually see. Like, I want to see one of these faults because I haven't seen it myself. And also, how do you know that you've seen it? I've started playing with, like, setting up a cloud chamber. A cloud chamber lets you actually view high energy particles going through sort of like in a small jar with some evaporated alcohol. And I thought it'd be really cool if we put some memory chip in there, like a basic memory chip and we just fill it with some data, but then you put a camera on that area and you just watch. Assuming that there is a high energy particle that actually hits that memory, that should potentially flip the energy state of that bit. The outside microcontrollers should be able to read that and actually say, Oh wait, the data, even though I'm not changing data, I'm only reading data, and we should be able to visibly or optically see it. What I'm wondering is could that be a next area of research? Because I don't think anyone's actually looking at intentionally injecting high energy particles to take over a computer, when really, you know, that's another technique for fault injection, technically speaking.\n","109":"Explainer: Maybe a mutual acquaintance of ours, Jasper gave a example of fault injection, and I like to use that as, when I'm trying to explain fault injection, he shows a pinball machine and the pinball machine, obviously the two inputs are the two plungers when you're playing a pinball machine, but fault injection, you can tilt the entire pinball machine, right? You're just introducing some external variable that's outside of the traditional inputs that you're used to and you've now controlled the environment in a advantageous way to the user or the player. Can you give an example of some type of fault injection that you're doing or working on?\nExplainee: One of them was looking at, like, a little hardware Bitcoin wallet, and you could use fault injection to actually recover secrets from it, and a lot of devices. I mean, the whole idea is pretty cool, right?

Maybe call it a verifiable visualization of it, right? We know it's true, you know, you can get skin cancer by going outside and having too many high energy particles hit you, but we've never seen it. And we know it can happen to a computer chip, but I've never seen both.\nExplainee: Yeah, so actually, so it's funny you mentioned, like, making it more obvious. I mean, staying on fault injection right now, this is lately what I've been up to. A lot of making a little kind of, you know, like electronics kits of old, right? And you can assemble it all yourself and see how it works. So making something like that for fault injection. So all kind of older logic and stuff like that. So, I mean, it's sort of based on, like, you're presented the little MUX chip. You know, voltage switcher. That sort of idea, using just discreet logic to generate the actual glitch itself. So, but you know, it's part of, I think, this stuff, right? It's like people don't know about it sometimes. Like, even engineers designing systems. It's new to a lot of people.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Fault injection has become pretty interesting. Like, there's been a lot of people poking at that, and I think a lot more products of interest. Side channel still might have a bit of a comeback. Basically, what I kind of see is a lot of the really cool stuff has been in academia because product security hasn't kept up, right? For the longest time, doing these attacks on hardware was pretty straightforward. You didn't need these crazy attacks. It looks like a lot of devices are coming out now that actually have real claims to security, right? More than just a data sheet mentioned. There's actually something behind it.\nExplainer: For me, I think the things that have been recent and super interesting are typically down to physics-level effects that maybe we haven't seen before. I think my mind was blown with the, there was the light commands research, and they were able to modulate sound, although it's purely over light using a laser, they would hit the MEMS microphone, and it was picking that up and was able to then interpret it and essentially take control over light.\n","111":"Explainer: The thing is, even if you know about that, then there's so many others that someone won't necessarily know about, because there's so many, I guess, potential areas for a fault to occur. Where do you think security is going or new research is going? Are there any new areas you think are coming out or are going to be more interesting, you know, pretty soon?\nExplainee: Fault injection has become pretty interesting. Like, there's been a lot of people poking at that, and I think a lot more products of interest. Side channel still might have a bit of a comeback.

So you said like, Hey, Colin, you should test this out. I probably would be like, It probably won't even work. Which is like a lot of side channels. When I first heard about it, you know, working, doing firmware stuff, it was like, Oh, that sounds like it's not gonna work. Like, that sounds impossible. You know, the whole area of hardware hacking, it feels kinda like cheating because, you know, as you said, someone designing the system needs to know about so many different ways, right? So there's so many ways to break the system, and if you're designing them, you need to know all of them, but when you're attacking it, you really need to know one, right? So I can know nothing about, like, how does ECC actually work? You know, I have some vague hand-waving I can tell you about, but if you gave me a pen and told me, like, Okay, write it down, specifically the equations and what they mean and how the point model works and stuff. Right, no idea, but designers are like the other side. It's almost like, I don't wanna say the lazy side of it.\nExplainer: It's the easier side. I would say my side is the easier side, right? I'm on the offensive side. I want to break into things. Someone on the defense side, they might have, you know, a system was developed and they now need to patch a hundred holes. They patch 99 of them. I only need to find that one.\n","112":"Explainer: So tell me, what do you know about black holes?\nExplainee: Well, I know they're created when stars, once they start growing, it doesn't, it can't expand anymore, so they collapse inward.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: But no, the wind, the pull isn't, if you're not close enough, it doesn't work.\nExplainer: Right, you will feel the gravitational pull, and it'll redirect you in some way, and if you're far enough way, it's just like you're very far away from the sun, or something else. If you're close enough, it will divert your path more, if you're close enough still, then you will get what are called tidal forces, where the difference between, for example, if you're standing next to a black hole, the difference in gravity between your feet and your head actually becomes significant. Next time you see a science fiction movie, if somebody says, Oh, my god, we've been caught in the gravitation field of a black hole, and we're gonna fall in, it's like, no, no, just, if you're far enough away, just thrust a little bit this way, and then you'll slingshot around the black hole.\n","113":"Explainer: You got, pretty much, you got a very good idea about it. Basically you have a star, at the core its generating energy, which is countering the pressure of all that mass trying, being pulled in by gravity. Once it can't generate that energy anymore, the core collapses, once the core is collapsing, it keeps collapsing, and collapsing, and collapsing, and that's the critical thing that makes a black hole. You have enough mass in the volume, such that the escaped velocity becomes the speed of light, once light can't escape, hence the black part. (laughs) But that's the thing, is that just because there's an intense amount of gravity very close to a black hole, things don't start behaving differently. And my favorite analogy is a vacuum, everybody thinks, like, if you point a vacuum cleaner at something, it's just gonna suck everything in--\nExplainee: But no, the wind, the pull isn't, if you're not close enough, it doesn't work.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: So are there any movies that actually do, like, get space right?\nExplainer: I wouldn't call them educational, but the movie Interstellar actually had, as one of the people involved in both writing it, and as a science advisor, Dr. Kip Thorne, who's a Professor at Caltech, who was part of the team that detected gravitational waves, and just won a Nobel Prize for it. So he made sure to try and get it as accurate as possible, so Interstellar, I think, is one of the best examples of getting black holes right.\n","114":"Explainer: Right, you will feel the gravitational pull, and it'll redirect you in some way, and if you're far enough way, it's just like you're very far away from the sun, or something else.

But the infrared can penetrate the dust, the X-rays can penetrate the dust, the radio can penetrate all of that dust, so by combining all of these different wavelengths, people are really coming to a point of okay, how is this happening, by looking at different wavelengths of light, we can get a better sense, but they're still working on the theory, it's not all done.\n","115":"Explainer: You know, we first met 10, 11 years ago and machine learning has changed a lot since then.\nExplainee: Tooling that we now have, the capacity, and also, an elevation of the problem sets that we're dealing with and how to frame the problem. And I'm almost struggling to figure out whether it's a blessing or curse that it has become as accessible and as democratized and as easy to execute and you just build another new company from scratch. And so, what's been, kind of, your reflection on that?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: In contrast, what I'm struggling with, the friend of mine who asked me to look at some health care data for him. And despite the capabilities that we're having in all of the, kind of, bigger societal problems alongside with data collection engineering, all the gnarly stuff, that is actually not the machine learning itself, it's the rest of it where certain data isn't available.

Like, Oh, no. The accessibility of the tooling, like, we can now do in, like, five lines of code something that would have taken 500 lines of very mathematical, messy, gnarly code even, you know, five years ago. And that's not an exaggeration. And there are tools that mean that pretty much anyone can pick this up and start playing with it and start to build with it. And that is also really exciting.\nExplainee: In contrast, what I'm struggling with, the friend of mine who asked me to look at some health care data for him.

What types of biases in the data collection, and then also in the usage? We now call it the bias, but we're still struggling with the society not really living up to its expectations and then machine learning, bringing it to the forefront.\nExplainer: Right. And so, to say that another way, when you're collecting data from the real world and then building machine learning systems that automate decisions based on that data, all of the biases and problems that are already in the real world then can be magnified through that machine learning system. And so, it can make many of these problems much worse.\n","117":"Explainer: And part of the challenge of it is not the mathematics of building models, but the challenge is making sure that the data is sufficiently representative, potentially high quality.\nExplainee: And how transparent do I need to build it for it to be adopted at some point?

What types of biases in the data collection and then also in the usage?

And the motivation was really because it was such an amazingly exciting playground to push that technology that used to largely live in academia, really, out in the world and see, kind of, what it can achieve. It has created such a hunger for data that now everything is being collected. I'm curious, when are we going to make a foray into things like agriculture about smart production of the things we eat? You see and hear these interesting stories, but I feel like we're not ready yet to put that into a economically viable situation.\nExplainer: So when we think about the next five to 10 years, the things that are really still holding us back are these uneven applications of resources to problems because the problems that get attention are the high value ones in terms of how much money you can make or the things that are fashionable enough that you can publish a paper on it. So what do you think is holding us back?\n","119":"Explainer: These are great questions. So things like actuarial science, operations research, where they actually are not using machine learning as much as you might think. And then you have other sorts of companies or on the FinTech side, or even the ad tech side of things where they perhaps are using machine learning to the point of even absurdity.\nExplainee: So I spent about eight years working in ad tech.

I think there is a chicken and egg problem, like your former example, that these areas that need to wait for data, the value of the data collection is then also slightly less apparent. And so, it gets delayed further and you'll see that happening. But what my experience has been, there's unfortunately, I feel a drifting apart between academia and the uses of AI, but I am somewhat frustrated with a generation of students who have standard data sets that they never think about what the model needs to be used for, that they never have to think about how the data was collected. So with all of these challenges ahead of us, how optimistic are you about this world that I deeply believe we can create and the steps towards it?\nExplainer: I am incredibly optimistic and not... Perhaps it's a personality flaw, but I can't help but look at the potential of the technology to reduce harm, to give us information that help us make better decisions. And to think that we would choose to address the big problems ahead of us. I don't think we have a hope of addressing them without figuring out the role that machine learning will play. And to think that we would then choose not to do that is just unthinkable.\n","120":"Explainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Wow.\nExplainer: The thing that makes them cool is they're sort of like tilings, it looks like you could put this together by cutting little pieces of paper and sliding them together, but they're still one sheet.\n","121":"Explainer: A lot of origami is animals, birds and things. There's also a branch of origami that is, it's more abstract or geometric, called tessellations. Tessellations, like most origami, are folded from a single sheet of paper but they make patterns, whether it's woven patterns like that, or woven patterns like this. If you hold them up to the light you can see patterns.\nExplainee: Wow.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: They weren't cut?\nExplainer: There's no cuts in these just folding. We can build these up from smaller building blocks of folds, learn how to fold little pieces and put them together in the same way that a tiling like this looks like it's built up of little pieces. Can you make a fold that starts at the dot that doesn't run all the way across the paper?\n","122":"Explainer: There's no cuts in these just folding.

Each of these folds is peaked like a mountain and we call these mountain folds but if I made it the other way, then it's shaped this way and we call it a valley fold. In all of origami there's just mountains and valleys.\nExplainee: So all the folds are reversible?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Oh.\nExplainer: That's a rule of all flat origami no matter how many folds come together at a point and I'm going to show you a building block of tessellations, it's called a twist because that center square, as I unfold it, it twists, it rotates.\n","124":"Explainer: So they're all reversible and it turns out that in every origami shape that folds flat, it's going to be either three mountains and a valley or, if we're looking at the backside, three valleys and a mountain, they always differ by two.\nExplainee: Oh.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Twists?\nExplainer: If I had another twist in the same sheet of paper I could make these folds connect with that, and these folds connect with that. And if I had another one up here, I could make all three. And if I had a square array and all the folds lined up I could make bigger and bigger arrays, like these, because these are just very large twists. In this case it's an octagon rather than a square, but they're arranged in rows and columns. And let's just try going along. All right, there is our tessellation with squares and hexagons. So you have now designed and folded your first origami tessellation and perhaps you can see how just using this idea of building up tiles and small building blocks you could make tessellations as big and complex as you want.\n","125":"Explainer: That's a rule of all flat origami no matter how many folds come together at a point and I'm going to show you a building block of tessellations, it's called a twist because that center square, as I unfold it, it twists, it rotates.\nExplainee: Twists?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: That was cool.\nExplainer: Yeah, so what do you think now of origami and tessellations?\n","126":"Explainer: Yeah.\nExplainee: I'm understanding more so that it's these, a mapping of the circuitry, the pathways between neurons that can lead to evidence of patterns in your brain that are common between different people.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Well, the computer only communicates with itself in binary so it only has two options, it can only ask itself yes or no questions, but a human brain has an infinity of directions that it can go.\nExplainer: Neurons are also digital. Meaning a Neuron either fires or it doesn't fire, so that's either one or zero. And it's the combination of those ones or zeros that actually produce the 10 thousand different answers that you say.\n","127":"Explainer: We have to use electron microscopes and then what we have been developing a way to slice the brain into really thin slices, use an electron microscope to take a picture of each slice, and then use computers to put it all back. Imagine that we could get a map of every connection, right? And we knew how neurons fire. Do you think we could put that in a computer, that map, and then therefore, that computer should be able to think just like the brain that we extracted it from?\nExplainee: Well, the computer only communicates with itself in binary so it only has two options, it can only ask itself yes or no questions, but a human brain has an infinity of directions that it can go.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","128":"Explainee: So how do you do your observations in optical and infrared?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: So do you get dimensions of the disk out of that?\nExplainer: Yeah, again, we don't know exactly where X, Y, Z, zero is, we're assuming that it's something, you know, the X-rays that are coming out are very close to the event horizon of the black hole, but this is still, you know, your realm of X-rays, to really figure out those kinds of things. But once the X-rays, once the photons hit the corona, and are re-scattered, and up, energized, and then they start illuminating the accretion disk, it heats it up, and so just by the light travel time, when the optical, if it gets, you know, brighter and fainter, and then the infrared gets brighter and fainter, two weeks later, then the dust is two light weeks away from that. So it's a one dimensional one, so we're averaging, so we don't get the two dimensional, or even three dimensional one. And then we've done it now, of course, we have better telescopes, there was a project where you could do it with the Hubble Space Telescope and the ultraviolet, you used the Swift Observatory, which had optical and ultraviolet, and then from ground base, we did optical, and then from space we did it with Spitzer and the infrared. So you could actually see this bright flash go off in a nearby AGN called NGC5548, and then you see it propagate as it warms up the disk, as all that light is falling onto it, and then eventually you hit the, the, further away, where the dust is, and the dust tends to radiate in an infrared. So we got basically a structure, and you just, you see this flashbulb go off, and then it illuminates, effectively, the structure.\n","129":"Explainer: So you do see it, basically the dust sublimation radius, and you see it at, and it tells you, depending on what kind of dust it is, and it's actually one of the problems for me studying, whenever we try and do X-ray studies of low luminosity active galactic nuclei in your, by galaxies, because there're all these X-ray binaries that are also emitting X-rays, which make our lives difficult. But they're also in black holes, when it's this really interesting sort of both, it's great, but ugh, it's also a source of noise for those of us who are trying to do X-ray observations of nearby galaxies.\nExplainee: We have the same problem, we can't see the actual black hole underneath all these very bright X-ray binaries.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: The X-ray binaries, yeah, so they're, no, they're typically like 10 solar masses, so from three, you know, that's the smallest one you can have is from three solar masses, and then all the way up. So that's where we have LIGO, and LIGO has now directly, I mean, this was all theory before, that we knew that this was gonna happen, and never seen it before, so LIGO is now the first time that we have been able to completely verify this theory, that you can have black holes and neutron stars merging together. And so what happens in the case of two neutron stars, when they merge together, now suddenly they become heavier, they become heavy enough to turn into a black hole. And so the first of these events happened in August, and what happened here is you had these two neutron stars that spun around each other, and then they merged, and then for a very short time, we are talking about 100 milliseconds, or tens of 100 milliseconds, it actually remained a neutron star, probably, it was a hyper massive neutron star because it was spinning so fast, it didn't collapse under its own weight. But then, you know, the angular momentum gets dissipated away from the object, and then, at that point, it can't maintain its own weight, and then it collapses, and turn into a black hole. All this theory that we knew about is now finally being, being validated.\nExplainer: Which is great, although it still doesn't help us in the AGN community, because we don't know how the millions to billions solar mass black holes came to be. But it's, at least we're building up, or hopefully that at some point, and by understanding these lower mass, how these lower mass black holes came to be, then we can see where there are a large scale number of mergers can potentially give us this, or you really need something, other, another corridor to fundamentally get us something that's a million solar masses, you know, on the minimum side, but definitely, you know, we've gotten those which are billion. So we know we can merge the million solar mass black holes to get the bigger ones, but how do you get to those in the beginning, particularly so early in the universe, when you get quasars at really high red shifts, so they're really early on.\n","130":"Explainer: It's a weird thing to be sitting in your own galaxy, but not be able to separate all these, four million solar mass black hole creating, next to, how massive, it's like two to three solar masses for the X-ray binaries?\nExplainee: The X-ray binaries, yeah, so they're, no, they're typically like 10 solar masses, so from three, you know, that's the smallest one you can have is from three solar masses, and then all the way up.

I mean, the other thing that's a little odd, now we're going back to stellar mass black holes is, so we look at a lot of supernova remnants, and we, so we see them, we can only really see them in our own galaxy, and so we have a lot of supernova remnants, and so how we see them is, you see the expelled mass from the star as it died, so that creates an extended source, and then you look for the compact object that was left behind. And what's interesting is that you see, you quite often see the neutron stars because they pulse, so they're easy to see, but so far, we've not found a single black hole at the center of a supernova remnant. And so, which is interesting, so you say, you should see them, you know, you ought to see some fallback, you know, you need some matter, you need something, but no, never, not yet been detected.\nExplainer: And this goes to the idea that you don't have a core balance, that a supernova with a black hole as its final result, actually never has any kind of expulsion, that it all just goes.

When do we really need deep learning versus when can we use something that's a little bit more interpretable, something that's been around for a while?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: I definitely think there is, but I also, sort of, see it varying a lot based on the use case, something that, kind of, works out of the box and maybe works a little bit more automatically might be better.

As you said, these models are trained to, sort of, predict the next sequence of words, given a certain sequence of words. So we could start with just, sort of, prompts like the woman was versus the man was, and, kind of, pull out common words that are, sort of, more used with one phrase versus the other. So that's, sort of, a qualitative way of looking at it. It's not ever kind of a guarantee of how the model is gonna behave in one particular instance. And I think that's what's really tricky and that's why I, sort of, think it's really good for creators of systems to just be honest about, This is, sort of, what we have seen. And so then, someone can make their own judgment about, Is this gonna be too high risk for, sort of, my particular use case?\nExplainer: I imagine in the last few years, we've seen a lot of changes and improvements in the capabilities of NLP systems. So is there anything in that that you're particularly excited about exploring further?\n","135":"Explainer: So we've been talking about gravity from Newton and celestial bodies, the Earth, the Moon, pulling on each other in the conventional sense of gravity being an attractive force, to the Earth creating curves in space-time, then we moved on to just diffused seas of energy and space-time as the real universe and gravitation is really just talking about space-time in general, and here we are, and you're really hardcore in theoretical physics. Where would you take the exposition of gravity from that point?\nExplainee: Well, one thing is quantum mechanics. Quantum mechanics is the most successful theory in the history of science, it explains the most different phenomena the most precisely. Yet many people would still say we don't understand even the basics of it.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Yeah, for me, the beauty of the theory of gravity is the way Einstein formulated it, as a theory of geometry, of curved space and time. I think, like you, that's one of the things that really pulled me into it.\nExplainer: Is there really space-time or are we just using unnecessary language because it's elegant and we like it and it's beautiful?\n","136":"Explainer: To have the waves together.\nExplainee: Yeah, and in two states and in two possible states of the world, you can just literally put a plus sign between them and that's a sensible state, that's a good state, it makes sense.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Yeah, I think so. I think if you were to go far enough back in the history of the universe, back to when it was very, very dense, very small, and when quantum mechanics was certainly important, then it must have been like that. I mean, if we believe that the dominant standard model of cosmology, something had to produce the density perturbations, the things that seeded all the galaxies and stars and everything else in the world. So there's a galaxy over there, let's say, and not over there, so how did that happen? Why is there a galaxy there and not there? In the standard theory, as you know, that was a quantum event, a random event. And it doesn't mean that if happened there and not there 'cause you flipped a coin, it actually happened in both places. There's gotta be a wave function where in one branch of the wave function there's a galaxy there and not there, and on the other branch it's the opposite.\nExplainer: So when we're talking about the multiverse or the Big Bang, we are really talking about gravity ultimately, and we're talking about how a theory of gravitation which we know think of as a theory of space-time has a quantum explanation, has a quantum paradigm imposed on it that will help us understand these things, and we don't have that yet. One of the things that I think is so amazing is that the terrains in which we're going to understand quantum gravity are very few. It's the Big Bang, because that's where we know that quantum and gravity both were called into action. And there's black holes. One of the most interesting discoveries is of course Hawking's discovery, kick-started a kind of crisis, right? In thinking about why quantum mechanics and gravity were so knocking heads. It was one of the most beautiful examples.\n","137":"Explainer: So do you think there's some sense in which we shouldn't be thinking about individual universes, individual space-time, so we should be thinking about superpositions of space-times?\nExplainee: Yeah, I think so. I think if you were to go far enough back in the history of the universe, back to when it was very, very dense, very small, and when quantum mechanics was certainly important, then it must have been like that.

So, first of all, to be totally clear, though, we've never observed Hawking radiation, which is what he predicted, directly. I don't think very many people doubt that it's there, but yeah, Hawking discovered mathematically that when you have a black hole, it's got an event horizon, it's got a surface which is a point of no return. If you fall through that surface, no matter what you have, no matter how powerful the rocket you've got, even if you beam a flashlight back behind you in the direction you fall from, nothing escapes, not even light. It all gets sucked in and spaghettified and destroyed at the singularity, or something, something happens, but it doesn't get out. But in quantum mechanics, you can't really pin down the location of something precisely. If you try to pin down an electron in a tiny circuit in a microchip, sometimes you discover it's not actually there and then your computer crashes.\nExplainer: This is the Heisenberg's uncertainty principle in reality. You can't precisely say where the electron is, and you can't precisely say how quickly it's moving.\n","138":"Explainer: So when we're talking about the multiverse or the Big Bang, we are really talking about gravity ultimately, and we're talking about how a theory of gravitation which we know think of as a theory of space-time has a quantum explanation, has a quantum paradigm imposed on it that will help us understand these things, and we don't have that yet.

And this kind of uncertainty produces a radiation, which you can think of as pulling some of the energy out of the black hole. The black hole is formed out of some mass and there's an energy in that. If you think of pulling some energy out of that and sending it off to infinity in the form of particles being admitted. And what Hawking found is that it's a thermal spectrum, it looks like a hot, or not so hot for a large black hole, but like an oven, the kind of radiation that comes out of a cast iron.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: It's a crisis because of some of the details of it, but I would say the way you just described, I mean, if I build a big bonfire or an incinerator and I throw an encyclopedia into it, good luck reconstructing what was in that encyclopedia. The information is lost for all practical purpose.\nExplainer: Practical purposes.\n","140":"Explainer: Practical purposes.\nExplainee: Yes.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: One thing about quantum mechanics is that any time you have a state of the world and another state of the world, you can literally add them together and get a third possible state, as crazy as that sounds. And so if you're gonna have a quantum theory of gravity, then we can't really talk about there being a black hole or not a black hole, or an event horizon or not an event horizon, because we could always a state that had an event horizon and a state that doesn't, or has the event horizon in a slightly different position, maybe, and add them together. So the existence or position of an event horizon can't possibly be determined as a fact any more than the position of an electron is determined. So I think that's the loophole.\nExplainer: That's a nice way of looking at it. So that you're not actually violating classical relativity once you're in a regime where the wave function has really peaked around a very well-defined stage.\n","141":"Explainer: So this is a huge crisis 'cause either quantum mechanics is wrong, and as you described it, it's the most accurately-tested paradigm in the history of physics, how could it be wrong, right? Or the event horizon is letting information out and violating one of the most sacred principles of relativity.\nExplainee: One thing about quantum mechanics is that any time you have a state of the world and another state of the world, you can literally add them together and get a third possible state, as crazy as that sounds. And so if you're gonna have a quantum theory of gravity, then we can't really talk about there being a black hole or not a black hole, or an event horizon or not an event horizon, because we could always a state that had an event horizon and a state that doesn't, or has the event horizon in a slightly different position, maybe, and add them together. So the existence or position of an event horizon can't possibly be determined as a fact any more than the position of an electron is determined. So I think that's the loophole.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: That's right, and one of the most exciting developments in the last 10 or 20 years is called holography, and it's called holography because a hologram is a two-dimensional surface that creates a three-dimensional image. It's got sort of 3D information built into it. And this, in a fundamental way, really has that 3D or higher dimensional information built into it. It's exactly the same as this theory of gravity and more dimensions.\nExplainer: Yes, so one of the things I like to think of with holography is that I can pack a certain amount of information in a black hole. I mean, you can literally think of it as throwing things into it. So let's say I have information in some volume and I'm under the illusion that I can just keep packing information in that volume, as much as the volume will contain. Eventually I'll make a black hole and I'll find out that the maximum amount of information I can pack into anything in the entire universe is what I can pack on the area. And since area is projecting the illusion, maybe, of volume, maybe the whole world is just a hologram. It's not a principle that only applies to black holes. It's saying that, if this theory of quantum gravity is correct, then this while three-dimensionality is an utter illusion and really the universe is two-dimensional. That's crazy.\n","142":"Explainer: That's a nice way of looking at it.

And the most knowledge you could ever have would only be on a two-dimensional surface.\nExplainee: Right, and as big as the universe, and then you're done. So, you know, not likely that we're ever gonna hit that limit any time soon.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: If we buy the idea of holography, then absolutely, that's for sure, that's what it's telling us. Although which side is the illusion and which side is the reality? They're the same.\nExplainer: I mean, temperature is still great to talk about. It doesn't mean we shouldn't talk about temperature. I mean, we should absolutely adjust our thermostats and talk about temperature. But if we look at it closer and closer and closer, we realize there's not a thing in the world that has as a quantum value temperature, isolated. And so maybe there is no such thing as gravity isolated from quantum mechanics.\n","144":"Explainer: Do you think it's possible that gravity is really ultimately just quantum mechanics and doesn't exist at all in the fundamental ways that we've been talking about so far, like the Newtonian way and the space-time way, that those are just these kind of macroscopic illusions? Sometimes I talk about it in terms of temperature. Temperature is not a thing. There is no single thing called temperature. It's a macroscopic illusion that comes from the collective behavior, really quantum behavior of random motions of atoms. And is it possible that the whole of gravity is some kind of emergent illusion from what's really quantum phenomenon underlying it?\nExplainee: If we buy the idea of holography, then absolutely, that's for sure, that's what it's telling us. Although which side is the illusion and which side is the reality? They're the same.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Right, so I guess with the holographic description we've got two sides, which are actually secretly the same. On one side there's definitely no gravity. On the other side, well, it's a quantum theory of gravity, whatever that means. But the point is you can get it out, it's equivalent to this theory.\nExplainer: So that's just like saying there's the idea of a dual description. It's just saying there's a perfect dictionary between these two descriptions, and so to belabor which one's real is silly. It's like saying, is French or is English real?\n","145":"Explainer: I mean, temperature is still great to talk about. It doesn't mean we shouldn't talk about temperature.

For me, it's a question of which description is most useful. I mean, if you wanna say gravity is an illusion and it's all quantum, that's great, but then you fall down the stairs and bang your head.\nExplainer: [Janna laughs]\n","146":"Explainer: [Robert] Would you like to give it a try?\nExplainee: Sure.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: That's awesome.\nExplainer: So you ready?\n","147":"Explainer: So you ready?\nExplainee: Yep.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Wow.\nExplainer: Let's fold it in half from corner to corner, unfold it and then we'll fold it in half the other direction, also corner to corner but we're going to lift it up and we're going to hold the fold with both hands. We're going to bring these corners together, making a little pocket and then, this is the trickiest part of this whole design, so you're going to put your finger underneath the top layer and we're going to try to make that layer fold right along the edge. Now you see how the sides kind of want to come in as you're doing that?\n","148":"Explainer: Okay. We're going to start with a model that every Japanese person learns in kindergarten, it's called a crane, traditional origami design, it's over 400 years old. So, people have been doing what we're about to do for 400 years.\nExplainee: Wow.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Yeah.\nExplainer: It's called a petal fold, it's a part of a lot of origami designs and it's key to the crane. Now we're ready for the magic. We're going to hold it in between thumb and forefinger, reach inside, grab the skinny point that's between the two layers, which are the wings, and I'm going to slide it out so it pokes out at an angle. We'll take the two wings, we spread them out to the side and you have made your first origami crane.\n","149":"Explainer: Let's fold it in half from corner to corner, unfold it and then we'll fold it in half the other direction, also corner to corner but we're going to lift it up and we're going to hold the fold with both hands.

We'll fold it in half like a book. On the folded side we'll take one of the folded corners and I'm going to fold it up through all layers. There's a pocket in the middle. We're going to spread the pocket and bring all four corners together. Where you have original corners of the square, we're gonna just pop those out. This is one of the most satisfying moments, I think-\n","151":"Explainer: Now, this is a traditional Japanese design but there are origami designs that have been around so long we're not entirely sure where they originated.

What do you think of origami?\n","153":"Explainer: Sure, and people are working on that already.\nExplainee: Yeah, yeah, exactly. And it's this very fruitful area of research, and you can find yourself looking like 20 years out, right, where you have an enormous number of electric cars. You have all of these batteries. That's essentially a distributed peak load power grid, right. Like, the cars are getting plugged in and unplugged at different times. If you have a mechanism that's able to automatically and autonomously be distributing power based on batteries that are scattered throughout the grid that are being used for other purposes. Their owners don't even necessarily need to be aware. I mean, to have something that looks like a much more viable society that still has a lot of electricity needs but is able to base that much more on renewables, is able to make up the difference during peak load periods or during differences in weather, that is able to have power much closer to where it is needed rather than having to be distributed over great distances. It's like, that's something that would be an enormously hard problem to solve. And it's not that the blockchain makes it easy, but it makes it possible.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: I'm glad you mentioned initial coin offerings because for me, those really exemplify the sort of problem that we're having at this exact moment. They are an idea with enormous potential significance down the road. However, the promise of the initial coin offering has been kind of hijacked into this string of like basically pump and dump scams or sort of desperate gold rush schemes. The faster that we can shift from this fantasy that it is going to make you rich in a sort of, you know, 1920s tulip bubble kind of way, is the sooner that we can get into people, honestly, and I mean this like with all the hope in the world, people being disappointed in blockchain. It's like, oh, I didn't get rich. It's just being used now to make it easier to transact goods and services safely across borders. This isn't exciting at all. And then we'll see that become part of the everyday infrastructure of the world in a way that I think will be very significant. But I think it is now, almost every aspect of it that's connected with the concept of money is wildly over-hyped, and--\nExplainer: And it also creates a problem, which is people get a lot of excitement around it.\n","154":"Explainer: Where is this technology? Why haven't I seen any change yet?\nExplainee: (laughs) Yes, yes, yes.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Yes.\nExplainer: It will develop. It will take five years. It will take 10 years. That kind of time is necessary. One of the areas that brought me to supply chain research is the fact that we're not just gonna see blockchain emerge. We're gonna see artificial intelligence continue to evolve. We're gonna see connective devices and this sort of growing internet of things and machinery that can do a lot more and have a wallet and transact on their own. And so I actually think a lot of where blockchain and other technologies are headed is this interesting synergy that will help us elevate the kinds of institutions we've used in the past and cobbled together to create that identifiable, verifiable trust.\n","155":"Explainer: And it's because we've had a lot of PR, a lot of proof of concept, but truthfully, this is more like a science, right?\nExplainee: Yes.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Yes, and one of the most interesting ideas to me that came out of the currency side of the blockchain project was the notion around like coloring coins, right, assign properties to a particular coin, and in particular to assign those properties in ways that would allow you to do things like bring in the graph of previous transactions.\nExplainer: [Bettina] Right.\n","156":"Explainer: In that it's hard to compare it to some perfect future.

So it's an upgraded, better version. Sometimes that's new features, but sometimes that's bug fixes and ways to protect you as well.\n","159":"Explainer: Yeah, exactly. They're looking for ways that they can create protection. It's kind of like the lock on your front door. That lock is to essentially prevent bad people from coming in or people accidentally coming in when they shouldn't. A hacker is essentially looking at a way, how can I get into this lock? But then there are the good ones who are trying to unlock it so that they can tell the company that made the lock, hey, we can actually protect people by making the lock a little harder.\nExplainee: What would they do about the people and the broken lock?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: But like, they may get arrested because they might get mistaken.\nExplainer: That's a very good point. You should definitely make sure that you're obeying the law. They might work with the lock company and say, I'm trying to improve your product. And they're trying to find these holes or problems, and then share that with the company. Even though the good hacker is doing exactly the same thing as the bad hacker, it's the same exact skillset, and you're using the same exact techniques and information to try to break that lock, but your goal as a good hacker is really to help everyone like you and me to make sure that our stuff is protected.

Obviously it's not handmade, so is it factories and stuff?\nExplainer: Exactly. So these are made using a technique called lithography. You basically coat the silicon wafer with a polymer. Then you put a mask on it and then you shine light through it. And the features of the mask, the size of those holes determine the feature size in the chip. It's not just the size of the mask that matters. It's the wavelength of the light that's used. We talked about nanotechnology being science fiction before, but this is real stuff that's being produced, that's being made, that's being used every day by people.\n","166":"Explainer: You have to make it smaller. Exactly. But here's the problem. So about 10 to 15 years ago, the devices got so small that if you shrunk them this gate, that actually turns it on and off loses its ability to control the channel. And so what they did, was they took devices like this into these things, we call them, FinFETs, kind of like a fin on a fish. So they're very thin transistors. The width of these fins is only six nanometers. Okay? So 6 nanometers is 25 to 30 atoms across. And they repeat this over the entire wafer just about perfectly. It's just a huge feat in engineering. But these types of devices are exactly the kind of devices that your phones and computers either have, or will have in the near future.

Really, you have some sort of system and you have a bunch of inputs and you have some sort of output, and actually you, as the designer, you're essentially designing games and software. You're saying, well, I will only allow a user to really control these inputs. Can you think of any inputs the computer might have?\n","170":"Explainer: So on code.org, one of the things you've been doing is actually building a game or that they have a game and then you can actually rewire some of the inputs and outputs of that. Is that right?\nExplainee: Yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: [Linda] Space bar.\nExplainer: Yep, there's also things like your mouse and there's even things like the microphone itself is actually an input device. It's taking something from you, which is the sound and it's then transmitting that, ad it's actually sending it to me. Are there any other things that you can talk to a computer? You can give it information.\n","171":"Explainer: Okay. With computer hacking, it's actually the same thing.

That's how I try to think of things is there's just a bunch of inputs. Often, if you're trying to break something or hack something, you're really saying, okay, how can I control these inputs in a way that wasn't necessarily expected?\n","172":"Explainer: Yep, there's also things like your mouse and there's even things like the microphone itself is actually an input device.

I'm just going to be typing keystrokes to be talking to some piece of software or hardware, but other times it can be other things like even the temperature of a computer can actually affect how the computer operates, and it might be advantageous to me to cool down the computer and actually slow down the movement of electrons in something like memory, so that if a computer shuts off, it stores something that wasn't memory like a password and stores it for a long enough time that I might be able to actually extract it through some other methods.\n","173":"Explainer: Typically, it's going to be something like the keyboard, right?

There's different languages to hack in. I've also learned that a lot of things could be hacked that you don't necessarily think that can be hacked.\n","174":"Explainer: So you're saying gravity pulls things down, yet we've launched things into space. Do you ever wonder how we do that?\nExplainee: Isn't it like a slingshot, like if you pull something back enough it'll go in the opposite direction?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: And does the gravity pull it or is it just floating?\nExplainer: In a weird way, that is gravity pulling it. So have you ever had a yo-yo where you swing it around like this? The string is pulling it in at all times, but you've also given it this angular momentum. And as long as you give it the angular momentum, pulling it in actually keeps it in orbit. And so the Earth is pulling it in at all times, so that's why it doesn't just travel off in a straight line. It keeps coming back around. So it's funny, people think that the International Space Station is so far away that they're not feeling gravity, and that's not the case at all. They're absolutely feeling gravity. They're just cruising so fast that, even though they're being pulled in, they never get pulled to the surface.\n","175":"Explainer: Well, that's true, we do use slingshot technology once things are out in the solar system. So, for instance, we use Jupiter and other planets so that when some of the spacecraft gets close, it'll slingshot around and it'll cause it to speed up. But mostly, around the Earth, gravity pulls things down, so when we want to send a rocket into space, when we wanna go to the Moon, when we wanna send supplies to the International Space Station, the trick is to get something moving fast enough that it escapes the gravitational pull of the Earth. Have you heard the expression what goes up must come down? It's actually not true. If you throw it fast enough, you can actually get something that doesn't come back down again, and that's basically how rocket launches work. You have to get the rocket for the Earth to go more than 11 kilometers a second. Think of how fast it is. Just one breath and it's gone 11 kilometers. If you get it to go that fast, it's not gonna come back down again. So you know the International Space Station which is orbiting the Earth? That's going around the Earth at 17,000 miles an hour. It has no engines anymore, the engines are turned off. So it's just there falling forever. So once it's out there, it's not coming back down as long as it's cruising like that.\nExplainee: And does the gravity pull it or is it just floating?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: It's like that ride at the rollercoasters where you go in and it's spins super fast and you can't feel it spinning fast but--\nExplainer: Yeah, you feel pinned to that. It's exactly like that. There's something called the equivalence principle where people realized, especially Einstein, that if you were in outer space in a rocket ship and it was dark and painted and it was accelerating at exactly the right rate, you actually wouldn't know if you were sitting on the floor of a building around the Earth or if you were on a rocket ship that was accelerating.\n","176":"Explainer: In a weird way, that is gravity pulling it.

You ever had that experience where you're sitting in a train and the other one moves and for a second you're not sure if you're the one moving?\n","177":"Explainer: Yeah, you feel pinned to that. It's exactly like that.

Imagine you're in this train and it's going near the speed of light relative to the platform, but it's so smooth, then you should be in a situation in which there's no meaning to your absolute motion, there's no absolute motion. So that if you throw a ball up, you might think from the outside of the platform, be confused that when gravity pulls that back down, it's gonna hit you or something, but it'll land in your palm as surely as if you were in your living room.\n","178":"Explainer: Yeah. You ever had that experience where you're sitting in a train and the other one moves and for a second you're not sure if you're the one moving?\nExplainee: Yeah, 'cause I go on the train every day to go to school, but I never feel like I'm moving when I'm in the train, and then I'm like, wait, what?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Isn't that kinda crazy? Amazing.\nExplainer: So imagine you were an astronaut and you were floating in empty space. You can't see anything. There's no stars, there's no Earth. You can ask yourself, am I moving? There's really no way for you to tell. So you would probably conclude, well, I'm not moving. So then your friend Marina comes cruising past you, and maybe she's going thousands of kilometers a second, and you say, Marina, you're cruising at thousands of kilometers a second, you're going so fast. But she had just done the same experiment. She was just floating in space thinking, Am I moving? There's no way to know which one of you is moving and there's no meaning to the absolute motion. The only thing that's true is that you're in relative motion, that's true. You both agree you're in relative motion, and that's clear. But neither of you can say it's actually you who's moving and I'm stationary.\n","179":"Explainer: That's because in some sense, you're really not.

Amazing.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: [laughs] I don't even know what to say to that.\nExplainer: So let me tell you where it gets really crazy.\n","180":"Explainer: So let me tell you where it gets really crazy.\nExplainee: [Maria laughs]\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Yeah.\nExplainer: So you would say, oh Marina is gonna measure a different speed of light. But she comes back and she says, No. 300,000 kilometers per second. Because from her perspective, she's standing still, and the laws of physics have better be the same for her. The speed of light is a fact of nature that's as true as the strength of gravity. And the two of you are in this quandary because if one of you is the preferred person who correctly measures the speed of light, that ruins everything about the idea of the relativity of motion. Which one of you should it be? So Einstein decides they must both measure the same speed of life. How could that possibly, possibly be the case? And he thinks, well, if speed is how far you travel, your spatial distance, in a certain amount of time, then there must be something wrong with space and time. And he goes from the constancy of the speed of light and a respect for this idea of relativity to the idea that space and time must not be the same for you and for Marina. And that's how he gets the idea of the relativity of space and time. [laughs] You have the best expression on your face. [laughs] It's pretty wild, but that is a starting point, actually, of the whole theory of relativity. That starting point leads to this complete revolution in physics where we suddenly have a Big Bang and black holes and space-time. Just from that one simple starting point. So, is your impression of gravity different than when we started the conversation?\n","181":"Explainer: Mine too, because I get to spend all day studying it. Because you know what sleep does for you?\nExplainee: It rests your body, like an electric car.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Whoa.\nExplainer: So today, we're going to talk about some animals and how they sleep. So here's the first one. What's that?\n","182":"Explainer: They're pretty cool, right?\nExplainee: Mhm.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: And how does it like recharge, like humans?\nExplainer: So we think it works the same way, but maybe just like more efficiently. And so we're still really learning about how this works. Sleep science itself is kind of a new field.\n","183":"Explainer: And so what's really cool about this is that giraffes need to sleep like everybody else, and so the way that it does is it kind of slumps over and it gets down on its legs and it kind of becomes this ball, but what's crazy about the whole thing is they only sleep for like 30 minutes a day. 30 minutes! Because it can't waste any more time, because it can't be vulnerable for any longer. It can get eaten by lions and that kind of thing. It has kind of evolved in a way that it can still survive and still get all the restoration it needs under such a short period of time.\nExplainee: And how does it like recharge, like humans?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: I had a sleepover on Saturday, and I didn't sleep at all.\nExplainer: And how did you feel?\n","184":"Explainer: And how did you feel?\nExplainee: Really tired.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: It affects what you can do in your daily life.\nExplainer: Excellent. So now I want to tell you about another animal and how they sleep, okay? So we have this one. What's that?\n","185":"Explainer: A hippopotamus. They have a different challenge. They sleep underwater.\nExplainee: I could never do that, I would pass out.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: That's cool.\nExplainer: Would it be cool to have that power?\n","186":"Explainer: Would it be cool to have that power?\nExplainee: Uh yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Aww a dolphin.\nExplainer: A dolphin! Yes. So dolphins, kind of like hippos, have to sleep in the water, okay? But because they're mammals, right, they need to breathe. Dolphins breathe air. They have to go up to the surface and breathe, right? And for an animal like that, it needs to figure out a way that it can sleep but also still survive, right? You know how dolphins sleep?\n","187":"Explainer: So now I want to talk about our last animal, and I think this one is probably the most amazing of all. Okay, so what's this?\nExplainee: Aww a dolphin.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: How?\nExplainer: One half of their brain at a time. So half of their brain goes to sleep, and the other half stays awake, so that they can continue to breathe and swim, and they do it in this four hours a time, so like their right part of their brain sleeps, they're able to go up to the surface and breathe. Then their left part of their brain sleeps for four hours, and it goes back and forth, back and forth, so they can kind of maintain alertness, still breathe, and survive. Is that amazing or what?\n","188":"Explainer: I wanted to talk to you about a specific type of science called nanotechnology. Have you ever heard of this word before?\nExplainee: Nhn nhn.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: A baby ant?\nExplainer: A baby ant? Very good. So I have over here a meter stick, let me show it to you. And so that's a meter and if I divide it by 1000, I get a millimeter. So milli just means 1000. There's all these little lines on the ruler. And each of those little lines is one millimeter. So a baby ant is probably a couple of millimeters. So even the thing, that's the smallest thing you can think of, it's a million times bigger than a nanometer. Tiny, tiny, tiny.\n","189":"Explainer: Nano is kind of a funny word, right? It's a word that's used before another word, and it means one billion. What's the smallest object you can think of?\nExplainee: A baby ant?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Tiny, tiny, tiny, tiny.\nExplainer: If I took this stick and I was to draw 1 billion lines, the distance between those two lines would be one nanometer. So that's really all it is. It's just a measure of size. But it's really, really, really tiny, smaller than anything that we can see with our eyes. The reason why, in nanotechnology, scientists, we care about things that are that small, is because there are objects called atoms. Have you ever heard of atoms before?\n","190":"Explainer: If I took this stick and I was to draw 1 billion lines, the distance between those two lines would be one nanometer.

I first heard of them on a show I watched called StoryBots. They're just little things that make up everything on Earth, even earth.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Yeah!\nExplainer: So it's called a scanning tunneling microscope. And not only can you see the atoms, but you can move them around. Atoms are kind of sticky. You can actually build things using this instrument with actual individual atoms. So if I gave you that machine, would you want to make something? Would you want to look at something very carefully?\n","191":"Explainer: That was a perfect explanation. But what if I told you that scientists invented a special type of microscope that not only lets you see atoms, but also lets you move them around and build things with them. Would you think that would be pretty cool?\nExplainee: Yeah!\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: I would want to make a unicorn out of atoms.\nExplainer: You are definitely a second grader! [laughing] My daughter would probably answer the exact same way. A unicorn would be awesome.\n","192":"Explainer: You are definitely a second grader!

And Realism was meant to capture the mundane, everyday lives of individuals and not idealize any of their activities in any way. And I think that that's really important for virtual reality. I think its kind of rite-of-passage for any kind of our technology to go through.\nExplainer: Mostly in VR we talk about the display and optics, the visual side of things, but we should at least tick off the other senses. And haptics is an interesting thing about virtual reality really doesn't have that aspect of touching things. You can move your hands around, you can do everything but its a disconnected experience because you know you don't have an actual solidity there. And I am pessimistic about progress in haptics technology. Almost all other areas I'm an optimist and I'm excited about what's coming up, but I don't have any brilliant vision about how we're going to revolutionize haptics and make it feel like we're touching the things in the virtual world.\n","194":"Explainer: You know an interesting topic is: what are the limits to what we can do with virtual reality? Where I'm pretty pleased with what we have today. What we can show people and say virtual reality, its cool. People get an amazing response from it. But we're still clearly a very, very long ways from reality.\nExplainee: That kinds of notes back to Realism in our history and how Realism was a response to Romanticism.

I think its kind of rite-of-passage for any kind of our technology to go through.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: So I've tried the demos, at VRLA there's one that has waves, like audio waves I believe, that come up and then you can put your hands through that and feel the waves whenever you're supposed to be feeling bubbles or any kind of force field or something. And those are pretty interesting. I've seen some pretty interesting things that you can do with audios, you can cut down a lot of the storage I guess and the power that you would need in order to power a huge scene, you can just mimic the sounds of those scenes actually being there and they're not actually. For example, a professor at USC would have the sound of a train drive by without actually rendering the sound. And you would feel like you're deeply immersed in this world without having to have such an expensive scene built around you. So I think those are pretty significant.\nExplainer: Yeah, that is one potential quality improvement that is still on the horizon is when we do spatialization, we use HRTF, the Head Relative Transfer Function, to make it sound like its in different places. But usually we just use this one kind of generic, here's your average human, HRTF function. Its possible, that of course, if you are right in the average then its perfect for you. But there's always people off to the extremes, that it doesn't do a very good job at. And there may be better ways to allow people to sample their own perfect HRTF which can improve the audio experience a lot. It all comes down to all these trade-offs.\n","195":"Explainer: Mostly in VR we talk about the display and optics, the visual side of things, but we should at least tick off the other senses.

Its really difficult to build trust again with people who haven't done VR before but its easy to break off that trust when they have a bad experience.\nExplainer: There was a huge concern about that at Oculus. And the term internally that went around was poisoning the well. They were very, very concerned. I mean for a long time there was a fight about whether gear VR should even be done, because the worry was if we let a product go out, like gear VR that didn't have those things. That if somebody saw it and it was bad, made them sick, made their eyes hurt, then they would be like I'm never going to try VR again. I tried it that time and it was terrible. And there was legitimate arguments about whether it was even a good idea to do that. And it turned out that yes, its obviously better to have all those things, but you can still do something that's valuable for the user without it. Its weird being at the beginning of a medium like this.\n","196":"Explainer: Yeah, that is one potential quality improvement that is still on the horizon is when we do spatialization, we use HRTF, the Head Relative Transfer Function, to make it sound like its in different places.

Especially if they're experienced with traditional medium.\n","197":"Explainer: So, from your perspective, how would you describe gravity?\nExplainee: I'm taught that it's a force. It's described by inverse law. But I also know that it's a field. And there's a recent discovery with gravitational waves, although I don't know the specific details about that.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Yeah.\nExplainer: So you can also think of a gravitational field, something that permeates all of space. Even though the earth is three stories below us, it's not as though it's pulling at us from a distance. We're actually interacting with the field at this point and there's a real interaction right here at this point. And that's nice, because people were worried that if things acted at a distance, that the way that old-fashioned inverse-square force law describes it, that it was as spooky as mind-bending a spoon, that it was like telekinesis. If you don't touch something, how do you affect it? And so the first step was to start to think of gravity as a field that permeates all of a space. And it's weaker very far from the Earth and it's closer very close to the Earth. So one way to think of this field as a field that's really describing a curved space-time that is everywhere. Forget the difficulty of the math, just the intuition comes from two kind of simple observations. One was what Einstein described as the happiest thought of his life. So, right now, you might feel heavy in your chair, and we might feel heavy on the floor and our feet, or standing in an elevator cab. And Einstein said, what does the chair have to do with it, or the floor, or the elevator? Those aren't gravitational objects. So he wanted to eliminate them, and one way to do the thought experiment is to imagine standing in an elevator that you can see out of, a black box. And imagine the cable is cut and you and the elevator begin to fall.\n","198":"Explainer: So, when you say it's an inverse-square law, that means that the closer you are, the more strongly you feel the gravitational pull. And that makes sense. There's very few things that are stronger when you're further apart.\nExplainee: Yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: So, in free fall?\nExplainer: You're in total free fall. Now, because things fall at the same rate, including the elevator and you, you can actually float in the elevator. If you just floated in the elevator, the two of you would drop, and you might not even know you're falling. You could take an apple and drop it in front of you, and it would float in front of you. You would actually experience weightlessness. It's called the equivalence principle. It was Einstein's happiest thought that what you're really doing when you're experiencing gravity isn't being heavy in your chair, it's falling weightlessly in the gravitational field. And that was the first step, to think of gravity as weightlessness and falling.\n","199":"Explainer: So you can also think of a gravitational field, something that permeates all of space.

[laughs]\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Wow.\nExplainer: Wow. [Janna and Lisa laughs] Well, let's hope it doesn't happen.\n","204":"Explainer: Mm-hmm.\nExplainee: Is that an extra dimension? Does that fit into that, or is that something?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: And are each of those dimensions, are they governed by the same laws of physics, or is there like a separate Lagrangian for each universe--\nExplainer: It's a, yeah.\n","205":"Explainer: It's a, yeah.\nExplainee: [Bela] Or how does that work?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Okay.\nExplainer: Why in the world would you think that there are extra dimensions, right? So you've heard of string theory?\n","206":"Explainer: Why in the world would you think that there are extra dimensions, right? So you've heard of string theory?\nExplainee: I have. So string theory is basically a theory of quantum gravity.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Right.\nExplainer: That's the good news. The bad news is that it only seems to work if spacetime is ten dimensional. [chuckles] So you would say well then it's wrong. It can't be right. Spacetime is not ten-dimensional. Spacetime is four dimensional. We've observed that. But instead, we say if spacetime looks four dimensional to us, but string theory, which might be the best theory we have of quantum gravity says it must be ten dimensional, maybe we can hide those extra six dimensions somehow. So here's how we could get lucky. We could imagine that there are extra dimensions of space that are curled up somehow that are so small that we can't see them. This is actually an old idea. It goes back to Kaluza and Klein right after general relativity was invented in 1915. But there's a more recent idea that says there could actually be relatively large extra dimensions. There could be extra dimensions that are actually that big, like a millimeter across that you would not have noticed. But here's the new, exciting idea. So let's imagine, okay. This is a piece of paper. But let's imagine this is our entire world. So, in other words, our real world is three dimensional, but let's imagine that we're just idealizing it down to two dimensions, so we all live here. You and I live here. But let's imagine that we're embedded in this bigger space. So there are extra dimensions that are actually big, okay? And let's imagine that. When I say we live on this three dimensional world what I mean is imagine that the particles that you and I are made of, right, the quarks, the leptons, the electrons and everything, all the forces we know about, electromagnetism, the weak nuclear force, the strong nuclear force, imagine they can't leave this surface. This is what we call a brane. B-R-A-N-E. Have you heard this word before?\n","207":"Explainer: Mm-hmm. So we have quantum mechanics, right? The theory of atoms and so forth and how those work, and then we have gravity, and gravity doesn't seem to fit in. It's the one force of nature that we can't really easily fit into this quantum mechanical framework, so string theory is one of the best ideas.\nExplainee: Right.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: I've heard it, yeah.\nExplainer: [Sean] Do you know where it comes from?\n","208":"Explainer: [Sean] Do you know where it comes from?\nExplainee: No.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Right.\nExplainer: If you have a two dimensional surface that vibrates and is a physical thing, we call that a membrane. Membrane theory goes back, it never was as popular as string theory, but it's been around for a while. But if you had extra dimensions of space, then you can three dimensional vibrating things, and four dimensional vibrating things.\n","209":"Explainer: From membranes, you know. We have lines, one dimension. We have two dimensional surfaces. So if you have a line that is a vibrating physical thing, you call it a string, right?\nExplainee: Right.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: So how do these strings give rise to things like mass and charge, and basically give us the properties of the particles that we see?\nExplainer: Well basically the strings are the particles that we see. It's exactly the same thing as we said for the straw, if you look at it far away it looks one dimensional. A little loop of string, so a little one dimensional circle that is vibrating. If you look at it from very, very far away, it just looks like a particle. So in string theory, an electron is a little string. A photon is a little string.\n","210":"Explainer: If you have a two dimensional surface that vibrates and is a physical thing, we call that a membrane.

Is it supposed to be the last thing that sort of unifies all the forces together?\nExplainer: Yes, string theory's even better. So the phrase Grand Unified Theory was coined in the 1970s for theories that joined electricity and magnetism. So a good string theory is gravity plus the Grand Unified Theory.\n","211":"Explainer: Yes, string theory's even better.

So a brane is a higher dimensional object that vibrates through space.\nExplainer: That's right. And we could live there. The world we see around us, the three dimensions of space around us could reflect the fact that we are somehow stuck on a three dimensional brane trying to escape.\n","212":"Explainer: [Bettina] Have you ever heard of blockchain?\nExplainee: I have. Whenever we have a transaction, and let's say I buy something from you, this information gets logged. And it gets verified by a third person or third party. And then if like all this information verified and it all matches, right, the transaction goes through without any intermediary basically, right? It gets stored, and when you make further transactions, this information is ready, embedded. It's in the ledger.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Absolutely. The way the technology's changing, nothing's gonna be like it used to be. And there's no like firm, and then the buyer and the seller, it basically, we'll have to rewrite a lot of rules in economics as well.\nExplainer: For sure. A lot of the assumptions won't hold true.\n","213":"Explainer: Same with, who are the actors? It's not just people anymore. It's machines.\nExplainee: [Valentinas] Absolutely.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: So at least when we talk about Bitcoin, there are some trust issues and some hacks. So there's obviously a need to work on trust and feeling that it's a safe technology.\nExplainer: Yeah. One of the problems that Bitcoin has faced is Bitcoins getting stolen or lost. But a lot of that actually comes from people trying to recentralize Bitcoin in different ways making themselves actually a pretty easy target.\n","214":"Explainer: We're gonna have to create entire new concepts of how they do trade and how they work with us, too.

Right?\nExplainer: Yeah. To actually transition into the mainstream and make it useful for average people to use, we're going to need to make sure we have a lot more education, a lot more standards and probably work with a lot of enterprises to create sort of a user experience around this being a technology that is safe and usable and understandable.

It must be used almost everywhere to where we won't even imagine how we lived without it. But I'm not sure where it's going to go. I mean, no one really knows, right.\nExplainer: Well, we have a lot of public blockchains. Like we have Bitcoin. We have the Ethereum network and XT, but a lot of companies and consortiums are getting together to build private blockchains, so ones that are more closed off at first and then may evolve into a public network where people feel comfortable using it. And some are also proof of concept out in the real world, projects in energy and in pharmaceuticals and in retail and lots of different fields are starting experiments. And we'll see in the next few years how all of those interact and what we learn about the best use cases for blockchain and what it means for trade.\n","216":"Explainer: Yeah.

And so carbon anodes and graphene are really good at adding conductivity to batteries. And then in the subsequent years, nanomaterials have been really interesting from things like incorporating sensors into batteries, to increasing the functionality of batteries, having some responsive materials that use things like graphene sheets that are incorporated into a matrix, and then you add a safety functionality to a battery. We're trying to squeeze out almost all the functionality that we can. And as new nano materials are being discovered and there're new properties being discovered, a lot of the time that someone tries to think of a way to translate that into a battery.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: I think every step of a process in a battery is something where you have to think about how would this translate to making a battery in terms of the production? One thing that I think is very interesting about the field of nanoscale materials in general, is that how you make the material changes the properties a lot. And so we claim that this 2D material has this property, then tying that to the battery performance is something that's pretty difficult to do. It takes a few steps in between. So we have to think kind of creatively with how we can do that.\nExplainer: That's actually, I think a very common problem. We can build a device in the lab it could be a transistor, can be a battery. And then you ask the question, okay, so what's the next step? How do we take it from that lab demonstration into a technology? The kind of work that I'm very interested in is developing tools to make the exact type of materials that you want. The tools that we've used in the past for conventional fabrication just don't work with these materials because they're all grown from the bottom up. They're intrinsically small, and you have to find ways to either use chemistry or some other means to get them to assemble into the structures that you want to actually either grow specifically what you want or after you grow them, to pull out the ones that you want. You need to be able to build that same thing over and over again, with the exact same properties. No one institution, no one research lab, no one national lab is gonna solve all of these problems on their own because they are difficult problems. And there is a real important payoff at the end. And it's gonna take all of us, making our contributions to push this field forward.\n","218":"Explainer: Because the materials are so small, they're at the nanoscale, their properties are dominated by quantum mechanics, which means that even slight changes in their size, in their orientation give profound changes in their properties. And while that's very scientifically interesting, and it allows you to tune their properties by making subtle changes, from a technology point of view, it's a bit of a headache in the sense that in technology want to optimize for a property and then repeat that over and over again. So what are some of the challenges that you face in the lab related to working with these materials and then trying to incorporate them into the batteries?\nExplainee: I think every step of a process in a battery is something where you have to think about how would this translate to making a battery in terms of the production?

I've been doing origami since I was eight years old and studying the mathematics of origami ever since grad school, at least.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Why does origami lend itself to, say, this type of application?\nExplainer: Origami applications have in common, is that at some stage the thing is flat and so whenever you need to either start from a flat state and then take it to a 3D state, or conversely, for deployables like space, you want to have it in a fully folded flat state but then take it to a 3D state, or possibly an unfolded flat state. Whenever a flat state is involved, origami is a really effective way of making the transition between those states.\n","220":"Explainer: The first thing I want to show you is origami in the real world. This is the origami lamp. It comes shipped flat but it folds, clip holds it together. The lamp has LEDs on the inside so when we power it up we get light, we have a lampshade and we get the base.\nExplainee: Why does origami lend itself to, say, this type of application?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Another aspect of origami and origami mechanisms that has leant itself to many different uses is the fact that it's scalable. When you have an origami crease pattern like the Miura-Ori used in solar panel deployment, the type of motion that you see happening here will happen whether this is on a piece of paper that's small like this, or on a larger scale, or even on a smaller, smaller, smaller, smaller scale. Engineers, in particular robotics engineers, are turning to origami toward designing mechanisms that will either be really big or really, really small. This looks like the most promising way of getting nano robotics to work.\nExplainer: This is another real-world application but this particular implementation is used to make a wheel for a Rover.\n","221":"Explainer: This is another real-world application but this particular implementation is used to make a wheel for a Rover.\nExplainee: Cool, so this is something that can actually get really, really tiny but then get big and fat and roll.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Yeah!\nExplainer: Another origami challenge that comes up with these patterns is if we're going to make an aircraft out of this thing we're going to need hundreds of yards of folded origami. We're not going to do it by hand and this might be the new frontier in origami engineering, which is the design of machines that can fold patterns that have applications.\n","222":"Explainer: New problems arise when we try to make origami out of things other than paper, but also new opportunities. An example here which is a kind of a variant of the Miura-Ori. It's got a three-dimensional structure. If I stretch it one way, it expands the other but because it has these S-bends in the pattern, if you squeeze it, it doesn't go all the way flat. This is a epoxy impregnated aramid fiber and so if I put this fold pattern into it and then compress it and then put a skin on the top and bottom, this becomes incredibly lightweight but incredibly strong.\nExplainee: Yeah!\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: So you're talking about a machine that is actually folding it into this, not just making the creases but actually folding it.\nExplainer: Yeah, so what goes in as sheet and what comes out is this, or something this wide.\n","223":"Explainer: We're gonna talk about blockchain technology.

As the distance in our trade grew, we ended up inventing institutions, right? If you Uber or you use Airbnb or you use Amazon even, these are just digital marketplaces and platforms that help us facilitate an exchange of value. But today, we actually have a technology that allows us to trade one to one but at scale, and it's called blockchain technology. There is some kind of interface for it. You could have an app, or you could use a computer to do it, but instead of there being a company in the middle that's helping you make that transaction, it's a bunch of software code.\nExplainee: Okay.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: I mean, I would assume this technology is taking away business or activity from these middlemen.\nExplainer: In some cases, yeah, it is.

A lot of people think about blockchain as Bitcoin because it's sort of in the news a lot, and it's this new cryptocurrency. And it's kind of exciting.

We mainly work on population studies. We work on thousands and even millions of population, and we use statistical modeling to find out the association between different sleep disturbances and also genetics related to sleep disturbances and link that to their risk of developing ADMPD.\nExplainer: So how strong is the link?\n","228":"Explainer: So how strong is the link?\nExplainee: Our study has found really strong associations looking at these populations, for example, with sleep apnea.

So there's beta-amyloid which accumulates in the brain, and then there's kind of these tangles, this tauopathies, right? And so it sounds like sleep seems to be related to the tauopathies. What about kind of beta-amyloid?\n","229":"Explainer: So it's interesting, so I also saw that there was also a recent meta-analysis around sleep disturbances and dementia risk, and in that study, they looked about 250,000 people in this meta-analysis, and they followed them around for 10 years, and you know, when they pulled all the samples together, they found there was a 1.2 fold increased risk for developing all caused dementia, so it sounds like both sleep apnea and then maybe sleep disturbances more generally are associated with increased risk for dementia. When I think about that, I think about how sleep lives in the brain, these neurodegenerative diseases live in the brain, and so what do we know about the causality of this? Could it be that individuals who have early onset of say, Alzheimer's, have then poor sleep kind of as a consequence of that?\nExplainee: Yeah, so I think what's really fascinating is all these bio-directional relationships that's being identified in animal studies especially, showing that sleep changes actually occur very early on in the disease process, so it could be a prodromal stage of Parkinson's, and also in transgenic model of AD, they're already showing a lot of circadian abnormalities in this mouse.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Yes, in the transgenic mouse models of AD, including those expressing human mutant amyloid precursor protein, APP type or both, so that's kind of showing the sleep changes in both of these pathologies.\nExplainer: Okay, so there is this bio-directional piece, but I think perhaps the most exciting thing that happened in the sleep field, at least in my view, has been understanding the role of sleep and its clearance of beta-amyloid in the brain. This idea that sleep is kind of the dishwasher of the brain, it seems like, that you know A betta accumulates as we kind of use energy, and you know it's kind of a waste product, and the idea that if you don't clear it out, that it's going to build up and accumulate.\n","230":"Explainer: So within dementia risk in particular, Alzheimer's for instance, there are kind of two clear features that seem to be part of the pathology, right?

There's a fifth circle, which is like that, but does the crane have a fifth flap in it? Let's refold it and put the wings up. Well, yes, there is, there's another point and that point is the fifth circle of our crane.\n","234":"Explainer: Yeah, exactly. Actually you've discovered something pretty neat because you made your point not from a corner so you've already discovered one of the key insights. Any flap, any point, leg of the ant, takes up a circular region of paper. Here's our boundary. To make your point from an edge you use that much paper and the shape, it's almost a circle. If we take the crane we'll see if the circles are visible in the crane pattern. Here's the crane pattern, and here's a boundary of the wing, and here's the other wing.\nExplainee: Okay.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Okay.\nExplainer: And to do that we use a new technique called circle packing in which all of the long features of the design are represented by circles. So, each leg becomes a circle, each wing becomes a circle and things that can be big and thick, like the head or the abdomen, can be points in the middle. Now we have the basic idea of how to design the pattern, we just count the number of legs we want. We want a spider, if it's got let's say eight legs, it's also got an abdomen, that's another point, and it's got a head, so maybe that's 10 points. If we find an arrangement of 10 circles we should be able to fold that into the spider. So in this book, Origami Insects II, it's one of my books and has some patterns, and this is one of them for a flying ladybug and, in fact, it is exactly this flying ladybug. We've got the crease pattern here in the circles and you might now be able to see which circles end up as which parts, knowing that the largest features like the wings are going to be the largest circles, smaller points will be smaller circles.

So we think that that's a great place to think about making materials on the nano scale and manipulating materials on the nano scale, and wiring them together as well. This abalone shell, you can see the exquisite beautiful colors and structures of it. This is a nano composite material. If you take this and fracture it, and you look at it in a scanning electron microscope, what you'll see is that it's made out of these beautiful tablets. And I studied that as a graduate student. I looked at that and I said, that is completely amazing. You have an organism in the ocean, that takes what's in its environment, which is calcium and carbonate. That's dissolved in the water and templates it into this really exquisite structure. And so you think that's great. Calcium carbonate is great, but what if we wanted to make a solar cell or a another electronic device or a battery, how would you get an organism to do that? And you say, okay, that's a really crazy idea. But is it really that crazy if this abalone, already figured out how to do it, 500 million years ago? So we're saying, okay, abalones build shells. Can viruses build solar cells, can viruses build catalysts? Can they build batteries using the same kind of idea?\nExplainer: It's really fascinating work, especially now we're all familiar with the viruses and how they act. And I'm not aware of any viruses that build nanostructures. So how did you come to that? And then how do you actually program a virus to do your bidding?\n","238":"Explainer: I remember reading your papers when I was a student and we're all trying to create these materials and finding ways to exploit their properties. What I love, and I'm delighted that you're here to talk to us about is how you took inspiration from nature and sort of recognize that nature's figured out a way to both synthesize incredibly complex nanostructures with high functionality and how you sort of were inspired by that to do the research that you're doing now.\nExplainee: Life gave us this toolkit that is already on the nanoscale. So we think that that's a great place to think about making materials on the nano scale and manipulating materials on the nano scale, and wiring them together as well. This abalone shell, you can see the exquisite beautiful colors and structures of it. This is a nano composite material. If you take this and fracture it, and you look at it in a scanning electron microscope, what you'll see is that it's made out of these beautiful tablets. And I studied that as a graduate student. I looked at that and I said, that is completely amazing. You have an organism in the ocean, that takes what's in its environment, which is calcium and carbonate. That's dissolved in the water and templates it into this really exquisite structure. And so you think that's great. Calcium carbonate is great, but what if we wanted to make a solar cell or a another electronic device or a battery, how would you get an organism to do that? And you say, okay, that's a really crazy idea. But is it really that crazy if this abalone, already figured out how to do it, 500 million years ago? So we're saying, okay, abalones build shells. Can viruses build solar cells, can viruses build catalysts? Can they build batteries using the same kind of idea?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: We work on something called bacteriophages, it's a virus with DNA. This particular bacteriophage called M13 bacteriophage is made up of single stranded DNA and proteins. It's long and thin. So it's 880 nanometers in length, and it's about 9 nanometers in diameter. And so one of the reasons I love it is it spans the nanoscale and almost the micron scale at the same time. Take the single strand DNAs, obviously a model, and you can cut it with molecular scissors. And you can put a new piece of DNA in between. And so you put a small piece of DNA in there that doesn't belong there. And that piece of DNA is going to randomly code for a protein. Now, the next time that that virus is replicated within a bacterial host, it'll be able to put a new protein sequence on the coat, just a short protein sequence on the coat, maybe like 8 or 12 amino acids in length. And just like that abalone is going to grab calcium and build calcium carbonate. We're going to have our viruses build iron phosphate for a battery electrode material or Gallium arsenide or cad sulfide for a semiconductor material.\nExplainer: So you've evolved, and I suppose, trained these viruses to build the materials that you want them to build by exposing them to the raw materials and then evolving their function. We're talking about the electronics from nanomaterials. That critical issue that we're facing is how do you go from those single experiments with a single material, understanding its properties, how do you scale that to the billions of devices that you need in a technology? It is a chemistry driven approach. We're not going to grow them exactly where we want them, but to take that one step, and to tie into what you're doing, tt sounds like there could be an area of collaboration where instead of using conventional chemistry, that we can train some of these biological elements to do that work work for us.\n","239":"Explainer: It's really fascinating work, especially now we're all familiar with the viruses and how they act.

Molecules, proteins, and DNA work with all the same kinds of bonding and things that the chemicals that you're gonna be looking for in these processes. It's put together in a way that when a protein or enzyme folds, it almost always folds correctly. That's kind of the beauty of it, the predictable aspect of it encoded in its DNA. If we need to make it the same over and over again, then as long as you have the right DNA sequence, DNA is a beautiful structure on the nanoscale. And there's really, really cool, incredible work on DNA origami, when DNA can fold into just the right structure. And so I can see that as an interface, that would be really cool and interesting in your work. And you can have the virus make the DNA for the DNA origami, and then you use DNA to assemble your beautiful structures.\nExplainer: It's really fascinating. You have all these little worker viruses building the materials for you. How are you then applying these materials that you're building?\n","240":"Explainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Right.\nExplainer: Telescopes, solar arrays, they need to be packed into a rocket, go up, but then expand in a very controlled, deterministic way when they get up into space.\n","241":"Explainer: Whenever there's a part of a spacecraft that is shaped somewhat like paper, meaning it's big and flat, we can use folding mechanisms from origami to make it smaller.\nExplainee: Right.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Okay.\nExplainer: These are the building blocks of many, many origami deployable shapes, it's called a degree-4 vertex. It's the number of lines. So in this case, we use solid lines for mountain, we use dash lines for valley. We're going to fold it and use these two to illustrate some important properties of origami mechanisms. It's important in the study of mechanisms to take into account the rigidity. So what we're going to do to help simulate rigidity is to take these rectangles and we're going to fold them over and over so that they just become stiff and rigid.\n","242":"Explainer: Telescopes, solar arrays, they need to be packed into a rocket, go up, but then expand in a very controlled, deterministic way when they get up into space.\nExplainee: Okay.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: [Grad Student] Okay.\nExplainer: So this is what's called a single degree of freedom mechanism. You have one degree of freedom, I can choose this fold, and then if these are perfectly rigid every other fold angle is fully determined. One of the key behaviors here is that with the smaller angles up here, the two folds that are the same parity and the folds that are of opposite parity move at about the same rate but with this, as we're getting closer to 90 degrees, we find they move at very different rates and then at the end of the motion, the opposite happens. This one is almost folded but this one goes through a much larger motion so the relative speeds differ.\n","243":"Explainer: These are the building blocks of many, many origami deployable shapes, it's called a degree-4 vertex.

So, these are examples of a pattern called the Miura-Ori. When you stretch them out they're pretty big.\n","244":"Explainer: So this is what's called a single degree of freedom mechanism.

What sort of angle would you want so that they open up the same rate?\nExplainer: Infinitesimally small.\n","246":"Explainer: So, sadly, the only way to get them at exactly the same rate is when these are microscopic slivers and then that's not useful.\nExplainee: For sure, right, right.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: So, it's kind of a trade-off?\nExplainer: There's an engineering trade-off to get them both to work. And there's another place that shows up in deployable structures in a very cool structure. This is a folded tube, it sort of pops out like this but it has this neat property that if you twist it quickly, it changes color. There's a Mars Rover application where they need a sleeve that protects a drill and as the drill goes down, the sleeve is going to collapse and they're using a pattern very much like this.\n","247":"Explainer: And it's exactly the difference between the motions of these two vertices. So these angles are closer to right angles and the closer you get to a right angle the more asymmetry there is between the two directions of motion. And then the other difference is how efficiently they pack, so these started at about the same size but when they're flat notice that yours is much more compact. So if I were you making a solar array, I'd say, oh, I want that one. But if I say, well, I want them to open at the same rate, then I want this one.\nExplainee: So, it's kind of a trade-off?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Interesting.\nExplainer: There are many open mathematical questions and so room for mathematicians, like yourself, to have a big impact on the world of origami and mechanisms. And even though those studies are mathematically interesting, they're going to also have real-world applications in space, solar arrays, drills, telescopes, and more. Any questions or thoughts about this?\n","248":"Explainer: There's an engineering trade-off to get them both to work.

Its like a video game except it feels like you're in the video game.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Or in Minecraft.\nExplainer: Yeah, or in Minecraft. When you look at a TV on the wall there showing like a picture of a mountain or something, how can you tell that its not just a window and there's something else behind it. Because it always doesn't look quite right if you have a static picture of a person on a screen and you move around like this, its not really changing. And its interesting, those are things we have to figure out We need to figure out when you look at something in reality how can you tell whether its real or not. Have you been to a 3-D movie where you put on the little glasses?\n","250":"Explainer: That's actually a really good description. The idea is that if you've got a system here that can make you see whatever we want you to see, then we can make you believe that you're anywhere else, like on top of a mountain, or in a dungeon or under the ocean.\nExplainee: Or in Minecraft.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Yeah.\nExplainer: So what they do, the trick for that is, if you ever at a theater and you take up the glasses and you look at it, you'll see its blurry where there's actually two pictures that they're showing at the same time. And what those little glasses do, is they let one eye see one picture, and the other eye see a different picture. So then your eyes can say, oh it looks like I'm seeing through the screen or something is floating out in front of it. In the VR headsets, what we do is, there's actually either two screens or one screen split in half, so that it draws a different picture, completely different picture, for each eye. And we make sure that each eye can only see the picture it intended to. And that's what can make things feel like they got this real depth to them, that its something that you could reach out and touch and it doesn't feel like a flat TV screen.\n","251":"Explainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Mm-hmm.\nExplainer: Okay, that's great. On one side, we have a lot of the notes which make us feel brighter, you know, like these kinds of, (keyboard music) these really bright sounds.

Exactly. We're gonna build a little two dimensional space. You wanna do it? You wanna do the honors here? Why don't you put those two lines together?\n","258":"Explainer: We need one number to tell you where we are. That's one dimension. That's what it means to be one dimensional.

So to me, machine learning is essentially exactly what it sounds like. It's trying to teach a machine specifics about something by inputting a lot of data points and slowly, the machine will build up knowledge about it over time. For example, my Gmail program, I assume that there would be a lot of, like, machine learning models happening at once, right?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: I'd probably look at certain keywords. Maybe if the recipient and the sender had exchanged emails before and generally, those fell into in the past.\nExplainer: So these are things we would call features. And we go through a process where we do feature engineering, where somebody looks at the example and says, Okay, these are the things that I think might allow us to statistically tell the difference from something in one category versus another. So for example, perhaps you don't speak Russian, you start getting a lot of email in Russian.\n","262":"Explainer: Absolutely. And that's a great example because you have models that are operating to do things like figure out if a new email is spam or not. So what would you think about if you were looking at an email and trying to decide if it went in one category or another?\nExplainee: I'd probably look at certain keywords. Maybe if the recipient and the sender had exchanged emails before and generally, those fell into in the past.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Obviously, like the features that you just described are features which a person would have had to think about. Are there features which, like, the machine itself could learn?\nExplainer: This is a great question because it really gets to the difference between some of our different tools in our machine learning tool belt in addressing problems like this. So if we were to use a supervised learning classic classification approach, a person would need to think about those features and creatively come up with them in approach we call the kitchen sink approach, which is just try everything you can possibly think of and see what works. Unsupervised learning, where we don't have labeled data and we're trying to infer some structure out of the data is you're projecting that data into a space and looking for things like clusters. And there's a bunch of really fun math about how you do that, how you think about distance and by distance, I mean that if we have two data points in space, how do we decide if they're similar or not?\n","263":"Explainer: So these are things we would call features.

Unsupervised learning, we don't necessarily have those labels. That's the thing we're trying to discover. So reinforcement learning is another technique that we use sometimes. You can think about it like a turn in a game and you can play, you know, millions and millions of trials so that you're able to develop a system that by experimenting with reinforcement learning can eventually learn to play these games pretty successfully.

And it actually comes historically from trying to train a robot to navigate a room. If it bonks into this chair, it can't go forward anymore.

It actually was very accurate, but it wasn't useful because nobody knew why the prediction was what it was. So they could say, you know, Sunny, you're likely to quit next month.

We can't stay in the visual.\n","277":"Explainer: And that's, like you said, we're stuck a little bit, we're not up to that kind of acceleration, so that would be a Nobel Prize winning possible idea.\nExplainee: Absolutely.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: So actually there's a potential ways of doing it with optical or near optical radiation. And there's been a lot of work done in the defense department and so on, how do I combine laser beams together?\nExplainer: Okay.\n","278":"Explainer: Okay.\nExplainee: And make them act as one coherent source. So one of the things that we'll be doing with our two petawatts, we're going to see if we can actually combine them into a 50. If you can do that, you can begin to imagine doing this with many lasers. Many petawatt lasers of the scale we're talking about. So one could possibly see an exawatt from that. People have been able to combine 10s of lasers together for a coherent source so you have to be able to phase lock them, you have to be able to make their phases be exactly connected and related and be able, as they propagate through all the different optical components, whatever it may be--\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: So that's right so you have to have the aperture size, you have to have them phase locked across the entire aperture. Which will be a great challenge and people have done it, again, with small lasers. The lasers we'll be trying to do is about a 40cm aperture. So we'll begin to start looking at this. And actually wavelength control and then be able to adaptive optics other ways which you can control the uniformity of the phase is something that's been developed in lots of ways now. For defense applications, for science applications. So we will do our best to make use of all these technologies. Lasers I think have progressed so much. Just like the semi conductor did, 'cos there's such a market for it, there were so many different applications for that.\nExplainer: Okay so there's a lot of us working around the world on these high intensity lasers and so, what do you think the real fun is? What do you see the real excitement being?\n","279":"Explainer: And right across the beam. Don't you think that's gonna be the challenge? 'Cos it's not like our beams are as perfect as we like to think they are.\nExplainee: So that's right so you have to have the aperture size, you have to have them phase locked across the entire aperture.

We already got light. Now we can't live without lasers. My cell phone, that is in my pocket, has billions of transistors. How is that made? With lasers. All of the greatest circuitry is done with lasers. Actually now it's using x-rays, made from laser heated matter. That came out of the laser fusion program.\nExplainer: So it is amazing, the parallels. And optics is used everywhere. We're gonna possibly take over from CERN, we'll just do high energy physics with lasers, we're looking at gravity waves with lasers, we wanna do black holes with lasers, we wanna machine with lasers, we wanna do medicine with lasers. It's everywhere. And now, with the Nobel prize, people are hearing more about it so they know lasers are everywhere.\n","280":"Explainer: Have you heard of the breach of Target where they were breached many years ago and their point of sale systems were hacked?\nExplainee: Yes, I heard about that.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: I've heard about similar attacks in hospitals using hospital equipment, but I'm surprised that something as simple as a meat scale would have been used in such an attack. We discussed it in class as how hackers look at some of the weakest links in these large networks and use those to tap into networks.\nExplainer: Yeah, that's another interesting concept. It's really just different layers that we have for protection, because often when you're talking about something like a corporate network, or even your home network, you typically have sort of one level of defense, right? If someone can break that or it can get in through some other system that is connected or exposes some other protocol, like Bluetooth, right? You can connect to a Bluetooth device without being on the wireless network, without being on the LAN. That potentially gives you another place that you can pivot on and then access other devices, because if something has both Bluetooth and also Wi-Fi, well, if you can get in through Bluetooth, then you can then access the Wi-Fi and get to other devices on the network. Are you familiar with buffer overflows?\n","281":"Explainer: So where people are swiping credit cards, those credit card numbers were stolen. They hired a company to come in and perform a penetration test to see, can the good guys essentially break in again to prevent this sort of thing in the future? And when this team came in, they found they actually were able to get pretty much to the same point of sale system, and the way they did that was by exploiting an internet-connected deli meat scale. Once the company was able to essentially get into the deli scale, because the deli scale was on the internal network, then they were able to really escalate privilege and find a vulnerability within another system. Essentially, that just got them into the network. and once you're in the network, it's often really easy to then escalate from there.\nExplainee: I've heard about similar attacks in hospitals using hospital equipment, but I'm surprised that something as simple as a meat scale would have been used in such an attack. We discussed it in class as how hackers look at some of the weakest links in these large networks and use those to tap into networks.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: No, I am not familiar with that.\nExplainer: If we were to write a program that asked for your name and you typed in your name, but before you could type in your name, in a low leveling, which is like C or C++, you'd have to allocate some memory. So you might allocate a buffer of a hundred bytes because whose name is going to be longer than a hundred bytes or a hundred character? But what happens if you were to not really check that they limited to a hundred bytes? Do you know what happens if they essentially start typing over that hundred bytes?\n","282":"Explainer: Yeah, that's another interesting concept.

Are you familiar with buffer overflows?\nExplainee: No, I am not familiar with that.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: In that case, it would be an error for accessing invalid memory.\nExplainer: Absolutely, you would essentially cause a segmentation fault.\n","283":"Explainer: Absolutely, you would essentially cause a segmentation fault.\nExplainee: Yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: So how does the buffer overloading relate to what you are doing in terms of network security or designing software for penetration testing?\nExplainer: Ever since buffer overflow started many years ago, there been a lot of protection mechanisms built to make it difficult to exploit. More and more, we're actually using smaller and smaller computers with smaller amounts of compute power. If you take a car, you have hundreds of microcontrollers that are all running there. So they don't really have a sophisticated operating system that can try to prevent attacks like buffer overflows. So how do we keep these low cost computers in here while adding layers of protection to prevent malice and these types of attacks? Sometimes it actually is, how can we write software or how can we build a system that prevents these types of attacks from entering? But oftentimes, it's really looking for how can we find new attacks that we haven't even necessarily thought of? What got you interested in computer science and information security?\n","284":"Explainer: But what's really cool about that is, when you're going into memory, you're starting to cross over that boundary of that hundred byte allocation, and now you're starting to write over additional memory. That other memory is really important stuff. So you have your name, the hundred bytes there, and then right next to your name is the return address, and that's the address that the code is gonna execute and it's going to return to after that function is done, and it's going to jump to that address, but after you type your hundred bytes, the next few bites that you type, you're actually going to overwrite that return address. So that return address could essentially be another address in memory. So what you end up doing is you type a name and it's not really a name, it's really just code. And that code, you keep typing until you get to the return address, and you start typing an address, which is really the beginning of your name and your computer or your processor is actually going to read that address and it will jump back to the beginning and then execute that payload. So that was sort of the very first thing that I think was super exciting to me when I started learning about really reverse engineering.\nExplainee: So how does the buffer overloading relate to what you are doing in terms of network security or designing software for penetration testing?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: I got interested in cybersecurity because I'm really into global affairs, global politics, and you often hear in the news about the rising power of China, the rising power of Iran.

They have essentially censored internet. In the US, we have a really interesting internal struggle here where we actually have government agencies like the state department that are funding software to evade censorship, like Tor and other mechanisms.

We should know how to control it.\nExplainer: It's good for us to understand how these systems can really break down. Although, I think one thing that I see is that some of, let's say, the organizations that are looking to break this are not necessarily going to share once they actually learn that information.

So what do you think about lasers?\nExplainee: I don't know--\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: No.\nExplainer: Well one of the fun things people do with lasers, the cat will try to grab that dot. I'm sure what you have at home is a flashlight. I brought a cute little one. So the question is, do you see any difference between what a flashlight does and what a laser does?\n","288":"Explainer: You haven't got to play with lasers. So I brought one.

Do you ever use a laser as a cat toy?\nExplainee: No.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Flashlight is a bigger shine and the laser is just a dot.\nExplainer: That's true, that laser's just a dot. And so the other thing to notice though is that, like if I shine it in your eyes and I'm sorry if I do! But it seems awfully bright doesn't it? And yet when, you know, you shine this down and you put the laser, which one do you see easier?\n","289":"Explainer: [Donna] And yet it's not. Isn't that amazing?\nExplainee: Yes.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Yes.\nExplainer: And that's because the light will go through this glass and, when it hits that corner, it has to bend.

When they light up the sky with lasers, it's almost like fireworks.\nExplainee: Well I saw a shooting star before.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Yes they're very cool. I like the one where you did the green one.\nExplainer: The green one. And the next time you go to a grocery store, take a peek at the red.\n","294":"Explainer: Have you done any work in side channel analysis?\nExplainee: Like, a little bit. I read the Rowhammer paper. I found it really interesting, but it's nothing that I've actually worked with.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: So all memory devices are just, it's just a bunch of gates and they're in rows. They basically all hold different pieces of memory. That's all the gates are. Either they're turned on or they're turned off. So what Rowhammer found was they tested a bunch of different memory devices and found that by doing a certain order of storing things, and then pulling that information back in a certain way in one place would actually flip gates in a different place. So you could actually do a bunch of things to a piece of memory that had nothing to do with something that may be critical in a different place and actually change its contents, and that obviously exposes all sorts of security issues, because that's very hard to predict.\nExplainer: Yeah, I suppose the physical adjacency of the underlying transistors and capacitors that are holding that storage. That's crazy. I think the first time I heard of an interesting attack like that was learning about the cold boot attack. Being able to, you know, someone enters their password on their computer and that decrypts their hard drive and then they walk away. Being able to extract that password is really difficult. If I can pull that memory chip out and extract that memory, put it in my own device, except the problem is memory is volatile, so it'll erase as soon as I pull it out. You can take something like canned air, turn it upside down, cool that computer, make it real nice and cool. Then you have a minute or two to pull out the memory, put into your own device, extract the memory, and then you're good. It's such a simple method to really extract something kind of critical. Like Rowhammer, it's such a low level of vulnerability and you could argue that it's not necessarily a vulnerability in the architecture itself, but rather exploitation of physics at that point.\n","295":"Explainer: So the side channel analysis is really looking not at a vulnerability within a system, but really unintended consequences of what the system is built on. A very simple example of a side channel is putting your ear to the ground to hear if there are horses coming towards you, and the same thing applies to technology. So you can have something like a CPU, it's executing instructions, certain instructions that use a little bit more power, and power is reserved in these capacitors, which are like tiny batteries next to your CPU. And as they're pulling power, there's something in physics called the electrostrictive effect where the capacitor will move in a very, very tiny amount. And then although we can't hear it, the microphone on a mobile device can actually listen to that. If you then listen to that and you say, oh, I see a pattern here, and you can go all the way down and then extract and reveal the full password, the full key, even though it could be argued that the algorithm itself, there's no problem with it.\nExplainee: So all memory devices are just, it's just a bunch of gates and they're in rows.

Over the last year while I was doing some other stuff, I actually designed some microcontroller boards for a company that was doing stuff with, like, a smart watering project. The problems with updating is just, like, that scares me the most. Like, people don't update their own stuff, let alone these, like, devices.\nExplainer: I keep forgetting to update my fridge.\n","296":"Explainer: That's pretty challenging if you want to use wireless, right? If you wanna use a wireless router.\nExplainee: Yeah, I mean, there's obviously essentials, but yeah, no matter what, you can't really avoid any of this.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Oh yeah, for sure. When people find vulnerabilities, I think it's their duty to release those to the public.\nExplainer: Especially now that we're seeing more and more companies who are trying to make it illegal for you to inspect the vehicle that you've purchased, right? Something that you actually own.\n","297":"Explainer: The risk right now, just during this quarantine, is actually massive now that we think about it, because you might have these legacy systems. You know, they were built 20, 30 years ago, and it's too costly to upgrade, but now you can't actually have a lot of people in a single location, so potentially, they actually do have to now add some sort of remote capabilities to these systems that were never meant to be on the internet. Have you ever had any ethical concerns with the stuff you're interested in or the work you do?\nExplainee: Oh yeah, for sure. When people find vulnerabilities, I think it's their duty to release those to the public.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Yeah, I think that's nuts. I'm firmly against that for sure.\nExplainer: What if it were illegal? Would you then do it? Fortunately it's not today, right?

We have a lot of banks.\nExplainee: Yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: So how does it work?\nExplainer: It's basically a network of computers that all have the same history of transactions. And so instead of sort of there being one company with one database that holds all the information, the same sort of list is held by all these different people.

I got an engineering physics degree. There you go, something in common. We're here today talking about lasers. So have you have had much exposure to lasers yet at school?\nExplainee: Not yet. I'm really hoping that we will. I think it's super interesting just the field in general because I really do enjoy examining all the calculations and being able to do a little bit more of the math side of physics.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Vaguely.\nExplainer: Well I brought a little bit of a prop to explain how chirped pulse amplification works. Our short pulses are made of different colors. So I've got a colored slinky here. We probably could've called it stretched pulse amplification but that's kind of boring so we used the word chirped. The word chirped comes around because birds chirp. When the birds are singing, the notes are actually changing audio frequency with time and that's a chirp. The point is is that when all the light is squeezed together like this, it's a short pulse. And that's when it's a hammer because all of the light is now concentrated and you can imagine if this was coming along and also using a lens to focus it small, then all of that light at the focal spot, concentrate. And so that was the laser hammer. So we can't have that in the laser. So the question is what could we do? The fact that it's different colors and different colors because of dispersion, travel different speeds inside material. So we used a long fiber, 1.4 kilometers of fiber but, in fiber, the red colors really haven't got that much in common with the glass atoms and so they spend very little time interacting and they travel fast. The red is going to start traveling faster than the green, faster than the blue and, as you travel down the fiber, next thing you know, you have a long pulse and it's chirped from red at the beginning to blue at the back. And so the frequencies go hoo! Like this okay? So this is a chirped pulse and now it's a long pulse. And so, first this is what we did, we chirped it, we stretched it, then we can safely amplify it because it's not all concentrated and, after we amplify it, then we use something called a compressor and we put all of the colors back together and it was back being a short pulse but a high energy pulse. And then we really had what I like to call a laser hammer. When this laser pulse goes inside, it smacks those electrons right off the atom.\n","304":"Explainer: Okay. As opposed to the experimental side and seeing things? Okay so I'm much more, I like to see the things happening. So then the question is, what's so special about making a light that's intense enough to actually possibly blow things up? Certainly we can blow atoms up with the laser hammer and when the laser light comes in and just smacks the electrons right off the atom. And so the question really is how do you make that? Back in the 70s and into the 80s, I know that was a long time ago for you, we had big energy lasers and we had short pulse lasers, we couldn't have big energy, short pulse lasers and actually it was my supervisor and I that figured the way around that and we got something called chirped pulse amplification. Have you heard of chirped pulse amplification by any chance?\nExplainee: Vaguely.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: So the laser hammer that you were describing with other types of lasers and the one in the chirped is it still the same premise?\nExplainer: Well a lot of lasers and when lasers first came along, they were only single color. Your cat toy, would only be a single color, probably a red one and so that's just one color. And one color means that it has to really be there for the whole time. One color is one wave length of light and so it's just one wave that goes on and on and on. If you want a short pulse, you actually have to have all the colors. And if you can imagine that one point in time, and I like to say it's like a conductor of an orchestra. When you're listening to an orchestra warm up, they sound terrible, they're all playing their own notes. But when the conductor conducts them, they all play different notes but, together, it's beautiful music. So we have something in the laser called a mode locker and it's like the conductor and it says go now. And all the colors will start together but some colors are long wave length and others are shorter. So next thing you know, you have peaks meeting valleys and they cancel each other. And the more colors you can bring in, the faster that happens and the shorter the pulse you can make.\n","305":"Explainer: Well I brought a little bit of a prop to explain how chirped pulse amplification works.

When this laser pulse goes inside, it smacks those electrons right off the atom.\nExplainee: So the laser hammer that you were describing with other types of lasers and the one in the chirped is it still the same premise?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: What's the pendant?\nExplainer: The necklace is something that was designed for my Nobel prize. It's sold at the Nobel museum and it is a chirped pulse. So we've been talking a lot about lasers and applications, what have you learned about chirped pulses?\n","306":"Explainer: Well a lot of lasers and when lasers first came along, they were only single color. Your cat toy, would only be a single color, probably a red one and so that's just one color. And one color means that it has to really be there for the whole time. One color is one wave length of light and so it's just one wave that goes on and on and on. If you want a short pulse, you actually have to have all the colors. And if you can imagine that one point in time, and I like to say it's like a conductor of an orchestra. When you're listening to an orchestra warm up, they sound terrible, they're all playing their own notes. But when the conductor conducts them, they all play different notes but, together, it's beautiful music. So we have something in the laser called a mode locker and it's like the conductor and it says go now. And all the colors will start together but some colors are long wave length and others are shorter. So next thing you know, you have peaks meeting valleys and they cancel each other. And the more colors you can bring in, the faster that happens and the shorter the pulse you can make.\nExplainee: What's the pendant?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: I learned that it all stretches, which is super cool, because red moves the fastest and so it kinda tugs around blue. It really threw me off just how fast. It's hard to imagine things happening that fast. And I also learned how many of the things that I know are lasers. Like how many of the things that I've been looking for, like, the answers to, it is in lasers.\n","307":"Explainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Only until I started listening to singing, like barbershop quartet, and, and as I was a violinist as well--\nExplainer: Right.\n","308":"Explainer: Right.\nExplainee: Then I finally understood the idea where the overtone series came from that if a bunch of singers were to nail a chord or have it perfectly tuned, the overtones, you would hear a tone that necessarily wasn't being produced by one the singers.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Yeah.\nExplainer: I think that people forget that you can work with the notes you already have by just rearranging them, just the simple idea of inversion, inversion of the simple triad, of F major. \u266aI once was lost and now I'm found \u266a \u266a Was blind \u266a \u266a But now I see \u266a Now how home do I want to go here, you know? Is there another verse to come?\n","309":"Explainer: Yeah. The amazing thing about harmony is that it exists in nature. So, take the harmonic series of the note F, for example. Okay. You have the ups on the fifth and the fourth and then the, (hums) That seemed a little bit sharp, but that's fine. And then tones get increasingly small. Beneath that note, you have the undertone series, which essentially is like a reflection of something. In the same way that when a tree grows in nature, you have the branches which grow upwards and the roots which go downwards. So it's quite a nice thing to thing about, this being the key center, the floor, the ground, and then these two different directions of ways in which it can express itself, and the differences in the sensations with that. Lots of the time I think when it comes to reharmonization or harmonization, people think that the solution to the problems come when we add more notes.\nExplainee: Yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Right.\nExplainer: Because I can delay the gratification of going home. First of all, just by using inversions, even before we add the notes to the chord. One thing that I was very joyful to discover is that every single melody note works with every single base note.\n","310":"Explainer: I think that people forget that you can work with the notes you already have by just rearranging them, just the simple idea of inversion, inversion of the simple triad, of F major. \u266aI once was lost and now I'm found \u266a \u266a Was blind \u266a \u266a But now I see \u266a Now how home do I want to go here, you know?

(laughs) A flat soft, A flat major seven. A flat major seven sharp five, with a sharp 11. Essentially, what that demonstrates is that every note and every base note are compatible. So once we realize this its like, that's great! Now what should we do? What, how, what should we, what should we, how, what am I supposed to do? What to do, right.

The perfect and the play goal. The feeling of a minor perfect-- (keyboard music) Resolving, it's so moving, you know?

She got me my first science kit and she asked me to cure cancer and I will never forget running into my aunt's room and just opening up the box and seeing that microscope, it was a tiny little blue one and the little microscope slides and the little pipettes.

Two scientists were dissecting an eye, a cow's eye. And I was like that is the coolest thing I've ever seen. And something about that that carried me forward. Something happened so long ago, it left some long lasting trace through neural circuits and it continues to shape the decisions we make about what to study and what to do.\n","323":"Explainer: Is there any particular memory for you that you feel has been either kind of influential in your, in deciding which areas to pursue or that you feel is sort of emblematic of what it is to have a memory?\nExplainee: I was probably six years old and my aunt who had stage four ovarian cancer, she battled it for 20 years. She got me my first science kit and she asked me to cure cancer and I will never forget running into my aunt's room and just opening up the box and seeing that microscope, it was a tiny little blue one and the little microscope slides and the little pipettes. So they just, that memory will never be forgotten my whole life.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Just being able to apply those memories in the future is just so crucial in everyday life of the humans and the fact that we're learning how that works. And I would love to hear more about your side of memory and the mechanisms that you're studying.\nExplainer: So we're interested in the idea that memory is kind of a pervasive force that shapes all our behaviors. And we're trying to understand how different kinds of memory are organized in different structures of the brain. And then to understand how those different structures work together to orchestrate complex cognitive behaviors like decision-making or reasoning and thinking.\n","324":"Explainer: The best way to kind of think about that distinction really goes back historically to one of the most important discoveries in memory research. The patient was referred to famously as patient HM. The neurosurgeon went in and removed the tissue that happened to be right around the hippocampus on both the left side and the right side of HM's brain. But then they started noticing something odd in his behavior. He was not able to create new memories of the experiences he had after the surgery. And that led Brenda Milner and her colleagues to report that the hippocampus was very important for memory, but a one particular kind, these sort of explicit, or as now referred to them episodic memories. But the hippocampus was not necessary for learning skills like mirror tracing, things that you can't necessarily articulate but you just get better at over time. And it really led to a couple of decades or more even of an enormous amount of very important work that kind of kept on breaking memory down further and further into different types. Episodic and semantic as both forms of explicit memory where episodic refers to memory for an event that happened like what you did yesterday morning and semantic refers to general knowledge about the world. Implicit memory is being broken down into a bunch of different kinds like skills or habits or conditioning. And when I started graduate school, many of us felt kind of the next question was really to understand how do we now understand how they work together. This was right around when functional magnetic resonance imaging started becoming a popular tool for measuring brain activity. We could scan the entire brain and we could ask questions about multiple brain regions at once. And we discovered that what we might expect during a skill learning task that only the striatum might show activity, that we also saw the activity in the hippocampus. Or when we asked someone to form an episodic memory that we thought might depend only on the hippocampus we suddenly also saw activity in the prefrontal cortex. And so the confluence of these new ideas and questions about how different forms of memory interact together with the development of new tools for studying the human mind and brain allowed us to kind of adjust our view of memory systems, to think of them less as multiple completely separate independent systems and instead to try to understand how they really work in concert with each other and give rise to all kinds of behaviors that might not fit neatly into one category or another.\nExplainee: Are the connectivities that you're seeing using the FMRI in your studies, are they different when you look at the implicit and explicit memories? Are you seeing more activity in the striatum in comparison to the hippocampus or the prefrontal cortex?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: It's very interesting to see the imperfections of the human brain and being able to rewrite something that happened to you and fully believe it yourself. I think that that's one of the coolest errors and faults in the human brain that could exist.\nExplainer: You know I think these imperfections, I interpret them as an indication that the role of memory is much less about being accurate representation of the past and much more about being kind of a flexible compass into the future.\n","325":"Explainer: Yeah, you know things are kind of breaking down in unexpected ways I'd say. I think there's been a lot of really great work out of multiple labs showing hippocampal activity related to behaviors that don't look anything like episodic memories, but which might depend on episodic memories right? So for example also when you're making a decision about how to choose between two good options that suddenly you might see activity in the hippocampus related to the choice itself, others have found that you find activity in the hippocampus not only when people are forming memories, but also when they're imagining events that are gonna happen in the future. So it kind of forced us to rethink the way we define what the hippocampus might be doing in a way that can account for creating memories, thinking about the future, making decisions and other kinds of behaviors that involve what we would refer to you in the field as relational processing. And that raises all kinds of new questions about what memory really is. Reminiscing about our early influences that made us want to be scientists is that, you know, of course we know, we know better than to think that those are necessarily accurate memories. You know this reminds me of sort of the classic example from literature when people talk about memory of course is Marcel Proust's Madeleine in Remembrance of Things Past. Where in the book it's this taste for the, for the protagonist this taste of the crumbs of the Madeleine cookie and the tea that bring him back to his childhood. You know, seven volumes then emerge of memories of, of that childhood. Digging further into earlier drafts of Proust's novel that initially it didn't describe a Madeleine at all.\nExplainee: It's very interesting to see the imperfections of the human brain and being able to rewrite something that happened to you and fully believe it yourself. I think that that's one of the coolest errors and faults in the human brain that could exist.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","326":"Explainer: What's your favorite subject?\nExplainee: I'd say math.

Multiplying infinities. And there's a sense in which it's very similar to the arithmetic that you learned about already. But it's also totally different. It has some very weird properties. Welcome to Hilbert's Hotel. Unlike an ordinary hotel, has accountably infinitely many rooms. Suppose a new guest shows up, you might think that the new guest could take the room that's all the way down at the end of the hall, all the way at infinity, except there isn't a room like that. The rooms each have a number, and even though there's infinitely many rooms, each room is only a finite distance away. So here's how we're gonna make room for the new guest. I'm gonna ask the guest in room one to move into room two, and then we're gonna ask the guest in room two to move into room three, and we'll continue this all the way along. It looks to me like there's space for the new guest. Where is it? \n","332":"Explainer: Yeah, that's absolutely right. So infinity gets used a lot of different ways in mathematics. There's a way that mathematicians think of infinity as a number, just like the number 13, just like the number 10 million. So the reason that mathematicians consider infinity to be a number is that it is a size of a set. So the first example of an infinite set in mathematics is the set of all counting numbers. So one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, et cetera. That list goes on forever. That is an infinite set. And to be a little bit more precise, it's a countably infinite set. But as a number, infinity is pretty strange.\nExplainee: What do you mean by that?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: It'll be in room number one.\nExplainer: Room number one. Exactly. I'm gonna use this symbol for infinity, but what we've just shown is that one, the one new guest plus infinity is equal to the same infinity.

That would be a great solution. I don't know. I think these people don't really get along. So I need to somehow create infinitely many new rooms, but I can only ask each person in the hotel to move a finite distance away. So let's take the guest who is originally in room one and move them into room two. So that's creating one new space for us. And I'm gonna take the guest who was originally in room two and move them into room four. Are you starting to see a pattern here?\n","334":"Explainer: They can't live together.

You're going up one each time?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Infinity.\nExplainer: Infinity, great.

So I'm doubling the room number in fact. So this is some of the strange arithmetic of infinity. So we have two Hilbert Hotels, each of which have infinitely many guests, then this is equal to?\nExplainee: Infinity.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: How does infinity come across in mathematics for you?\nExplainer: So when I'm teaching calculus and talking about concepts like limits and derivatives, those are only defined precisely with infinity. Teaching algebra, which is meant in a different sense about number systems, we deal with infinite families of numbers in their operations. Infinite sets are somehow very exotic. They're not found so commonly in their real world, but they're all over mathematics.\n","336":"Explainer: Infinity, great.

That's what it's called.\nExplainee: Yeah. yeah, I haven't heard of it before.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Yeah, I did work with robots, but they weren't doing like artificial intelligence type of stuff. We were just sending like instructions and the robot would do, like, perform like a simple task. I wasn't so used to the aspect of, like, teaching computer how to do stuff.

I feel like that might be a problem.\nExplainer: Yeah, so there's this generalization gap, this gap between what it was trained to do and the new thing.\n","339":"Explainer: Yeah, so there's this generalization gap, this gap between what it was trained to do and the new thing.\nExplainee: So what's like the most complicated thing for a robot to learn, is it motion?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Do you think that we'd be able to kind of accelerate that process of collecting data? Or do you think, is it the way that we've been collecting those types of data sets, Is that what's keeping us behind?\nExplainer: That's a great question. I think we should be able to accelerate the data collection process by having robots collect more data autonomously on their own. And by doing that, we might be able to overcome some of the challenges of Moravec's paradox.\n","340":"Explainer: So you can think of robotics as having two core components. One is perception, being able to see and feel and so forth, and action, where the robot actually figures out how to move its arm. And both components are really essential, and both components are quite difficult. If you train a perception system independently of how to choose actions, then it might make errors in a way that mess up the system that selects actions And so if you instead try to train these two systems together, to have it learn perception action for the goal of solving these different tasks, then the robot can be more successful. One thing that's really difficult about robotics is, there actually isn't that much data of robots in the world. On the internet, there's all sorts of text data, all sorts of image data that people upload and write. But there isn't a lot of data of doing a simple thing, like tying your shoe, for example, because it's so basic. One challenge is even just getting data sets that allow us to teach robots to do these simple kinds of tasks.\nExplainee: Do you think that we'd be able to kind of accelerate that process of collecting data? Or do you think, is it the way that we've been collecting those types of data sets, Is that what's keeping us behind?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: What are some common algorithms that are used in these types of techniques as the robot is learning?\nExplainer: Deep learning is a common toolbox for addressing some of these challenges, because it allows us to leverage large data sets. And so, deep learning is basically, corresponds to methods for training these artificial neural networks. Another common method that comes up is reinforcement learning. A third kind of algorithm is meta learning algorithms. And these algorithms learn not just from the most recent experience on the current task, but leverage experience from other task in the past. And they're not just completely separate. We can combine the aspects of these algorithms into a single method that gets the benefits of each of them.\n","341":"Explainer: Do you have any sense of how you would give a really precise mathematical definition to, you know, what is a fractal?\nExplainee: It would probably have to be some kind of recursive definition, like imaginary numbers. I know the Mandelbrot set we'll use those.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: No, I have not actually.\nExplainer: Yeah, great. So, so the real physical paper has some amount of thickness, but when we model this mathematically, we might ignore the thickness and say, yeah, this is really just kind of a two dimensional sheet of paper. And then you have your apple, how many dimensions is the apple?\n","342":"Explainer: The Mandelbrot set or the Julia set, you know, the idea is always, oh, I'm gonna apply some polynomial over and over again. Z squared plus C or something like that. When I think about fractals, I try to get away from these very specific examples and ask, what is it fundamentally that makes a fractal, a fractal. And one thing that I think you can be precise about, even if you can't really say exactly what a fractal is, is you can talk about this idea of fractal dimension. Have you ever heard of that?\nExplainee: No, I have not actually.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Well on the, on the paper itself, I would say it's two dimensional, but the actual paper would be three dimensions because it has a very small thickness.\nExplainer: And why three?\n","343":"Explainer: And why three?\nExplainee: I would also say three.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Because it has the pipes and the width. And there's a depth to it as well.\nExplainer: So it's not quite as solid as the apple, but it's also not quite as two dimensional as the original sheet of paper. And so for this reason, people associate this crumpled ball with a fractal dimension, maybe something like 2.5 dimensions instead of two or three, there are a lot of different definitions, precise definitions of fractal dimension. But I think the one that's easiest to understand is this thing called box counting dimension. You have, let's say an image and you want to decide what's the fractal dimension of this image. So what you're gonna do is you're gonna count the number of boxes, or you can imagine big pixels of this image that cover the boundary of this shape. And you're gonna see how does that counting compare with how the counts work for just an ordinary shape? So, so if I have a straight line and I start out with one big box that covers the whole line, and now I shrink my boxes by a factor of two, I just make boxes half as big. How many boxes will I need to cover that line?\n","344":"Explainer: Totally, now, as a little experiment, take your piece of paper and just crumple it into a ball. So what is it? Is the paper three dimensional or is it two dimensional?\nExplainee: Because it has the pipes and the width. And there's a depth to it as well.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: It changed and dimensions depending on how it is shaped.\nExplainer: And if I cut that box in half again, how many boxes do I need to cover the line.\n","345":"Explainer: And if I cut that box in half again, how many boxes do I need to cover the line.\nExplainee: two\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Four.\nExplainer: And so what this box counting is getting at is saying, well, I still can never decide what the length of the coastline is, but what I can do is I can see how quick does the number of boxes grow relative to how it would grow just for an ordinary one dimensional curve, like a line or a circle.\n","346":"Explainer: But if you take a more interesting shape, some kind of fractal shape, like let's say the coastline of great Britain and you start doing this box, counting experiment, something really interesting happens as you make these boxes smaller, the number of boxes you need to cover the coastline grows faster than it would for just a straight line.\nExplainee: Four.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Yeah, I've, I've heard about that. Where if you, if you change the amount of measurement for a coastline, you can actually change like how much of the coast that, that there is like if you measure in mile lengths, you're gonna get a much different estimate than if you measure in one inch increments.\nExplainer: So procedural computer graphics, which kind of came out of thinking about fractals is one answer to this question about how do you add more detail without for instance, consuming tons of memory or requiring artists to paint ultra detail the textures. So if, if you can instead describe at least some aspect of what you're looking at in a procedural or recursive way, then you can add as much detail as you need when you get close to objects.\n","347":"Explainer: And so what this box counting is getting at is saying, well, I still can never decide what the length of the coastline is, but what I can do is I can see how quick does the number of boxes grow relative to how it would grow just for an ordinary one dimensional curve, like a line or a circle.\nExplainee: Yeah, I've, I've heard about that.

Right? Right. So this is what makes zero-knowledge proof so fascinating, and so counter-intuitive. And I think the best way I can explain it to you is by means of an example. But before we do that, I have to decide what I'm gonna prove to you in a, with a zero-knowledge proof.\n","355":"Explainer: So actually, in the blockchain space is one of the spaces where we are seeing zero-knowledge proofs being implemented. And I think it's just the beginning. Let's talk about zero-knowledge proofs. At its core, a zero-knowledge proof is an interaction between two people. Then I should be able to convince you that some statement is true, but you won't have any idea why it's true.\nExplainee: Will I, like, understand that it's true because like, you know, the operations performed in the proof are like, of a certain, like, you know, they have like, certain attributes that would make them true?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Sounds good.\nExplainer: And the way we're gonna approach this is through something called NP-completeness. What an NP-complete problem is, it's a problem that's really hard to solve. But if you can solve it, you can solve any problem that's in the class NP. And that includes a vast number of problems. And what we're gonna do is we're gonna use an NP-complete problem to actually prove an incredible variety of statements through a zero-knowledge proof. And the specific Np-complete problem that we're gonna be looking at is called map three-coloring. Okay, so here we have a map. Okay. And these are a bunch of countries. And we've arranged them so that no countries that have the same color share a border. That's what makes a map like this validly colored. And now you might think, well, why should we care? It turns out that whether or not a map can be three-colored in this way is an example of an NP-complete problem. And it turns out that, you know, maybe what you really wanna do, is you wanna give a zero-knowledge proof that you have at least 0.3 Bitcoins, right? That would be cool.\n","356":"Explainer: What you're basically asking is, wait, what? Right? Right. So this is what makes zero-knowledge proof so fascinating, and so counter-intuitive.

You're getting into philosophy of math now. It's just exciting.\nExplainer: I mean I think that's another common misconception about mathematics is that it's so far removed from the humanities, for instance. I mean it's hard to ignore some of these philosophical questions, particularly when we're talking about certain things like infinity. And I think one of the most difficult things to really be precise about and to explain to students is the continuum hypothesis. What do you say to students about the continuum hypothesis?\n","364":"Explainer: I'll grant you that Hilbert's Hotel does not exist. For me, infinite objects absolutely exist. And I can't read the thoughts in your head, but I have a high degree of confidence that we have a lot of the same ideas about infinity.\nExplainee: It's this idea that are things that you can think of, do they exist? You're getting into philosophy of math now. It's just exciting.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: The most fun thing to teach when you teach about infinity, when students realize that you are talking about different sizes of infinity, but then a natural thing is for them to think about what is the next size of infinity that I can think about? And sort of the continuum hypothesis is sort of one of these really hard things to grasp.\nExplainer: So what's so fascinating about the continuum hypothesis, if you take a subset of the real line that's infinite, does it necessarily have either the cardinality of the naturals or the cardinality of continuum, or is there some sort of third possibility? What's very surprising is the continuum hypothesis has been completely resolved in the sense that we now know for absolute certain that we will never know whether it's true or false. So this is a little bit confusing. The standard foundational axioms of mathematics that we take for granted are completely insufficient to prove the continuum hypothesis one way or the other. Mathematicians among other things have been very clear about exactly what they're taking as an assumption and exactly what they're concluding from it. So mathematical practice is to be exact transparent about the hypotheses you need to prove your theorem. So now I think of a proof of a theorem more like constructing a function where the domain of that function is all of the hypotheses that I'm assuming and then the target of that function is maybe a particular element in some universe that is the modularized space of the statement that I'm trying to prove or something like this. If the foundations were to change, if set theory were replaced by something else, maybe dependent type theory, do you think the theorem you've proven would still be true?\n","365":"Explainer: So on your trip what was the funnest day ever?\nExplainee: There was this pool, I love pools. And then there's a slide you go down and there's pool noodles in there too.

Basically we can't remember everything. So when you tell us this memory of that vacation and your brain is able to kind of play almost this movie of a memory, a moment, a day that you had in your life a while ago, where do those memories come from?\n","367":"Explainer: When you were telling me about the sandbox, it felt like you didn't have to make that guess, that you could just see the sandbox in your eyes. I asked you about the towel. It doesn't come to mind immediately, but you can stop and think about it and kind of make a good guess because there are things you know about the world. And for those of us who study memory that's a really strong hint as to how memory works. And so for you your memory kept all the fun stuff and all the stuff that was important to you, but the details like did you have to have a ticket to get in or how you got there, all these other less interesting, less exciting aspects, your brain kind of decided letting go of all that information.\nExplainee: I think as you get older you start forgetting things more because you have to make space for new things, which is why you forget stuff.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: I do know that there's different parts of the brain. So there's probably a part of your brain that remembers a bunch of stuff.\nExplainer: The hippocampus is a part of your brain that if you kind of took it out and looked at it, it looks a lot like a seahorse and it plays a really important role in creating those kinds of memories that help you two years after your vacation share with me what happened that day, all these details of that day. There's another part of the brain. It's actually also important for memory and it's called the amygdala and it is important for keeping all the kind of emotional processing going for memory. So memory for things that are really scary, it's gonna talk to the hippocampus now and get that memory to be really strong. Why do you think it might be important to remember scary things?\n","368":"Explainer: Yeah, that's a great insight. Basically we can't remember everything.

Then your brain makes a note and says don't get too close to sharp things, or you're going to cut yourself again.\nExplainer: You got it.

So Abigail based on our conversation today, can you tell me what is a memory?\n","369":"Explainer: And so you can't actually measure the length.\nExplainee: Yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Would a planet or an asteroid be a fractal?\nExplainer: Yeah, so if you look at kind of the wrinkly surface of an asteroid, each one of those little wrinkles adds a little bit to the surface area. And so it's really hard to say, what is the area of an asteroid? Let's take a look at a little example of where fractals actually show up in nature. What we're gonna try to do is we're gonna try to say what the length of the coastline of great Britain is. So we're gonna start out with the blue ones, which are spaced further apart. We're gonna ask you to connect the blue pins with a piece of string so we can get a measurement of the coastline. So we have our first measurement of the length of the coastline, and we're gonna do it over again. But this time we're gonna use the white pins, which are spaced closer together. So we measured the coastline again. And what do you think happens?\n","370":"Explainer: Right? Yeah. So that's already a really good idea of what a fractal is. It has some really, really interesting detail at all, scales that makes it hard to talk about standard quantities like lengths and areas and volumes.\nExplainee: Would a planet or an asteroid be a fractal?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: There's more in and out. Therefore probably takes more string for this one.\nExplainer: I think I agree with you, but I think to really validate our scientific experiment, we should probably compare the length of the string. A lot of extra slack in that pig of string. So what we noticed with great Britain is we were never able to measure it's length. It just kept getting longer and longer. This is called the coastline paradox where there's not really one definite number you can assign to the length of the coastline, but it depends on how you measure it. Like if we kept going to really get this to be accurate, we might have to like actually go down the beach and start measuring these tiny little details along the coastline. But really there's so much detail. We would probably never get a definite answer for how long the coastline is. Fractals also give us a really nice language. We're talking about how smooth or rough some kind of shape is. And actually a lot of people, engineers and scientists use this idea of fractals and this language of fractals to compare different shapes, not in terms of their size, but in terms of their roughness. So based on everything we talked about today, how would you describe a fractal to somebody in your own words?\n","371":"Explainer: Yeah, so if you look at kind of the wrinkly surface of an asteroid, each one of those little wrinkles adds a little bit to the surface area.

A couple of groups actually that are working on trying to read out the spin state of NV centers electrically, instead of optically.

In a quantum system, when you look at it or make measurements, it can change in a way that's beyond your control. We have the following task, build a nearly perfect computer out of a whole bunch of imperfect parts.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: The great power of a quantum computer is also it's Achilles's heel. That it's very very sensitive to perturbations and noise and environmental effects.

And basically with that, you can figure out minute details such as searching for a value in a binary tree. It's kind of like iterating through itself, but it's often more sophisticated in that it's easier to write.\nExplainer: They're easy for a computer to execute, right? It just has to run this recursive procedure over and over and over again. We can kind of get as much detail as we want or need. When I think about fractals and kind of what they've done for computer graphics. The example I think is subdivision surfaces. Did you, did you encounter subdivision surfaces in your graphics class at all?\n","384":"Explainer: Yeah it looks really blocky. And it's the same thing not only with shapes and games, but also colors and textures. And this is an especially a big problem in virtual reality because you have no control over where people are gonna go. What they're gonna look at, how close they're gonna get to various objects. So fractals on the other hand are these things that have infinitely, you know, nice details you get closer and closer and closer. And so this is something that can help us solve this problem in computer graphics of generating more detail. One of the reasons why fractals are really nice for computer graphics is because the algorithms that we use to draw images also have this kind of recursive flavor. What's recursion?\nExplainee: Recursion is a function that uses itself or calls itself in it's definition.

And so if we keep doing this with our paper, you kind of get pretty quickly the idea of what's gonna happen. So when you go to see a Pixar movie, for instance, every surface has been subdivided down.

And so if we keep doing this with our paper, you kind of get pretty quickly the idea of what's gonna happen. So when you go to see a Pixar movie, for instance, every surface has been subdivided down. So you have tiny little triangles called micro polygons that are even smaller than the size of a pixel.\nExplainee: How long does this process take?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: What do you think are the current shortcomings in, I guess applying fractals to computer science right now, what are, what is the cutting edge?\nExplainer: So we've, talked a little bit about the positive features of fractals and procedural graphics, which is you can write one simple recursive program and the computer creates a lot of detail for you. So that's really nice, right? It's saving you a lot of work, but the downside is you lose a lot of control. So because the only thing you're describing is this short little program, you don't have complete control over how this is gonna end up. And so adding more controllability to procedural graphics is something people have been thinking about for many years. So how has our conversation changed your understanding of what fractals are all about?\n","388":"Explainer: Well, because people who really need to use these subdivision services for everything, people who worked hard over the years to make this super, super fast. In fact, subdivision services were invented basically at Pixar. There's this guy, Ed Capel, and he was harshly responsible for one of the most famous kinds of subdivision surfaces called Capel Clark subdivision surfaces. And in fact recently won the touring award for these subdivision services.\nExplainee: What do you think are the current shortcomings in, I guess applying fractals to computer science right now, what are, what is the cutting edge?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: I think it's really interesting to see the different ways, fractals will be not only useful, but necessary in being able to render these games and these different programs that are interesting in the metaverse or different media to be really beautiful.\n","389":"Explainer: I wanted to ask you a little bit about what you know about the history of the internet. Have you heard of ARPANET, for example?\nExplainee: I have not heard of ARPANET.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: So what would packet switching enable? I'm sure there's something big here, for sure.\nExplainer: There's a lot big, right? And so remember, this was a Department of Defense, was they wanted to have forms of of communication that were very robust, that were survivable. Packets could all find their own ways, be routed differently through the network. So if parts of the network failed, you could route around failures.\n","390":"Explainer: Okay, back into the 1960s, there was a research agency in the United States called DARPA, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency. Actually, it was called ARPA at the time. They wanted to build this notion of a packet-switching network. Not a circuit switch network like a phone network where you get a dedicated path and a dedicated set of bandwidth and links from source to destination.\nExplainee: So what would packet switching enable? I'm sure there's something big here, for sure.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Sounds like the reason for like a request response type of structure.\nExplainer: So you can sort of see how the network architecture that wasn't designed to be 100% reliable inside the core of the network, and had that complexity built into the edges of the network.

Spoken like a real computer scientist, right? You're a computer scientist. I'm a computer scientist. We talk about APIs, application programming interfaces. The API for the internet is something called a socket. And a socket simply says, I can communicate if I know your internet address, you know, 128.119.40.186, that number is the IP address of my server, the University of Massachusetts. If you know that, you can write a program anywhere in the world and send a message, and it'll pop out at my end.\n","392":"Explainer: So you can sort of see how the network architecture that wasn't designed to be 100% reliable inside the core of the network, and had that complexity built into the edges of the network.

[Jim laughs] I've heard that there are like seven keys to the internet, something like that.\nExplainer: Okay, well I don't know about the number seven, but there's something in the internet that's sort of similar to that. It's called the Domain Name System. The DNS's role is to translate names like gaia.cs.umass.edu, or ibm.com, or facebook.com to an IP address so that your application can actually send a message to that name, to that named service.\n","393":"Explainer: Okay. What does that mean?\nExplainee: No one authority holds control over any sort of decisions or destinations.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: When can we see the next tenfold increase in in Wi-Fi speed?\nExplainer: In terms of tenfold speeds of increases, depending on what device you're using right now, it's available, all you need to do is upgrade. So the Wi-Fi protocol's called 802.11. And this is sometimes a source of confusion for people. How can it be that I've got a connection at 100 megabits per second from our TV into our router? 100 megabits per second not enough?\n","394":"Explainer: Where do they get dropped, do you think?\nExplainee: Somewhere in their travel process.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: I see.\nExplainer: I'm curious, has our conversation sort of changed your view or sort of taught you new things about the internet?\n","395":"Explainer: Cool. What do you think of when you hear the words quantum sensing?\nExplainee: I think that using some sort of quantum computing to sense some quantum level molecules or particles, like interactions and stuff, maybe.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Okay.\nExplainer: We believe quantum mechanics tells us what the true laws of physics are, and so a quantum sensor, in that sense, would reach the limits of what's attainable.\n","396":"Explainer: It would be the top tier.\nExplainee: What are you doing? Like, what are you studying?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Okay.\nExplainer: Which is a really nice platform because the spins show their quantum properties, even at room temperature.\n","397":"Explainer: Which is a really nice platform because the spins show their quantum properties, even at room temperature.\nExplainee: So, are you studying the spins of the electrons?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: So you mentioned the diamonds that are used to create the sensors.\nExplainer: Right.\n","398":"Explainer: So that's in some ways the key to both quantum sensing, as well as quantum computing. It's the idea that you can take a system and put it in a superposition of two states. Normally we think of classically a bit can be a zero or a one. So switch is either on or off. Whereas in a quantum system, it can be in what's called a superposition. So it can be partially on and partially off. But one of the challenges with quantum systems is that these superpositions are really hard to maintain because we don't see superpositions in the world around us. In quantum computing, you try really hard to isolate everything so that you can maintain this quantum property and the fact that it's actually going to lose its quantum properties as it interacts with the world also makes it a great sensor because now you're actually, you're using that fact that it's interacting with the world to say, wait, it's sensing something.\nExplainee: Okay, so it's like using like, the quantum computer would be kind of like the base level and then like you take it out into the world and see how like it differs?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: How does entanglement work into it?\nExplainer: So entanglement is the idea that two particles are correlated. They're essentially in the same quantum state, so that you can't disturb one particle without disturbing the second particle. And so, if I have a large number of quantum sensors that are entangled, then they're all going to interact much more strongly than if I just had one of them interact at a time.\n","399":"Explainer: So rather than trying to build a lot of complex algorithms and gates with it, what you do is, you take these quantum bits and you take them out into the world and say, what do you see? What are you sensitive to? So you can use an idea called entanglement to make an even more sensitive quantum sensor, but it's even more fragile. So there's always this trade-off between being super fragile and being super sensitive at the same time.\nExplainee: How does entanglement work into it?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Okay.\nExplainer: And so that gives you a boost in sensitivity when you have an entangled\n","400":"Explainer: In some ways, it is and you know, atomic clocks are remarkable devices and being able to measure time that precisely has really important consequences. In fact, our old GPS system is based on the accuracy of atomic clocks. They're a set of satellites, each of which has an atomic clock on board and they send out a timestamp and so, once it gets a signal from three different satellites, it can triangulate and figure out exactly where you are. Now, if you could make those clocks even more precise, you could actually accurately position where you are even more accurately.\nExplainee: Okay, that's really cool.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","401":"Explainer: So you're a student in high school, is that right?\nExplainee: Yes, I'm a sophomore.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: How does like all of the networks in my house connect to all the city networks?\nExplainer: Wow. Great question. Often, it's a little blue wire called an ethernet cable. So that cable is able to bring bits of information up into your apartment at say, a billion bits per second.

There's a couple of things that could happen inside the internet. Information is sent in these little packets of information from the Netflix server to your display device. And literally, each packet that arrives says, This is the first packet for Jenna. This is the second. This is the third. This is the fifth. This is the fourth. And they're reordered for you. Matter of fact, your computer will say, using the TCP protocol to the server, Hey, I didn't get packet four, can you resend it again? And again, the Netflix server is very happy to send you packet four again. The other is the internet protocol. If you think about sending letters through the US Postal Service, how you've got an address on it. So every packet that flows from the Netflix server to you has an address on it. It says, This is going to Jenna. It's going to the what's called the Internet Protocol address of your device. Think of all the range of devices that are hooked up to the internet. It's totally amazing, right? Every single one of them has one thing in common, and that is they speak the IP protocol, the Internet Protocol.

So we wanna think of a function as procedure or mapping between sets. So a function defines a one-to-one correspondence if it defines a perfect matching between the elements of its domain set and the elements of its output set. We call such functions bijections or isomorphisms. So the reason I'm so interested in this idea of a bijective function or a one-to-one correspondence that guarantees that every element of one set gets matched with an element of the other set, no matter how many elements there are, these bijections or these one-to-one correspondences as they help mathematicians reason about infinity.\nExplainee: How can you compare something that is endless?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Yes, the integers would, there'd be more integers than natural numbers.\nExplainer: I'm gonna now try and convince you that they are in fact the same size infinity.

That's exactly right. So we were hoping to compare the size of infinity of the rational numbers with the size of infinity of the natural numbers. What we've done is introduced an intermediate set, these pair of integer points, and this proves that this size of infinity is smaller than this size of infinity. Since we also have an injective function the other way, this size of infinity is smaller than this size of infinity so therefore they must be the same size.\n","414":"Explainer: Yeah, that's exactly right.

On the one hand there are infinite sets that feel very different like the natural numbers, the integers, the rational numbers that nevertheless have the same size or the same infinite cardinality.

There's a practical implication for computer science. Alan Turing, he came up with a mathematical model of a computer, something called a Turing machine. So Turing was wondering is it possible to compute every real number, an arbitrary real number to within arbitrary precision in finite time? He defined a real number to be computable< if you could calculate its value, maybe not exactly, but as accurately as you'd like in a finite amount of time. And because there are uncountably infinitely many real numbers, but only a countably infinitely many Turing machines, what that means is that the vast majority of real numbers are uncomputable.

And if it's run outta fuel, it's no longer shining and pushing outward. And without that it itself begins to go dark and there's nothing fighting the collapse anymore. And that's when you form a black hole.\nExplainee: How does it go that small?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: So if like the sun all collapsed on itself, it would form a black hole?\nExplainer: So it goes so fast that it goes completely dark. Any light that veers too close will fall in, will not be able to make it back out again. If a light is shining from the sun near a black hole, the black hole's not touching it. Why does the light get pulled in? Why does that happen?\n","424":"Explainer: Well, that's a really good question. So interestingly, the sun itself isn't heavy enough. So it has to be heavy enough that when it begins to collapse, it just overcomes all attempts to fight it. If you made something really dense, you would have to travel faster than the speed of light to actually escape. That's 300,000 kilometers per second.\nExplainee: So if like the sun all collapsed on itself, it would form a black hole?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: So it goes so fast that there's it's all dark?\nExplainer: It is taking other stuff, but the funny question was like, if I wanted to move your chair, you'd think it was really strange if I didn't have to come near you and actually grab the chair and move it. One of the things Einstein thought about is he imagined that what the black hole is doing is it's changing the shape of space around it. What do you think of that idea?\n","425":"Explainer: So it goes so fast that it goes completely dark. Any light that veers too close will fall in, will not be able to make it back out again.

And then Einstein goes a step further and thinks, well, what black holes must be doing is curving the space so strongly that even light gets caught. Sometimes you can get light caught into a whole orbit, literally the light going round and round in an orbit.\n","426":"Explainer: It is taking other stuff, but the funny question was like, if I wanted to move your chair, you'd think it was really strange if I didn't have to come near you and actually grab the chair and move it.

We've been talking for a little while about black holes. What are you gonna walk away with in your impression of what a black hole is?\n","427":"Explainer: Does infinity come up in your mathematics that you're studying?\nExplainee: One place infinity comes up is in algebraic geometry. Normally we think okay, well if you have two lines like this, you'd keep drawing them, they intersect right here. But in projective space, two parallel lines will also intersect at the point at infinity. Infinity is like this perfect concept for what we can add to a space that allows lines to have this more uniform property. What's your research in?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Yeah, it's basically this idea that you can put a choice function on any set.\nExplainer: And a choice function does what exactly?\n","428":"Explainer: And a choice function does what exactly?\nExplainee: Yeah, that's a good question.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Yeah, I've used it like that. I've also used it in Zorn's lemma and in the well ordering principle.\nExplainer: So there are three well-known famous equivalent forms of the axiom of choice. The well ordering principle is the assumption, the axiom that any set can be well ordered, but there are lots of subsets of real numbers that do not have a minimal element. So that ordering is not a well ordering. So here's the key question. Do you believe the axiom of choice?\n","429":"Explainer: So the way I think about it is if you have an infinite or an arbitrary family of sets and you know for sure that none of these sets are empty, then a choice function would allow you to select an element from each set sort of all at once. When you've used the axiom of choice in proofs, do you know which incarnation of this you've used?\nExplainee: Yeah, I've used it like that. I've also used it in Zorn's lemma and in the well ordering principle.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: I do believe the axiom of choice.\nExplainer: You do believe the axiom of choice, though it leads us to some strange conclusions. So if the axiom choice is true, then it's necessarily the case that there exists a well ordering of the reals. And what that means is that we can perform induction over real numbers like we perform induction over the natural numbers. This is trans-finite induction. It would work for any ordinal. So there must be some uncountably infinite ordinal that represents the order type of the real numbers. And this allows us to prove some crazy things. Imagine three-dimensional Euclidean space. So the space that we live in, extending infinitely in all directions. So it is possible to completely cover three-dimensional Euclidean space by disjoint circles, so infinitesimal circles, disjoint circles of radius one. So what that means is you can put a circle somewhere in space and then put a second circle somewhere in space that can't intersect with the first one because these are solid circles and then another circle can somehow cover every single point in space with no gaps in between.\n","430":"Explainer: So Cantor's diagonal argument can be abstracted and then generalized to prove that for an arbitrary set A, its power set has a strictly larger cardinality. And since that's true for any set, we can just iterate this process. When set theory was being discovered or invented or created in the late 19th century, one of the natural question to ask is can there be a universe of all sets? This comes up in my research in category theory because even though there is no set of all sets, we would really like for there to be a category of sets. So what category theorists need to do to make their work rigorous is to add additional axioms to set theory. One of my favorites was introduced by an algebraic geometer Alexander Grothendieck. This is something that we sometimes call a Grothendieck universe, or also an inaccessible cardinal. It's an infinite number that is so big that it cannot be accessed by any of the other constructions within set theory. It's so big that we'll never get to it and this allows us to contemplate the collection of all sets whose cardinality is bounded by this size that will never reach.\nExplainee: So you're just making a cutoff point. You're saying we're never gonna get sets bigger than this anyway, so we might as well make our category only include things smaller than that.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","431":"Explainer: That you don't want the complexity of managing them to go up linearly with that. You'd like it to still stay pretty flat as you start adding.\nExplainee: Right, exactly. I mean, the good thing about IoT devices is that they tend to transmit very, very small amounts of data.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: No, I mean I would imagine upper bound, KB per second, lower bound, you could see bytes per second just on average. But I mean, say that you have a temperature sensor running off of your Arduino that's reporting the temperature in your house every minute. That's going to be far less than kilobytes per second on average.\nExplainer: My sense is you're spot on, that they'll produce over time, a lot of data. And that a lot of IoT is about computing on that data. That computation happened mostly at the edge, or somehow a combination between the edge and something happening in a far away data center.\n","432":"Explainer: We're used to ethernet cables that can handle many hundreds of gigabits per second over a wired device. What are the typical data rates for IoT devices? I mean, not hundreds of gigabits.\nExplainee: No, I mean I would imagine upper bound, KB per second, lower bound, you could see bytes per second just on average. But I mean, say that you have a temperature sensor running off of your Arduino that's reporting the temperature in your house every minute. That's going to be far less than kilobytes per second on average.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Well, my sense is right now that all that data tends to be centralized because IoT devices are usually the commercial products of companies.\nExplainer: Do you think they'll share it?\n","433":"Explainer: Do you think they'll share it?\nExplainee: Not without some persuasion, but I agree that these data have massive, massive research value. Something I'm interested in with my research is collaborating with people who manage these distributed sensor devices, and then taking advantage of those datasets and comparing them to, say you were interested in doing a research project on how daily rush hour traffic impacts the acoustic landscape of New York City. Figuring out, look, this street next to this school is causing visible ratings above what we mandate. And so there needs to be an intervention here.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Definitely. I mean, we're already seeing long range networks like LoRa that can, first of all, provide access over a much larger coverage area, but then also look the same because they're set up to the same specification, regardless of where the individual gateway is.\n","434":"Explainer: [Amit] Right.\nExplainee: So what's your take on why knowledge is, rather than information, or zero-data proof. Clearly, there's data there. So can't be zero-data.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Mm-hmm.\nExplainer: being something that you can already predict.

This concept of zero-knowledge programs would allow you to carry out completely arbitrary computations\nExplainee: Mm-hmm.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Mm-hmm.\nExplainer: And then you can run it and gain the benefit of that computation without having to talk to me anymore.\n","438":"Explainer: And I think that's a sign. That's a sign that our baby has grown up and, you know, it's time for it to be developed.\nExplainee: I think, profoundly, the students often also ask me, what are the future direction, both in terms of crypto, zero-knowledge proof, in the real world and how mathematical you see in computing.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Mm-hmm.\nExplainer: I think that there is, you know, we've done so much in cryptography over the last few decades, but we understand so little.\n","439":"Explainer: Does the Large Magellanic Cloud have a big black hole?\nExplainee: I'm a second year. So I'm measuring star formation histories in the Small and Large Magellanic Clouds.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: So, I think the prevailing wisdom for a while was no, but my answer honestly is I'm not sure.\nExplainer: Yeah, I think it's a really good question. The only mechanism that we know for sure can form black holes is to collapse of very massive stars. So it's sensible to think, well maybe some very massive stars in a young universe collapsed under their own weight and then they merged and after some time they got big enough, but the black holes from stars can be tens of times the mass of the sun, maybe hundreds of times to the mass of the sun if they merge. To get to millions and billions, and if you just do the simple arithmetic of how many years that would take, there aren't enough years in the 14 billion years of the universe's lifetime. So they must have come from somewhere else.\n","440":"Explainer: Yeah, and probably nobody is. Have you heard a lot in your studies about these super massive black holes that we think lurk in the centers of very nearly every galaxy?\nExplainee: So, I think the prevailing wisdom for a while was no, but my answer honestly is I'm not sure.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: So I don't study AGN a lot, but I do have a long term interest in black holes, it's one of the reasons I entered the field. I always was curious about how a black hole of that size was able to form. Was it the result of mergers between smaller black holes, ultimately creating gravitational well deep enough to contract a protogenic disc for a whole galaxy? Or, man, what happened?\nExplainer: Yeah, I think that's right. I think people are really perplexed about how you make something so big in such a short period of time. It's kind of funny, the bigger you make a black hole, it seems maybe counterintuitive, but the less dense the material has to be out of which you make it. So you can, out of something the density almost of air, you can make a supermassive black hole. You can't make a star out of that, but weirdly, if you skip the star phase altogether, it's conceivable that they directly collapse. And so there's suddenly a new way to make black holes that nature has figured out.\n","441":"Explainer: Yeah, I think it's a really good question.

And then we'll have this just gigantic-\nExplainee: And Andromeda is one of the few galaxies that is traveling towards us and do for a merger event at some point. So given a sufficiently low velocity, we would just have two big galaxies that, for the most part, pass through each other, pass by each other. But given a sufficiently high velocity, we will have some crazy black hole interactions and some crazy star interactions.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Supermassive black hole.\nExplainer: We work a lot right now on thinking of black holes as batteries. So a black hole that can take, like a giant magnet, astronomical magnet in the form of another collapsed star, like a neutron star, and flip it around so fast, near the speed of light, that it actually creates an electronic circuit out of this moving magnet. And so that the power that can come out of these electronic circuits created by these batteries can be tremendous.\n","443":"Explainer: Yeah, and it's very possible that as you said, the collision won't be so severe that it'll be very disruptive. So our entire solar system could stay intact and here we would go with the sun and all the other planets in orbit around a new black hole.\nExplainee: Supermassive black hole.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: They're kind of misunderstood giants in a way. So I was curious, have you heard anything new or interesting in the field of black holes that will shape future discussions?\nExplainer: It's a great question. I once did a calculation of using a black hole made out of the moon and the strongest magnet we could find on Earth to see if I could make an electronic battery. And honestly, you only get about enough energy to power New York City. But we have to find one in our neighborhood first.\n","444":"Explainer: It's a great question.

And they inform a lot about, not just how a galaxy is destroyed or made, but how it's shaped and how it eventually, you know, builds life like ours.

One could be like a narrower task range. Another is maybe like also biasing the types of samples that you're collecting can bias towards interactions that are gonna be useful where the hands actually interact with each other, rather than just off doing their own things. What have you found to be like your go-tos between the different styles?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: It's similar to like skill transfer style of things, because some skills are just repeatable.

I mean, basically, software-defined networking exists, let's say within a single provider backbone, or a single cloud provider's network or a single campus. There's been some work on doing it at the juncture points between a pair of networks. But one other trend that's happening that makes it more possible is it used to be that to get from one end to the internet to the other, you have access networks getting much closer to, say Google or Microsoft or other large cloud providers, where even, you might only go through two networks\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Right, exactly. And if you take that even further, they're starting to be more edge computing where you might imagine you might have a cell tower connected to a small number of routers, connected directly to a server that's gonna be running the application. In that case, the entire infrastructure might be controlled by a single party.\nExplainer: It's totally fascinating to me that we have such an important global infrastructure, and yet, the laws that that govern it tend to be very, very local.\n","456":"Explainer: Right, well it holds together because we have standards, and we have protocols that you mentioned.\nExplainee: Exactly, protocol standards for how the equipment talks to one another. And increasingly, certificate authorities that help bootstrap the secure, encrypted and communication between end hosts. So there are a few of these sort of centrally, kind of agreed upon kinds of infrastructure, but for the most part, each network runs itself.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Not really because each country really can have it's own laws and its own norms. And so they can decide, like the Great Firewall of China can decide, they don't wanna let certain content be accessed by the citizens inside that country. So if a country decides they don't wanna answer a request for a particular domain name, they say, Hey, I don't want to let someone know the IP address of this website. They can decide not to let those answers be delivered inside their country. And so encryption plays a role in helping people keep their privacy or prevent surveillance, but it's not perfect. It's often possible, still, to know a fair amount about what people are doing, even if you can't look inside the envelope at the letter that's written.\nExplainer: I mean, even you could just tell that two people are communicating even though the traffic itself is encrypted.

Where you might have a mobile phone or a drone or some other kind of device connecting over the wireless medium directly to a network that connects you directly to the server that might run your application.\nExplainer: So you want the computation close to where the endpoint is.\n","458":"Explainer: So you want the computation close to where the endpoint is.\nExplainee: Exactly, and I think that what's now exciting about that is all three of these technologies, wireless, networking and cloud, which are normally three different communities, three different sets of technologies, three different sets of standards or practices, now have to work together in close harmony to be able to service applications that are really critical and that that might be interacting with the physical world in ways where safety is a potential concern.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: I agree. It's both the high bandwidth, it's the low delay so that you can have these applications that interact with the physical world and need answers in real-time. It's about having the compute really close so that you can integrate computation and communication. It's about having more coverage.\nExplainer: Coming back again to the softwarization. SDN and softwarization is a maybe a little bit behind the covers, that you wouldn't normally see it as a user going from 3G to 4G to 5G. You just see an increase in speed. But yet, the way the network is now being managed again, I think is bringing the cellular networking world sort of into the internet world in terms of the softwarization-\n","459":"Explainer: You know, we've had cellular networks now for 20, 30 years. So when we hear about 5G, what's trumpeted the most is the fact that oh, super high bandwidth, right? But I sense that the exciting things are more than just the network being faster.\nExplainee: I agree. It's both the high bandwidth, it's the low delay so that you can have these applications that interact with the physical world and need answers in real-time. It's about having the compute really close so that you can integrate computation and communication. It's about having more coverage.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Completely agree. I think the bringing in of compute and storage is important too. I think when you think just about networking, it really is often just one part of the IT, the information technology ecosystem. Is there's often compute and storage as well. And so, I think now there's an opportunity to have all of those parts of the infrastructure work together towards an even higher level goal. And so I think it's a really exciting time to be in the field 'cause now, the plumbing is getting close to the application in a way that it wasn't before.\n","460":"Explainer: What is your impression of what a black hole is?\nExplainee: I'm a senior at NYU. I'm studying physics and environmental studies.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: So it's a star that has collapsed. It has so much concentrated mass and gravity that there's a point outside of the black hole called the event horizon. So once you get past the event horizon, nothing, not even light can escape from that.\nExplainer: It turns out that there are only three quantities that define a black hole, its electric charge, its mass, and its spin. So the most general black hole can also spin and it can also be electrically charged. Whether or not they are has to do with how they formed. If a star collapses, it will likely be spinning when it collapses and the remnant black hole that formsbwill likely be spinning. A black hole of a certain mass, charge, and spin is indistinguishable from any other black hole with those same properties. So in some sense, they're like fundamental particles, which makes them absolutely exceptional for any other astrophysical object. Have you heard the stories about what happens inside a black hole?\n","461":"Explainer: So that's a great definition and I wanna pick that apart a little bit. So what you described is just right. Stars, when they run out of thermonuclear fuel are gonna collapse under their own weight. It'll explode in a supernova, it'll leave a core, and if the core itself is heavy enough, it will keep collapsing. It does, as you say, reach this point where not even light can escape. But the amazing thing is it leaves that point, you called it rightly the event horizon, it leaves it behind kind of like an archeological record because the start itself can no more sit at the event horizon than it can race outward at the speed of light. So the core of the star keeps collapsing and where it goes nobody knows. So in a weird way, the black hole isn't anymore a crush of matter. It left it behind in its wake, but the stuff of the star is gone.\nExplainee: So it's a star that has collapsed.

And what's more common?\nExplainer: So from the outside, if you're an astronaut, you're watching your friend, another astronaut going into the black hole, it's as though your times become rotated relative to each other. So the profound thing is as an astronaut on the outside, looking at this round event horizon, you think of the center of black hole as a point in space, but to the person who's fallen in, it's not a point in space at all, it's a point in time. The singularity, or the end of it all, the crush in the center of a black hole is in their future. So they can no more avoid the singularity than you can avoid the next instant of time coming. So the death in the singularity is inevitable. Although we don't really think the singularity necessarily exists.\n","462":"Explainer: It turns out that there are only three quantities that define a black hole, its electric charge, its mass, and its spin. So the most general black hole can also spin and it can also be electrically charged. Whether or not they are has to do with how they formed. If a star collapses, it will likely be spinning when it collapses and the remnant black hole that formsbwill likely be spinning. A black hole of a certain mass, charge, and spin is indistinguishable from any other black hole with those same properties. So in some sense, they're like fundamental particles, which makes them absolutely exceptional for any other astrophysical object. Have you heard the stories about what happens inside a black hole?\nExplainee: I've heard of Schwarzschild black holes, which is a black hole that is static, a Kerr black hole or a Kerr-Newman black hole, which is a black hole that rotates, but what makes a black hole static versus rotating?

And in the theory of spacetime, there is no question that a singularity would form when the star collapses catastrophically inside the black hole. Now, even when people talked about singularities back in the '60s, they thought, you know, quantum mechanics is part of the story of the whole of physics. It's not just gravity.

The black holes should in fact evaporate, that's not disputed, right?\nExplainee: That's right. It would be wonderful if we could have some experimental of evidence for this, if we could really build a black hole in the lab and test to see whether it behaves this way. But I think there is hope that we'll be able to detect some of these effects either indirectly, by looking at black holes out in the universe, or also maybe indirectly in the laboratory by looking at systems which aren't black holes, but which radiate in kind of similar ways.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: The pursuit of quantum gravity has taken us to places we never expected to be. I think what's exciting about physics, about theoretical physics, that you start following a thread, you start developing a chain of logic, and you never know where it's gonna end up.\nExplainer: Do you think there's ever a hope that the kind of information that you think about, the quantum gravity aspects of the universe that you think about, whether it will pan out or not, will ever be viably observed in these astronomical pursuits of the event horizon?\n","467":"Explainer: Do you think there's ever a hope that the kind of information that you think about, the quantum gravity aspects of the universe that you think about, whether it will pan out or not, will ever be viably observed in these astronomical pursuits of the event horizon?\nExplainee: It's a real challenge, but astronomical observations have gotten so fantastically precise. And there is some hope that if you looked at things like two black holes merging, each black hole comes in with its own event horizon, but then when the black holes merge, there's a very complicated process where these two event horizons merge and oscillate and vibrate, and then settle down into a single event horizon for the final black hole. There is some hope that if we can make sufficiently detailed observations of this process, if we could really see the way the event horizon is behaving as it settles down to this final state, that maybe that could reveal some of these quantum effects that we've been talking about.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Yeah, it's a spectacular process.\n","468":"Explainer: What do you know about memory?\nExplainee: I know when you see something you could like kind of like picture it, like in your head you can imagine it.

And if we can remember what's good and what's bad from what we did in the past, that can help us make decisions about what to do next time. So Dylan, you may be surprised to learn this, but we asked your mom what some of your favorite candies are. So you have to make a decision between these two candies and whichever one you pick, you actually get to take with you.\n","469":"Explainer: And on one hand memory is like a record of something that happened in the past that we can carry with us and we can like bring it back to mind. And on the other hand we need to be a little bit suspicious sometimes because we might get it wrong.

Okay, you can take those. It took you some time there. You looked like you were really working hard at that problem. And that's interesting because actually we know that from research that when people have to make a decision between two things they like equally, some people like economists think oh those are the easiest decisions because they're both good options. But as psychologists and neuroscientists we know it's the opposite. One of the reasons is because there's no simple answer of like I know that one's better I'm just gonna go with it.

And you don't know.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Am I always gonna like choose pixie sticks or sour patch kids? What's gonna like change that?\nExplainer: We fluctuate a lot because we use different kinds of memory to kind of resolve the uncertainty basically every time. But also the way we make decisions will change because our memories change. What's interesting about your brain as a teenager is that we know it's actually a phase of life where the brain is especially sensitive to rewards, to things that are exciting and positive. It's a phase of life where those rewards, whether it's candy or your friends or whatever it is that's exciting can have an especially powerful control over the decisions you make and the memories you create.\n","471":"Explainer: Got a favorite movie?\nExplainee: Matilda.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Yeah.\nExplainer: Let's say we want to get a video from here, over to here.

To my mind your work has really revolutionized the field of cognitive neuroscience more broadly.\nExplainee: I've been really interested in how past understandings of the brain have really focused on, on pinpointing exactly what each piece of the brain does. But I think that there's also a broader conversation happening in the brain, which is between one region and another. So it's actually the pattern of connections between these regions that would allow for the flow of information. But I think the tools that have become widely available now from the physics community and mathematics and computer science are under the umbrella of, of network science. So that is a science of networks, a science of understanding how bits of a system are interconnected with one another. Not just comparing two groups of people or two kinds of two species, but we can ask even within a single person, how does the pattern of connectivity in my brain change as we talk with one another? How does the information flow change? I think a lot about traffic on roadway networks as a good example of this. Which is, you know, we can understand where the roads are and perhaps the roads are relatively fixed. They change over long timescales and it's similar to the brain. We really only create large scale connections over long timescales. But we can alter the traffic on the roadways really easily. And that's similar to what we do in the brain is that we change the way that information is flowing to allow us to respond to our environment.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: The field is definitely opening up in the kinds of questions that can be asked now with these approaches. And I think what you're pointing out is that conceptually it's where we wanted to go anyway. So if there's so much orchestration that happens and a symphony is not a single piece, it's not a single pattern of, of harmony between instruments and, and similar to the brain, symphony of your brain is not a single pattern. It's a very dynamically changing pattern.\nExplainer: In the field we often talk of have having a mental model that we use to make predictions about what's about to happen and really use that to mean kind of a general understanding of what's going on. What does that look like in terms that come from your world of like the configuration of, of a circuit?\n","476":"Explainer: In the field we often talk of have having a mental model that we use to make predictions about what's about to happen and really use that to mean kind of a general understanding of what's going on. What does that look like in terms that come from your world of like the configuration of, of a circuit?\nExplainee: I think this is the most exciting area of memory research right now I think, which is how people build and remember, you know, and keep with them models of the world over long periods of time. When I think about a mental model, I think about ideas, potential outcomes, potential events, potential actions, and how they all depend on one another. So when we predict what will happen next it would be, I am currently sitting at this piece of the network and I know that there are, there are these possible outcomes. And so I have to get ready for those, you know, four possible outcomes. But that brings this interesting question to the fore, I think which is how does a network system in our mind and our brain create a network model of the world outside? It's almost like there's a reflection in the structure of what's inside in the hardware and what we're building in a very abstract way. And I think that relates to some interesting work that's coming out about the hippocampus too.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: That makes a lot of sense. And I think that it makes me wonder how we think about places in the abstract, what is a cognitive place, right? And what is, how do we map out the cognitive spaces that we, that our mind moves within in the same way or in a similar way to the spaces that we physically walk in. But I think it opens a lot up, a lot of questions about how individuals make their own maps, right? And then how the way that they choose to make that map will then affect the way that they may respond in the future to a new context or environment.\nExplainer: It's really interesting. And I think it also really speaks to the kind of pervasive and circular role of memory, right? Because the maps are dependent on memories, they're built from memories and experiences. So there's this kind of dialogue with memory creating maps, maps creating experiences, experiences creating memories, affecting the maps, and really makes me think even of a question a friend asked me recently about moods and mental health and this feeling of like how do some people get kind of trapped in a state of mind where all they can see is a particular way forward. But then something happens in the world that shifts them to another model.\n","477":"Explainer: It's really interesting.

As you walk into a new room you make a new map of that room. So what are the doorways basically for mental models? And I think that often we sort of fall into this pattern of, of thinking about memory as, as always additive, that we always just keep gathering more information and update what we currently have. We don't as often speak about deleting pieces of information or, or perceptions or something that we thought was a, was a useful fact but actually it's not a fact.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Right.\nExplainer: Getting way out there, but, but it is a way in which if you have the right model, it should be an efficient one.

Would you be willing to try to help me think about how to define it?\n","478":"Explainer: Getting way out there, but, but it is a way in which if you have the right model, it should be an efficient one.

I think getting your behavior in there somewhere seems, seems important. But also is it just a record of the past or is it, you know, our perceptions of, of what happened in the past, or how we've changed how we think about that past event or have we deleted that event completely and then gathered this higher level structure or mental model that then allows us to behave differently in the future? So it's more alive, it's more changing. It's more, I think it's bubbling out and gathering, gathering and growing and becoming more flexible, but it's also sort of bubbling in, in the sense of deleting and removing and forgetting. So yes, I think that what we need to add perhaps is that changeability and perhaps the behavioral relevance of that changeability. I don't know, what do you think?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Yeah, yeah I agree. I think that's perfect.\nExplainer: Yep.\n","479":"Explainer: Have you heard about black holes?\nExplainee: Yes, I know it has a lot of mass, but it's very small. I know that there are several theories about the universe due to black holes, like, around the universe and how it's made.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: A little bit?\nExplainer: Okay, you wanna do the demo for me? So the LIGO instrument electronically records the ringing of the shape of space with its very complicated instrument. It stands for Laser Interferometric Gravitational-Waves Observatory and the design was incredibly difficult and they didn't know if they would succeed. I think of the instrument as like the body of the electric guitar. And then they take the readout of the motions of the waves that they're recording, just like that guitar is recording the motions of the waves on the string. Now just play it like a little bit. And you can't hear anything, right? You're not meant to hear an electric guitar when it's not plugged in. What's happening is the guitar strings are ringing, but so quietly that we can't actually hear the sound. And this is like the gravitational waves, which are ringing the drum of spacetime, but so quietly that they're not move the air and we're not hearing them. So now play and I'm gonna turn the volume up a little bit. While I can't actually hear the ringing of the strings themselves, I can hear the data of the shape of the string recorded and played through this amplifier. And that's kind of the idea behind the LIGO instrument.\n","480":"Explainer: So a lot of times stars are born together in two star systems and when they die, if they're heavy enough, they will collapse under their own weight and form a black hole. So here you have a black hole and a big fluffy star. And what will happen is it'll start to tear apart its neighboring star. Literally parts of the star will begin to spill onto the black hole and splatter on the black hole. But let's say both those stars formed black holes. And what these black holes do is they are like mallets on a drum. They create literally waves in the shape of spacetime as they're moving. So imagine mallets on a drum, how the drum ripples. Depending on how the mallets are moving you hear different sounds. So effectively these black holes, as they get very close together in the final stages of their life together, they're orbiting each other at hundreds of times a second. It's this really crazy event, but it's happening in complete darkness. Eventually they bobble together and they merge and then they wring out, the spacetime's going crazy around them, it's this storm in spacetime, and they settle down to a quiet black hole. Then those waves that they created travel through the universe, basically undisturbed. For a long time people thought, well, even if black holes are out there, they're impossible to observe. And then they got very clever. You might wonder how we could possibly hear black holes, that sounds crazy. So I'm gonna show you, but I'm gonna need your help. This demo involves an electric guitar. Do you play at all?\nExplainee: A little bit?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: How do you know that it's like the black hole that's making this sound and nothing else?\nExplainer: It's a great question. If I didn't see you playing the guitar, I would recognize the sound of a guitar. And even if I had never heard of a guitar before I could figure out the frequencies that the string was playing, I could tell how strongly it had been plucked, and I could tell the length of it and where it was pinned down from the harmonics of the string. And I can tell the different lengths of the strings from the notes that they play. So I can actually reconstruct the instrument that's playing it. And it's very similar to LIGO, we can listen to the notes, the amplitude, the harmonics, and we can deduce the size and shape of the objects doing that. And they're very massive and they're very small and they have all the markings of a black hole.\n","481":"Explainer: It's a great question.

And so when we talk about babies, a lot of what we're talking about is how they become human. I started to try to build computer models of little tiny bits of babies cognition. And I would ask people, and they'd say, You have to assume that you can recognize objects, because actually recognizing objects is impossible. And I was like, 'Wait, it's impossible? What about AI?' And they're like, 'That's, that's really hard.'\nExplainer: Why do you think it's so hard to build these things into AI systems and robots?\n","483":"Explainer: Why do you think it's so hard to build these things into AI systems and robots?\nExplainee: I guess if you think about a quintessentially human task, like playing chess or solving arithmetic problem, things that other creatures just don't do, when you're a human being, you have to learn that in cultural time. And so there's a limited amount of data you have. But if you're talking about seeing the world interacting with the world, using your effectors properly, that's the combination of this massive amount of evolutionary time. When you look at that, it's like the 56 games of chess I played in chess club that doesn't look like a lot of training data. You work so hard to make a robot, do one particular thing or one class of task, and then seems like people must always come up to you and say, 'So, okay, but what about my other task? Okay. You can fold the sock or stack a cup. How about my dishes?' Is that frustrating? Is that a challenge? Is it interesting?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: When we think about babies on their social cognition, we actually start from the idea that they have a notion of what an agent is. An agent is something that's self-propelled, that has its own internal states, like goals and beliefs. And so, it's very natural to imagine that when you see a seemingly, they call it propulsive, action by a robot, you're thinking, 'Hey, this thing has a desire. It has a goal. It's accomplishing it with its. So what if I give it a different goal? Why couldn't it do that?' They call it promiscuous generalization about agents, right? I think that the electrical outlet looks like a face. I think that my computer's mad at me. And so I think it, the challenge actually is to stop people from doing that, and to recognize limitations where there are some. Or we bring to bear our knowledge, sometimes incredibly quickly, to parse an uncertain image. So our experiences go all the way down to our very first impressions of the sensory signal.\nExplainer: I like that description, because it conveys how much complexity there is to these really basic tasks that we're doing. Is there a definition for the simple tasks that we do versus things that are more complex, like playing chess?\n","484":"Explainer: I think it's interesting. And also a huge challenge. I think that it's interesting that if a person sees a robot doing something that seems very capable, they assume that the robot can do all sorts of other capable things.

I think it does make sense to talk about lower level, meaning closer to sensation and perception and action, and higher level meaning more deliberative, more mediated by memory and language and judgment.\nExplainer: That notion of hierarchy is really interesting, because it is these higher level things, like playing chess, for example, that are easier for AI systems. And the reason why they're easier is that we're providing the abstraction for the system already, then when we give the game of chess to an AI system, we abstract away all the challenges of like picking up pieces and moving them, and we say, 'Okay, there's this board of however many boxes on it.' And you just need to figure out within that very narrow, small world, what to do. But handling and learning what those abstractions should be and handling everything from low level sensory inputs to that higher level processing is really, really hard.\n","485":"Explainer: I like that description, because it conveys how much complexity there is to these really basic tasks that we're doing. Is there a definition for the simple tasks that we do versus things that are more complex, like playing chess?\nExplainee: I guess I like to think about this hierarchical cascade, where, at first, vision starts with the sensory signal and parses it into gradually more complex units. I think it does make sense to talk about lower level, meaning closer to sensation and perception and action, and higher level meaning more deliberative, more mediated by memory and language and judgment.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Our impression that it's purely discrete and symbolic might be, just that might be an impression, because we talk about it in a language. And actually, the fact that it's connected up to all these perception and sensation and action systems means that it's probably grounded in a more continuous set of representations. I wonder, is there gonna be a point where what you really want to know is what are the experiences that a human has? [indistinct] human speech own project. His idea was, 'Well, I need the exact data that my son gets in order to train my robot to be like my son.' Or do you think that we're gonna end up in a world that's more like the large language models and that'll have to do?\nExplainer: I suspect that we'll start by doing whatever is most convenient, 'cause that's whatever we can get. But I think that for robots to be capable alongside humans, in a world with humans, I think that we may need to actually use human experience, human learning, to inform how robots learn, if we want them to follow the same kind of mistake pattern as humans, so that humans can interpret robots, and humans can understand what robots will and will not do.\n","486":"Explainer: That notion of hierarchy is really interesting, because it is these higher level things, like playing chess, for example, that are easier for AI systems.

It's fairly easy to get different participants to experience consistent negative emotions to the same stimuli, but with positive emotions it's so much harder to study.

They have disruptions to episodic memories. They have trouble after this conversation remembering what the conversation was about, but they do have pretty good semantic information. They have a good sense of knowledge about the world. And that's interesting for two reasons. One, it shows this association between the role of the hippocampus and these two forms of memory, episodic memories and semantic memory. The other reason it's interesting is that people often assume that we get to semantic memory through episodic memory, that we encounter one dog and then another dog, and then another dog and then we learned the concept, the semantic notion of a dog.

There was a discovery about how the striatum responds to rewards and to learning that just all of a sudden flipped the way we thought about the role of reward and learning and memory, and may force us to realize there was something fundamentally connected between these processes.

study the cerebellum, but I'm going to talk about the prefrontal cortex, so I'm sure you'll be able to relate it to your own work.","1":"Can you tell me more about how that works?","2":"And as for the reliability of those kinds of interventions, it's a mixed bag. Some people find that they can actually improve the quality of their sleep, but it really depends on the individual and the specific drug being used. And it's worth noting that amphetamines, for example, can have a lot of negative side effects, so it's not always a reliable or safe solution.","3":"You know, so I think that's less clear. In some ways, you know, getting back to this idea of this wake-sleep system, we have this sleep system that is kind of the counterpoint to this wake arousal system, and so the primary nucleus region is the ventral lateral pre-optic nucleus, also called VLPO, and that has particular neuron outputs that release GABA and galanin, which work in an inhibitory way on kind of the wake promoting ones. And so, it's kind of this delicate balance of these two systems that are ongoing.","4":"And from what I understand, the research suggests that amphetamines can disrupt the normal progression through the different stages of sleep, but it's not entirely clear which stages are most affected.","5":"Yes, and then also, one thing that I'm interested in is, you know, do you have a way of verifying that they actually did get a good night's sleep, or do you just rely on their self-reporting?","6":"And I think that's what you did with 'Don't Follow the Crowd', you expressed your life experience in a way that was a surprise to you.","7":"You're saying that your life experience and sudden realizations guide your choices, but how do you balance that with the technical aspects of music, like chord progressions?","8":"You said that the chord progression in Don't Follow the Crowd is a great example of a modulation to the key of D flat major.","9":"I didn't get it","10":"It was just a cartoon, but it was a cartoon about a haunted house.","11":"The thing that's arriving is like a presence, it's a thing that's happening.","12":"It's like, in a way, music is life, and life is music.","13":"I've been listening to it a lot lately, it's really beautiful.","14":"I have, it's a classic.","15":"What do you mean by'sounds better'?","16":"Exactly, that's right. Latency is the time it takes for the system to respond to your actions, and if it's too high, it can ruin the whole experience.","17":"And with all this advancement, you can really see the difference in the graphics and the way the game feels when you're playing it.","18":"That's exactly right! Machine learning is a type of artificial intelligence that enables machines to learn from data without being explicitly programmed.","19":"So, in a recommendation system, if you like Melanie Martinez, you might be suggested other artists with similar styles or genres. But if you don't like her, the system might try to understand why and suggest artists that are more aligned with your tastes.","20":"I think it's also worth noting that the machine can understand patterns in data, like if you always watch videos at a certain time of day or if you tend to look at certain types of posts more often than others.","21":null,"22":"I think we're getting closer to machines being able to do some things that even we can't, but there are still certain aspects of human cognition and behavior that are uniquely tied to our biology and experience. For instance, creativity, empathy, and complex decision-making in highly uncertain situations are areas where machines are still struggling to keep up.","23":"So, the neutron star is incredibly dense, but it doesn't warp the fabric of spacetime in the same way that a black hole does.","24":"I think that's a good way to put it, though. One of the things that's interesting about black holes is that they're not just a final state that stars collapse into, they're also formed in supernovae, so they're a product of a star that's been blown apart, and that's a very different process.","25":"Well, that's a great question. So, one way to think about it is that inside a black hole, space-time is so distorted that our usual notions of distance and direction don't apply. It's not like there's a 'inside' or an 'outside' in the classical sense. But, some theories, like string theory, suggest that there might be a kind of 'fuzziness' or 'foaminess' to space-time at the quantum level, even in the most extreme environments like a black hole. So, in a sense, you could say that there is a kind of 'interior' to a black hole, but it's not something that we can easily visualize or describe in classical terms.","26":"We've actually been able to see the merger of two neutron stars with both gravitational waves and telescopes, and that's given us a lot of information about the properties of neutron star material.","27":"The way you do in a supernova is basically nuclear fusion.","28":"How would you explain to your friends who are not math and physics majors what a dimension is?","29":"So you can imagine, like, you're walking around in a three dimensional space, and you're moving through that space, and you're also moving through time.","30":"But I'm getting ahead of myself. Let's start with something even simpler, like what do you know about one dimensional space?","31":"Because if you think of it as separate dimensions, you can imagine moving through space and then moving through time, like you're doing two different things. But if you think of it as one four dimensional thing, you're not moving through space and then time, you're just moving through spacetime.","32":"You move through spacetime at different speeds depending on your location in the gravitational field, right?","33":"So that's a different trajectory through spacetime, right?","34":"So the time that you measure is actually the distance that light travels, which is why it's different depending on how fast you're moving.","35":"Well, because the other person didn't experience the time dilation effect, they were standing still.","36":"So, if you don't have a spring, it's like a flat surface.","37":"The book, if you drop it, will follow a geodesic, which is a straight line on a curved surface, so it's not actually going straight down, it's going along the curvature of the sheet.","38":"I think that's a good way to start, but the train paradox is actually a consequence of special relativity, which is just a subset of the full theory of general relativity, which includes gravity. So, if you were to explain relativity, you might want to talk about how gravity warps spacetime, and how that affects the way we experience time and space. Maybe something like,'relativity is the idea that the laws of physics are the same everywhere in the universe, and that gravity is not a force that acts between objects, but rather a curvature of spacetime caused by massive objects.'","39":"I was thinking we could use that tune for our project","40":"you can't wrap them all up at once, but you can imagine taking a piece of string and wrapping it around a certain region of space.","41":"And down there in the tube it looks like your long thing that is compactified in one direction and infinitely extending in the other direction, so there's one less macroscopic dimension of space.","42":"We don't need to address that because the theory we're discussing is based on the assumption that the universe is already in a state of large dimensions.","43":"So, what's the difference between a black hole and a black brane?","44":"I've seen some papers by Arkani-Hamed and others that do something similar, where they consider a non-singular brane in de Sitter space, and they find that it's actually a solution to the Einstein equations.","45":"So, you'd think that's a bit of a problem, because then you'd expect a huge number of different solutions.","46":"Yes, that's right, these solutions have the lowest action of all the possible solutions, which is why they're so stable.","47":"You're saying it's like something out of a movie, right?","48":"And you're saying that some people in the literature are questioning the idea of the emergence of spacetime?","49":"That's because I wanted to make the concepts accessible to a broad audience, and a graphic novel can be a more engaging and easier-to-understand format than a traditional science paper.","50":"gravity","51":"Because I'm using this object to show you how strong gravity can be.","52":"How many fingers am I waving?","53":"string","54":"You're right, continuous lasers do deliver power at a constant rate, but they're not very good at delivering a lot of energy in a short amount of time, which is what we need for amplification. That's why we use pulsed lasers.","55":"You want to deliver a huge amount of energy in a very short amount of time, which is why you use a chirped pulse amplifier, as opposed to a continuous wave laser which delivers energy over a longer period of time.","56":"Well, we could probably use this to drive chemical reactions at a very, very specific spot. Like if we want to target just a single cell in the body.","57":"And what if we use a laser to heat up the cell? Maybe that's a way to selectively destroy it without affecting the neighboring cells.","58":"I'm curious, what are some of the ways that virtual reality can be meaningfully different from what we're used to, like a television on our wall?","59":"I think we're getting ahead of ourselves with the idea that we can just throw more computing power at this problem. I think we need to start thinking about the kinds of experiences that we can create, not just the fidelity of the graphics.","60":"Or bandwidth, or streaming.","61":"I think what's really exciting is the potential for people to come up with innovative solutions that aren't just about technological advancements, but also about changing the way we think about and interact with technology.","62":"I think what you're getting at is that it's not just about the tech, but how it's going to be used and how it's going to be integrated into our lives in a way that's positive and empowering.","63":"I think I know what you mean by the first four, like one dimension is a line, two dimensions is a plane, three dimensions is space, and four dimensions is, like, time and space combined or something.","64":"We've learned about them in class.","65":"What do you mean by extra dimensions?","66":"You can use them to locate any object in the sky, like a star or a planet.","67":"There would be three, latitude, longitude and altitude.","68":"I mean, it's not just some theoretical problem, it's a very real problem that we're dealing with right now.","69":"What kind of technology and tools have you been using in your studies, or, like, just in general, in the study of black holes?","70":"explainer says, We've been using a variety of tools, from computational simulations, to data analysis, to actually observing the sky with telescopes, to detect the X-ray binaries, and then using the Event Horizon Telescope to get these direct images of the black hole. We've also been using machine learning algorithms to help us analyze the data and make predictions about the behavior of these black holes. We've also been using numerical relativity to simulate the mergers of black holes and get a better understanding of the physics that's going on.","71":"What do you mean by 'right now'?","72":"And that's why the Earth's gravity is not strong enough to pull us into the ground, but it's strong enough to keep us on the surface.","73":"If gravity was too strong, the Earth would probably be a very small, very dense planet, and we wouldn't be able to stand on its surface.","74":"You are 4 feet tall?","75":"You're going to hear a lot of different stories about how gravity was discovered, but the one that's most widely accepted is that it was discovered by a guy named Galileo Galilei.","76":"That's right, the acceleration due to gravity is independent of mass.","77":"You're referring to the famous story about an apple falling on Newton's head?","78":"And so, understanding how process C works, especially in relation to process S, can help us understand why some people have trouble sleeping, even if they're getting the right amount of sleep, and how we can intervene to improve sleep quality.","79":"I think the relationship between sleep and health is pretty clear. The less sleep you get, the higher your risk of things like cardiovascular disease, diabetes, obesity, and depression. And the longer you go without getting enough sleep, the higher your risk is. It's not like you can just get away with a little bit less sleep and it's fine. It's actually pretty cumulative, so if you're consistently getting less than seven hours of sleep per night, you're going to start to see some pretty negative effects on your health.","80":"But actually it's a bit different, it's a concentrated beam of light, isn't it?","81":"Exactly, so it needs to be centered, it needs to be precise and it needs to be concentrated into a very small area, so that it can do the work that we want it to do.","82":"And that's why we need to make sure it's centered and has enough time to actually penetrate, because if it's not centered, the light might not be focused properly and if it doesn't have enough time, it might not be able to penetrate the target effectively.","83":"A lens works by bending the light, so it's taking the light and making it go in one direction, rather than spreading out, and that's how we get the concentration of the light.","84":"If we could somehow compress the light into a smaller area, then we could potentially use it to power our machines.","85":"It would be like a concentrated beam of light, like a tiny little bullet.","86":"it funnels into this lens and it gets focused and magnified and that's how we get a really concentrated beam of light","87":"And you're seeing a lot of these new missions coming online, like Athena, and the Square Kilometre Array, and these are all going to be game-changers for us in the field.","88":"Yeah, I mean, I'm pretty sure I'm not getting enough of it.","89":"You know, like, when you're sleeping, you're not just completely unconscious, right? You're not just, like, a vegetable or something. There's a lot going on in your brain, even when you're sleeping.","90":"So, for example, you can get a good amount of sleep, but if you're waking up a lot at night, that's not necessarily as good as getting a solid 7 hours of sleep.","91":"While REM is an important indicator, it's not the only factor in determining the sleep schedule or amount of sleep. We also look at the duration of non-REM sleep to get a more complete picture of the sleep pattern.","92":"That's right. And you're more likely to wake up during those times when you're not in deep sleep, so if you're on technology right before you sleep, you're probably waking up a lot during the night.","93":"And also, that's why you see a lot of people who are, like, super stressed or have anxiety, they often have trouble sleeping at night.","94":"What makes you think it's a long nap?","95":"Did you learn about them in that course?","96":"If I understand correctly, a 0D material would be like a single atom, a 1D material would be like a nanowire, a 2D material would be like a nanosheet, and a 3D material would be like a bulk material. So if these quantum dots are 0D materials, they're essentially just a single cluster of atoms.","97":"Well, I think it's still a few years away from being actually used on an industrial level, because we need to overcome some challenges, like how to scale up the production of these materials, and how to make them stable and reliable over time.","98":"Well, you can't actually roll up graphene like a sheet of paper to make a nanotube. The process is more complex and involves growing them from nanocrystals.","99":"So the way you control the diameter of these nanotubes is by using what's called a catalyst. It's a metal that you deposit on a substrate, and then you use a carbon source, which can be a hydrocarbon gas, and then you heat it up to a very high temperature. The carbon atoms then precipitate out of the gas and start to form the nanotube. And the catalyst determines the diameter of the nanotube.","100":"Have you ever used a computer or worked with data before?","101":"I'm not sure what you mean by 'what makes a dog, a dog and a cat, a cat', but I think it's because of their physical characteristics and behaviors that are unique to each species.","102":"So, is it a cat or a dog?","103":null,"104":"I'm not sure, because I've only been practicing with 10,000 data points, and I'm not sure if that's enough.","105":"I think I would still struggle, because it's not just about the number of examples, it's also about how well the examples are chosen and how the machine is set up.","106":"What's that?","107":"I've learned that in school, but I never really thought about it until now.","108":"I've been looking into some of the recent papers on fault injection attacks and I'm really interested in how they apply to real-world devices. Have you come across any interesting results or methods that you think could be useful for our research?","109":"So I was looking at, like, a little hardware Bitcoin wallet, and you could use fault injection to actually recover secrets from it, and a lot of devices. I mean, the whole idea is pretty cool, right? Because you tell the device, Hey, I want to authenticate, and it's supposed to run some really crazy math that authenticates it, but instead of doing that crazy math and attacking the math, you just attack the check at the end.","110":"So, I was wondering if there's a way to visualize fault injection in action, like, maybe a way to see the effects of the glitch on the system in real-time?","111":"I think the most interesting thing right now is the combination of the fact that we have more secure products coming out, but also the fact that people are starting to realize that even with secure products, there are still a lot of potential attack vectors that can be exploited. So it's not just about the product itself, but also about how it's used and the environment it's in. I think that's what's going to be really interesting in the next few years, is seeing how people start to think about security in a more holistic way.","112":"That's not exactly what happens. The gravity of a black hole is actually quite strong, even at a distance. It can affect the path of nearby stars and even the expansion of space itself. It's just that the effects are only noticeable if you're very close to the event horizon, which is the point of no return around a black hole.","113":"Exactly, the vacuum cleaner's not going to suck up the entire room, unless you're right next to it, and even then, it's not going to suck up the entire room, it's just going to suck up the dust and dirt on the floor, and that's what's happening with black holes.","114":"Yeah, I've noticed that too, it's like they always make it sound so dramatic and inaccurate.","115":"And part of the challenge of it is not the mathematics of building models, but the challenge is making sure that the data is sufficiently representative, potentially high quality.","116":"But in my case, it's just getting the data from the healthcare provider, even though it's supposed to be available, it's like pulling teeth, and then also the quality of the data is just really bad, so it's hard to even get started with any kind of meaningful analysis.","117":"It seems like there are a lot of questions that are being asked here that aren't necessarily about the technical aspects of building the model, but more about the social and ethical implications of using that model. And I think that's where a lot of the challenges come in, because it's not just about writing good code, but it's about understanding the context in which that code is going to be used.","118":null,"119":"You're right, it's a bit of a chicken and egg problem. Companies in areas like agriculture may not have the data or the resources to invest in AI, but on the other hand, the value of AI is hard to demonstrate when there's not much data to work with. It's a bit of a catch-22, isn't it?","120":"The thing that makes them cool is they're sort of like tilings, it looks like you could put this together by cutting little pieces of paper and sliding them together, but they're still one sheet.","121":"They can be made with a variety of techniques, including wet folding and squash folding.","122":"What if you start at the top of the paper and fold down to the dot, and then unfold it and make a second fold from the top down to the dot, and then make a third fold from the top down to the dot, and then make a fourth fold from the top down to the dot, and then make a fifth fold from the top down to the dot?","123":"Yes, that's right, every fold can be reversed, and that's why you can always make an origami model by reversing all the folds of a given design, it's a fundamental property of flat origami that makes it so unique and interesting.","124":"Twists, if I had another twist in the same sheet of paper I could make these folds connect with that, and these folds connect with that.","125":"You mean like when you twist a paper napkin to make a swirly design?","126":"Explainer: Neurons are also digital. Meaning a Neuron either fires or it doesn't fire, so that's either one or zero. And it's the combination of those ones or zeros that actually produce the 10 thousand different answers that you say.","127":"That's true, but the computer would be representing the brain's connections and firing patterns, not actually thinking in the same way. It's more like a simulation, and the computer's limitations would be reflected in the simulation. We'd be trying to capture the brain's behavior, not replicate its subjective experience.","128":"We do it by monitoring the brightness of the optical and infrared light coming from the accretion disk as it heats up after the X-ray photons are re-scattered and up-energized in the corona.","129":"the actual text of the missing part","130":"You're saying that if you have a supernova that creates a black hole, you don't have that same kind of fallback, that you have with a neutron star, right?","131":"You see, one of the ideas, one of the suggestions that we've had is that maybe the black holes are not accreting, they're not getting any mass, they're not getting any material to fall back onto them, so they're just sitting there, but they're still there.","132":"What do you mean by expulsion?","133":"Yeah, I think so. I mean, I think one of the things that's really interesting is that deep learning models can be really powerful, but they can also be really opaque, and that makes it really hard to understand why they're making certain predictions or how they're working.","134":"I think that's a good point. It's one thing to look at the outputs of a model and say, 'Oh, this is biased,' but it's another thing to actually understand what's going on under the hood.","135":"You're getting a little too philosophical on me, but I do think that the language of space-time is a powerful tool, and it's hard to see how we could do physics without it. But at the same time, it's possible that it's just a useful fiction, a way of describing the world that happens to work very well. I think we can say that the math works, but what does that really mean?","136":"And that's why having these waves together is so important, because it gives us a way to understand how quantum mechanics and gravity work together in extreme conditions, like the Big Bang.","137":"This is the Heisenberg's uncertainty principle in reality. You can't precisely say where the electron is, and you can't precisely say how quickly it's moving.","138":"So, Hawking realized that if you apply quantum mechanics to a black hole, the event horizon is not a sharp boundary, but a fuzzy one, and that means that particles can actually tunnel through the event horizon, and that means that some of the information that fell into the black hole can actually escape, which is a problem, because, in quantum mechanics, information can't be destroyed, it can only be scrambled, so if information is escaping from a black hole, where is it going?","139":"It's a crisis because of some of the details of it, but I would say the way you just described, I mean, if I build a big bonfire or an incinerator and I throw an encyclopedia into it, good luck reconstructing what was in that encyclopedia. The information is lost for all practical purpose.","140":"If we try to do that, we'd be in trouble with general relativity.","141":"So, if we apply this idea of superposition, we could have a state where the information is still inside the black hole, and another state where it's outside, and then we could add those two states together. And that would mean that the information is both inside and outside the black hole at the same time, which is kind of weird, because it means that the black hole isn't really a boundary between the inside and the outside.","142":"You're saying that the holographic principle is related to the extra dimensions in string theory, right?","143":"So, we should be careful not to get too excited about having an ultimate theory, because it might not be what we think it is.","144":"I think that's a great way to put it, it's like saying there's a dual description, and there's a perfect dictionary between them, so to argue which one's real is silly, it's like saying is French or is English real?","145":"And that's why we still need a theory of gravity that works at all scales.","146":"What's the first step?","147":"Okay, so we're making a hexagonal paper fold. It's a bit tricky, but stick with me.","148":"So, that's the first part of the crane that people usually struggle with, but it's actually very easy.","149":"You're doing it perfectly, don't worry if it's not perfect, it's all about the technique.","150":"How did you make it look like that?","151":"We're going to start by folding the paper in half lengthwise to create a crease in the paper.","152":"It's really cool, I've never seen anything like it.","153":"The explainer asks the explainee to elaborate on the potential of blockchain technology in relation to the distributed power grid and how it can be used to make up for the differences in renewable energy production.","154":"So, you're saying this technology is not ready yet?","155":"I was going to say that, but you beat me to it, the whole proof of concept is actually a proof of concept for the science, not the other way around.","156":"And then you have the same kind of thing with self-driving cars. You can't just compare them to a human driver because humans make mistakes.","157":"What do they do after they hack into someone's account?","158":"They put a firewall or something like that.","159":"They might get arrested, or they might get in trouble with the law if they're not careful.","160":"And maybe you could learn more about how the game was made and how you can make your own games.","161":"But I was trying to improve the game, and if I could change things that were hard for me, that would be a good thing, right?","162":"Have you shared it with anyone else, or is this the first time you've mentioned it?","163":"You know, it's actually been around for a while. People have been working on it since the 1980s.","164":"So, if you wanted to make a more complex circuit, like a logic gate, you'd have to add more components to this transistor, right?","165":"And that's the key to making more and more transistors on a chip, right? You can't just make them smaller and smaller, you have to make them more and more dense.","166":"Yeah, it's a combination of factories and machines that can etch and cut the silicon wafers into the tiny devices. And also, a lot of it is just the precision and the control that we have over the machines, so that they can make these devices so small and so consistent.","167":"No, trade is when you give something you have, and get something you want in return.","168":"What would you trade and what would you get in return?","169":"Can you think of any inputs the computer might have, like keyboard or mouse?","170":"You're clicking on things and moving your mouse around, and it's taking all that information and using it to help you play the game.","171":"Keyboard, mouse.","172":"Exactly, a camera is an input device. It's taking in light and images and transmitting that to the computer.","173":"What do you mean by 'get in'? Do you mean get into a system or access a particular resource?","174":"Exactly, so when you throw a rock, the Earth is pulling it in, but it's also got this momentum from being thrown, so it goes up and then comes back down.","175":"does the gravity pull it or is it just floating?","176":"Exactly. So, it's like, you can be in a situation where you're feeling a lot of forces, but they're all balanced out, so you don't feel them.","177":"And that's a pretty mind-blowing idea, right? It's like, we're used to thinking about motion and we're used to thinking about gravity, but they're all relative.","178":"Imagine you're on a train, and you're sitting in a seat. You feel like you're not moving, right? You look out the window, and the trees and houses are passing by. It feels like the train is stationary, and the world is moving past you.","179":"You're telling me!","180":"But if Marina is moving really fast, wouldn't she measure the speed of light differently?","181":"That's like, totally not how it works. It's like, your brain keeps working even when you're sleeping.","182":"You know, I was just reading about this, and it seems like they have some pretty interesting features.","183":"Well, it's not exactly like humans, because humans need to recharge in a full night of sleep, but the giraffe, it can kind of recharge in short bursts, like 30 minutes at a time, and it can do that like five or six times a day.","184":"How did you feel when you were tired?","185":"Hippopotamuses have to hold their breath for a long time, but they have adaptations that allow them to do so.","186":"What if we had that power?","187":"What's so special about dolphins?","188":"What is it?","189":"A baby ant is a great example. Imagine a baby ant is 1 centimeter long, so if I were to divide that by 1 billion, that would be about 1 nanometer. ","190":"So, how do you think this works?","191":"The missing part is: _______________________________________________________","192":"So that we can understand the world better, like how unicorns are just a myth, but tiny things like atoms and cells are real.","193":"I was thinking about how Realism in art and literature was all about capturing the everyday, mundane life, and how that relates to what we're trying to do with virtual reality, making it feel more real and immersive.","194":"Do you think we'll ever get to the point where virtual reality is indistinguishable from reality, or is that just a pipe dream?","195":"But I think what's really interesting about this is that we can actually start to use haptics and audio in a more subtle way to create a sense of presence, and to create a sense of immersion, without necessarily trying to replicate the real world. So, for example, if you're in a virtual environment and you're walking through a forest, you could use audio to create the sound of leaves crunching under your feet, or the sound of birds chirping in the trees, and you could use haptics to create a sense of resistance or texture as you're walking through the environment. It's not about trying to make it feel like you're really walking through a forest, it's about creating a sense of presence and immersion in that environment, and I think that's a really interesting area of research and development.","196":"I think that's one of the reasons why we're seeing a lot of investment in VR from companies that are traditionally focused on gaming and entertainment, because they understand the importance of creating a seamless and engaging experience for users.","197":"You're talking about the LIGO experiment, right? They detected the gravitational waves emitted by two black holes merging.","198":"So, in free fall, you'd feel weightless. The elevator is accelerating downward at 9.8 meters per second squared. That's the same rate that you would fall if you were in free fall. So, you'd feel weightless.","199":"You're in free fall, and what you notice is that you feel weightless. You're not feeling the force of gravity because you're falling along with it. You're not accelerating relative to the gravitational field, so you don't feel any force. That's the intuition behind Einstein's thought experiment: that gravity is not a force that pulls you towards something, but rather a curvature of space-time that affects your motion.","200":"But what if I threw it on a planet where gravity is weaker?","201":"the ball would hit the ground","202":"I was just thinking, how do people do that?","203":"you're actually able to see the stars in the sky without the light pollution from the city.","204":"That's the same idea, but it's a bit more complicated than that, because you have to consider the compactification of the extra dimensions, which is a bit of a technical issue.","205":"I mean, in string theory, the idea is that the fundamental building blocks of the universe are not point-like particles, but tiny, vibrating strings.","206":"So basically, what you're saying is that string theory predicts that spacetime is ten dimensional, but we observe it to be four dimensional, so we have to find a way to reconcile these two different descriptions of the world.","207":"So, string theory tries to solve that problem by proposing that the fundamental building blocks of the universe are not particles, but tiny, vibrating strings, and that's why it's called string theory.","208":"It's something that vibrates, like a string or a membrane, but in a way that's not directly observable.","209":"And if we have a two dimensional surface, a membrane, that is vibrating, we call it a membrane, but if we have a one dimensional line that is vibrating, we call it a string. So what about a two dimensional surface that is vibrating?","210":"Well, it's thought that the vibrations of these strings correspond to different modes of vibration, and it's the way that these strings vibrate that gives rise to the different properties of the particles that we see, like mass and charge. The idea is that the different vibrational modes correspond to different particles, so if you have a string vibrating in one particular way, that might give you an electron, and if you have it vibrating in another way, that might give you a quark.","211":"So how does that work, exactly? How does the vibration of the brane give rise to the different fundamental forces?","212":"That's a good summary. How does the blockchain technology work, though? Is it like a database, or is it something else entirely?","213":"I think one of the biggest implications of machines being actors in the system is that it's no longer just about human behavior and human psychology. It's about understanding how these machines interact with each other and how they affect the system as a whole.","214":"I think a big challenge is going to be the scalability of the technology itself. We need to be able to handle a lot more transactions per second and also make sure that it's not only safe but also fast and efficient.","215":"That's right, the more people that understand it, the more they can use it, the more it can grow and improve.","216":"That's right, there are many unknowns, but the potential is huge.","217":"One thing that I think is very interesting about the field of nanoscale materials in general, is that how you make the material changes the properties a lot. And so we claim that this 2D material has this property, then tying that to the battery performance is something that's pretty difficult to do. It takes a few steps in between. So we have to think kind of creatively with how we can do that.","218":"For instance, we have to figure out how to make large quantities of the material without losing those nanoscale properties.","219":"Origami is useful in applications where a flat state is involved because it allows for a precise and efficient way of transitioning between different states, such as folding and unfolding. This is due to the mathematical principles underlying origami, which enable the creation of complex shapes from a flat sheet of paper.","220":"","221":"Another origami challenge that comes up with these patterns is if we're going to make a wheel for a Rover we're going to need hundreds of yards of folded origami. ","222":"We're using a machine that can actually fold it into this shape, not just make the creases, but actually fold it into the three-dimensional structure. It's a bit of a complicated process, but essentially, the machine applies the fold pattern and then compresses it to get the desired shape.","223":"So, can you tell me a little bit about what you do know about blockchain?","224":"But isn't this just a new way for people to be able to do what they're already doing on Amazon or on eBay, or on other online marketplaces?","225":"Is this technology potentially disrupting the business of middlemen or are they adapting to it in some way?","226":"Yeah, that's one of the things that blockchain does. It creates a permanent record of every transaction that's made, and it's distributed across the network, so it's not just one central authority that's saying, 'Oh, yeah, this is legitimate.' It's like, the whole network is verifying that this is a legitimate transaction, so it's a way of creating trust without needing a central authority.","227":"What do you specifically focus on in your work as an epidemiologist?","228":"What about beta-amyloid, do you think there's a relationship there as well?","229":"And I think that's been really well supported in the literature, especially with some of the work that's been done in mice, where they've been able to show that if you knock out the genes that are involved in the clearance of beta-amyloid, that you get this accumulation of amyloid, and you get these changes in the sleep patterns, and it's kind of a vicious cycle, where the sleep disturbances are driving the accumulation of amyloid, and the accumulation of amyloid is driving the sleep disturbances.","230":"What about kind of beta-amyloid, in relation to sleep?","231":"Yeah, I think that's really interesting, and it's also related to the idea of circadian rhythm and how that impacts our sleep-wake cycle, and it's also related to the idea that sleep is not just a passive process, but it's actually an active process that's really important for brain health, and it's not just about getting enough sleep, but also about getting the right kind of sleep at the right time.","232":"How would you make one point out of this sheet of paper?","233":"You're getting creative with the paper airplane idea, but what I'm trying to get you to see is the geometric shapes in the crane.","234":"And now that we have the basic idea, let's take a look at the pattern for the spider and see how we can use the circle packing technique to create the different features of the spider.","235":"So, what we're seeing is that the five circles of the crane are actually the five flaps of the bird's wings when they're folded up.","236":"Now, let's see how these simple shapes can be combined to create more complex designs.","237":"We've been looking at viruses for a long time, but we've always thought of them as something that causes disease. But what if we thought of them as something that builds things? So we started to think about how we could use them as a kind of factory to build materials on the nanoscale. And one of the first things we thought about was, how could we get them to do that? And one of the ways we thought about that was to use a piece of DNA that codes for a protein that's involved in building the virus's own structure. So we took a piece of DNA that codes for a protein that's involved in building the virus's own capsid, which is the protein shell of the virus. And we used that to program the virus to do something else. We said, okay, we want you to build a nanowire instead of your own capsid. And we showed that the virus would do that. It would take that DNA and use it to build a nanowire. And that was a really exciting moment for us, because it showed that we could use viruses as a kind of factory to build materials on the nanoscale.","238":"So I think one of the key areas of interest for us is how we can take this idea of using biological systems to build materials and scale it up to make large quantities of those materials. And that's where we see a potential intersection with the work that you're doing, in terms of being able to synthesize and characterize these materials at a large scale.","239":"So how do you actually control what the viruses are building? Are you using some kind of template or programming them to make specific materials?","240":"How do they manage to do that?","241":"You see, this is actually an example of a degree-4 vertex, which is the building block of many origami deployable shapes.","242":"So, when we're packing these into a rocket, we want them to be as compact as possible, right?","243":"So, we're going to fold these rectangles over and over, making sure the edges align and the corners are crisp, to create a stiff and rigid structure.","244":"So the motion is quite non-linear and that's one of the reasons why it's so useful for solar arrays, because it allows you to pack a lot of material in a very small space.","245":"You would want to have a system that can open them up at the same rate, so they're not like flapping wildly.","246":null,"247":"Exactly.","248":"But what's really cool is that this material can also change its shape in response to temperature, so if you heat it up or cool it down, it can change its dimensions and that's something that's very useful for deployable structures, because you can design them to expand and contract as needed.","249":"Do you have any idea how virtual reality works?","250":"And that's kind of what Minecraft does, it makes you feel like you're in a different world, right?","251":"Have you ever heard of a key in music before?","252":"The circle of fifths is a chart that shows all the chords and their relationships to each other, with the chords that sound good together grouped together.","253":"So you're going to start on F and then go to G.","254":"Let's think about what it might look like if the notes were different colors.","255":"What's your favorite science subject?","256":"Did you ever think about how that works?","257":"You have to define it in two dimensions.","258":"Imagine a line where you can just move in one direction, and if you're at a certain point, you just need to tell me how far along that line you are.","259":"can you explain the difference between the x and y axes?","260":"you're saying that everything has a certain dimension, but we're not really sure what that means, right?","261":"And that's exactly what's happening when you use Gmail, it's using machine learning to try to figure out what's spam and what's not spam, and that's why it gets better over time as you use it more.","262":"Likewise, if the email contained links or attachments, that would probably be a red flag.","263":"Yes, absolutely. There's a process called feature extraction, where the machine itself looks at the data and says, 'Oh, I see that the first 10 bytes of this email are a string of Russian characters, I think that's a feature.' And then the machine can extract those features and use them to make predictions.","264":"Well, in unsupervised learning, the algorithms typically involve techniques like k-means clustering, hierarchical clustering, or dimensionality reduction techniques like PCA, which all involve projecting the data into a lower-dimensional space and looking for patterns in the data.","265":"No, I would say that reinforcement learning is more like a trial and error approach, where you're constantly experimenting and adjusting your system to see what works best.","266":"When would you choose one over the other?","267":"The outcome would likely be a model that's accurate in its predictions but completely useless for decision making or for understanding the underlying reasons for those predictions.","268":"And I think the other thing is that the model is so complex that nobody really understands it, so it's hard to interpret, so it's hard to know what to do with the results, which is a big problem in machine learning, right?","269":"Well, one thing we can do is to increase the amount of data we use to train the model, which can lead to more accurate predictions. We can also try to incorporate more domain knowledge into the model, such as using features that are relevant to the specific problem we are trying to solve. Another approach is to use techniques like feature engineering and dimensionality reduction to make the model more interpretable and easier to understand.","270":"I think that's a very good point, and it's not just the wiring diagram, it's also the dynamic nature of the brain, the way the connections are formed and reformed over time, that's going to be really hard to capture in a static image like a connectome.","271":"I'm working on developing algorithms that can trace neural connections in brains, but it's a difficult problem because the data is so complex and there are so many variables to consider.","272":"I'm still working on that, actually.","273":"Hi, I've been thinking a lot about our past and how things turned out.","274":"That's the real goal of your research, isn't it?","275":"If we can beat the Schwinger limit, we will have a new source of high-energy particles.","276":"Or we could just be more careful with our math and see if that gives us any new ideas.","277":"That would be a really big deal, but I was thinking, what if we could use some kind of beam combining technology to increase the power output without needing to accelerate the particles as much?","278":"and that's a big challenge, but the real challenge is actually getting the two beams to overlap perfectly in space, at the same time, and that's what we're going to be trying to do with our two petawatts.","279":"So, with the progress in lasers, the problem of phase locking across the beam becomes a lot more tractable.","280":"How did the hackers gain access to Target's point of sale systems?","281":"If they start typing over that hundred bytes, they can essentially overwrite the memory that the program is using to keep track of things, and that can lead to a buffer overflow attack, where they can essentially inject their own code into the program and take control of it.","282":"A buffer overflow occurs when you have a program that allocates a certain amount of memory for a buffer, and then you write more data to that buffer than it's actually supposed to hold. And then what happens is, the program doesn't check that, so it just keeps writing, and the extra data spills over into other areas of memory, which can be a problem because it can overwrite other variables, or even the return address on the stack, which can then be used to execute arbitrary code, which is a very bad thing.","283":"And that's why you're interested in buffer overloading, right? Because you want to know how it works and how it can be used to cause a segmentation fault.","284":"So, when you're designing software for penetration testing, understanding buffer overloading is crucial because it's a common technique used in network attacks, like buffer overflow attacks, which can allow an attacker to execute malicious code on a target system. This is why developers need to design software with security in mind, preventing such attacks from occurring.","285":"I think one of the things that's really interesting to me is how computer science and information security intersect with global affairs. Like, there's a lot of talk about the rise of China and its technology, and how that's going to impact the world. And I think that's really fascinating. I've always been interested in how technology can be used as a tool for diplomacy and for international relations.","286":"That's a good point, and it's also interesting that the NSA's efforts to break these systems are not necessarily being used to help the US government's efforts to evade censorship, but rather are more focused on surveillance and intelligence gathering. It's a bit of a tension between the two different goals, and it's not always clear how they align.","287":"Do you have a laser at home?","288":"But do you have a cat?","289":null,"290":"So it's actually using the laser to sort of create a beam that is going around the corner and we can see it because it's so bright.","291":"seen a laser or have you gotten to play with lasers somewhere else?","292":null,"293":"How about the one where they made a giant arrow in the sky?","294":"I've been reading a lot about side channel attacks, but I have to say, Rowhammer really stands out to me. The idea that you can actually flip bits in memory just by accessing it in the right way is just wild. I've been trying to understand how it works, but it's not something that I've had a chance to work with yet.","295":"So it's kind of like that, where the memory is just a bunch of gates, and if you can find a way to, like, manipulate those gates in a certain way, you can actually get access to information that's not supposed to be accessible. And that's kind of what Rowhammer found, it's just that instead of using a certain order of storing and pulling information, they found that by doing a certain pattern of reads and writes, they could actually flip those gates and get access to information that's not supposed to be accessible.","296":null,"297":"You said that when people find vulnerabilities, it's their duty to release those to the public. I'm curious, what do you think about the ethics of that? Do you think it's always the right thing to do?","298":"But don't you think that by not allowing people to inspect their vehicles, it's somehow taking away their autonomy or their right to make informed decisions about their property?","299":"You have banks and other financial institutions that are kind of middlemen between people who have money and people who want to spend it.","300":"We would use blockchain technology to create a permanent record of all transactions, so that everyone can see the same history of trades.","301":"Well, there's a lot of different ways to do that, but one of the main ways is through cryptography.","302":"So, that's the basic idea behind the concept.","303":null,"304":"So chirped pulse amplification is a way of taking a laser pulse and stretching it out so that it can be amplified, and then compressing it back down to its original duration.","305":"Yes, it is. It's the same premise, but the chirped pulse laser is able to be amplified without being damaged by its own light, whereas the other lasers can't. The laser hammer is still a short, high-energy pulse, but it's able to be produced in a way that's safe for the laser itself.","306":"The pendant is a device that contains a piece of glass that is designed to create a cavity in the laser, allowing the different colors to interact and cancel each other out, creating the shorter pulse.","307":"I started learning music theory, and I was really interested in harmony and counterpoint.","308":"and that's where the overtones come in, they're not part of the original chord, but they're inherent in the notes themselves.","309":"And that's the key thing to me, is that the harmony is not just about adding more notes, but about how you use the notes you have, and that's where the real magic happens.","310":"Let's see how that works with the chord progression we were discussing.","311":"You're gonna play it on the guitar.","312":"You're just listing off chord progressions like they're a grocery list, don't you ever feel like that?","313":"You're right, that's the dark side, but that's actually the opposite, it's like, the opposite of the bright side, the dark side, but it's actually really beautiful and it can be really powerful.","314":"You see, the chord progression is like a day-night cycle, where F major is the night and A major is the day.","315":"It's the map of all the connections between the neurons in your brain, like a super complex road map of how your brain works.","316":null,"317":"I think what you're saying is that the brain's anatomy isn't enough to explain its function, and that's where the temporal order of neural activity comes in.","318":"What do you mean by'sensitive'? Is it the method, the data, or something else?","319":"But what you did see was a proof that I know the combination, without seeing any information about the combination itself.","320":"A zero-knowledge proof is a way of proving that something is true, without revealing any information about what that something is. It's like a way of saying 'I know this secret, but I'm not going to tell you what it is'. And in the context of computer technology, it's often used in cryptographic protocols, like secure multi-party computation, or zero-knowledge proofs of identity, to name a few examples.","321":"That's exactly what it does, but how is it actually done?","322":"What's the earliest memory you have that might have sparked your interest in science?","323":"And I think what's really interesting about your story is how that memory of your aunt has shaped your interests and your career. It's a great example of how memories can influence our lives in really profound ways.","324":"Well, we're seeing a lot of overlap between the different memory systems, but if I had to give you a simple answer, it would be that we're seeing more activity in the prefrontal cortex when we're looking at explicit memory tasks, and more activity in the striatum when we're looking at implicit memory tasks. But it's not a strict division, and there's a lot of overlap between the different regions.","325":"And that's one of the things that's so fascinating about the field right now, is that we're starting to understand that our memories are not just passive records of the past, but are actively being constructed and reconstructed in our brains all the time. It's a really complex and dynamic process, and it raises all sorts of questions about the nature of truth and reality.","326":"So what's the context of this photo?","327":"I'm trying to trick you into thinking you can figure it out.","328":"I see the puffin, but I still don't know where it is.","329":"Because it has a lot of applications in cryptography and security. It's a way for us to have secure communication, so we can protect people's privacy.","330":"So, you think that would be a good way to do it?","331":"You said that anything that has no end to it is an example of infinity. I'd like to show you a way that infinity can be a bit counterintuitive.","332":"I mean, if we think about it, if we think about the number one, and then we add one more guest to the room, we get two. If we add one more guest to the room, we get three. And so on. But if we think about infinity, and then we add one more guest to the room, we still have infinity. We still have an infinite number of guests. That's a pretty strange property of infinity.","333":"You think it would be two plus infinity equals infinity?","334":"So each time we move the person from one room to the next higher-numbered room, we're essentially skipping one room, so the person in room three is now in room four, and the person in room five is now in room six, and so on.","335":"That's correct, infinity is the answer, but we also have the concept of countable infinity, which is a more precise term.","336":"Well, in mathematics, infinity is treated as a number, but it's not just any number - it's a number that can be used in arithmetic operations, like addition and multiplication, in ways that defy our everyday intuition. For example, if you have a hotel with an infinite number of rooms, and each room is occupied, you can still add more guests by moving the person in room 1 to room 2, the person in room 2 to room 3, and so on, effectively creating a new room for the new guest. It's mind-bending, but it shows how infinity can be manipulated in mathematics.","337":"So what kind of robots were you working with?","338":"I was thinking maybe it's like the robot's sensors, like what it sees and what it feels, and the actions it takes, and how it interacts with the environment.","339":"I think motion is a good example, but actually, I'd say that's probably the simplest thing for a robot to learn. It's really the things that are more abstract, like perception and understanding language, that are much harder for robots to learn.","340":"Do you think there's a way to, maybe, not just collect more data, but also use the data that we have in a way that's more efficient or effective?","341":"I'm not sure. I've heard of three dimensional objects, but I've never thought about it before. Is the apple just a three dimensional object?","342":"So, the fractal dimension is a way of describing the complexity of a fractal, and it's a number that's often between one and two, and it's not exactly the same as the dimension of the space that the fractal is embedded in, so even though this picture is on a two-dimensional piece of paper, the fractal itself has a dimension that's greater than two.","343":"So, what specifically about the number three do you associate with the crumpled ball?","344":"You're saying that the paper is two-dimensional when it's flat, but when you crumple it into a ball, it becomes three-dimensional because it has a depth to it as well.","345":"because I'm covering it with two boxes, and then you're covering it with four boxes, and that's why you need four boxes.","346":"That's the famous result, known as Benford's Law, where the number of boxes needed to cover the coastline is proportional to the length of the coastline to the logarithm of the scale of the boxes.","347":"Exactly, I get that. So if you're using boxes of a certain size, you'll get a certain estimate, but if you use boxes of a smaller size, you'll get a different estimate.","348":"Exactly, it's a classic algorithm. Ken Perlin developed it in the 1980s to improve the look of computer graphics. He was working at Bell Labs at the time and was trying to create a more natural look for computer graphics.","349":"turn the cup over.","350":"pick up the box and then drop it again.","351":"If it's looking at the cup, it should be able to move over here without any problems.","352":"An equation, like 2+2","353":"yeah but what's really cool is that it's not just a quarter it's a really really tiny quarter that's spinning really fast and that's what lets us do the calculations so much faster","354":"So, basically, it's like a way for me to prove to you that I know something, but without actually telling you what it is.","355":"Exactly. And you're not gonna get any information about how I know that you won't get any information about how I know that some statement is true.","356":"So, let's say I want to prove to you that I have at least 0.2 Bitcoins without revealing what the address is of your account.","357":"We can take the map of countries that is three-colorable if and only if you have at least 0.2 Bitcoins, and then use zero-knowledge proofs to show that this map is three-colorable without actually revealing the map itself.","358":"So what do you think about the color of this one?","359":"So, this is the key insight, right? We're not actually giving you the information about the colors, but we're giving you the ability to verify that the coloring is correct.","360":"You changed the colors, didn't you?","361":"I think they're supposed to be more practical for implementation, because they're supposed to be like, the protocol, but they're also supposed to structurally prove something, like, that the encryption is working, that the cryptography is working, like, that the whole thing is secure.","362":"The explainer is explaining the concept of 'implementation' in the context of the explainee's question.","363":"And I think that's what makes this topic so interesting, right?","364":"I think that's one of the most interesting aspects of this, because it makes me wonder about the nature of mathematical truth. If the foundations of mathematics change, does that mean that the truth of a theorem changes too?","365":"We also played games and ran around a lot.","366":"I think I used the dark blue one. I remember because my mom got really mad at me for using it because it was her favorite.","367":"I think that makes sense. But I'm not sure how it relates to why I remember the fun stuff and forget the boring stuff.","368":"And so, the memories that we do remember are the ones that our brain has decided are important to us.","369":"And so, it's a bit like measuring the length of a coastline, it's a bit of a tricky problem.","370":"I think that's a great question. A planet or an asteroid would not be a fractal because they are not self-similar at different scales. They have a definite size and shape, and they don't have the same patterns repeating themselves over and over again.","371":"So that's going to be longer than our first measurement, and that's going to be longer than our second measurement, and so on, and so on, and we can just keep going and going.","372":"What are your senses?","373":"Is it a ball?","374":"see the underlying structure of the material, like what's going on beneath the surface.","375":"like an MRI for the ball.","376":"I started with a background in materials science, and then I moved into a field called quantum sensing, which is where I've been for the past five years. It's a very exciting field because it's still in its infancy and there's still a lot to be discovered.","377":"You have to be very close to the nitrogen-vacancy center in order to be sensitive to the single electron. That's why they're able to use diamond as the substrate, because diamond is really dense and you can get really close to the nitrogen-vacancy center without having to worry about the signal getting lost in the bulk material.","378":"But I'm not sure how that would actually work in practice.","379":"But isn't that still a significant achievement?","380":"What do you think are some of the key challenges that this larger group of scientists will face in making these breakthroughs?","381":"I've heard that the field of quantum computing is moving so fast that the most exciting work is happening on the cutting edge and that it's hard to keep up with the latest developments how do you keep current in your field","382":"The great power of a quantum computer is also it's Achilles's heel. That it's very very sensitive to perturbations and noise and environmental effects. You're just multiplying your problems if all your doing is adding qubits.","383":"You see, recursion is actually kind of like what happens in Minecraft when you zoom in really close to a shape. It starts to look more and more detailed, right? It's like the game is recursively generating more and more blocks as you zoom in.","384":"But in the context of computer graphics, recursion is often used to generate complex shapes and patterns, right?","385":"I was just trying to get to subdivision surfaces because it's a great example of how fractals can be used in computer graphics. And it's actually really closely related to what we were just talking about with recursive procedures. So, we were talking about how fractals can be used to create detailed images by recursively applying a procedure. And subdivision surfaces is a technique that uses a similar idea to create smooth surfaces in 3D graphics.","386":"And what this is doing is it's taking the corners of this paper and just cutting them off one at a time, it's still going to look very angular, I still have these really sharp points, so it's not working very well.","387":"It takes a long time, but it's a process that's been going on for years. The first Pixar movie, Toy Story, took about 18 months to render. But now, with modern computers, it's much faster. We're talking about hours, days, or even weeks, depending on the complexity of the scene.","388":"One of the current shortcomings is that fractals are still computationally expensive to render, especially for high-resolution images or complex scenes. This can lead to long rendering times, which can be a problem for real-time applications like video games or virtual reality. Additionally, fractals can be sensitive to parameters and settings, which can make it difficult to achieve consistent results. However, researchers are actively working on improving the efficiency and robustness of fractal algorithms, and there are some promising new approaches being explored, such as using machine learning to optimize fractal rendering.","389":"And what was ARPANET's primary function?","390":"So you can sort of see how the network architecture that wasn't designed to be 100% reliable inside the core of the network, and had that complexity built into the edges of the network.","391":"And that's why we have TCP\/IP, which is a protocol that ensures that packets will be delivered reliably, even if the network is congested or parts of it fail.","392":"Abstraction allows you to hide the complexity of the underlying system, so you don't have to think about it, and you can focus on building new things on top of it.","393":"How does that relate to Wi-Fi speed?","394":"Do you mean when they're being transmitted, or when they're being stored?","395":"That's a good start, but actually, a quantum sensor doesn't necessarily use quantum computing, it uses the principles of quantum mechanics to sense certain properties, like magnetic fields or temperature, at the quantum level.","396":"I'm studying quantum physics, and I'm working with a platform that uses spin to study quantum properties.","397":"Yes, we are. We're using them to study the properties of the spins in the diamonds.","398":"So, when you take a quantum system that's in a superposition and you expose it to the environment, the act of measurement itself can cause the superposition to collapse, but in doing so, it can also provide information about the environment.","399":"Well, when you entangle two particles, you can measure one and immediately affect the other, even if it's on the other side of the universe, so you can use that to amplify the effect of your sensor.","400":"And scientists are actually working on that right now, trying to make atomic clocks even more precise by using new materials and techniques.","401":"How does your internet get into your house in the first place?","402":"Well, in your house, you have a router that connects to your internet service provider. The router is like a hub that connects all the devices in your house to the internet.","403":"The internet signal travels through a series of networks that are connected to each other, kind of like a big web. It's a series of routers and switches that forward the signal from one network to the next, kind of like a game of telephone, but with computers.","404":"There are several underseas cables, actually. They're kind of like the information superhighways. They carry a lot of data from the East Coast of the United States to Europe and to Australia.","405":"The undersea cables allow internet service providers to connect their networks directly to each other, which means data doesn't have to travel all the way back to the US or Europe to get to its final destination.","406":"So, when you're watching Vampire Diaries, it's not actually downloading the entire movie to your computer. It's downloading just the piece that you're watching at that time. And it's doing that in real-time. It's getting the information from the Netflix server, and it's sending it to your display device, and it's playing it for you. It's not actually storing the movie on your computer. It's just storing the information that you need to watch the movie right now.","407":"Well, Netflix has a system of content delivery networks, which are like a network of servers that are located in different places around the world, and when you request to watch a movie, Netflix's system looks at your location and tries to connect you to a server that's close to you, and then it uses load balancing to make sure that the server you're connected to has enough resources to handle your request.","408":"That's a good start, but it's a bit simplistic. For example, consider a function that takes the square root of an input number. That's an operation that takes an input and returns an output, but it's not a function in the mathematical sense, because it doesn't work for all possible inputs.","409":"Well, one way to think about it is to imagine a never-ending list of elements. We can compare the size of two infinite sets by trying to create a one-to-one correspondence between them. If we can find a way to pair up each element of one set with exactly one element of the other set, then we know that the two sets have the same size.","410":"The natural numbers would be smaller than the integers.","411":"How about three?","412":"Exactly.","413":"By labeling each point in this lattice, we can create an injective function from the set of rational numbers to the set of natural numbers, showing that the size of infinity of the rational numbers is smaller than the size of infinity of the natural numbers.","414":"That's 3 over 2, and 3 over 2 is encoded as 25, because 25 is the product of 3 and 17, and 17 is the next prime number after 2.","415":"If you just like added one to them, then that would be something that doesn't exist in any of the other ones.","416":null,"417":"And now that we've established that, it has some pretty profound implications for our understanding of the nature of computation itself.","418":"What does it mean?","419":"I was expecting a more in-depth explanation about how noise-canceling headphones work, but it seems like you're going off on a tangent about quantum bits and superconducting materials.","420":"we're building the quantum hardware itself like the quantum gates and the quantum processors that are going to run the quantum algorithms","421":"It's not about weight, but about density, isn't it?","422":"So when it collapses, it actually collapses into a singularity, which is a point of infinite density, and then if it were to collapse further, it would become a black hole, with an event horizon beyond which nothing, including light, can escape.","423":"And it's incredibly dense, like a point with no volume, but all the mass of the star is packed into that point.","424":"So it would be a singularity, and then it would be surrounded by an event horizon, and nothing, not even light, could escape once you cross that boundary.","425":"the space is so curved that it has no escape.","426":"So, in Einstein's view, it's not that the black hole is a vacuum that's sucking things in, it's more like the space around the black hole is being warped and bent in such a way that it's pulling things towards it.","427":"My research is in set theory. I've been looking into how certain properties of infinite sets affect the existence of choice functions.","428":"I think of it as a way to assign a member from each of the non-empty subsets of a set, and it's useful in situations where we need to make a selection from multiple options.","429":"I've used it in various other places as well, like when constructing the Stone-\u010cech compactification.","430":"Exactly. And the idea of a Grothendieck universe is that it's a cutoff point that we can work with because it's so large that it's inaccessible. So we can just say, let's work with the category of sets whose cardinality is less than this Grothendieck universe, and that's a perfectly good category to work with because it's large enough to include all the sets that we're interested in, but it's small enough that we can actually work with it.","431":"So, in terms of the complexity of managing them, the small data transmission makes it easier to handle because it's less bandwidth-intensive and requires less storage, which simplifies the infrastructure needs.","432":"And I think that's a major point, that most of the IoT devices are not really designed to be decentralized, they're designed to be part of a larger network, and they're designed to send their data to a central server.","433":"What kind of research do you think you could do with this data that would be compelling enough to get the owners to share it?","434":"being something that you can already predict. Right.","435":"That's why we thought it was worth exploring.","436":"But they can still infer some properties of the compound, right?","437":"And it would be based on the idea of a trusted setup and then public key encryption.","438":"And I think that's one of the reasons why we need to have more people who understand both the mathematical side and the practical side of cryptography.","439":"So, you're studying the star formation in the Magellanic Clouds. What's the significance of this for understanding galaxy formation?","440":"I don't think so, because I think you're getting a bit of a tangent on the topic of supermassive black holes.","441":"Well, one of the leading theories is that supermassive black holes formed in the early universe through a process called 'direct collapse.' This involves the collapse of a giant cloud of gas, which can occur in the early universe when the gas is still very dense and cool. It's a complex process, but essentially, it allows for the formation of a black hole without the need for mergers or other intermediate steps.","442":"Andromeda has a supermassive black hole as well, which would merge with our own supermassive black hole during the collision.","443":"your answer here","444":"The problem is, as you get to the size of our sun, the energy output would be so enormous that it would basically vaporize anything that got too close, including any spacecraft. And even if you could somehow shield against the radiation, the sheer gravity of the black hole would warp space-time so much that it would be impossible to navigate.","445":"and isn't it interesting how the principles of storing classical information like bits in a hard drive could maybe inform how we think about training neural networks?","446":"So, in a way, quantum computers are similar to classical computers, but instead of using logical gates to perform operations, they use quantum gates and manipulate quantum states to change the input to some sort of output.","447":"We use a process called superposition to encode the model onto qubits, allowing the quantum computer to process multiple states simultaneously.","448":"I think we're facing a lot of challenges in terms of actually building a large scale quantum computer, and one of the biggest challenges is just the noise and the error correction, like I mentioned before, but also just the scalability of the thing, like how do you get a million qubits to work together in a way that's reliable and efficient. We're also facing challenges in terms of just the software and the algorithms, like how do you take these quantum computers and actually use them to solve real problems.","449":"The simulation models that we've developed so far work well for rigid objects, but they tend to break down when you get to things that can change shape, like tofu or broccoli.","450":"Do you think that's a better approach than trying to directly program the robot to learn a specific skill?","451":"One direction that I think is promising is to use machine learning to learn about physics and to build these kinds of physics simulators, but another direction that I think is also promising is to use multi-modal learning to combine the data from different sources, like vision and proprioception, to get a more complete understanding of the world.","452":"Would you like to know more about something that might look familiar to you?","453":"If you try to apply that rule to every single branch on the tree, you'd go crazy.","454":"What brings you here today?","455":"Can you elaborate on how these trends are changing the way networks are managed and controlled?","456":"So, if a country decides to block a particular domain name, it's not that difficult to do, is it?","457":"And that's what makes it so interesting, right?","458":"and that's exactly what's happening with the edge computing and the combination of the three technologies, wireless, networking and cloud.","459":"I think you're hinting at something, but I want to make sure I understand. You're saying that 5G isn't just about the network being faster, but about how it integrates with other parts of the IT ecosystem, right?","460":"I've been trying to learn more about the physics behind them.","461":"Explainer: A static black hole is one where the mass is spherically symmetric, so it's just a point in space, whereas a rotating black hole has an axis of rotation, so it's not spherically symmetric. The Kerr black hole is the most common type of rotating black hole, and it's what we would expect to form from the collapse of a rotating star.","462":"Well, a static black hole is more likely to form if the star is collapsing in a way that doesn't transfer any angular momentum to the black hole, whereas a rotating black hole is more likely to form if the star has a lot of angular momentum, like if it's a binary system where the two stars are orbiting each other and the black hole forms from the more massive of the two stars.","463":"Exactly, and that's what's so mind-bending about black holes. When you're near the event horizon, the curvature of space is so extreme that the concepts of space and time get severely warped. And at the singularity, the point of infinite density, the laws of physics as we know them break down. The mathematics suggests that a singularity is a point where the curvature is infinite, but we're still grappling with how to interpret that in a physical sense.","464":"Now, when you talk about the theory of spacetime and singularities, you have to be careful. Singularities are points in spacetime where the curvature is infinite and the laws of physics as we know them break down. So, in a way, you can say that singularities are not really a part of spacetime because the usual rules of physics don't apply there. If we want to understand what happens at singularities, we need to merge general relativity with quantum mechanics, which is a really tough problem.","465":"Exactly. And that's the beauty of the math, it's not just that we can describe what happens, but it's actually giving us predictions that we can test against the real world. So, for example, Hawking radiation, which is a theoretical prediction that black holes should emit radiation due to quantum effects near the event horizon, was initially met with a lot of skepticism, but it's been confirmed by observations of black holes in space.","466":"But what's also interesting is that even though we can't directly observe black holes, we can still learn a lot about them by studying the effects they have on their surroundings, like the way they distort space and time, and the way they interact with other objects in the universe.","467":"It's a very difficult observation to make, but if you can make it, it would be a huge deal.","468":"That's actually really interesting, because memory is also involved in our emotions and our preferences. For example, if you have a favorite flavor of ice cream, that's because of a memory you have of eating that flavor and feeling happy. So, memory is also connected to how we feel about things.","469":"Your turn to fill in the missing part","470":"You're saying that like the memory of the experience of choosing between two things you like equally is like really important in making that decision, but also that like after the decision you're wondering what if I had chosen the other one, and that's like a kind of uncertainty that's hard to resolve.","471":"What's it about?","472":"And what if some of the connections between here and here were really slow or really unreliable, or maybe even broken?","473":"Yeah, that's a great point. Maybe one way is messed up or broken. So you go the other way.","474":"And another reason is that it allows for redundancy, so if one path is congested or experiencing issues, data can still be transmitted through the other paths.","475":"I'm trying to understand how your work on network science relates to the idea of a mental model. Can you describe what that looks like in terms of the configuration of a circuit?","476":"I think what you're getting at with this idea of a mental model is the way that we can use a kind of abstract representation of the world to make predictions and understand what's going on, and that's something that we also see in the way that we think about the structure of a circuit, right? We can think about the circuit as a kind of abstract representation of the world, and that allows us to make predictions about what will happen when we put certain inputs in and what the outputs will be.","477":"You know, I was thinking that the maps and the memories are not just additive, but also, like, there's a lot of pruning and editing going on, right? Like, we're not just adding new information, we're also deleting old information, or, or changing the way we think about it. And that's a really interesting process, because it's not just about adding new information, it's also about, like, refining and adjusting what we already have. And that's, that's a really interesting thing to think about, in terms of how we think about memory and how it's not just a passive storage of information, but an active process of, of shaping and refining what we know.","478":"I was thinking that maybe we could use the word'representation' instead of'memory' because it captures that changeability and flexibility you were just talking about, and it's a bit more general so it can encompass all the different ways that information is stored and used in the brain, rather than just being a record of the past.","479":"Have you heard about the LIGO instrument and how it detects gravitational waves?","480":"Do you know how it is that we can hear the sound of a guitar, even though the strings are just vibrating in the air? It's because the vibrations are creating waves in the air, and those waves are what we hear as sound. And that's basically what's happening with the black holes, they're creating waves in spacetime, and we can detect those waves as gravitational waves.","481":"Not directly, no, but the effects of those waves can be used to test some of our theories about gravity and the universe, like Einstein's theory of general relativity.","482":"I've been working on this project for a while now, and I've been thinking about how we can use AI to help us better understand human development. I'd love to hear your perspective on this.","483":"Is it interesting that we can't just build a general-purpose robot, and then have it do all the tasks that we can do? That it seems like we have to program each task separately, and that it's not just a matter of adding more sensors or more processing power?","484":"I think that's a really good way to put it, and it's also interesting that the way we do it is often not very transparent to the system, right? We're not always aware of what the abstractions are that we're using to simplify the world.","485":"Do you think there's a particular point at which the complexity of these tasks becomes more difficult to model or simulate, or is it always a matter of scale?","486":"","487":"I'm actually more interested in the cognitive processes behind social cognition, like how do we categorize people and why do we categorize them in certain ways?","488":"I was really interested in how you were describing these processes as more like automatic and less like something that people are consciously thinking about.","489":"And I was thinking about how this relates to my own work on emotional processing and how it might be influenced by the type of memory that's being drawn upon.","490":"So, in people with intact brains, you might use a particular process, but if that brain region that subserves that process is damaged, that it's not that you can't do it anymore you just now do it a different way.","491":"But I think one of the key challenges in this area is that the brain is so good at compensating for damage, that it can be really hard to figure out what's actually going on.","492":"I think one example of that even has to do with the connection between memory and decision-making, and I think we're in a similar place right now with this new field of study that's emerging around the relationship between attention and memory, and I think it's gonna be really exciting to see where that takes us.","493":"But that's not actually the case. In fact, one of the hardest things for robots to do is to pick up small objects like a penny.","494":"Can you try it with your eyes closed?","495":"Now I have it in my left hand.","496":"Can you do it again with the eyes closed?","497":"What did you hear that made you think it was a ball?","498":"I think that's because we often think of robots as just being the physical device, but there's a lot of software and algorithms that go into making it work, and it's not always easy to understand.","499":"text to fill in the missing dialogue","500":"So how does it know what the reinforcement is, or how does it know whether it's doing it right or not?","501":"I think it's worth noting that the robot is not just looking at the numbers, it's also looking at the structure of the numbers. For example, if it's seeing a red ball, the numbers for the red pixels are going to be different from the numbers for the green pixels, and the robot is using that structure to figure out what's going on.","502":"No, I don't think that's a possibility with current robotics technology.","503":"I was thinking about that actually, how fractals can be used to model physical systems.","504":"You could also say that fractals are a way of describing how things look the same at different scales, and that's a really powerful idea, because it means that you can understand the world in a much more simple way than you might have thought.","505":"Keenan said, \"You have to zoom out.\"","506":"Scaling is a simple thing yeah.","507":"So one of the key challenges is that when you're dealing with fractals, you have to generate an infinite number of details, but most of the time, the user is not going to look at most of those details.","508":"That's why we're working on procedural generation, so the computer can generate the world as you're playing it, rather than having to store the entire thing.","509":"But isn't that a bit simplistic? Don't you think that infinity is more than just a really, really big number?","510":"You know, you're giving me a number, but I'm guessing it's probably not actually a finite number. I mean, we can't count all the way through it, right?","511":"because the jars would have to be infinitely small to fit in the room.","512":"You're thinking about the nature of infinity and how it can be perceived in different ways.","513":"What does that mean?","514":"and then i flip it over to show the tail side","515":"you're basically describing something that's really, really hard to understand.","516":"the way that you see the quantum properties of the qubits is by putting them in a superposition and then you can actually see the interference pattern that forms when you have two qubits entangled and that's what this thing is actually doing it's just showing us the interference pattern that forms when you have two qubits entangled","517":"so that we can understand how the chemicals interact with each other and use that information to make new medicines and materials","518":"And that's what we do in sensing, we measure the world around us.","519":"I'll try to break it

work.","1":"Can you help me understand the brain's natural processes that regulate the transition from wakefulness to sleep, without relying on external substances like amphetamines?","2":"It's a bit of a complex issue, and the effectiveness of amphetamines in improving sleep quality varies greatly from person to person. While some individuals may experience improved sleep quality, others may find that it's not a reliable solution due to potential side effects. It's also worth noting that the impact of amphetamines on the sleep cycle is not fully understood, and more research is needed to determine how these substances affect the transition between different stages of sleep.","3":"So, in a way, it's like a seesaw between the wake-up system and the sleep system. And it's all about finding that balance. There's a part of the brain called the ventral lateral pre-optic nucleus, or VLPO for short, which helps regulate sleep. It does this by releasing chemicals that calm down the wake-up system. It's a delicate dance between these two systems, and it's what helps us feel rested and refreshed.","4":"And from what I understand, the research suggests that amphetamines can disrupt the normal progression through the different stages of sleep, particularly affecting the transition from non-rapid eye movement (NREM) to rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. This disruption is thought to be due to the increased activity in the brain's wake-promoting systems, which can make it difficult for the brain to enter into the deeper stages of NREM sleep. However, more research is needed to fully understand the specific effects of amphetamines on the sleep cycle.","5":"Yes, and then also, one thing that I'm interested in is, you know, how do you account for individual differences in sleep quality among your participants, and are there any specific measures you take to ensure that they're well-rested before the study?","6":"I think that's what you did with 'Don't Follow the Crowd' - you took a deeply personal experience and crafted it into something that was both authentic and unexpected. It's that blend of vulnerability and creativity that makes it so compelling.","7":null,"8":"You mentioned that the chord progression in Don't Follow the Crowd is a masterclass in modulating to the key of D flat major, and I've always found that to be a really effective way to add depth and interest to a song.","9":"I'm having trouble wrapping my head around it, to be honest.","10":"It's funny how something that's just supposed to be a lighthearted cartoon can leave such a lasting impression, especially when it taps into our deep-seated fears of the unknown, like a haunted house does.","11":"The thing that's arriving is like a presence, it's a thing that's happening, and it's like a thread that connects the two, don't you think?","12":"It's like they're two sides of the same rhythm, each one influencing the other in a beautiful, endless cycle.","13":"I've been listening to it a lot lately, and I've been reading about its history and the story behind it. Did you know that it was written by a former slave trader who had a change of heart and became a minister? It's such a powerful story of redemption and forgiveness, and the melody is just hauntingly beautiful.","14":"I have, it's a timeless hymn that's been a staple in many cultures for centuries, and I think it's amazing how it can evoke such strong emotions in people.","15":null,"16":"Exactly, that's right. Latency is the delay between a user's input and the system's response. Think of it like a conversation \u2013 if there's a long pause between your question and my answer, it can be frustrating. Similarly, in VR, high latency can make the experience feel disjointed and unimmersive.","17":"I'm not sure I follow what you mean by that. Can you elaborate on how the advancement in technology is making games feel more immersive?","18":null,"19":"But in a recommendation system, the goal is to understand your musical preferences and make personalized suggestions. If you're not a fan of Melanie Martinez, the system might try to identify what specifically you don't like about her style or sound, and then recommend artists that better fit your tastes.","20":"I think the machine can understand the context of the conversation, like how our discussion about creepy vibes has been focused on music, and use that to inform its understanding of what we're talking about.","21":"That's a great point about targeted ads, but what if companies use machine learning to create entirely new experiences that are tailored to our individual interests and preferences?","22":"I think we're making progress in that direction, but there's still a long way to go before machines can replicate the full range of human capabilities. For example, creativity, empathy, and making decisions in situations with high levels of uncertainty are areas where machines are still lagging behind. However, it's also worth noting that machines have their own unique strengths, such as processing vast amounts of data quickly and accurately, and being able to perform repetitive tasks with minimal error. So, while there are certainly things that machines can't do yet, there are also things that humans can't do that machines can, and that's an interesting dynamic to explore.","23":"The reason we can tell them apart is that neutron stars are born from massive stars that undergo a supernova explosion, whereas black holes are formed when a star collapses in on itself without exploding. The difference in formation process leads to distinct properties, like the neutron star's crust and the black hole's event horizon.","24":"I think that's a good way to put it, though. One of the things that's interesting about black holes is that they're not just a final state that stars collapse into, but also a product of a star that's been torn apart, often in a supernova explosion, and that's a very different process, with a lot more energy released, which is why we see them as separate phenomena in the universe.","25":"Well, that's a great question. One approach to understanding what's happening inside a black hole is to think of it as a realm where our conventional notions of space and time are severely distorted. The event horizon marks the point of no return, where the gravitational pull is so strong that not even light can escape. As we delve deeper, the fabric of spacetime becomes increasingly turbulent, making it challenging to define a clear 'inside' or 'outside.' However, some theoretical frameworks, such as string theory, propose the existence of a quantum 'haze' or'mist' that permeates the interior of a black hole. This suggests that, in a highly abstract sense, there may be a kind of 'interior' to a black hole, but one that defies our classical understanding of spatial relationships and temporal progression.","26":"Actually, we've observed the merger of two neutron stars with both gravitational waves and electromagnetic radiation, which has provided valuable insights into the properties of neutron star material.","27":"I mean, think about it - the same process that powers the sun and creates all the elements in our universe is happening in a supernova, but on a much larger scale. It's like a cosmic furnace, where all the heavy elements are forged in the intense heat and energy released during the collision.","28":"I'd say dimensions are like the different ways we can move around in space. Imagine you're in a room, you can move left and right, forward and backward, and up and down. That's like three dimensions. But if you're in a swimming pool, you can also move up and down in the water, so that's like a fourth dimension. It's kind of hard to wrap your head around, but basically, dimensions are just different ways we can move around and experience the world.","29":"So, imagine you're on a hike, and you're moving through the forest, but you're also moving forward in time, so every step you take, you're not only covering distance, but also getting older. That's kind of what it means to be four-dimensional, like you're experiencing the world in a way that's both spatial and temporal at the same time.","30":"Let's start with something simpler. What do you think is the most basic aspect of space that we can all agree on?","31":"I see you're curious about why we think of spacetime as a four-dimensional thing. The reason is that it helps us understand how space and time are connected. If we think of them as separate dimensions, it's hard to see how they're related. But when we think of spacetime as a single entity, it becomes clear that they're not separate at all - they're intertwined. Does that make sense?","32":"You move through spacetime at different speeds depending on your location in the gravitational field, but that's not the only thing that affects your speed - your motion through space also plays a role, and it's actually a bit more complicated than that.","33":"Exactly, and that's where relativity comes in \u2013 it's not just about how we measure time, but how time itself is relative to our frame of reference, and that's what makes spacetime a four-dimensional fabric that we can move through in different ways.","34":"So the time that you measure is actually affected by how fast you're moving through space, and the distance light travels, which is why it's different depending on your velocity.","35":"Well, because the person who stayed behind was essentially stuck in their own personal time warp, while the other person was zooming through space and experiencing time at a much slower pace.","36":"So, if you don't have a spring, it's basically just a flat surface.","37":"The book, if you drop it, will follow the curve of the sheet, so it's not going straight down, it's going along the path that the sheet's curvature dictates.","38":"I think that's a good start, but to make it more comprehensive, you could mention how general relativity builds upon special relativity and introduces the concept of gravity as a curvature of spacetime. Perhaps something like,'relativity is the idea that the laws of physics are the same everywhere, and that gravity is not a force, but rather the way massive objects warp the fabric of spacetime, affecting how we experience time and space.'","39":"So I think we could use that tune as the basis for our project's theme song. I'm thinking of humming it to get a feel for it.","40":"You know, it's a bit like trying to fold a really long piece of paper into a compact shape \u2013 you can't just wrap it up neatly in one go, but if you focus on a smaller section, you can imagine creating a sort of tube or cylinder that captures the essence of that region, and that's kind of what we're talking about when we say that the extra dimensions can be compactified in a way that's not just static, but dynamic and responsive to the local conditions.","41":"So when you're looking at it from down there, it's like you're living in a long, thin tube, with one direction all wrapped up and the other direction stretching out infinitely, right?","42":"Actually, the theory we're discussing does make an assumption about the pre-existence of large dimensions, but it's worth exploring the origin of these dimensions to better understand the underlying mechanisms.","43":"So, the main difference between a black hole and a black brane is the way they behave in the context of extra dimensions. A black hole has a singularity at its center, whereas a black brane has a smooth, non-singular interior with higher dimensions.","44":"I was actually thinking of a specific paper by Arkani-Hamed and collaborators where they explore non-singular branes in de Sitter space, and they show that it's a viable solution to the Einstein equations. What's interesting is that their work highlights the potential for de Sitter branes to be used as a tool for understanding the cosmological implications of higher-dimensional theories.","45":"So, you'd think that's a problem, because then you'd expect a huge number of different solutions that would arise from the balance between the cosmological constant and the electromagnetic field.","46":"Exactly, and that's what makes these solutions so compelling - they're not just stable, but they also offer a unique window into the structure of our universe. Can you see how the compactified sphere could be influencing the behavior of the other dimensions?","47":"I love how you're saying it's like something out of a movie, but it's even crazier than that \u2013 it's like the special effects are happening right in front of us, in the real world!","48":null,"49":"I chose to create a graphic novel because I wanted to make complex ideas more approachable and fun to learn from, and a visual storytelling format can be really effective in conveying abstract concepts in a way that's easy to grasp.","50":"the way it warps space and time, making it nearly impossible to escape once you're pulled in.","51":"I'm using this object to demonstrate how gravity affects different masses and objects, and I'd like to see how it responds to being pulled in different directions.","52":"Can you see how many fingers I'm waving?","53":null,"54":"Actually, that's a great point. Continuous lasers are more about sustained power delivery, whereas pulsed lasers are better suited for applications where you need a high energy burst in a short time, like in our case, where we're trying to amplify the signal. The key difference is that pulsed lasers can concentrate a lot of energy into a very short pulse, which is essential for amplification, whereas continuous lasers just can't match that level of energy density.","55":"That's right, with a chirped pulse amplifier, you can concentrate a huge amount of energy into an incredibly short pulse, which is not something you can do with a continuous wave laser, which delivers energy more steadily over time.","56":"We could potentially use this technology to target specific areas within the body, like a single cell, with great precision. That could lead to new possibilities in medicine, such as delivering treatments directly to the affected cells.","57":"And how would we ensure that the laser's heat is localized to the cell, rather than spreading to the surrounding tissue?","58":"I'm curious, what are some of the ways that virtual reality can be meaningfully different from what we're used to, like a television on our wall? What kind of experiences do you think will really stand out and make us feel like we're in a new world?","59":"I think we're getting ahead of ourselves with the idea that we can just throw more computing power at this problem. We need to focus on creating meaningful experiences, not just relying on the fidelity of the graphics. Let's prioritize the kind of experiences we want to create, and then figure out how to achieve them, rather than the other way around.","60":"Exactly, and that's why we're seeing a shift towards more efficient compression algorithms, like those used in video conferencing platforms, to reduce bandwidth requirements.","61":null,"62":"I think what you're getting at is that it's not just about the tech, but about how it can be a force for good and bring people together in meaningful ways.","63":null,"64":"Actually, we did cover polar coordinates in our last lecture, but I'm not entirely sure I understand how they relate to the concept of extra dimensions. Can you help me connect the dots?","65":"That's a great question - I was thinking of something like the concept of time as a dimension, but I'm not sure if that's what you had in mind. Can you tell me more about what you mean by extra dimensions?","66":"You can use them to pinpoint any object in the space, like a star or a planet.","67":"We'd need three dimensions to pinpoint a location: latitude to measure how far north or south you are from the equator, longitude to measure how far east or west you are from a prime meridian, and altitude to measure how high above the Earth's surface you are.","68":"It's a bit surreal, isn't it? We're talking about a fundamental aspect of the universe, and yet we're still in the dark.","69":"We've been using a combination of radio telescopes, similar to the one I mentioned earlier, that are scattered across the globe, from Greenland to South America, to try and get a good image of the black hole in the center of our galaxy. We've also been working with some advanced software that allows us to process and analyze the data from these telescopes, which has been really helpful in our research.","70":"We've been employing a diverse range of techniques to study black holes, including computational simulations that enable us to model the complex dynamics of these cosmic phenomena, data analysis to identify patterns and trends in the observational data, and observational astronomy to detect and characterize X-ray binaries, which are key indicators of black hole activity. Furthermore, we've been leveraging the Event Horizon Telescope to capture high-resolution images of black holes, providing unprecedented insights into their structure and behavior. Additionally, we've been utilizing machine learning algorithms to analyze large datasets and make predictions about the behavior of black holes, and numerical relativity to simulate the mergers of black holes and gain a deeper understanding of the underlying physics. By integrating these different approaches, we've been able to gain a more comprehensive understanding of black holes and their role in the universe.","71":"What did you mean by 'right now'? Was it something you noticed recently, or is it a general way of thinking about gravity?","72":"The Earth's gravity is strong enough to keep us on the surface, but not so strong that it pulls us into the ground. It's a balance between the Earth's mass and our own.","73":"If gravity was too strong, it would make it much harder for us to stand up, as our bodies would be more compressed and our muscles would have to work much harder to support our weight.","74":"I'm guessing you're about 4 feet tall, am I right?","75":"You might have heard different stories about how gravity was discovered, but one of the most well-known is that it was discovered by Galileo Galilei. He's the one who helped us understand that everything has weight and that it pulls us towards each other.","76":"I think it's fascinating that this law, which seems so simple, has far-reaching implications for how we understand the universe. It's amazing to think that the same force that makes that apple fall is what keeps us and the Earth in orbit around the sun!","77":"You know, I think you might be getting at the legend of Sir Isaac Newton and that fateful apple. Am I right?","78":"And so, understanding how process C works can help us understand why some people have trouble sleeping, even if they're getting the right amount of sleep. Can you tell me more about what you've learned about process C?","79":"I think it's clear that sleep plays a crucial role in our overall health, and getting enough sleep is essential to maintaining optimal physical and mental well-being. Research has shown that chronic sleep deprivation can increase the risk of developing serious health problems, including cardiovascular disease, diabetes, obesity, and depression. The good news is that it's not just about getting a little bit less sleep and being fine; it's actually a cumulative process. If you consistently get less than seven hours of sleep per night, you'll start to notice negative effects on your health. It's not just about the quantity of sleep, but also the quality. Factors like sleep fragmentation, sleep disorders, and even lifestyle choices can impact the quality of your sleep. So, it's essential to prioritize sleep and create a sleep-conducive environment to get the best possible rest.","80":"Actually, it's more complex than a light bulb. A laser is a device that produces a highly concentrated beam of light through a process called stimulated emission, which involves exciting atoms or molecules to release photons in a coherent manner.","81":"Exactly, so it needs to be precise and concentrated into a very small area, kind of like how we use a magnifying glass to focus sunlight onto a small spot, making it hot enough to burn a hole in a piece of paper. That's similar to what the laser does, but with light instead of heat.","82":"Turn text here, with one sentence per line, and indentation used to show the structure of the conversation.","83":"A lens works by focusing the light onto a single point, making it incredibly intense, kind of like a superpower for light.","84":"I'm thinking about how this could be applied to solar panels, for instance. If we could concentrate light into a smaller area, we could potentially increase the efficiency of solar panels and harness more energy from the sun.","85":"Imagine it as a super-thin, super-powerful beam of light that's moving really fast.","86":"and it gets focused and magnified, allowing us to manipulate and control the light in a really precise way, which is what makes lasers so powerful and useful.","87":"I think one of the most exciting aspects of the current state of AGN research is the potential for these new missions to provide us with a more complete understanding of the circumnuclear environment, and how it relates to the different types of AGN we're observing.","88":"I'm pretty sure I'm not getting the quality of sleep I need.","89":"And that's why, even when we're not consciously thinking about it, our brain is still processing and consolidating memories, learning new information, and even regulating our emotions.","90":"And what we're trying to say is that it's not just about the quantity of sleep, but also the quality, so even if someone is getting a full 7 hours of sleep, but waking up frequently during the night, that can still have an impact on their overall sleep health.","91":"Actually, we look at both REM and non-REM sleep to get a clear picture of someone's sleep schedule and the amount of sleep they're getting. The duration and quality of both types of sleep are important factors in determining a person's overall sleep health.","92":"That's right. And because you're not getting quality sleep, you're more likely to wake up feeling groggy and tired in the morning. So, it's a good idea to create a sleep-conducive environment, like keeping the room dark, quiet, and cool, and avoiding screens for at least an hour before bedtime.","93":"That's why stress and anxiety can disrupt sleep patterns, making it tough for people to get quality rest.","94":"I'm glad you're excited about sleep, but what I was trying to get at was what makes you consider a six-hour nap to be a long one?","95":"What specific aspects of quantum mechanics did you find most fascinating or challenging to grasp during the course?","96":"Actually, if I understand correctly, a 0D material would be like a single atom or a molecule, a 1D material would be like a nanowire, a 2D material would be like a nanosheet, and a 3D material would be like a bulk material. But what's interesting is that these quantum dots, despite being 0D materials, can exhibit unique optical and electronic properties due to their small size and quantum confinement effects.","97":"Well, I think it's still a few years away from being actually used on an industrial level, because we need to overcome some challenges related to scaling up production, ensuring material stability, and developing reliable manufacturing processes, which are critical for widespread adoption and commercialization.","98":"The process of creating carbon nanotubes is more nuanced than simply rolling up a sheet of paper. In reality, they're grown from nanocrystals through a process called chemical vapor deposition, where a carbon source is introduced, dissolves into the nanocrystal, and then precipitates out as tubes. This process allows for a high degree of control over the nanotubes' diameter, but it's still a developing field, and researchers are working to refine their techniques and develop new methods for patterning and manipulating the tubes to create functional high-speed electronics.","99":null,"100":"I'm actually a data analyst, and I work with spreadsheets and databases all the time, so I think I have a good foundation to understand what machine learning is.","101":"I think you might be misunderstanding the question. Dogs and cats are both animals, but they have distinct features that set them apart. For example, dogs are often more social and active, while cats are generally more independent and sedentary.","102":"I'm not sure, but I think it might be a fox. I'm guessing that because foxes are generally slender and have long legs, which would make them good at running. Plus, their ears are usually pointy, right?","103":"I was wondering, do you have any specific criteria or guidelines that help you distinguish between different species?","104":"I'm a bit concerned that my practice might be a bit limited, given the relatively small dataset I've been working with. ","105":"I think I'd still struggle, even with a large number of examples, because it's not just about the quantity, but also the quality and how well the system is set up to learn from them. Plus, I'm not sure I'd be able to generalize what I've learned to new, unseen situations. But I do think it's really cool that machine learning can be applied to so many different areas, like coding and problem-solving, which are skills I'm interested in developing.","106":null,"107":"I've been studying cells in biology class, and it's really cool how they're the building blocks of our bodies, but I'm still trying to wrap my head around how they work together to keep us alive.","108":"I've been reading about some of the recent advancements in fault injection techniques and I'm intrigued by the potential applications to our research. Have you come across any studies that explore the feasibility of using high-energy particles for fault injection, or perhaps any interesting case studies that demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach?","109":"I was experimenting with a specific hardware Bitcoin wallet, and found that fault injection could be used to recover secrets from it, and potentially many other devices. The concept is fascinating, as it involves manipulating the device's authentication process by targeting the verification step, rather than the complex calculations involved. It's a clever approach to bypass traditional security measures.","110":"I'd love to see a visualization of the system's behavior as it's being glitched in real-time, almost like a debugger but for fault injection. Have you explored any tools or techniques that could make that possible?","111":"I think what's really fascinating right now is the tension between the advancements in secure product design and the reality that even with those improvements, there are still numerous attack surfaces that can be exploited. It's almost like we're seeing a cat-and-mouse game play out, where manufacturers are getting better at securing their products, but attackers are finding new ways to get around those defenses. I'm excited to see how this dynamic plays out in the next few years, particularly as we see more emphasis on holistic security approaches that take into account not just the product itself, but also how it's used, deployed, and maintained.","112":"That's not exactly what happens. The gravity of a black hole is actually quite strong, even at a distance. It can affect the path of nearby stars and even the expansion of space itself. The effects are noticeable when you're close to the event horizon, which is the point of no return around a black hole.","113":"The vacuum cleaner's suction power is limited to a certain distance, it's not a force that can pull everything in, even if it's very strong. Similarly, a black hole's gravity is only significant close to it, and objects outside of a certain distance are not affected by it.","114":"Yeah, it's frustrating to see how space and gravity are often misrepresented in movies and TV shows. It's like, they're trying to make it sound exciting, but they're not even close to what actually happens.","115":"And I think a crucial aspect is ensuring that the data is not only representative but also unbiased, which can be a much more nuanced challenge than it seems.","116":"I'm running into the same problem with getting data from healthcare providers. It's like they're not willing to share it, even though it's supposed to be available. And when I do get it, the quality is often really bad, which makes it tough to do any kind of meaningful analysis.","117":"I think we're hitting on a crucial point here, which is that the technical aspects of model-building are just one part of the equation. The real challenge lies in understanding the broader social and cultural context in which these models will be deployed, and being able to navigate the complex ethical implications that come with that. It's not just about writing good code, but about being able to anticipate and mitigate the potential consequences of that code in the real world.","118":"I think one of the biggest challenges is that many industries are still struggling to articulate a clear business case for investing in explainability, and as a result, they're not prioritizing it. It's not just a matter of technical feasibility, but also about making a compelling argument for why it's worth the investment of time, money, and resources.","119":"I think you hit the nail on the head. It's a bit of a problem when companies in areas like agriculture don't have the data or resources to invest in AI, but at the same time, it's hard to see the value of AI when there's not much data to work with. It's a bit of a vicious cycle, but I'm sure we'll figure it out eventually.","120":"The thing that makes them cool is that they're a great example of a mathematical concept called \u201cperiodic tiling\u201d, where you can create a repeating pattern of shapes that fit together without any gaps, kind of like a puzzle, but it's all on one sheet of paper.","121":"One of the key things about tessellations is that they can be created using a range of techniques, including wet folding, squash folding, and other methods that allow the paper to be manipulated and shaped without cutting. This means that the patterns and designs can be built up gradually, using a series of small folds and creases to create the final image. It's a bit like building with blocks, where each fold is a individual unit that can be combined with others to create a larger pattern.","122":"What if you start at the top of the paper, make a fold down to the dot, and then unfold it, making a second fold that runs from the top of the paper to the dot, but this time slightly offset from the first one?","123":"That's a key aspect of origami, actually. Every fold has a reverse, which makes it possible to recreate a design by reversing all the folds. It's a fundamental property that makes origami so unique and flexible.","124":"If I had another twist, I could create a connection between the folds, allowing them to link up and form a larger pattern.","125":"I see what you mean, the way the square twists as it unfolds is kind of like twisting a paper strip to make a spiral, but with a square shape.","126":"I see what you mean about the binary aspect, but I was trying to say that neurons can be thought of as binary switches, and the way they're connected determines the patterns that emerge in the brain, which can be similar across people. But that's a simplification, and it's not as clear-cut as a computer's binary code.","127":"That's true, but the idea is to use the map of connections and firing patterns to create a simulation that mimics the brain's behavior, rather than replicating its subjective experience. The computer would be limited by its programming and binary language, but it could still be a useful tool for understanding how the brain works and making predictions about its behavior.","128":"We monitor the brightness of the optical and infrared light coming from the accretion disk as it heats up after X-ray photons are scattered and energized in the corona. This allows us to estimate the distance of the dust from the black hole based on the time it takes for the light to travel.","129":"Actually, the X-ray binaries in the centers of galaxies are a major obstacle for us when we try to study the X-ray properties of supermassive black holes. These binaries can be so bright that they overpower the signal from the black hole, making it difficult to distinguish between the two. It's a bit like trying to take a picture of a faint object in the presence of a bright light source - you just can't see the object clearly. So, we have to find ways to account for the X-ray binaries and their impact on our observations, in order to get a clearer picture of the black hole's properties.","130":"You're saying that if you have a supernova that creates a black hole, the core collapse is more violent and there's no fallback disk, unlike what happens with a neutron star.","131":"One idea is that these black holes might be dormant, not actively feeding on surrounding material, so they're just sitting there, but still present.","132":"You mentioned expulsion, could you elaborate on what happens to the material that's not absorbed by the black hole in a supernova?","133":"I think one of the main challenges with deep learning models is that they can be incredibly powerful, but their opacity can make it difficult to grasp the underlying reasoning and decision-making processes, which is a major concern when it comes to trust, accountability, and transparency in AI systems.","134":"I think that's a crucial point. Understanding the underlying mechanisms of these models is essential to grasping the nuances of their outputs. It's not just about identifying biases, but also about recognizing the complex interplay of factors that contribute to their predictions.","135":"I'm not sure we can separate the language from the reality, but I do think we need to be careful not to get too caught up in the beauty of the math. What really matters is whether it helps us understand the world around us.","136":"And that's why having these waves together is so important, because it provides a framework for understanding how quantum mechanics and gravity can coexist in extreme conditions, such as the Big Bang, by reconciling the principles of wave-particle duality and the curvature of spacetime.","137":"This is actually more related to the concept of superposition, which is a fundamental aspect of quantum mechanics. In the context of cosmology, it suggests that the universe could be in a superposition of different states, with different branches of the wave function representing different possibilities, such as the presence or absence of a galaxy in a particular location.","138":"So, Hawking figured out that if you apply quantum rules to a black hole, the point of no return isn't a clear line, but a bit of a blurry edge. That means particles can kind of sneak through the edge, and some of the stuff that fell into the black hole might actually escape. But that's a problem, because in quantum world, information can't be erased, it can only get jumbled up. So, if information is leaking out of a black hole, where is it going?","139":"That's a great analogy, but the problem is, according to quantum mechanics, the information that falls into a black hole isn't actually lost. It's just scrambled and encoded on the surface of the event horizon. So, in a sense, the information is still there, but it's not in a form that we can easily read or access. It's a bit like the way that a scrambled hard drive still contains all the information, but it's just not accessible until it's decrypted.","140":"If we try to incorporate quantum mechanics into general relativity, we'd be facing a challenge that could potentially undermine our understanding of spacetime, which is a fundamental aspect of relativity.","141":"So, if we apply this superposition thing, we could have a scenario where the info is still locked inside the black hole, and another where it's already spilled out. Then, we could combine those two scenarios, and it'd mean that the info is both inside and outside the black hole at the same time \u2013 which is pretty mind-bending, because it implies that the black hole isn't really a clear boundary between the inside and the outside.","142":"I see, so the holographic principle is a way of describing how the information in a higher-dimensional space, like the one in string theory, can be encoded on a lower-dimensional surface, much like a hologram encodes a 3D image on a 2D surface. That's a pretty mind-blowing idea, and it's got some really interesting implications for our understanding of gravity and the structure of space-time.","143":"I think what's interesting is that if we assume an ultimate theory is possible, we might need to redefine what we mean by 'ultimate'.","144":"I think that's a great way to put it, it's like saying there's a dual description, and there's a perfect dictionary between them, so to argue which one's real is silly, it's like saying is French or is English real?","145":"But what if we're looking at this from the wrong angle? Could it be that gravity is not something that exists independently, but rather it's an emergent property of the quantum world?","146":"Let's start by brainstorming a list of ideas and then we can narrow it down to the most exciting one!","147":"Let's start with the fold. We'll make a crease from one corner to the other, then unfold it. Next, we'll make another crease in the opposite direction. Now, we'll lift the top layer and hold it with both hands. Bring the two top corners together to create a pocket. The tricky part is making the top layer fold smoothly along the edge. Try to keep your finger under the top layer as you do this. You'll see the sides start to come in as you work it out.","148":"So, you've seen the traditional design of the crane, but did you know that there are over 50 variations of the origami crane, each with its own unique twist? And the petal fold is a crucial element in many of those designs. Can you imagine what would happen if we were to modify the petal fold in some way? How do you think it would affect the overall shape of the crane?","149":"I can see that's a bit tricky, but you're getting the hang of it. Let's take a closer look at how the layers are interacting.","150":"What's the magic behind making it look so neat and symmetrical?","151":"We\u2019re going to start by folding the paper in half lengthwise to create a crease in the paper, and then we\u2019ll open it back up to make sure the crease is visible. This will help us as we begin to fold the cootie catcher, so let\u2019s take a look at the paper and see how it changes shape when we fold it in half.","152":"I think it's amazing, the way the flaps come up and the crow's beak and mouth are so detailed.","153":"I'd like to drill down on how blockchain technology could help stabilize the distributed power grid. Could you elaborate on how it could be used to balance energy supply and demand, especially during peak load periods or when renewable energy production varies due to weather conditions?","154":"Can you tell me more about what's holding back the development of this technology? I'm curious to understand the challenges you're facing.","155":"Ha! You're absolutely right, I was about to say that the proof of concept is actually a stepping stone to the science, not the other way around. It's funny how that works, isn't it?","156":"And then you have the same kind of thing with self-driving cars. You can't just compare them to human drivers because we all make mistakes.","157":"They often try to cover their tracks, delete any evidence of their activity, and move on to the next target.","158":"They put in place various security measures like multi-factor authentication, to prevent unauthorized access in the first place.","159":"They might get arrested or face legal consequences if they're not careful, but hopefully, they'll be able to work with the lock company to identify vulnerabilities and improve the lock's security without running into any trouble.","160":"And what do you think is the most interesting aspect of the game that the creator did, that you'd like to incorporate into your own game design?","161":"I was trying to make the game more fun for myself and my friends, and I thought that if I could change certain things, it would be a better experience for everyone.","162":"Have you shared it with anyone else, or is this the first time you've mentioned it to me?","163":"It's actually been around for decades, and it's not just sci-fi anymore \u2013 it's in the tech you use every day, like the tiny transistors in your phone's processor that make it possible to have a smartphone in your pocket.","164":"So, if you wanted to make a more complex circuit, like a logic gate, you'd have to add more components to this transistor, but that's not what's happening in modern computer chips. Instead, what's happening is that the size of the transistors is being shrunk down to fit more of them on a single chip, using techniques like lithography and etching. That's where nanotechnology comes in \u2013 it's the manipulation of materials at the nanoscale to create these tiny transistors.","165":"Actually, you can't just make them smaller and smaller, because the wavelength of light used in lithography limits how small you can make the features. So, to make them more dense, you have to find ways to use the same wavelength of light to create smaller features, or use other techniques that don't rely on light, like etching or 3D printing.","166":"It's a combination of super-advanced factories and machines that can precision-cut and etch the silicon wafers into these teeny-tiny devices, and it's also about having super-accurate control over those machines so they can make these tiny devices consistently, like a well-oiled machine.","167":"No, trade is when you give something you have, and get something you want in return, kind of like a swap, like if you have a toy you don't play with anymore and your friend has a toy they don't play with anymore, you can trade them and both get something you want.","168":"What specific thing would you trade, and what's the one thing you're hoping to get from the kid you'd trade with, and what's so special about that thing?","169":null,"170":"You're interacting with the game in a way that's actually teaching the computer how to learn from your actions, so it can get better at recognizing patterns and making decisions on its own. For example, when you press the space bar, the computer is taking that input and using it to inform its next move, and when you move your mouse or use the microphone, it's gathering more information about how you're interacting with the game.","171":"Game controller, microphone, touchscreen, fingerprint reader, voice commands, and even keyboard shortcuts.","172":"That's a great point about the camera! But I'm curious, what about other types of input devices? For example, can you think of any other devices that might allow us to interact with a computer in a more... let's say, unconventional way?","173":"I'm not sure what you're asking, could you provide more context or clarify what you mean by 'get in'? Are you referring to accessing a system, a device, or something else entirely?","174":"I think what's happening is that the Earth's gravity is warping the trajectory of the rock, but it's not strong enough to pull it back down immediately, so it keeps going up and then comes back down, kind of like a parabola. That's why we can launch things into space, because the initial velocity we give them is enough to overcome the Earth's gravity for a while, and then they can keep going in a straight line or orbit the Earth.","175":"The gravity of the Earth is what keeps the International Space Station in orbit. It's constantly falling towards the Earth, but it's also constantly moving forward at 17,000 miles an hour, which means it never actually gets closer to the Earth. It's in a state of continuous free fall, but it's also in a state of continuous orbit, which is why it's able to stay up there indefinitely.","176":"It's like being in a state of equilibrium, where all the forces are balanced, so you don't feel them.","177":"That's a pretty amazing concept, isn't it? It challenges our everyday understanding of motion and gravity, and it's mind-bending to think about how our experience of the world can be relative.","178":"You feel like you're stationary, like you're not moving, because you're looking out the window and seeing the trees and houses passing by, and it's like the world is moving, not the train.","179":"I know, right? The implications of relative motion are mind-bending. It's one of the most fascinating aspects of special relativity.","180":"But if Marina is moving really fast, that raises a question about the speed of light. Shouldn't it be different for her?","181":"That's a great point, but I was thinking more about how our brains process information while we're asleep. It's actually really interesting stuff.","182":"I was actually wondering that too! So, have you ever heard about the different ways they supposedly recharge? I've read about some pretty fascinating theories.","183":"I mean, it's a total game-changer from how humans do it, because we need a solid eight hours to feel even remotely human again, but the giraffe's like a sleep ninja, zipping in and out of these quick power naps throughout the day.","184":"What was going through your mind when you were feeling so exhausted?","185":"Hippopotamuses have some amazing adaptations that help them sleep underwater, like a thick layer of fat to keep warm and a special skin that can hold air, but I'm curious, do you think these adaptations would be useful for humans if we could somehow develop them?","186":"Imagine what it would be like to be a dolphin, able to swim through the ocean while still being able to rest and breathe. It's like having the best of both worlds!","187":"I think what's really special about dolphins is that they have this unique ability to sleep with only half of their brain at a time, which allows them to rest while still being able to breathe and swim, but what's even more fascinating is that this process is called unihemispheric slow-wave sleep, and it's a trait that's shared by only a few other animals, including whales and seals, so it's really a remarkable adaptation that helps them conserve energy and stay safe in their environment.","188":"Actually, nanotechnology is a field of science that involves working with materials that are incredibly small, on the scale of atoms and molecules. It's a pretty cool field because it allows us to create new materials and devices that have unique properties, like superconductors or materials that can absorb a lot of sunlight. I've heard it's really promising for things like medicine and energy production.","189":"A baby ant is a great example! Let's use it to explore the concept of nano. If a baby ant is about 1 centimeter long, and we divide that by 1 billion, we'd be looking at something incredibly tiny \u2013 about 1 nanometer. Can you imagine something that small?","190":"That's so cool! I've always wondered how scientists can see something that small.","191":"I would want to make a tiny car out of atoms, with wheels that spin and a engine that goes 'vroom'!","192":"That's a great question! We study tiny things because they're the building blocks of everything around us, even the things that seem magical like unicorns. Imagine a unicorn's sparkly mane is made up of tiny hair follicles and cells that work together to make it look so beautiful. By understanding how these tiny things work, we can learn more about the world and even make new discoveries that might seem like magic!","193":"I was thinking about how Realism in art and literature sought to capture the essence of everyday life, which resonates with our goals in virtual reality \u2013 making it feel more real and immersive. I think this connection to Realism is interesting because it highlights the importance of authenticity in our experiences, not just visually but also in how we interact with virtual environments.","194":"I think we're getting closer to making VR indistinguishable from reality, but it's still a ways off. I mean, we're making some amazing strides with tech like spatial audio and haptic feedback, but it's all about finding that balance between immersion and practicality. What do you think, are we heading towards a future where VR is seamless, or will it always have its own unique feel?","195":"But I think what's really interesting about this is that we can actually start to use haptics and audio in a more nuanced way to create a sense of presence, and to create a sense of immersion, by leveraging the subtleties of human perception. For instance, if you're in a virtual environment and you're walking through a forest, you could use audio to create the subtlest of sounds, like the quiet rustling of leaves or the soft chirping of birds, and you could use haptics to create a sense of tactile feedback that's not necessarily about replicating the real world, but about creating a sense of agency and control within that environment. It's not about trying to make it feel like you're really walking through a forest, but about creating a sense of presence and immersion that's tailored to the user's individual experiences and expectations.","196":"I think that's one of the reasons why VR is becoming more accessible to non-gaming audiences, because companies are recognizing the need to prioritize user experience and create content that's tailored to specific industries, like film and education, rather than just relying on generic experiences.","197":"You're referring to the LIGO experiment, which detected gravitational waves from the merger of two black holes. That's a significant finding in the field of gravitational physics.","198":"That's correct, but what I meant to say is that in free fall, you'd feel weightless because the acceleration due to gravity is the same as the acceleration of the elevator, so you wouldn't feel any force pulling you down.","199":"You're in free fall, and what's striking is that you feel weightless. The sensation of being pulled towards the ground is absent because you're falling alongside the gravitational field. Your motion is being shaped by the curvature of space-time, rather than being influenced by a force that's acting on you from a distance. That's the core insight behind Einstein's thought experiment: gravity isn't a force that pulls you towards something, but rather a manifestation of the geometry of space-time.","200":"I'm curious, what if we were to simulate a scenario where the planet's gravity is, say, 20% weaker than Earth's? How would that affect the trajectory of the object you threw?","201":"the ball would hit the ground and probably bounce back up!","202":"I was just wondering, what makes someone's face so expressive, you know?","203":"It's incredible to be able to stargaze here without the city lights, don't you think?","204":"Let me try to simplify that for you. Imagine you have multiple layers or levels, and each one has its own unique characteristics. We can think of compactification as a way of folding up those extra dimensions, making them harder to see and understand. It's a bit like taking a big piece of paper and folding it up to make it smaller, but in this case, we're talking about the fabric of space and time itself.","205":"Well, in string theory, the idea is that the fundamental building blocks of the universe are tiny, vibrating strings that exist in more than the three dimensions we experience. It's a pretty mind-bending concept, but essentially, it suggests that the universe has extra dimensions beyond the three we're familiar with, which is what allows these strings to vibrate and give rise to the particles we observe.","206":"So, what string theory suggests is that our four-dimensional spacetime is actually a subset of a ten-dimensional space, and we need to figure out how to reconcile these two different descriptions of reality.","207":"Actually, I think you might be oversimplifying it a bit - string theory doesn't just propose that the fundamental building blocks are vibrating strings, but it also tries to unify the fundamental forces of nature, including gravity, by proposing that these strings vibrate at different frequencies, which correspond to different particles, and it's a highly speculative and mathematically complex theory, so it's not just about strings, it's about how they interact and give rise to the universe we observe.","208":"It's something that produces vibrations, like a guitar string or a drumhead, but in a way that's not directly visible.","209":null,"210":"Well, it's thought that the vibrational modes of these strings correspond to different energy levels, and it's the intricate interplay between these modes that gives rise to the diverse properties of the particles we observe, such as mass, charge, and spin. The idea is that the unique combination of vibrational modes determines the specific particle, much like how a musical instrument's timbre is shaped by the interplay of its various harmonics. So, for instance, a string vibrating in a certain pattern might give rise to an electron, while another pattern might yield a quark or a photon, each with its distinct characteristics.","211":"I'm curious, what's the most mind-blowing implication of string theory that you think is still not well understood or needs more exploration?","212":"I'm glad you have a good grasp of the basics. To break it down further, blockchain is essentially a decentralized, digital ledger that records transactions across a network of computers. It's often compared to a database, but it's more like a distributed, transparent accounting system that ensures the integrity of each transaction.","213":"I think one of the most significant implications of machines being actors in the system is that it challenges our traditional understanding of agency and decision-making. By integrating machines into the equation, we're no longer just dealing with human motivations and behaviors, but also with the complex interactions between machines and their impact on the system's dynamics. This requires a more nuanced approach, one that takes into account the autonomous nature of these machines and their potential to influence the system in unpredictable ways.","214":"One of the biggest challenges is going to be making the technology work for more people, so it needs to be faster, safer, and easier to use.","215":null,"216":"The potential is huge, but we need to figure out how to make it more accessible and user-friendly before it can reach its full potential.","217":"One thing that's really challenging about taking these nanomaterials and turning them into better batteries is figuring out how to scale up the process without losing the properties that make them so promising. It's a bit like trying to bottle lightning - we can make something amazing in the lab, but then we have to think about how to make it work in the real world.","218":"For instance, we have to figure out how to accurately model and predict the material's behavior in a battery context, which is a significant challenge given the complex interactions between the material's properties and the battery's performance metrics.","219":"Origami is particularly useful in applications where a flat state is involved because it allows for a precise and efficient way of transitioning between different states, such as folding and unfolding, by leveraging the mathematical principles underlying origami. This is why origami is often used in deployable systems, such as space applications, where a flat state is necessary for deployment and a 3D state is required for functionality.","220":"I think origami lends itself well to applications like this because of its inherent flexibility and modularity. The fact that origami models can be designed to fold and unfold in a specific way allows for a high degree of customization and adaptability, making it an attractive solution for a wide range of problems. For example, in the case of the lamp, the origami design enables it to be compact and easy to ship, while also providing a unique and functional form when deployed.","221":"Actually, if we're making a wheel for a rover, we'll need to scale up the design significantly, not necessarily hundreds of yards of origami, but rather a large, precise, and repeatable folding process.","222":"We're using a machine that can actually fold it into this shape, not just make the creases, but actually fold it into the three-dimensional structure. It's a pretty cool process, we're talking about a robotic arm that can apply the fold pattern and then compress it to get the desired shape, kind of like a 3D printer but instead of printing it, it's folding it into the final product.","223":"What specifically comes to mind when you hear the term blockchain, and what do you think it's used for?","224":"Isn't this just a new way for people to shop on Amazon or eBay, without needing a middleman?","225":"I see, so the technology is essentially creating a new layer of trust and verification that doesn't rely on intermediaries. Can you tell me more about how this impacts the traditional business models of these middlemen?","226":"So, one of the ways blockchain helps with that is by creating a permanent record of every transaction. It's like a digital fingerprint that proves the deal happened.","227":"What aspects of sleep disturbances and neurodegenerative diseases are you currently investigating, and what are the most interesting findings you've come across so far?","228":"Actually, we've also found a significant association between sleep apnea and beta-amyloid accumulation in our meta-analysis, with a ratio of 1.42, indicating a 42% elevated risk of developing Alzheimer's in individuals with beta-amyloid accumulation compared to those without.","229":"And I think that's been really well supported in the literature, with studies in mice showing that disrupting the normal clearance of beta-amyloid, such as through the knockdown of certain genes, leads to the accumulation of amyloid and subsequent changes in sleep patterns. This suggests a mechanistic link between amyloid clearance and sleep regulation, where impaired clearance may drive sleep disturbances, and conversely, sleep disturbances may exacerbate amyloid accumulation, highlighting the complex interplay between these two processes.","230":"I'm not sure I understand the connection between beta-amyloid and sleep. Can you elaborate on that?","231":"I'm really curious about how sleep affects our brain's waste management system, and how that relates to neurodegenerative diseases. I think it's cool that researchers are looking into how sleep can help clear out beta-amyloid, but I'd love to hear more about what that means for our daily lives and how we can use that knowledge to prevent or even reverse damage. Can you tell me more about that?","232":"Let's see... if we fold this square in half diagonally to create a triangle, then fold it in half again, we can create the crane's body. Next, we can fold out the two top corners to create the crane's wings. Can you see how the paper is starting to take shape?","233":null,"234":"And now that we have a basic understanding of the circle packing technique, let's see how we can apply it to create the different features of the spider.","235":"So, what we're seeing is that the five circles of the crane are actually the five flaps of the bird's wings when they're folded up, and it seems like the smaller circles are likely the legs and the antenna.","236":"Now, let's see how we can build upon these basic shapes to create more intricate designs, like animals and insects. By breaking them down into their component parts, we can see the beauty in their simplicity.","237":"It's really fascinating work, especially now that we understand viruses better. To be honest, I'm not aware of any viruses that build nanostructures on their own. But we were inspired by the way certain organisms, like the abalone, can build complex materials like their shells using the materials available in their environment. So, we wondered, could we program a virus to build something similar, like a solar cell or a battery, using the same principles?","238":"So I think one of the key areas of interest for us is how we can take this idea of using biological systems to build materials and scale it up to make large quantities of those materials, which is exactly where we see a potential intersection with the work that you're doing, in terms of being able to synthesize and characterize these materials at a large scale, and I'm curious to explore how your research on bacteriophages could potentially inform our own efforts to develop more efficient and scalable methods for creating these materials.","239":"So, to clarify, you're using these bacteriophages as tiny molecular factories, where you can program them to produce specific materials by introducing new DNA sequences that encode for the desired proteins. And then, by leveraging the inherent properties of DNA and the predictable folding of proteins, you can control the composition and structure of the materials being produced. It's a remarkable example of biomimicry, where nature's own building blocks are being repurposed to create novel materials with specific properties.","240":"That's amazing, and it's like a big engineering puzzle, isn't it? The precision required to pack all those delicate instruments into a tiny space, and then have them unfurl and work perfectly in the vastness of space. It's mind-boggling to think about the complexity of it all.","241":null,"242":"So, let's talk about the engineering challenges of deploying these compact systems in space. What do you think are some of the most critical factors that need to be considered?","243":"We\u2019ll fold the rectangles multiple times, aligning the edges and creasing the corners to create a stable structure.","244":"The motion is quite non-linear, which makes it ideal for applications like solar arrays, where compactness is crucial, allowing you to pack a lot of material into a small space.","245":"You'd want to make sure the panels unfold smoothly, so the motion is controlled and synchronized, right?","246":null,"247":"Yeah, and that's what makes origami and mechanism design so fascinating \u2013 it's all about finding that balance between form and function, and there's no one-size-fits-all solution. It's a constant trade-off between efficiency, aesthetics, and practicality.","248":"But what's really cool is that this material has a unique property called shape memory, which allows it to change its shape in response to temperature changes. This means that it can be designed to expand or contract as needed, making it ideal for deployable structures that need to adapt to changing environments, like the Mars Rover application you mentioned. The fact that it can also change color when twisted quickly is just an added bonus!","249":"Actually, I think it's really cool how virtual reality uses things like sensors and head-tracking technology to create a more immersive experience. It's like the technology is trying to trick your brain into thinking you're really there. I've heard that it's still a bit of a mystery how our brains process visual information and distinguish between what's real and what's not, so it's interesting to think about how VR can manipulate that.","250":"And that's a great point, because in VR, we use a similar technique to create a sense of depth and immersion. By showing a different image to each eye, we can trick the brain into thinking that objects are farther away or closer, which is a key aspect of creating a believable virtual environment.","251":null,"252":null,"253":null,"254":"Let's imagine the B flat as a beautiful blue note, surrounded by a vibrant green treble clef and a gentle purple staff.","255":"I'm really into biology, I love learning about how living things adapt and evolve over time.","256":"I mean, have you ever noticed how things fall down when you drop them, but also how a thrown ball follows a curved path? That's pretty cool, right?","257":null,"258":"Let me think of an analogy - imagine you're on a train, and you want to tell a friend where you are. If you're in a one-dimensional world, you'd just need to tell them how many stops back you are from the end of the line. That's it - no need to give them any other information. You're just moving in one direction, and that's all they need to know.","259":"Okay, so let me break it down for you. The x-axis, which is typically the horizontal axis, represents the independent variable or the input, whereas the y-axis, which is usually the vertical axis, represents the dependent variable or the output. Think of it like a recipe: the ingredients are the independent variables, and the dish that's being cooked is the dependent variable. Does that make sense?","260":"you're saying that everything has a certain dimensionality, but the thing is, we don't really understand what that dimensionality means or how it works, right?","261":"That's a great example of how machine learning is used in real-world applications. But what's really interesting is how Gmail's algorithm learns to distinguish between spam and non-spam emails. It's not just about keywords or sender-receiver relationships, but also about understanding the context and patterns in the emails. For instance, if you're receiving a lot of emails with suspicious links, the algorithm might start to flag those as potential spam, even if they don't contain any obvious keywords. It's a complex process that involves a lot of data analysis and pattern recognition, and it's what makes machine learning so powerful in applications like email filtering.","262":"Likewise, if the email contained links or attachments, that would raise suspicions, but it's also worth considering the tone and language used in the email, such as if it's overly formal or if it contains generic greetings, which could be indicative of spam.","263":"Yes, absolutely. There's a process called feature extraction, where the machine itself looks at the data and identifies patterns or relationships that could be indicative of a particular feature, such as the presence of Russian characters in the email. This is different from feature engineering, where a human explicitly identifies features that might be relevant. The machine can then use these automatically extracted features to make predictions.","264":"Well, in unsupervised learning, the algorithms typically involve techniques like k-means clustering, hierarchical clustering, or dimensionality reduction techniques like PCA, which all involve projecting the data into a lower-dimensional space to facilitate feature extraction and pattern recognition. This allows us to identify underlying structures and relationships in the data that may not be immediately apparent. In contrast, supervised learning algorithms are often focused on feature extraction and pattern recognition as well, but they're typically designed to optimize a specific performance metric, such as accuracy or precision. So, how do you think the choice between unsupervised and supervised learning would impact the type of insights we could gain from a dataset?","265":"I don't think that's a fair comparison, actually. Reinforcement learning is more about learning from feedback, rather than just trying everything. In the case of a Roomba, it's really just a pre-programmed robot that's following a set of rules, whereas reinforcement learning is about adapting to a situation and learning from trial and error, but also from the feedback it receives.","266":"Well, it really depends on the problem you're trying to solve. If you're dealing with complex, high-dimensional data, or if you need to model sequential or temporal relationships, deep learning algorithms might be a better fit. On the other hand, if you're working with a system that can interact with an environment and adapt to changing conditions, reinforcement learning could be more suitable. Additionally, if you're trying to optimize a specific objective function, reinforcement learning might be a better choice.","267":"If you choose the wrong approach, you might end up with a model that's good at predicting things, but it's like trying to navigate a map without knowing the terrain - you'll get to the right place, but you'll have no idea how you got there or why it's relevant. What do you think would happen in that situation?","268":"Actually, that's a great point about the model being too complex to interpret. It's a bit like having a crystal ball that's accurate, but you can't decipher the underlying mechanics. So, we need to strike a balance between model accuracy and interpretability, which is a major challenge in machine learning. By developing more transparent and explainable AI systems, we can unlock the full potential of machine learning and make it more useful in real-world applications.","269":"That's a great point about interpretable systems. Building on that, one way to improve machine learning algorithms is to focus on explainability and transparency. This can be achieved by incorporating techniques like feature importance and partial dependence plots, which can help us understand why the model is making certain predictions. Additionally, we can explore methods like model interpretability techniques and human-in-the-loop approaches, which can provide more insights into the model's decision-making process.","270":"I think that's a very good point, and it's not just the wiring diagram, it's also the dynamic nature of the brain, the way the connections are formed and reformed over time, and the varied roles that different types of cells and neural structures play, that's going to be really hard to capture in a static image like a connectome.","271":"I'm trying to develop algorithms that can analyze brain activity and identify patterns, but it seems like you're talking about something else entirely, can you clarify what you mean by 'trace neural connections in brains'?","272":null,"273":"Hi, I've been thinking a lot about our past and how things turned out. It's crazy how life takes unexpected turns, and I'm still trying to process everything. What about you, how have you been?","274":"I suppose that's the ultimate prize, but it's not the only one \u2013 there are plenty of other breakthroughs waiting to be made, and I'm excited to see what the future holds for our team.","275":"If we can achieve that, we'll have a way to create high-energy particles, which is a major breakthrough in physics.","276":"Or we could explore alternative approaches, like using advanced computational methods or novel experimental techniques, to see if they can provide new insights or breakthroughs in our current plateau.","277":"Actually, that's an interesting idea. I was thinking we could explore using beam combining technology to boost the power output without needing to accelerate the particles as much. What do you think about that approach?","278":"That's right, it's a huge challenge, but the real hurdle is actually getting the two beams to overlap perfectly in space, at the same time, which requires a high degree of precision in terms of aperture size, wavelength control, and adaptive optics to ensure the uniformity of the phase across the entire beam profile. We'll need to carefully design and calibrate our system to achieve this level of accuracy, which is why we're working closely with experts in the field to develop the necessary technologies and techniques.","279":"But with the advancements in laser technology, we're not only able to tackle the challenge of phase locking across the beam, but also explore new possibilities in high-energy physics, gravity waves, and even medicine, which is why this project is so exciting.","280":"Actually, I think it was a malware-infected email that was opened by an employee on the point of sale system that gave the hackers access to Target's network. The hackers then used that access to install malware on the point of sale systems, which allowed them to steal customer credit card information.","281":"By exploiting a buffer overflow vulnerability, the hackers can inject malicious code into the system, potentially allowing them to execute arbitrary commands, access sensitive data, or even take control of the entire network. This is a classic example of how a seemingly innocuous device like a deli meat scale can be used as a foothold to gain access to a larger network, and how the lack of proper security measures can lead to catastrophic consequences.","282":"A common vulnerability occurs when a system allocates a fixed amount of memory for data storage, but then writes more data than it can hold. This excess data can spill over into adjacent areas of memory, potentially overwriting critical information, such as function pointers or memory addresses, which can be exploited to execute unauthorized code.","283":"And that's why you're interested in buffer overloading, right? Because you want to know how it works and how it can be used to cause a segmentation fault, which is a critical aspect of network security and designing software for penetration testing, especially in the context of exploiting vulnerabilities in systems with limited protection mechanisms.","284":"When designing software for penetration testing, understanding buffer overflows is crucial because it's a common technique used in network attacks that can allow an attacker to execute malicious code on a target system. This is why developers need to design software with security in mind, preventing such attacks from occurring and ensuring the integrity of the system. In fact, buffer overflows are often used in real-world attacks, so it's essential to stay up-to-date with the latest security measures and techniques to protect against them. For example, in the context of network security, buffer overflows can be used to inject malicious code into a system, which can then be exploited by an attacker. This is why understanding buffer overflows is a critical aspect of network security and software design.","285":"I think one of the things that's really interesting to me is how computer science and information security can be used to address global challenges, like ensuring the security and integrity of critical infrastructure, or protecting sensitive information from unauthorized access. This is a fascinating area where technology meets policy and diplomacy, and I think it's an exciting space to explore.","286":"That's a good point, and it's also interesting that the NSA's efforts to break these systems are actually creating a kind of paradox, where the US government is funding tools to evade censorship, but at the same time, the NSA is working to undermine those very same tools, which raises questions about the US government's commitment to promoting internet freedom and access.","287":"I've actually heard about how people use lasers for various applications, such as cutting materials or creating holograms. I'm curious to learn more about the specific ways lasers are used in your field of study.","288":"I was just curious, do you have any pets at home?","289":"That's fascinating. But why does the light bend when it hits the corner of the glass? Is it because of the way the glass is structured or something else entirely?","290":"So, by shining the laser around the corner, we can actually see how it behaves as it bends around the edge, which is really cool because it helps us understand how light interacts with different surfaces and shapes. It's almost like we're getting a glimpse of what's hiding from view, and that's exactly what makes lasers so useful for exploring and observing things that are out of sight.","291":"I've played with lasers before, but I've never seen one like this that can bend around corners. What's the story behind this one?","292":"I've noticed that when I do that, the laser's beam can be really intense, almost like a red glow, but it's not quite the same as seeing a shooting star, is it?","293":null,"294":null,"295":"So it's kind of like that, where the memory is just a bunch of gates, and if you can find a way to manipulate those gates in a certain way, you can actually get access to information that's not supposed to be accessible. And that's kind of what Rowhammer found, it's just that they discovered a specific vulnerability in how memory is accessed, where certain patterns of reads and writes can cause unintended changes to the memory, allowing for security breaches. ","296":"I think that's what's so concerning, though - the shift from being able to inspect and potentially fix your own device to being forced to rely on the manufacturer's support, which can be limited and expensive.","297":"I'm curious, do you think it's always right to release vulnerabilities to the public when you find them?","298":"I think that's a great point. If companies are trying to limit our ability to inspect our own property, it's essentially stripping us of our right to know what we own and making it harder for us to make informed decisions about it.","299":"You have banks and other financial institutions that act as intermediaries between people who have money and those who need it, helping to facilitate transactions and manage money flows. They do this by maintaining a shared record of transactions, which is essentially a digital ledger that's updated and verified by multiple parties in real-time.","300":"We'd use blockchain to create a permanent, public record of all transactions, so everyone can see the same history. But to ensure it's secure, we'd also use cryptography to encode the transactions, making them difficult to alter or manipulate.","301":"We use cryptography to scramble the information so that only authorized people can access it and make sure it's accurate.","302":"I'm glad you're getting a sense of it, so what do you think is the most interesting part so far?","303":"I'm actually really curious about how the properties of the chirped pulse affect the amplification process. Does the chirp have a significant impact on the gain medium, and are there any specific challenges that come up when trying to amplify a chirped pulse?","304":"So, to make it simple, chirped pulse amplification is a technique that allows us to amplify a laser pulse by stretching it out, making it easier to amplify, and then compressing it back to its original duration, creating a powerful and intense beam that can be used for various applications, including high-energy physics research.","305":"Yes, the idea of a laser hammer is still the same \u2013 a short, high-energy pulse that can be used to interact with matter. The key difference with the chirped pulse laser is that it allows us to produce this high-energy pulse in a way that's safe for the laser itself, whereas other lasers can be damaged by their own light.","306":"The mode locker is actually a device that helps to synchronize the different colors of light in the laser, allowing them to combine and cancel each other out, which creates the short pulse. It's kind of like a timing device that ensures all the colors start and finish together, creating a precise and coherent beam of light.","307":"I started learning music theory, and I was really fascinated by the way different notes and chords interacted to create harmony and counterpoint. I spent countless hours studying and experimenting with different compositions, and I even tried my hand at writing my own music. But what really sparked my interest was listening to singing, especially the barbershop quartet style, which I found incredibly beautiful and harmonically rich. As a violinist, I was also drawn to the way the human voice could produce such a wide range of tonal colors and textures, and I loved exploring the similarities and differences between the two instruments.","308":"That's a great point, and it's fascinating to think about how the overtones are embedded within the notes themselves, even if they're not explicitly played. It's almost like the notes are carrying hidden harmonies that become apparent when the chord is perfectly tuned.","309":null,"310":"Let's see how we can apply the principles of inversion to the chord progression we've been exploring, using the F major chord as an example. I think it could be really interesting to see how rearranging the notes within that chord can create new harmonies and add some variety to our progression.","311":"You're gonna play it on the guitar, and see how it sounds!","312":"I'm starting to feel like we're just scratching the surface of music theory, and you're casually dropping these complex concepts like they're everyday conversation topics. Do you ever get overwhelmed by the depth of it all, or is this just a normal day for you?","313":"I see what you mean about the dark side, actually I was trying to avoid that, but you're right, it can be really beautiful and powerful when used correctly. I think what you're getting at is that it's not just about adding dissonance, but about creating a sense of tension and release that adds depth to the music.","314":"I think that's a really cool way to think about it, and it's amazing how music can evoke emotions like that, don't you?","315":"It's the intricate network of neural pathways that helps your brain process thoughts, emotions, and experiences. Think of it like a vast, ever-changing cityscape, with neurons as buildings and synapses as the roads connecting them. By mapping this complex landscape, scientists can gain insights into how our brains function, learn, and adapt \u2013 and maybe even unlock new ways to support brain health and cognition.","316":"But that's exactly what I'm trying to get at \u2013 if we could replicate the workings of the human brain in a machine, would that machine, in essence, be conscious and capable of experiencing emotions, just like us?","317":"Can you elaborate on what you mean by 'temporal order from neuron to neuron and region to region'? ","318":"I'm curious, what aspect of brain mapping do you think is particularly sensitive, the technology itself, the data it's based on, or something else that's at play?","319":"But what you did see was a proof that I know the combination, without seeing any information about the combination itself, which is actually pretty cool when you think about it.","320":"A zero-knowledge proof is a method that lets you convince someone else that you know something is true, without actually telling them what that something is. This is particularly useful in situations where you want to prove something without revealing sensitive information, like in cryptographic protocols or secure online transactions. For example, it can be used to prove that you own a certain digital asset without revealing what that asset is.","321":"That's fascinating. But what if I'm not entirely sure what this secret is? Can you walk me through the process of how a zero-knowledge proof works, even if the details are fuzzy?","322":"What's the earliest memory that made a lasting impression on you, and how did it influence your interest in science?","323":"That memory has clearly had a lasting impact on your life, and it's fascinating to see how it has influenced your interests and career path. Can you tell me more about what you think it is about that experience that has stuck with you, and how you think it has shaped your perspective on the world?","324":"What's fascinating is that when we look at the brain's activity during different memory tasks, we see that the lines between explicit and implicit memories are blurry. The prefrontal cortex, which is involved in explicit memory, like recalling a specific event, is also active when we're doing implicit tasks, like learning a new skill. And vice versa. The striatum, which is key for implicit memory, shows up in explicit memory tasks too. It's like the brain is using a combination of different regions to navigate and make sense of our experiences. And I think that's what makes our brains so amazing \u2013 their ability to adapt, to learn, and to create new connections between different pieces of information.","325":"That's a fascinating point, and it ties in perfectly with the idea that our memories are not just passive records of the past, but are actively being constructed and reconstructed in our brains all the time. It's almost as if our brains are constantly updating and refining our memories to fit the present, and that's what makes them so malleable and prone to error.","326":"I'm still trying to understand how you connect your love for math to the photo.","327":"I'm trying to make you think you can figure it out, but actually, I'm just stalling because I don't want to tell you, and you're right to be skeptical about believing me.","328":"You see the puffin now, but you didn't before. That means it must have been hidden behind the poster the whole time. Zero-knowledge proof is a way to prove that something is true without actually revealing what it is. That's what I'm trying to do here with the puffin.","329":"I'm interested in zero-knowledge proof because of its potential to revolutionize secure authentication methods. If we could develop a system where people can prove their identity without revealing sensitive information, it could have a huge impact on protecting people's privacy online and offline.","330":null,"331":null,"332":"I mean, if we think about it, adding one more guest to an infinite number of guests doesn't change the fact that we still have an infinite number of guests. It's a pretty weird property of infinity, right?","333":"So, if we add another guest, would it be two plus infinity equals infinity, but with some kind of limit or restriction on the number of rooms we can create?","334":"So each time we shift the guest to the next higher-numbered room, we're effectively leaving one room vacant, allowing us to create a new space without actually adding any new rooms.","335":"That's correct, infinity is the answer. And to be more precise, we can talk about different types of infinity, like countable and uncountable infinity. In mathematics, countable infinity refers to a set that can be put into a one-to-one correspondence with the natural numbers, whereas uncountable infinity refers to a set that is too large to be put into a one-to-one correspondence with the natural numbers. This distinction is crucial in many areas of mathematics, including calculus and real analysis.","336":"Infinity's a wild card in math. It's like this hotel example - you can keep adding rooms, but it's not like you're running out of space, because there's always another room. It's trippy to think about, but it's actually really useful for understanding some weird math concepts.","337":"So, you were working with robots that followed pre-programmed instructions, right? But I was more focused on the data analysis and machine learning side of things, and I'd love to hear more about your experience with those robots and how it differed from what I was doing.","338":"I was thinking maybe it's like the robot's internal state, like its proprioception and its sensors, and how it maps its actions to the environment.","339":"I think you're right that motion is an important aspect of robotics, but I'd say that perception and understanding language are actually the more complex tasks for robots to learn. They require a much deeper understanding of the environment and the ability to interpret and respond to subtle cues, which can be challenging even for humans to do well.","340":"Do you think we could make the most of the data we already have, rather than just collecting more? Maybe use it in a way that's more efficient or effective?","341":"I'm intrigued by the idea of a recursive definition for fractals. You mentioned the Mandelbrot set, which is a great example. But how does that relate to the concept of self-similarity that fractals often exhibit? Is it possible to define a fractal as a geometric shape that displays self-similarity at multiple scales, and if so, how would you capture that in a mathematical definition?","342":"I'd say the fractal dimension is a way to quantify the intricate patterns and self-similarity that are characteristic of fractals. It's a measure that can be applied to various types of fractals, not just those defined by simple polynomials like the Mandelbrot or Julia sets. The dimension itself doesn't necessarily relate to the physical space in which the fractal is represented, but rather to the way the pattern scales and repeats within itself.","343":"I think what's interesting about the number three is that it represents a balance between the ball's volume and its surface area.","344":"I'm not sure I follow what you mean by 'dimensions depending on how it's shaped.' Could you clarify what you're getting at? Maybe we can explore this idea together and see if we can come to a better understanding of what's happening with the paper when you crumple it.","345":"because I'm covering it with two boxes, and then you're covering it with four boxes, and that's why you need four boxes. But if I cut that box in half again, I'll need even more boxes to cover the line, because the line gets more wiggly and harder to cover. That's the key point - the number of boxes grows faster when the line is more complicated.","346":"That's right, and it's a fascinating example of how the complexity of a shape can affect our measurement of its length. By using fractals, we can create shapes that have a non-integer dimension, which leads to the interesting property that the number of boxes needed to cover the coastline grows faster than it would for a straight line.","347":"And that's the key insight of box counting, isn't it? The estimate of the coastline's length changes with the scale of measurement, so if you use bigger boxes, you'll get a coarser estimate, but if you use smaller boxes, you'll get a more detailed estimate.","348":"Yeah, that's right! Perlin noise is a fundamental algorithm in computer graphics, and it's still widely used today. I think what's really interesting about it is how it was developed to address the limitations of early computer graphics, which were often too blocky and artificial-looking. Ken Perlin's work built on the ideas of Mandelbrot and others, who were exploring the properties of fractals and how they could be used to create more realistic textures and patterns.","349":"pick up the cup and carefully place it on the other side.","350":"Let's observe how the robot handles the box. We'll program it to pick up the box, inspect its contents, and then drop it again.","351":"If it's looking at the cup, it's probably not going to move over here without some issues. That's what I'd expect to see. I'm curious, what do you think the robot would do in this situation?","352":"A math problem, like 2+2.","353":"I'm not sure what you mean by'really hard homework', but computers can definitely help with tasks that involve a lot of calculations, like solving equations or simulating complex systems. But they're not like magic tools that can just make your homework disappear \u2013 they're more like really powerful assistants that can help you find the answers on your own.","354":"Let's say, for instance, I want to prove to you that I can solve a certain mathematical problem without actually telling you the solution. It's a bit like showing you a puzzle and saying 'I've solved it,' without showing you the answer.","355":"Exactly, and what's fascinating is that you won't even know which specific attributes or operations I'm relying on to prove the statement, or how I derived them, which is what makes zero-knowledge proofs so powerful and secure.","356":"So, let's say I want to prove to you that I have at least 0.2 Bitcoins without revealing what the address is of your account. I can use a cryptographic protocol that allows me to prove this statement without actually revealing the account information. This way, you can be sure that I have at least 0.2 Bitcoins, but you won't know which specific account it's associated with.","357":"We can take the map of countries that represents the Bitcoin balance, and then use zero-knowledge proofs to show that it's three-colorable, which in turn proves that you have at least 0.2 Bitcoins, without revealing any information about the map or the balance.","358":"So what do you think about the colors of the other countries on the map?","359":"Exactly, and that's what makes this approach so clever. By not giving you the information directly, we're actually giving you the tools to verify it for yourself.","360":"That's a big change! I'm curious, did you intentionally switch to blue, or did you notice it changed automatically?","361":"I think zero-knowledge proofs are a powerful tool that can provide both practical benefits for implementation and structural guarantees about the security of the system. They can be used to demonstrate that certain properties hold without revealing any sensitive information, which can be really useful in scenarios where transparency is not necessary but security is. For example, in voting systems or secure multi-party computation, zero-knowledge proofs can help ensure that the system is working correctly without compromising the privacy of the participants.","362":"So, when you say 'implementations,' I'm assuming you're referring to the practical steps taken to bring a concept or idea to life. Is that correct?","363":"I think one of the key aspects that makes this topic so compelling, and also a bit mind-bending, is the way it challenges our intuitive understanding of concepts like infinity and the nature of numbers, which are fundamental to mathematics, but also have deep implications for philosophy and our understanding of the world.","364":"I think that's one of the most intriguing aspects of this, because it makes me wonder about the nature of mathematical truth. If the foundations of mathematics change, does that mean the truth of a theorem changes too? For instance, if we switch from set theory to dependent type theory, would the theorems we've proven in set theory still hold in dependent type theory? That's a question that's been on my mind lately.","365":"We had an epic water balloon fight that left us all soaked and laughing!","366":"I think I used the dark blue one, but I'm not entirely sure \u2013 can you remind me what happened with that towel?","367":"I think that's a great point about making space for new things, but it still doesn't explain why we tend to remember the fun and exciting parts of our experiences. Is it possible that the brain is prioritizing certain types of information over others, like emotional or sensory details?","368":"Actually, I think you're on the right track, but the way I'd phrase it is that our brain selects and consolidates certain memories as important, but that's a bit different from saying it decides which memories are important to us. It's more about how our brain processes and prioritizes the information it receives.","369":"And so, it's a bit like measuring the length of a coastline, but in a more abstract sense. We can't directly measure the length of the fractal, just like we can't directly measure the length of a coastline, because it's a continuous curve.","370":"I think that's a great question. A planet or an asteroid wouldn't be considered a fractal because they don't exhibit self-similarity at different scales. Their size and shape are fixed, and they don't have repeating patterns. But I think it's interesting to consider how the concept of fractals might apply to more complex systems, like planetary surfaces or asteroid terrain, where you might see self-similar patterns in the way rocks or craters are distributed. That would be a great topic for further exploration.","371":"And that's the really interesting thing about fractals \u2013 the more measurements you take, the longer the coastline appears to be, and it's a never-ending process. No matter how small you make your measurements, you'll always find more detail and more complexity, which is why fractals are often described as having infinite length.","372":"I'm so curious, what's it like to experience the world through your senses? Do you have a favorite sense or one that you find particularly magical?","373":"I was thinking maybe it's a stress ball, but it looks too big for that. Am I close?","374":"Exactly, and that's where imaging technologies like x-rays or even CT scans come in. They allow us to peer inside the material, revealing the internal structure and composition. It's like getting a 3D map of the material's innards, which can give us a much better understanding of its properties and behavior.","375":"So, how does our sensing method compare to an MRI scan in terms of non-invasiveness?","376":"To be honest, I got into quantum sensing because I've always been fascinated by the intersection of materials science and physics, and how we can use that to make really cool stuff. I mean, it's still a pretty new field, so there's a lot of room to explore and figure out what's possible.","377":"You have to be pretty close to the nitrogen-vacancy center to pick up that single electron. That's actually one of the reasons they use diamond as the substrate - it's really dense, so you can get close without losing the signal in the bulk material. I mean, that's why they can do this at room temperature, right?","378":null,"379":"But what's impressive is that even with these advancements, the technology still faces significant challenges in scaling up to practical applications, don't you think?","380":"I think one of the key challenges they'll face is the need to integrate and synthesize the vast amounts of data being generated across different fields, which will require new approaches to interdisciplinary collaboration and knowledge sharing. Additionally, the increasing complexity of scientific problems will necessitate the development of more sophisticated tools and methods for modeling and simulation, which will be a significant challenge in and of itself.","381":"I've heard that the field of quantum computing is moving so fast that it's challenging for even the most experienced researchers to keep up with the latest developments. What strategies do you use to stay current and ensure that your work remains relevant in this rapidly evolving field?","382":"Your turn response here","383":"If you zoom in on a shape in Minecraft, you'll start to see individual blocks and their textures, but it's not necessarily a perfect analogy for recursion. Recursion is more about a function calling itself, whereas Minecraft's rendering is more of a procedural generation of blocks based on the game's rules.","384":"That's right, recursion is a key concept in computer graphics. In fact, it's often used to generate complex shapes and patterns by iteratively applying a set of rules to create detailed and realistic models. Think of it like a digital version of a Russian nesting doll, where each level of detail is built upon the previous one, creating a sense of depth and complexity. This is particularly useful in computer graphics because it allows us to create smooth and curved surfaces, like those found in nature, from a series of flat polygons. For example, a recursive algorithm can be used to create a tree by repeatedly subdividing a polygon into smaller and smaller branches, each one more detailed than the last. This is just one example of how recursion is used in computer graphics to create realistic and detailed models.","385":"I'd love to explain subdivision surfaces because it's a great example of how fractals can be used in computer graphics. It's actually really closely related to what we were just talking about with recursive procedures. So, fractals can be used to create detailed images by recursively applying a procedure, and subdivision surfaces uses a similar idea to create smooth surfaces in 3D graphics by recursively subdividing a surface into smaller pieces. It's a really powerful technique that's widely used in computer graphics, and it's actually pretty interesting to see how it works.","386":"I'm trying to show that even if we remove the corners of these polygons one by one, the overall shape still doesn't become smooth and rounded, so this approach isn't working as expected.","387":"Well, it's fascinating to think about how the rendering process has evolved over time. The first Pixar movie, Toy Story, took about 18 months to render, but with advancements in computer technology, the process has become significantly faster. Now, we're talking about hours, days, or even weeks, depending on the complexity of the scene. However, despite these improvements, there are still challenges in achieving photorealism, particularly when it comes to capturing the intricate details of real-world objects. Researchers are actively exploring new techniques, such as using fractals to generate more realistic textures and patterns, but it's a complex problem that requires a deep understanding of both mathematics and computer science.","388":"One of the current challenges in applying fractals to computer science is that they can be difficult to control and predict, especially when it comes to generating high-quality images or animations. However, researchers are exploring new techniques, such as using fractal noise or multi-fractal analysis, to improve the efficiency and consistency of fractal-based rendering. This could potentially enable more realistic and detailed visualizations in fields like computer graphics, game development, and scientific visualization.","389":"And to be more specific, ARPANET was initially developed as a project by the United States Department of Defense's Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA), with the primary goal of creating a network that could withstand a nuclear attack by routing data through multiple paths, ensuring that critical communication remained functional even if some parts of the network were destroyed.","390":"If I understand correctly, packet switching would allow for a network that's more adaptable and resilient, even if some parts of it go down, because it can reroute traffic through other paths. This would mean that the network's edges would handle the complexity and potential failures, rather than the core of the network.","391":"And that's why we have TCP\/IP, which is a protocol that ensures packets are delivered reliably, even if the network is congested or parts of it fail, which aligns with the robust and survivable communication forms the Department of Defense wanted to achieve.","392":"Exactly, and that's a great example of abstraction in action. The DNS is a layer of abstraction that allows us to use easy-to-remember names instead of IP addresses, which are much harder to work with. It's a fundamental concept in computer science that enables us to build complex systems on top of simpler ones, and it's a big part of why the internet is so powerful and flexible.","393":"I'm not sure how Wi-Fi speed relates to the idea that no one authority has control over decisions or destinations, could you help me understand the connection between those two concepts?","394":"I was wondering if they get lost in transit or when they're stored on servers.","395":"That's a good start, but actually, a quantum sensor doesn't necessarily use quantum computing. Instead, it leverages the principles of quantum mechanics to measure properties like magnetic fields or temperature at the quantum level, which allows it to detect subtle changes and anomalies that classical sensors can't. It's a bit like the difference between a compass and a magnetometer \u2013 both can measure magnetic fields, but the magnetometer is more precise and can detect smaller variations.","396":"I'm working with a team on a project that explores how tiny particles behave when they're spinning around. It's pretty fascinating stuff, and we're learning a lot about the quantum world.","397":"We're examining the spin dynamics within these diamonds, which is crucial for understanding their behavior under various conditions.","398":"That's right, by putting a quantum system in a superposition and then measuring it, you're essentially using the environment to collapse the superposition and gain information about it. It's a bit like trying to take a snapshot of a fleeting moment - the act of taking the picture changes the scene, but it also gives you a glimpse of what was there.","399":"When you entangle two particles, you're essentially linking them in a way that lets you tap into their shared properties, allowing you to measure one particle and instantly influence the other, regardless of the distance between them. This phenomenon enables you to amplify the sensor's sensitivity, making it more effective at detecting subtle changes.","400":"One of the biggest challenges they're facing is that the clocks need to be extremely stable, because even a tiny variation in the clock's frequency can throw off the positioning. Scientists are exploring new materials like yttrium silicon fluoride, which has a much more stable frequency than the current materials used in atomic clocks.","401":"I've always wondered how my parents managed to set up our internet at home. I think it's pretty cool that it's all connected through these invisible networks and wires that allow us to access the internet from anywhere in the house. Do you think it's true that some of these networks are more secure than others, or is it all just a big mess of wires and signals?","402":"The router in your house acts as a switchboard, connecting your devices to the wider network, kind of like a telephone exchange that links multiple phone lines to the rest of the world.","403":"The internet signal travels through a series of networks that are connected to each other, kind of like a big web. But to understand how it gets there so fast, let's break it down. When you send a message or make a call, it's first processed by your router, which sends it to your internet service provider's network. From there, it's forwarded to a series of routers and switches that are connected to each other, kind of like a game of telephone, but with computers. These routers and switches use a system of IP addresses and routing tables to figure out where to send the signal next. It's a bit like a giant postal system, where each router and switch is like a post office, forwarding the signal to the next one until it reaches its destination. So, to answer your question, the undersea cables do play a role in connecting the networks in different parts of the world, but they're just one part of a much larger system that makes it all work.","404":"Actually, there are undersea cables that carry a lot of data between continents, including from the East Coast of the United States to Europe and Australia. ","405":"The undersea cables allow internet service providers to connect their networks directly to each other, which enables faster data transfer and reduces latency, making it possible for online services like Netflix to stream content seamlessly to users around the world.","406":"So, when you're watching Vampire Diaries, it's not actually downloading the entire show to your computer. It's using a technology called caching, which stores frequently watched content on your device, but it's not storing the entire show. Instead, it's downloading just the piece that you're watching at that time, and it's doing that in real-time. It's getting the information from the Netflix server, and it's sending it to your display device, and it's playing it for you. This way, you can watch your favorite shows without having to wait for the entire thing to download.","407":"Well, Netflix has a system of content delivery networks, which are like a network of servers that are located in different places around the world. When you request to watch a movie, Netflix's system looks at your location and tries to connect you to a server that's closest to you. It then uses load balancing to distribute the workload across multiple servers, ensuring that the one you're connected to has enough resources to handle your request without any issues.","408":"A function in the mathematical sense is a rule that assigns to each input exactly one output, in a way that's consistent and well-defined for all possible inputs. This means that even if the function involves a complex operation, like taking the square root of a number, it must work for every possible input, and produce a unique output for each one.","409":"Well, let's think about it this way: we can pair up the positive integers with the natural numbers, and then we can pair up the negative integers with a different set of natural numbers. For example, we can match -1 with 2, -2 with 3, and so on. This way, we can create a one-to-one correspondence between the integers and the natural numbers, which shows that they have the same size infinity.","410":"Actually, I think the natural numbers would be smaller than the integers because we can easily pair each natural number with an integer, but the reverse isn't necessarily true. For example, we can pair 1 with 0, 2 with -1, and 3 with -2, but what about -1? We can't pair it with any natural number, can we? So, it seems like the natural numbers are a subset of the integers, and therefore they're smaller in terms of cardinality.","411":"What if we match each positive integer with a natural number, and then each negative integer with a natural number, but shifted by some fixed number, like 1?","412":"And that's where the bijective mapping comes in \u2013 we can establish a one-to-one correspondence between the natural numbers and the rational numbers by considering the position of each point in the lattice, with the origin being the first point, and then moving counterclockwise, we can assign a unique natural number to each rational number, and vice versa, which would allow us to match the natural numbers with the rational numbers in a way that preserves their order and structure.","413":"By labeling each point in this lattice, we can create an injective function from the set of rational numbers to the set of natural numbers, which helps us understand why there are 'uncountably' many natural numbers, but only 'countably' many rational numbers.","414":"That's 3 over 2, and 3 over 2 is encoded as 25, because 25 is the product of 3 and 5, and 5 is the next integer after 2, which is a key insight in this encoding scheme, where each rational number is represented as the product of its numerator and the next prime number greater than its denominator.","415":"If you added one to each of those numbers, the resulting number would be different from every number on the list because at every position, it would have a different digit.","416":"That means if we keep changing the first digit, we'll never actually reach a number that's already on the list, because there are infinitely many possible changes we can make, and each change will take us to a new number that's not on the list yet.","417":"That opens up a fascinating area of research in computability theory, where we explore the limits of what can and cannot be computed, and the implications of these limits for our understanding of the universe, from the behavior of complex systems to the nature of randomness itself.","418":"Entanglement is actually really cool - it's when two particles become connected in such a way that what happens to one particle instantly affects the other, even if they're on opposite sides of the universe. It's a pretty mind-blowing concept, and it's been experimentally confirmed in many different ways. Want to hear about some of the craziest experiments that have been done to test entanglement?","419":"I was expecting a more detailed explanation, but it seems like we're going off on a tangent. Can you tell me more about how noise-canceling headphones work?","420":"We're working on building the actual quantum hardware, like the tiny parts that make up the quantum computer, and figuring out how to control them to run the quantum algorithms.","421":"It's about density, isn't it? The more massive the star, the higher its density, and if it collapses into a black hole, it's because the density has become so extreme that not even light can escape.","422":"So when it collapses, it becomes a singularity, a point of infinite density. That's a really mind-bending concept, but essentially, the gravity becomes so strong that space and time start to warp, and the event horizon forms, marking the boundary beyond which nothing can escape, including light. And to put that in perspective, if you were to approach the event horizon, time would start to slow down for you relative to observers outside, due to gravitational time dilation.","423":"Because as the gravity gets stronger, the light gets bent, and it follows the curvature of space and time around the black hole, and that's why it gets pulled in.","424":"That's right! If the sun were to collapse, it would create an incredibly dense point called a singularity. The point of no return around this singularity is called the event horizon. Once you cross the event horizon, nothing, not even light, can escape the gravitational pull of the black hole. It's not that the black hole is 'dark' in the sense that it's not emitting any light, but rather that it's warping the fabric of space and time around it in such a way that not even light can escape. And that's what makes it so fascinating and mysterious!","425":"That's a mind-bending concept - the space around a black hole is so warped that even light can't escape, it gets trapped in this cosmic whirlpool, making it impossible to get a glimpse of what's inside.","426":"So, in Einstein's view, the black hole warps the fabric of space-time, creating a gravitational pull that draws objects towards it, rather than a vacuum that actively sucks things in.","427":"My research focuses on the interplay between infinite sets and the concept of choice functions, particularly how the properties of infinite sets influence the existence and behavior of choice functions. I'm currently exploring the implications of various set-theoretic axioms on the existence of choice functions in different types of infinite sets.","428":"I think of it as a way to assign a member from each of the non-empty subsets of a set in a way that's consistent and systematic, which is useful in situations where we need to make a selection from multiple options, like when we're trying to find a solution that works for all the different subsets.","429":"I've also used it when constructing the ultrafilter on a Boolean algebra, which is a really interesting and counterintuitive result, and also when dealing with the Suslin operators in descriptive set theory, which has some mind-blowing implications for the structure of the real numbers.","430":"Exactly, so we're essentially creating a boundary that we can work with. It's like saying, let's focus on the sets that are within a certain size limit, and that way we can still explore the world of sets without getting overwhelmed by the infinite possibilities.","431":"That's a great point about the data transmission being small, which makes it more manageable. It's like having a steady stream of information that's easy to process, rather than a flood of data that's hard to handle.","432":"I think what's more interesting is that the data rates for IoT devices are often limited by the type of sensor and the protocol used for communication. For example, a temperature sensor might only transmit a few bytes of data per minute, while a device using a protocol like MQTT might be able to transmit more data at a faster rate. This is because IoT devices often have limited processing power and memory, which restricts the amount of data they can handle and transmit.","433":"I think we could develop a data-driven approach to optimize sensor placement and deployment strategies, leveraging machine learning algorithms to identify patterns and correlations between sensor data and environmental factors such as traffic patterns, weather conditions, and urban morphology. By demonstrating the potential of this data to inform evidence-based decision-making, we could persuade the owners to share it, and in doing so, contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of the complex interactions between urban systems and the acoustic environment.","434":"because it's based on patterns and relationships that have already been established through data, which is why we can make predictions about it.","435":"We thought it was worth investigating further, given its potential to yield some truly groundbreaking results.","436":"But they can still make educated guesses about the compound's properties, even if they don't know its exact structure.","437":"And it would be based on a clever combination of public key encryption and a special setup phase, allowing you to run computations without needing to communicate with anyone.","438":"I think that's one of the reasons why we need to have more interdisciplinary research in cryptography, bringing together mathematicians, computer scientists, and engineers to develop new cryptographic protocols that are both theoretically sound and practically applicable.","439":"So, you're studying the star formation in the Magellanic Clouds, which can help us understand how galaxies like our own Milky Way formed and evolved over billions of years. Am I right in assuming that's one of the main goals of your research?","440":"Actually, let's get back on track. I was asking if you've heard about the supermassive black holes that are thought to reside at the centers of nearly every galaxy. My question is more about the current understanding of these objects, rather than their formation.","441":"Well, one of the leading theories is that supermassive black holes could have formed in the early universe through a process called 'direct collapse,' but it's still a bit of a mystery. Some scientists think that the first supermassive black holes might have actually formed in the hearts of giant galaxies, and then those galaxies merged over billions of years to create even larger galaxies with supermassive black holes at their centers. It's a complex process, but it could be a key to understanding how these enormous black holes came to be.","442":"And if that happens, it could lead to an absolutely mind-blowing cosmic display \u2013 a burst of energy unlike anything we've ever seen, with the two supermassive black holes dancing around each other in a gravitational waltz.","443":"Actually, I think you meant to say supermassive black holes, as the term'supermassive' is often used to describe the most massive type of black hole found at the centers of galaxies, like our own Milky Way. It's a fascinating area of study, and there have been some recent discoveries that have shed new light on these cosmic phenomena. For example, the Event Horizon Telescope project has imaged the shadow of a black hole for the first time, providing us with a glimpse into the strong gravity and accretion disk of these objects. This has opened up new avenues for research and has sparked interesting discussions about the nature of black holes and their role in the universe.","444":"The issue is that as you scale up to the size of our sun, the energy output would be so immense that it would essentially incinerate any spacecraft that ventured too close. Moreover, even if you could somehow develop a shield to mitigate the radiation, the extreme gravity of the black hole would distort space-time to the point where navigation would be utterly impractical. The sheer scale of the black hole's influence would make it nearly impossible to design a spacecraft that could safely approach it, let alone harness its energy.","445":"I mean, it's wild to think that the same principles that govern how we store binary data on a hard drive could have implications for how we train these massive neural networks. I've always found it fascinating how the physical properties of data storage can inform our understanding of complex systems like AI.","446":null,"447":"We encode the model onto qubits using a technique called superposition, which enables the quantum computer to process multiple states at once, kind of like how a classical computer can only process one bit at a time.","448":"I think we're facing a lot of challenges in terms of actually building a large-scale quantum computer. One of the biggest challenges is just the noise and the error correction, like I mentioned before. But also, just the scalability of the thing - how do you get a million qubits to work together in a way that's reliable and efficient? We're also facing challenges in terms of the software and the algorithms, like how do we take these quantum computers and actually use them to solve real-world problems. There are many open questions in these areas, and I think that's where researchers like you could make a significant contribution.","449":"The simulation models that we've developed so far are primarily geared towards handling rigid objects, but we've encountered challenges when trying to adapt them to non-rigid deformable objects like tofu or broccoli, which can change shape and make the simulation more complex.  We're currently exploring alternative algorithms that can better handle these types of objects, such as those that incorporate machine learning or physics-based models.","450":"But isn't that approach more about shaping the robot's behavior indirectly, rather than directly programming it to learn a specific skill? I'm curious to know if you think there's a trade-off between these two approaches, and if so, what are the key factors that influence that trade-off?","451":"I think we can explore a few promising directions to make our simulations more realistic. One direction is to use machine learning to learn about physics and build more accurate physics simulators. Another direction is to use multi-modal learning to combine data from different sources, such as vision and proprioception, to get a more complete understanding of the world. But I'd like to clarify, are you suggesting that we can use videos of humans interacting with the world as a source of physics data to inform our simulator?","452":"I'd love to introduce you to a fascinating world that might seem surprisingly familiar \u2013 the realm of fractals, where geometric patterns repeat at different scales, much like the intricate details of a snowflake or the branching of trees. Would you like to learn more about this captivating topic?","453":"Exactly, and you'd end up with a forest of tiny twigs if you tried to apply it to every single branch.","454":"I noticed you're here for the networking conference. What specific aspects of network architecture are you looking to explore or improve today?","455":"Can you tell me more about how these trends are changing the network architecture and the role of different stakeholders in managing and controlling the infrastructure?","456":"So, if a country decides to block a particular domain name, it's not just a matter of technical feasibility, but also a question of how they choose to enforce it, right? For example, would they block the domain name itself, or would they block the IP addresses associated with it?","457":"And that's what makes it so fascinating, right? The fact that we can infer or guess a lot of things, and the technology behind it, like edge computing, is pushing the boundaries of what's possible.","458":"and that's exactly what's happening with the edge computing, where the combination of these three technologies \u2013 wireless, networking, and cloud \u2013 is enabling a new level of synergy and collaboration that wasn't possible before, allowing for the creation of applications that can interact with the physical world in a more seamless and efficient way.","459":"I think you're hinting at something, but I want to make sure I understand. You're saying that 5G isn't just about the network being faster, but about how it integrates with other parts of the IT infrastructure, enabling a more seamless and holistic approach to communication and computation.","460":"I've been fascinated by the idea of black holes and the mysteries they still hold. I'd love to learn more about the physics behind them, especially how they form and behave.","461":"Explainer: That's a great point, and it gets to the heart of what's so mind-bending about black holes. A static black hole, like the Schwarzschild solution, has a very simple structure, with no rotation or charge. But a rotating black hole, like the Kerr solution, has a much more complex structure, with an axis of rotation and a kind of 'drag' effect on spacetime around it. This means that the event horizon of a rotating black hole is not a perfect sphere, but rather an oblate spheroid, or a disk-like shape. So, to answer your question, a rotating black hole is more common because most stars that form black holes are rotating, and the rotation gets preserved in the black hole itself.","462":"<model-generated>Well, a static black hole is more likely to form if the star is collapsing in a way that doesn't transfer any angular momentum to the black hole, whereas a rotating black hole is more likely to form if the star has a lot of angular momentum, like if it's a binary system where the two stars are orbiting each other and the black hole forms from the more massive of the two stars. This is because the conservation of angular momentum is a fundamental principle in physics, and when a star collapses, it's likely that the angular momentum will be preserved, leading to a rotating black hole. In contrast, if the star is collapsing in isolation, it's more likely to form a static black hole. This is because the angular momentum is not conserved in this case, and the black hole will not inherit the angular momentum of the star.<\/model-generated>","463":"Exactly, and that's what's so trippy about black holes. When you're near the event horizon, the way space and time are curved gets totally distorted. And at the center, the point of infinite density, the rules of physics as we know them just don't apply. The math suggests that a singularity is a point where the curvature is infinite, but we're still figuring out what that means in the real world.","464":"But that's exactly the point \u2013 singularities are not just points in spacetime where the laws of physics break down; they're also a manifestation of our current limitations in describing the universe. General relativity and quantum mechanics are two theories that work incredibly well in their respective domains, but they're fundamentally incompatible. When we try to merge them, we hit a wall, and that's where the concept of singularities emerges. It's a sign that we need to develop a new understanding, a new framework that can reconcile these two theories and provide a more complete picture of the universe.","465":"The math isn't just describing what happens, but it's actually giving us a framework to make predictions that we can test against the real world. For instance, Hawking radiation, a theoretical prediction that black holes should emit radiation due to quantum effects near the event horizon, was initially met with skepticism, but it's been confirmed by observations of black holes in space. This shows how the math isn't just a description, but it's actually a tool for understanding the universe.","466":"But what's also interesting is that even though we can't directly observe black holes, we can still learn a lot about them by studying their effects on nearby stars and the cosmic microwave background radiation.","467":"That would be an incredible discovery, and it would open up a whole new window into the universe. Imagine being able to see the quantum effects in action, right before our eyes.","468":"That's actually really interesting, because memory plays a significant role in shaping our experiences and emotions. For instance, if you have a favorite flavor of ice cream, that's because of a memory you have of eating that flavor and associating it with feelings of happiness and comfort. Similarly, if you grew up in a place where orange juice was a common drink, but then you experienced it in a new context, like on vacation, your perception of it might change. This is because memory is not just about recalling facts, but also about creating emotional connections and associations that influence our preferences and behaviors. It's fascinating to think about how our memories can impact our daily lives in such profound ways!","469":"I think that's a great point, and it reminds me of a study where participants were asked to choose between two equally appealing options, and it turned out that the decision-making process was actually more cognitively demanding than expected. It's almost as if our brains are wired to seek out more information when we're faced with a difficult choice, and that's where memory comes in \u2013 it allows us to draw upon past experiences and knowledge to inform our decision-making process.","470":"You're saying that the memory of the experience of choosing between two things you like equally is crucial, but also that after the decision, you're left wondering what if I had chosen the other one, and that's a kind of uncertainty that's hard to shake off. Am I always going to choose between these two options, or is something going to change that? ","471":"The video would travel through the network in a series of 1s and 0s, like a digital signal.","472":"And what if some of the connections between here and here were really slow or really unreliable, or maybe even broken? That could make the video take a really long time to get to its destination, or maybe even get lost along the way. It's kind of like if you were trying to get to a party, and the roads were all congested or closed \u2013 you'd have to find a different way to get there, right?","473":"Actually, it's not that one way is necessarily messed up or broken, but rather that different paths can have different characteristics, like speed or reliability, that make one more suitable for a particular job.","474":null,"475":"I'm curious, when you think about how our brains process information, what does a'mental model' look like in terms of how different parts of the brain are communicating with each other? Is it like a dynamic map that's constantly being updated?","476":"I think what you're getting at with this idea of a mental model is the way that we can use a kind of abstract representation of the world to make predictions and understand what's going on, and that's something that we also see in the way that we think about the structure of a circuit, right? We can think about the circuit as a kind of abstract representation of the world, and that allows us to make predictions about what will happen when we put certain inputs in and what the outputs will be, which is a really interesting parallel between how our minds work and how electronic circuits work.","477":"I think of memory as more of a dynamic process, where we're not just adding new info, but also refining what we already know. It's like, we're constantly updating our mental maps, getting rid of stuff that's no longer useful, and adding new details as we go along.","478":"I was thinking that maybe we could use the word'representation' instead of'memory' because it captures that changeability and flexibility you were just talking about, and it's a bit more general so it can encompass all the different ways that information is stored and used in the brain, rather than just being a record of the past. This might also help us to think about how different types of representations, like emotional or social representations, might be stored and used in the brain in different ways.","479":"Actually, black holes are thought to be one of the sources of gravitational waves that LIGO detects. The merger of two black holes or a black hole and a neutron star can produce these waves, which are ripples in the fabric of spacetime.","480":"The vibrations from the guitar strings create sound waves in the air, kind of like how black holes create gravitational waves in spacetime. But instead of hearing a guitar, we're listening for the unique 'notes' that black holes play as they move and interact with each other. It's a bit like figuring out the instrument and how it's being played, just by listening to the sound waves.","481":"Actually, yes, there are indirect effects on Earth that scientists are trying to detect, such as tiny changes in the Earth's rotation and the movement of the planet's crust, which could be caused by the gravitational waves from black holes. It's a very subtle effect, but it's an area of active research and could potentially reveal new insights into the universe and its workings.","482":"I've been digging into this project for ages, and I'm curious to know how you think we can harness AI to crack the code on human development.","483":"That's fascinating, because it suggests that our brains are wired to assume that any system that can interact with the world in a goal-directed way must have some kind of internal state, and that's a pretty fundamental assumption that we make about other humans. But it's also a limitation, because it makes it hard for us to understand when a system is just mimicking human behavior without really understanding what it's doing. Does that mean that we need to fundamentally rethink how we design robots and AI systems, to take into account the way that humans tend to anthropomorphize them?","484":"I think that's a really astute observation, and what's even more fascinating is that our brains are wired to make those shortcuts, often without us even realizing it, so it's like we're constantly navigating this invisible landscape of assumptions and abstractions that shape our perceptions of the world.","485":null,"486":"I think that's a fascinating question, and it gets at the heart of how we can create more embodied and situated AI systems that learn from humans in a more holistic way. The idea of using human experiences as a foundation for AI development is really compelling, and it speaks to the importance of understanding the complex interplay between perception, cognition, and action in humans.","487":"I'm actually more interested in the cognitive processes behind social cognition, like how do we form impressions of people and why do certain characteristics or traits stick with us, even when we don't consciously think about them?","488":"I was struck by how you were describing these processes as almost intuitive, like they're happening beneath the surface of our conscious awareness, and it made me wonder about the implications for how we understand and work with people who have experienced trauma or other disruptions to their memory and emotional regulation.","489":"I'm curious, how do you think your research on emotional judgment and memory could inform our understanding of how emotional processing influences semantic knowledge, especially in cases where episodic memories are disrupted?","490":"I think what's really interesting is that when a brain region that's responsible for a particular process is damaged, it's not just a matter of losing that process altogether. The brain has a remarkable ability to reorganize and compensate for the damage, often by recruiting other brain regions to take on the lost function. This can lead to some fascinating adaptations, such as the formation of new neural connections or the strengthening of existing ones. However, it's also worth noting that this compensation can sometimes come at a cost, such as increased energy expenditure or decreased efficiency in other cognitive processes. So, it's a really complex and dynamic process that's still not fully understood, and it raises a lot of questions about how the brain adapts to injury and how we can leverage this adaptability to improve recovery outcomes.","491":"I think one of the key challenges in this area is that the brain's remarkable ability to reorganize itself in response to damage can make it difficult to pinpoint the exact mechanisms at play, which is why we need to approach this with a combination of rigorous experimentation and a willingness to adapt our hypotheses as new evidence emerges.","492":"You know, I think we're on the cusp of a major breakthrough with the emerging field of attention and memory. We're starting to see some really interesting connections between how we focus our attention and how we store and recall information. It's gonna be fascinating to see where this research takes us and what new questions it raises.","493":"I'm not sure that's true, though. I mean, have you ever tried to pick up a small object like a paper clip? That can be pretty tricky too. But I'm curious, what makes it so hard for robots to pick up small objects like a penny?","494":"Why don't we try it with your eyes closed first, and then we'll add the extra challenge of wearing these?","495":"How do you think I managed to move the penny from my right hand to my left hand?","496":"How about we try it with your eyes closed, and see if you can pick up the object based on the sound of the blocks falling into place?","497":"I see what you mean. It does seem counterintuitive that robots can excel at complex calculations but struggle with simple tasks like object manipulation. However, the key difference is that complex calculations involve abstract mathematical concepts, whereas object manipulation requires a combination of sensory perception, motor control, and decision-making. These are fundamentally different types of challenges that require different types of intelligence.","498":"I think that's because we tend to oversimplify what robots are capable of. We see them as just physical machines, but they're actually complex systems that involve a lot of sophisticated software and algorithms that work together to make them work.","499":"It's like they're learning from scratch, and it's amazing to see how quickly they can pick up new skills, but it's also humbling to realize how far they still have to go to match our abilities.","500":"So the robot has to learn what feedback means and how to use it to improve its performance over time.","501":"I think it's worth noting that the robot is not just looking at the numbers, but also at the context in which those numbers are being generated. For example, if it's seeing a red ball in a room with a green table, the robot is using the relationships between the numbers to figure out what's going on, like how the red ball is interacting with the green table, and where it's located in the room.","502":"I think the idea of robots taking over the world is more of a science fiction trope than a realistic concern with the current state of robotics. ","503":"I was actually thinking about how fractals can be used to model the intricate patterns we see in nature, like coastlines or trees. It's fascinating to see how simple rules can give rise to complex, self-similar structures.","504":"You know, fractals are all about patterns that repeat themselves, no matter how far in you zoom, and that's pretty mind-blowing when you think about it.","505":"You know, I think Keenan's comment really highlights the difference between zooming in and zooming out \u2013 it's like the difference between seeing the coffee cup and seeing the entire room.","506":null,"507":"So one of the key challenges is that when you're dealing with fractals, you have to balance generating infinite details with the user's limited field of view, which makes it hard to create rich and immersive experiences without overwhelming them.","508":"That's an interesting approach, but I'm not sure I understand how procedural generation would work in this context. Could you elaborate on that?","509":"But isn't that a bit simplistic? Don't you think that infinity is more complex and multifaceted, encompassing concepts like limits, infinite series, and the nature of mathematical infinity, which can be thought of as a property of certain mathematical operations rather than a physical quantity?","510":"I'll admit, I'm curious to know why you think it's a finite number. Is it because you think we could actually count all the way through the jar, or is there another reason that's making you lean towards that option?","511":"because the jars would have to be smaller than the wavelength of light to fit in the room.","512":"You're pondering the paradox of infinity, where the more you have, the more you realize how little you've grasped. It's a mind-bending concept that has fascinated philosophers and mathematicians for centuries, and it's what makes the idea of unlimited possibilities so both captivating and elusive.","513":"I'd love to explain it to you, but first, let me ask, are you ready to have your mind blown by some pretty cool science?","514":"So, if I spin the penny, it's like the superposition idea - it's in a state of being both heads and tails at the same time, until it lands on one side.","515":"You're implying that the concept of entanglement is so mind-bending that our brains struggle to wrap around it, like trying to visualize a four-dimensional cube \u2013 am I right?","516":"So, when we look at the qubits, we're actually seeing a pattern that forms when they're connected, or 'entangled'. This is a really cool property of quantum mechanics. But to see this pattern, we need to cool the qubits down to an incredibly low temperature. That's what this device is doing - it's like a super-powerful refrigerator that keeps our qubits nice and cold. Does that make sense? Do you have any questions about how it works?","517":"So, we can use quantum computers to study how these chemicals interact with each other, which helps us create new medicines and materials that are safer and more effective.","518":"We measure all sorts of things in sensing \u2013 temperature, light, sound, even the vibrations in the ground. It's like being a super cool detective, trying to figure out what's going on in the world, one measurement at a time!","519":"I'll try to simplify it for you, but keep in mind that MRIs are a bit of a black box \u2013 they use powerful magnets and radio waves to create detailed images of the inside of your body, so it's not quite like an X-ray, but I'll do my best to make it make
