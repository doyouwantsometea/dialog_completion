that's good, because that's why you're here, and so we're talking about sleep today, and really about kind of what is the brain machinery through which we go through consciousness to unconsciousness and that transition.","1":"Okay. The best way to think about this transition is really called, it's a flip flop switch, okay? So this term comes from engineering, and the idea is that in sleep, you basically have kind of this all of nothing experience. Certainly people kind of drift off to sleep, but then all of a sudden you're unconscious, right? So it seems like it's this flip flop between the arousal system and the sleep promoting system, and it's certainly regulated, and we'll get a little bit into that, but they're certainly kind of made up of two reciprocally inhibitory processes. Okay, so we have the ascending reticular activating system. It originates in the brain stem, and there's a dorsal and a ventral arm to this, and so the dorsal arm has neurons, cholinergic neurons, that go up to the thalamus and then it projections into the fore brain, and then there's the ventral arm, and this is comprised of a whole bunch of different types of neurons, so there are monominergic, so there's kind of dopaminergic neurons that come from the periaqueductal gray, serotonergic ones from the dorsal raphae nuclei, histaminergic neurons that come from the tuberomammillary nucleus of the hippothalamus, and then noradrenergic neurons from the locus coeruleus, and so all of those are kind of working in tandem to kind of drive wake within the brain. So if we just think about drugs that are available inducing wakefulness, we can certainly, kind of the dopaminergic ones jump out, right? So we have amphetamines that kind of drive those signaling, and then modafinil, which is a wake promoting drug for people that have kind of excessive day-time sleepiness that maintains alertness throughout the day.","2":"For the role that they play with respect to the sleep-wake system is really kind of amping up the wake system, right? And so certainly that has like down stream consequences for the sleep system, because now the flip flop switch is kind of pushed in a much stronger direction, and we have to kind of rely on what regulates sleep to get it pushed back to sleep.","3":"And do we know much about why, or which stages of the sleep cycle are affected? You know, if you take amphetamines, is it then when you go to sleep, that you're not able to transition through each of the sleep periods, or is that less clear?","4":"You know, so I think that's less clear. In some ways, you know, getting back to this idea of this wake-sleep system, we have this sleep system that is kind of the counterpoint to this wake arousal system, and so the primary nucleus region is the ventral lateral pre-optic nucleus, also called VLPO, and that has particular neuron outputs that release GABA and galanin, which work in an inhibitory way on kind of the wake promoting ones. And so, it's kind of this delicate balance of these two systems that are ongoing. In your cognitive neuro-science training, right, it sounds like it's pretty specific and focused in a particular part of the brain, the cerebellum, and one thing that I'm interested in is you bring a participant into the study, have you ensured that they got a good night's sleep? Have you asked them about their sleep?","5":"A lot of people will see you as somebody who's drank in harmony their whole life. They've seen so much harmony, heard so much harmony. How do you make the choices, there's so much that's possible when you know stuff. How do you have the courage to make a choice?","6":"But at that moment, I'm coming from here, and I wanna forge some, some solution. I get myself in a situation. (keyboard music)","7":"'Cause, you know, I just wouldn't think to use that chord in that situation. And there it was! And, you know, if you read the rule book, it's, that not in it.","8":"And so, we could play a bit of that if you want to. And we could talk about some stuff. I've been doing it in F. (keyboards playing Amazing Grace) (laughing) Thanks Herbie, that was a trip.","9":"It's a good one. The melody on its own just goes. (hums Amazing Grace) That melody on its own is kind of lonely, right? And no one really knows how it feels. (plays and hums Amazing Grace) So which one did you prefer?","10":"Yeah, ah, that's great. I can decide how I want this melody to feel and the more notes there are, the more exciting it is. That's what musical harmony is. Does that make sense?","11":"Its basically a delay and it happens in all parts of the system: monitors can be a big one. Like consumer televisions can often have 15 milliseconds or more of latency just in the TV part. And then you've got the processing and the computer and all of these add up to the total latency.","12":"30 years ago, you had desktop PCs which were, you spent whatever on that, but there was always this idea well you could spend a million dollars and buy a super-computer and its gonna be a lot faster. And that's not really true today. For scalar processing, when you just do one thing after another, a high-end, overclocked, cool gaming PC is about the fastest thing in the world. It is within a very small delta, yeah for some things you'll get some IBM power system that might be a little bit faster, but not a whole lot. So if I'm looking at this and saying we need to be five times faster. What do you do? You can't just say make each thing faster. As a developer you're making a trade-off, I can put my effort into making this more efficient or making it more fun. And more fun usually wins out for very good reasons. So there's some good judgment and trickery that goes into the design of things. But you can always just design a game that will just not work well. (laughing) I mean in the old days, games had to be so precisely designed. Nowadays you've got a ton more freedom. You really can--","13":"But VR makes, you have to give up a little bit of that freedom, you have to not do so many crazy things, so you can wind up having it be as responsive and high quality as it needs to be.","14":"So I'm gonna look up Melanie Martinez. And it says here, If you like Melanie Martinez, one of the other songs you might like is by Au\/Ra. Do you know who that is?","15":"And that's actually a really interesting thing to think about because that creepy vibe is something that you can perceive and I can perceive, but it's actually really hard to describe to a machine. What do you think might go into that?","16":"So there are things that machines are really great at that humans are actually not great at. And imagine watching every video posted to TikTok every day. So we just don't have enough time to do that at the rate at which we can actually watch those videos. But a machine can analyze all of them and then make recommendations to us. And then thinking about things that machines are bad at and people are good at, people are really great with only one or two examples of learning something new and incorporating that into our model of the world to make good decisions. Whereas machines often need tens of thousands of examples, and that's not even getting into things like good judgment because we care about people, because we can imagine a future that we want to live in that doesn't exist today. And that's something that is still uniquely human. Machines are great at predicting based on what they've seen in the past, but they're not creative. They're not going to invent. They're not gonna, you know, really change where we're gonna go. That's up to us.","17":"Not an experimental one. So, our theme here today is dimensions. So this is great that you have some math background because mathematicians think about dimensions in a different way.","18":"Why? This is a very good question. So, let's just start with space, right? We know a little bit about space. So here's my simple minded way of drawing space two dimensions, because that's how many I can draw on the blackboard. Let's say X and Y. And what is special about space, there's many things, but one is that if I have a curve or a path between two points, there's a distance that you can calculate, right? And the distance between those two points doesn't depend on your coordinates. It doesn't depend on whether you're in radial coordinates or Cartesian coordinates, or whatever. I'm allowed to imagine a curve that does something like this between those two points, and if I were a person walking on that curve, I would have an odometer with me maybe, and I would know, you would know, even without having done that, this path is always gonna be longer than that path. There's a formula, Pythagoras' Theorem that tells you what the shortest distance path is. That's the point. The physical-ness of what is real is the distance along a certain curve. So spacetime is like that. That's why it is useful to think about spacetime.","19":"So let me draw spacetime. Here's how we usually draw it. I'll just say X, but all of space is condensed in this one direction, and this is time, okay? So if you're a little person and you started some event, so you start, you're located somewhere in space, somewhere in the three coordinates of space, and whether you like it or not, you're moving through spacetime just by getting older.","20":"And it's almost exactly like the space story. The space story says there's a distance, distance is different along different curves. Einstein says there's something that measures the length of these curves, and we call it the proper time. It is literally the time that you would read on your wristwatch.","21":"And the crucial difference is that time is not the same for this person who stayed behind and sat in their chair, and this person who zoomed out there.","22":"There is what we call a metric on spacetime, and when we talk about Euclidean space versus a curved space, versus a sphere or something, that's a different metric. And spacetime has its own metric which says the following thing, that the path between two events in spacetime that is a straight line, will always be the longest time.","23":"Yeah, exactly. If you had a sheet that was originally flat, and you set a marble on it, it would go in a straight line, but then if you put something on it so it warps it, that marble is now gonna be deflected.","24":"Yeah, that's right. And it goes exactly back to what we drew on the board where how those two people in the train and on the ground would divide spacetime up differently to space and time.","25":"So a nice place to start is with the idea of a triad. A triad is a three-part harmony, basically. (keyboard harmonic tone) So that's a triad. So this triad's called C major.","26":"So in Amazing Grace, you start with F. You know, if I go (melodic humming) \u266a How sweet the sound \u266a (scat singing) (laughs) Where am I right now? I don't know where I am. (scat singing) And my job is to get back home, but to make this chord make sense.","27":"You know, a lot of people, a lot of string theorists, they care a lot about all the different ways in which we could hide the extra dimensions. As someone who cares about cosmology, I wanna start asking why are the extra dimensions small at all? How did that happen? Is this something you think about yourself?","28":"The thing I want to talk about is this paper I wrote with Matt Johnson and Lisa Randall where we realize there's another way to compactify extra dimensions spontaneously, dynamically. If you imagine starting with this big piece of paper you couldn't wrap up everything, but within some region of space you could make a tube.","29":"Right? And down there in the tube it looks like your long thing that is compactified in one direction and infinitely extending in the other direction, so there's one less macroscopic dimension of space.","30":"Yeah, I've been trying to explain this to lower levels, and they always look at me like, are you pulling my leg here a little bit? Or is this the real thing that they use? Yes, it is the real thing they use. We study these branes in de Sitter space, and so what we found is that there are black brane solutions which instead of having a singularity inside are non-singular, and stable, and compactified. Is this a familiar thing? I know things like this have been discussed, right?","31":"I guess. I mean, maybe you'd think otherwise. Again or maybe you could change my mind, I think that as long as it can happen it will happen some of the time, right?","32":"And I just wrote a book called Something Deeply Hidden about many worlds, quantum mechanics, and how spacetime can emerge from it. Plenty of reading material for the audience out there.","33":"The reason we're not just flying off the earth is because earth has gravity, so if we throw something up, it comes back down, so that's why when we're walking on the earth, we don't fly off the earth because the earth has gravity, and it keeps us down.","34":"Alright, so, at some point, you can probably see it right now? So without moving your eyes, this is kind of hard, tell me how many fingers I'm holding up?","35":"Okay. So this is about high intensity lasers. Not only how do you make them, but what was really stopping them being made in both cases is non linear optics. We wanna do something that requires a huge photon density application, and so that's how come we came up with chirped pulse amplification, so that we could stretch the pulse, safely amplify it, then compress it at the end, and then we're ready to do whatever we want at the end. So what do you think the main difference is between the continuous wave laser that you have that runs at 10 watts and a chirped pulse amplifier?","36":"I don't know if people are working on that because I'm not so much in the medical field, but I should look into that and see if that's a possibility. So after hearing about high intensity lasers, can you think about next time you go back to the lab and you're wondering how to do something in the lab with lasers, can you see how short pulses might help you?","37":"Mostly today, I've been talking a lot about what can we do, what's possible. We think might be possible in the next couple of years. But really at the professional level its more the question of wisdom of what should we be doing.","38":"I'm not trying to fool you here. Okay. Now this is going to be slightly trickier. I'm going to give you this. I want you to hold all three of them at right angles to all the others at the same time.","39":"Well, we could also say how far we are away from the center, just the distance. And then the angle that our little line makes with let's say the X axis.","40":"So astronomers call them right ascension and declination, which are two terrible words, but basically you've seen on the globe where you draw latitude and longitude, what it looks like.","41":"So we've been, we've had, now, effectively two different ways of getting more direct measurements, one is the LIGO, which is the Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory, which is where, getting the ripples in space time, coming off of the merging of black holes. The other one that you're mentioning is actually called the Event Horizon Telescope, where they're using radio waves to actually image the event horizon, that region where light cannot escape from the black hole at the center of our galaxy, which I know they're working on it right now. It's an amazing thing, but that'll be the most direct imaging of a black hole. LIGO is a direct detection of the consequence of the merging of black holes. The critical part has been, like, for the super massive black hole at the center of our galaxy, we've seen the stars orbiting it, and we've measured the mass, so that way, so if you look at a spinning black hole, it actually fundamentally alters the emission that's coming off the stuff that's falling into it. These are discovered as what are called X-ray binaries, that is, you know, there's an X-ray member of the binary that is emitting in the X-rays, and it's really not very bright in the optical (mumbles) at all, so there's always, people are looking at these X-ray binaries.","42":"For my studies, I actually, when I started at UCLA in graduate school, I worked with a professor named Matt Malkin who was, gotten a lot of data observations from the Hubble Space Telescope, so that was one of my very first projects to work on, so any, space-based observatories have been a really big advantage, and then I've moved on now to the Spitzer Space Telescope. In addition to that, then there's other people who've used a lot of X-ray telescopes, NuSTAR, Chandra have used data from that. It's been a combination of both ground-based observatories, as well as space-based ones, and going everywhere from X-ray observations, not done by me, but certainly ultraviolet, and then optical, and infrared, particularly, those are the ones that I've been most involved with.","43":"Yeah, and that was because gravity wasn't compressing him all the time and he was floating freely in the International Space Station and his spine just kind of elongated. After a while here on Earth though he'll readjust, he'll go back to the same size. Have you ever heard of how gravity was discovered?","44":"But it's a good story. So Isaac Newton realized that even if you're heavier, you will fall at the same rate as something much lighter, that that's the same. Once you hit the ground, if you're heavier, you'll hit the ground with much greater force, but you will hit the ground at the same time.","45":"They look the same, but this is much heavier, right? Okay, so try it, just try holding your arms up front, a little higher maybe, give them a chance to drop, and then drop them. [balls thud] [Janna laughs] Did they fall at the same time? Did they hit at the same time? So, Isaac Newton, he was also the one who realized that that's the same force that keeps the Moon in orbit around the Earth and the Earth in orbit around the Sun, and that's a huge leap. Here he is, looking at just things around him, and then looks at the stars and has this really big realization, that that's actually the same force. So, what have you learned today talking about gravity?","46":"Right. You can do part of this level, and you can do the other part, clearly. Got some expertise under your belt, and that's awesome, because I think that everyone should know more about sleep. And so the way that we think about what drives sleep are two independent but related processes and so they have kind of lame names. Process S and process C, and what you've kind of described is process C, and that's the master clock, right? And it helps regulate kind of the rhythms like all over your body, all your cells, and all those kind of things. It drives the release of melatonin from the pineal gland, and melatonin comes online under darkness, so when the sun goes down, your brain knows okay it's time to start getting ready for sleep, and so you start releasing melatonin, which really kind of sets the table for sleeping.","47":"Yeah, no, that's a really great question, and the same is true in places where the sun never goes down during the summer, and when it's dark all the time during the winter, and it turns out light isn't the only thing that kind of gates your circadian rhythm. But I think the thing that's really important, again there are two processes, that the other one is the S process, and that one's just kind of a really important driver of sleep. One name we call it is the homeostatic sleep drive. Kind of the longer you're awake, the sleepier you get. You stay up, you get sleepy. Time goes by, you get sleepier. Time goes by, you get sleepier. But it's actually kind of a fundamental principle for how sleep is regulated, and it's really kind of akin to like a balloon, okay? So you wake up in the morning and your balloon is flat. You've kind of like drained out all of the sleepiness. But then as you kind of go throughout the day, it kind of fills up, so you use your energy, it gets filled up. And then it gets filled up more as you get towards nighttime, right? And then when it's at this optimal amount is when you kind of go to sleep and let out all of the sleepiness again. And this is really what underlies why napping can also be bad for you. So napping's not inherently bad, but if you actually let out some of this air during the day, it's going to take longer for the balloon to get bigger, right, I see to where you feel sleepy, right?","48":"Well it depends. So if you're cutting steel, you need to have the nail. You need to have it concentrated all of the light, not going in all directions but you need it into as small a point as possible. And for that we use a lens. For a lens, the light's coming down as a column, you put in a lens, it all focuses it down in the same way as the nail and then it starts cutting that steel. Okay so that force per unit area--","49":"But if you send a one second long light pulse out into the skies there, the beginning of the pulse is actually two thirds of the way to the moon. It's 300,000 kilometers long. So now, if you talk about light being concentrated, that doesn't seem very concentrated. The type of lasers I play with in my lab will be no thicker than this piece of paper. So we take that energy that might be in three hundred thousand kilometers and we squeeze it all the way down into just this piece of paper and actually the beams are more the size of this piece of paper and so, in my lab, pieces of paper like this would be flying through the sky but we can't see them. 'Cos they don't come in our eyes, they fly by us and they're infra red.","50":"Exactly. And so now, if we have light like that that we wanna machine with. I bring this funnel and so, if we had a lens here and the light was coming down--","51":"It does seem to be that it may not even, in parts, it may not be even connected to this tiny, little torus at all because part of the work that I did, and others have done, is that type twos preferentially live in different kinds of galaxies than type ones, which should not in any way have to do with something such a small scale. They tend to be in smaller bulged, SB and SC type spiral galaxies. So there's something also having to do with environment that gets you to be a type two, and you can still maybe, timing wise, but there's something else that's going on on a larger scale because the type of the AGN should not really correspond to the host galaxy, but it seems to. And that was one of the things that we were finding out, and that was one of the early little ideas that the, individually, just as the torus model, the unified model, can't explain everything that we were observing at the time. But it is one of those things that it's, they're super luminous, they're all over the place, and we don't have a really good picture of it, which makes it exciting to study.","52":"So our sleep is made up of different types, okay? The first one is called non-rapid eye movement sleep, or non-REM, okay? Or NREM. And then the other one, which might not be a surprise, is called REM. Rapid eye movement sleep. And those are the two main types of sleep that happen. The way that we measure that as a sleep scientist is that we'll actually bring people into the lab where they can do this at home, where we put electrodes on their scalp while they're sleeping, and that allows us to measure the brain activity that's going on during the night.","53":"When we measure all of that, we're able to see how much time someone's asleep, and how many times they wake up and stuff during the night. You know, we're also really interested in kind of, the amount of non-REM sleep someone gets and the amount of REM sleep that someone gets, because each part of those types of sleep do different things for the body. And so it's important to get both of those. And so within non-REM sleep, there are three stages ranging from N-1 to N-2 to N-3. So not particularly clever in our naming, but that's how we know what stages they are. And what they do is it moves from lightest to deepest sleep, okay? N-1, it's more kind of light, wakefulness sleep, kind of in and out of sleeping. Then you go into N-2, which is where we spend 45 to 55 percent of our sleep. And it's more this kind of light sleep, but then we get into kind of the really restorative sleep, and that's N-3. And in N-3, when we look at someone's EEG wave, we see these big slow waves, and it's called slow wave sleep. And so we spend about 20% of our sleep in slow wave sleep, though it can vary on a day to day.","54":"You know, some of that is totally accurate, that like when your brain's more engaged by being on your phone or doing things that you really enjoy or things that stress you out or any of those types of things, it's harder to get to sleep and to kind of fall into that deeper levels of sleep. Most of the REM sleep, this dreaming sleep, happens in the second half of the night.","55":"Okay? So we wake up a lot during the night, and we just don't remember it. And you'll go back down into deep sleep, and then up again into REM, you know, in kinda these cycles.","56":"Okay. Usually we want to keep naps, like 20 to 30 minutes. When people drop into deep sleep, and then they're woken up out of a nap, most people report that they feel way worse than they did before they took the nap, and that's because you've been in deep sleep, and it's this term called sleep inertia. So what are the stages of sleep?","57":"I think to really get deep into nanomaterials and nanoscale devices, you really have to understand to some level, quantum mechanics. What it teaches us as we make these devices smaller and smaller, their properties begin to now depend on the size and the orientation of these devices. There are materials, and you're taking a 2D materials class, you know about this, that are intrinsically thin. As they're grown, as they're fabricated, they're already at the nanoscale and they possess these quantum confinement properties that as a nanotechnologist, you try to exploit. And so the first ones I wanted to talk to you about are quantum dots, have you heard of quantum dots before?","58":"So these are typically semiconductors. They can be cadmium selenide cadmium sulfide, zinc selenide and they're small clusters of atoms. They can be from 2 to 10 nanometers. What's interesting about these materials?","59":"That's correct. Yeah. Because of quantum confinement, once you get below this 15 nanometer range, the band gap of the material depends completely on the size of the material. So in bulk materials, if you want to change the band gap, you have to change the material, right? But in these quantum dots specifically, just by changing the size, you can change their band gap. And because their band gap is changing, their optical properties are different. And you can precisely tune the wavelength of light that they emit just by changing their size.","60":"There are people that are exploring using these materials for diode lasers. There are companies that are building displays from these materials. And there're even people thinking about if I take these quantum dots, and I change the chemistry on the outside so they stick to specific types of cells or tissue, that I could really do some interesting imaging and therapeutic work to track disease, even maybe to treat disease, if you can very precisely control the chemistry.","61":"Carbon nanotube, right. So if you roll up graphene, depending on how you roll it and the angle, you roll it with, it has different properties. So if I roll it one way, it'll act like a metal. If I roll it a different way, it'll act like a semiconductor. The one that gets everyone most excited is that the electrons and holes move very fast through graphene. And so there's a lot of interest in using these for certain types of high-speed electronics. The other interesting application is because it's one atom thin, it's very sensitive to changes in the environment. And so there's a lot of interest in using them as diagnostics. It's on us researchers to find ways to A, control that process and then B, to actually build some sort of interesting technology from them.","62":"Yeah. 100%. That's right. And that's the motivation for looking at these emerging materials. But I would never bet against the innovation and the creativity in this nano electronic space. Tens of thousands of scientists, every time they hit a barrier, at least historically, as a guide, they have found a way to overcome it. It's a real marvel in ingenuity.","63":"So machine learning is a way that we teach computers to learn things about the world by looking at patterns and looking at examples of things. So can I show you an example of how a machine might learn something?","64":"That's true. Do you think, if we look at these pictures, do you think maybe we could say, Well, they both have pointy ears, but the dogs have a different kind of body and the cats like to stand up a little different.? Do you think that makes sense?","65":"This one's a jackal. And it's actually a kind of dog. But you made a good guess. That's what machines do too. They make guesses. Is this a cat or a dog?","66":"And so, you did something pretty amazing there. Because we asked the question, Is it a cat or a dog? And you said, I disagree with your question. It's a human. So machine learning is when we teach machines to make guesses about what things are based on looking at a lot of different examples. And I build products that use machine learning to learn about the world and make guesses about things in the world. When we try to teach machines to recognize things like cats and dogs, it takes a lot of examples. We have to show them tens of thousands or even millions of examples before they can get even close to as good at it as you are. Do you have tests in school?","67":"Yes, we're gonna talk about science and we're gonna talk about a very specific kinda science, about people who study brains. Do you know what a brain is? What is it?","68":"Maybe a mutual acquaintance of ours, Jasper gave a example of fault injection, and I like to use that as, when I'm trying to explain fault injection, he shows a pinball machine and the pinball machine, obviously the two inputs are the two plungers when you're playing a pinball machine, but fault injection, you can tilt the entire pinball machine, right? You're just introducing some external variable that's outside of the traditional inputs that you're used to and you've now controlled the environment in a advantageous way to the user or the player. Can you give an example of some type of fault injection that you're doing or working on?","69":"I've never seen... Maybe call it a verifiable visualization of it, right? We know it's true, you know, you can get skin cancer by going outside and having too many high energy particles hit you, but we've never seen it. And we know it can happen to a computer chip, but I've never seen both.","70":"It's the easier side. I would say my side is the easier side, right? I'm on the offensive side. I want to break into things. Someone on the defense side, they might have, you know, a system was developed and they now need to patch a hundred holes. They patch 99 of them. I only need to find that one.","71":"Right, you will feel the gravitational pull, and it'll redirect you in some way, and if you're far enough way, it's just like you're very far away from the sun, or something else. If you're close enough, it will divert your path more, if you're close enough still, then you will get what are called tidal forces, where the difference between, for example, if you're standing next to a black hole, the difference in gravity between your feet and your head actually becomes significant. Next time you see a science fiction movie, if somebody says, Oh, my god, we've been caught in the gravitation field of a black hole, and we're gonna fall in, it's like, no, no, just, if you're far enough away, just thrust a little bit this way, and then you'll slingshot around the black hole.","72":"I wouldn't call them educational, but the movie Interstellar actually had, as one of the people involved in both writing it, and as a science advisor, Dr. Kip Thorne, who's a Professor at Caltech, who was part of the team that detected gravitational waves, and just won a Nobel Prize for it. So he made sure to try and get it as accurate as possible, so Interstellar, I think, is one of the best examples of getting black holes right.","73":"It's, there're multiple theories, there's observational evidence, more than some other theories that are really feeding into this because now we have the instrumentation, both in X-rays and infrared, in particular, because we don't have a direct optical line of sight to the center of our galaxy because there's just a lot of dust in the way. But the infrared can penetrate the dust, the X-rays can penetrate the dust, the radio can penetrate all of that dust, so by combining all of these different wavelengths, people are really coming to a point of okay, how is this happening, by looking at different wavelengths of light, we can get a better sense, but they're still working on the theory, it's not all done.","74":"Well, you're absolutely right that the attention machine learning gets has grown dramatically. 20 years ago, going to gatherings and telling people what I was working on and seeing the blank face or the like, Where's the turn? and walk away. Like, Oh, no. The accessibility of the tooling, like, we can now do in, like, five lines of code something that would have taken 500 lines of very mathematical, messy, gnarly code even, you know, five years ago. And that's not an exaggeration. And there are tools that mean that pretty much anyone can pick this up and start playing with it and start to build with it. And that is also really exciting.","75":"And part of the challenge of it is not the mathematics of building models, but the challenge is making sure that the data is sufficiently representative, potentially high quality.","76":"The thing that makes them cool is they're sort of like tilings, it looks like you could put this together by cutting little pieces of paper and sliding them together, but they're still one sheet.","77":"That's a rule of all flat origami no matter how many folds come together at a point and I'm going to show you a building block of tessellations, it's called a twist because that center square, as I unfold it, it twists, it rotates.","78":"If I had another twist in the same sheet of paper I could make these folds connect with that, and these folds connect with that. And if I had another one up here, I could make all three. And if I had a square array and all the folds lined up I could make bigger and bigger arrays, like these, because these are just very large twists. In this case it's an octagon rather than a square, but they're arranged in rows and columns. And let's just try going along. All right, there is our tessellation with squares and hexagons. So you have now designed and folded your first origami tessellation and perhaps you can see how just using this idea of building up tiles and small building blocks you could make tessellations as big and complex as you want.","79":"So fortunately there's, I'm also doing it from space with the Spitzer Space Telescope, so particularly in the infrared, and my main interest has been to try and study the environment around the super massive black holes, not as close as where the X-rays are coming from, but clearly there's something from the X-ray corona that illuminates the rest of the accretion disk, and the dust that's further out. And so fundamentally, that's one of the key things that I'm trying to use, is trying to see how long, once you've got this sort of pulse that's generated close to the black hole, it propagates out, and so you can use optical wavelengths to see that the accretion disk lights up in the optical a little bit as it gets heated up from the X-ray, and then later on, the infrared dust, the dust absorbs it, and emits it in the infrared. And so that, I love that, the ability to exchange time for resolution, because these structures are so far away that we're never gonna get a telescope big enough where that has the resolution to see the accretion disk, or the dust distribution around--","80":"Yeah, again, we don't know exactly where X, Y, Z, zero is, we're assuming that it's something, you know, the X-rays that are coming out are very close to the event horizon of the black hole, but this is still, you know, your realm of X-rays, to really figure out those kinds of things. But once the X-rays, once the photons hit the corona, and are re-scattered, and up, energized, and then they start illuminating the accretion disk, it heats it up, and so just by the light travel time, when the optical, if it gets, you know, brighter and fainter, and then the infrared gets brighter and fainter, two weeks later, then the dust is two light weeks away from that. So it's a one dimensional one, so we're averaging, so we don't get the two dimensional, or even three dimensional one. And then we've done it now, of course, we have better telescopes, there was a project where you could do it with the Hubble Space Telescope and the ultraviolet, you used the Swift Observatory, which had optical and ultraviolet, and then from ground base, we did optical, and then from space we did it with Spitzer and the infrared. So you could actually see this bright flash go off in a nearby AGN called NGC5548, and then you see it propagate as it warms up the disk, as all that light is falling onto it, and then eventually you hit the, the, further away, where the dust is, and the dust tends to radiate in an infrared. So we got basically a structure, and you just, you see this flashbulb go off, and then it illuminates, effectively, the structure.","81":"So you do see it, basically the dust sublimation radius, and you see it at, and it tells you, depending on what kind of dust it is, and it's actually one of the problems for me studying, whenever we try and do X-ray studies of low luminosity active galactic nuclei in your, by galaxies, because there're all these X-ray binaries that are also emitting X-rays, which make our lives difficult. But they're also in black holes, when it's this really interesting sort of both, it's great, but ugh, it's also a source of noise for those of us who are trying to do X-ray observations of nearby galaxies.","82":"Which was one idea, but again, it's, I'll leave this to your theoreticians, I think there are problems with that, as well. I call it job security. That's right. (both laugh) We have a lot of things about black holes, both in terms of their formation, or even how they exist as they are, and how they're interacting with their environment that we're still not understanding.","83":"This is the Heisenberg's uncertainty principle in reality. You can't precisely say where the electron is, and you can't precisely say how quickly it's moving.","84":"Yes, so one of the things I like to think of with holography is that I can pack a certain amount of information in a black hole. I mean, you can literally think of it as throwing things into it. So let's say I have information in some volume and I'm under the illusion that I can just keep packing information in that volume, as much as the volume will contain. Eventually I'll make a black hole and I'll find out that the maximum amount of information I can pack into anything in the entire universe is what I can pack on the area. And since area is projecting the illusion, maybe, of volume, maybe the whole world is just a hologram. It's not a principle that only applies to black holes. It's saying that, if this theory of quantum gravity is correct, then this while three-dimensionality is an utter illusion and really the universe is two-dimensional. That's crazy.","85":"I mean, temperature is still great to talk about. It doesn't mean we shouldn't talk about temperature. I mean, we should absolutely adjust our thermostats and talk about temperature. But if we look at it closer and closer and closer, we realize there's not a thing in the world that has as a quantum value temperature, isolated. And so maybe there is no such thing as gravity isolated from quantum mechanics.","86":"Okay, so we'll do some, but I want to tell you a little bit about origami. Most origami follows two, I'll call them customs, almost like rules. It's usually from a square and the other is it's usually folded with no cuts. So these guys are folded from an uncut square.","87":"Let's fold it in half from corner to corner, unfold it and then we'll fold it in half the other direction, also corner to corner but we're going to lift it up and we're going to hold the fold with both hands. We're going to bring these corners together, making a little pocket and then, this is the trickiest part of this whole design, so you're going to put your finger underneath the top layer and we're going to try to make that layer fold right along the edge. Now you see how the sides kind of want to come in as you're doing that?","88":"Now, this is a traditional Japanese design but there are origami designs that have been around so long we're not entirely sure where they originated. We're going to learn how to fold a cootie catcher.","89":"So we'll start with the white side up and we're going to fold it in half from corner to corner, in one fold and now we're going to fold all four corners to the crossing point in the center. We'll fold it in half like a book. On the folded side we'll take one of the folded corners and I'm going to fold it up through all layers. There's a pocket in the middle. We're going to spread the pocket and bring all four corners together. Where you have original corners of the square, we're gonna just pop those out. This is one of the most satisfying moments, I think-","90":"And it's because we've had a lot of PR, a lot of proof of concept, but truthfully, this is more like a science, right?","91":"It will develop. It will take five years. It will take 10 years. That kind of time is necessary. One of the areas that brought me to supply chain research is the fact that we're not just gonna see blockchain emerge. We're gonna see artificial intelligence continue to evolve. We're gonna see connective devices and this sort of growing internet of things and machinery that can do a lot more and have a wallet and transact on their own. And so I actually think a lot of where blockchain and other technologies are headed is this interesting synergy that will help us elevate the kinds of institutions we've used in the past and cobbled together to create that identifiable, verifiable trust.","92":"When you say, well, there's hundreds of thousands, millions of car deaths on the road due to human error today. I think we're in a similar place. We're going to see problems with this technology, and we are going to need to develop multiple kinds of standards that also have some flexibility. But it's going to also be a version, a system, that allows us to fix some of the things that are broken today.","93":"Yeah, exactly. They're looking for ways that they can create protection. It's kind of like the lock on your front door. That lock is to essentially prevent bad people from coming in or people accidentally coming in when they shouldn't. A hacker is essentially looking at a way, how can I get into this lock? But then there are the good ones who are trying to unlock it so that they can tell the company that made the lock, hey, we can actually protect people by making the lock a little harder.","94":"In many cases, they'll send them a new lock. So it's an upgraded, better version. Sometimes that's new features, but sometimes that's bug fixes and ways to protect you as well.","95":"That's a very good point. You should definitely make sure that you're obeying the law. They might work with the lock company and say, I'm trying to improve your product. And they're trying to find these holes or problems, and then share that with the company. Even though the good hacker is doing exactly the same thing as the bad hacker, it's the same exact skillset, and you're using the same exact techniques and information to try to break that lock, but your goal as a good hacker is really to help everyone like you and me to make sure that our stuff is protected. So hopefully they don't get in trouble because they're the good guys.","96":"You know, you're right. When you read about some of these technologies, it does feel like science fiction. But the part of nanotechnology I wanted to talk to you about is stuff that you probably use every day, most of your day, all of the time. Can you guess what aspect of nanotechnology I'm gonna talk to you about?","97":"So this is a silicon wafer, and they're embedded in basically almost every object that you use, from a laptop, to a phone, to cars, television sets, appliances. We ended up cutting these into little squares and those repeating patterns, each of those is a processor. And those chips are what goes into all of these objects. What I want to talk to you about is how we got from where we started, and how we're able to actually fit 18 billion of these little devices in a little one inch by one inch area. They're called transistors. It's a switch. Very simply, think of it as a light switch that turns on and turns off using an electric field by applying a voltage.","98":"I went through my kid's Lego bins to build a very simple model of a transistor. And these are wired together in circuits so that you can do computation. You can do logic with them. Where nanotechnology comes into play, the way you double the number of transistors on a chip. Can you guess what you would have to do to this transistor?","99":"You have to make it smaller. Exactly. But here's the problem. So about 10 to 15 years ago, the devices got so small that if you shrunk them this gate, that actually turns it on and off loses its ability to control the channel. And so what they did, was they took devices like this into these things, we call them, FinFETs, kind of like a fin on a fish. So they're very thin transistors. The width of these fins is only six nanometers. Okay? So 6 nanometers is 25 to 30 atoms across. And they repeat this over the entire wafer just about perfectly. It's just a huge feat in engineering. But these types of devices are exactly the kind of devices that your phones and computers either have, or will have in the near future. And it's a way that nanotechnology is directly impacting you right now.","100":"Exactly. So these are made using a technique called lithography. You basically coat the silicon wafer with a polymer. Then you put a mask on it and then you shine light through it. And the features of the mask, the size of those holes determine the feature size in the chip. It's not just the size of the mask that matters. It's the wavelength of the light that's used. We talked about nanotechnology being science fiction before, but this is real stuff that's being produced, that's being made, that's being used every day by people.","101":"That's probably a good idea, maybe somebody else likes it more than you do. So normally, when people trade, they have to go to the store, or they have to know the person so they can get what they asked for. With blockchain, you can make that exact same trade, but you don't need the store, and you don't even necessarily need to know the other person.","102":"So on code.org, one of the things you've been doing is actually building a game or that they have a game and then you can actually rewire some of the inputs and outputs of that. Is that right?","103":"Okay. With computer hacking, it's actually the same thing. Really, you have some sort of system and you have a bunch of inputs and you have some sort of output, and actually you, as the designer, you're essentially designing games and software. You're saying, well, I will only allow a user to really control these inputs. Can you think of any inputs the computer might have?","104":"Well, that's true, we do use slingshot technology once things are out in the solar system. So, for instance, we use Jupiter and other planets so that when some of the spacecraft gets close, it'll slingshot around and it'll cause it to speed up. But mostly, around the Earth, gravity pulls things down, so when we want to send a rocket into space, when we wanna go to the Moon, when we wanna send supplies to the International Space Station, the trick is to get something moving fast enough that it escapes the gravitational pull of the Earth. Have you heard the expression what goes up must come down? It's actually not true. If you throw it fast enough, you can actually get something that doesn't come back down again, and that's basically how rocket launches work. You have to get the rocket for the Earth to go more than 11 kilometers a second. Think of how fast it is. Just one breath and it's gone 11 kilometers. If you get it to go that fast, it's not gonna come back down again. So you know the International Space Station which is orbiting the Earth? That's going around the Earth at 17,000 miles an hour. It has no engines anymore, the engines are turned off. So it's just there falling forever. So once it's out there, it's not coming back down as long as it's cruising like that.","105":"That's because in some sense, you're really not. Imagine you're in this train and it's going near the speed of light relative to the platform, but it's so smooth, then you should be in a situation in which there's no meaning to your absolute motion, there's no absolute motion. So that if you throw a ball up, you might think from the outside of the platform, be confused that when gravity pulls that back down, it's gonna hit you or something, but it'll land in your palm as surely as if you were in your living room.","106":"So, let's say you and Marina are floating in space and you can't tell who's moving. Let's say you both see a flash of light. A flash of light comes from somewhere, you don't know where. So you measure the speed of light to be 300,000 kilometers per second. But here comes Marina and she's racing at the light pulse, as far as you can tell. Two cars driving towards each other seem like they're going faster towards each other than somebody who's standing still relative to one of the cars, right?","107":"So you would say, oh Marina is gonna measure a different speed of light. But she comes back and she says, No. 300,000 kilometers per second. Because from her perspective, she's standing still, and the laws of physics have better be the same for her. The speed of light is a fact of nature that's as true as the strength of gravity. And the two of you are in this quandary because if one of you is the preferred person who correctly measures the speed of light, that ruins everything about the idea of the relativity of motion. Which one of you should it be? So Einstein decides they must both measure the same speed of life. How could that possibly, possibly be the case? And he thinks, well, if speed is how far you travel, your spatial distance, in a certain amount of time, then there must be something wrong with space and time. And he goes from the constancy of the speed of light and a respect for this idea of relativity to the idea that space and time must not be the same for you and for Marina. And that's how he gets the idea of the relativity of space and time. [laughs] You have the best expression on your face. [laughs] It's pretty wild, but that is a starting point, actually, of the whole theory of relativity. That starting point leads to this complete revolution in physics where we suddenly have a Big Bang and black holes and space-time. Just from that one simple starting point. So, is your impression of gravity different than when we started the conversation?","108":"[laughs] That's exactly right. It kinda is like recharging your battery, right? And sleep is so critical for so many parts of our body and our mind, right? It plays a really important way that we learn, and it helps us kind of recover from the day before. It affects our immune system and our metabolism, all of these things that we need to kinda be healthy.","109":"And so what's really cool about this is that giraffes need to sleep like everybody else, and so the way that it does is it kind of slumps over and it gets down on its legs and it kind of becomes this ball, but what's crazy about the whole thing is they only sleep for like 30 minutes a day. 30 minutes! Because it can't waste any more time, because it can't be vulnerable for any longer. It can get eaten by lions and that kind of thing. It has kind of evolved in a way that it can still survive and still get all the restoration it needs under such a short period of time.","110":"Really tired. Do you think you were a little crankier than usual? Yeah. That's actually really interesting, because what happens is humans and everything needs to sleep eventually, and so you can't stay up indefinitely, right? What do you think happens if you don't sleep?","111":"Right, right! So how do they do it? In the area that they live in, they need to stay cool, right? And so they spend a lot of time in the water, and so then as a consequence, they need to sleep in the water, but how do they do it? So it's really fascinating. What they do is while they're sleeping, they actually float back up to the surface and breathe without waking up. They're able to go about their whole sleep cycles but still able to breathe, because their body has adapted in a way that they can still get the oxygen that they need. It's a really amazing thing. What do you think?","112":"One half of their brain at a time. So half of their brain goes to sleep, and the other half stays awake, so that they can continue to breathe and swim, and they do it in this four hours a time, so like their right part of their brain sleeps, they're able to go up to the surface and breathe. Then their left part of their brain sleeps for four hours, and it goes back and forth, back and forth, so they can kind of maintain alertness, still breathe, and survive. Is that amazing or what?","113":"Nano is kind of a funny word, right? It's a word that's used before another word, and it means one billion. What's the smallest object you can think of?","114":"If I took this stick and I was to draw 1 billion lines, the distance between those two lines would be one nanometer. So that's really all it is. It's just a measure of size. But it's really, really, really tiny, smaller than anything that we can see with our eyes. The reason why, in nanotechnology, scientists, we care about things that are that small, is because there are objects called atoms. Have you ever heard of atoms before?","115":"That was a perfect explanation. But what if I told you that scientists invented a special type of microscope that not only lets you see atoms, but also lets you move them around and build things with them. Would you think that would be pretty cool?","116":"I study it because objects that are that small have really interesting properties. They behave completely different than objects that are big. And because of that, we can build really cool things with them. Like really fast computers, for example, or new types of batteries or new types of solar cells. And a lot of nanotechnology is kind of like playing with Legos. You take these small objects and you put them together to build something new. Something interesting that no one's built before. It's like Legos for scientists.","117":"Mostly in VR we talk about the display and optics, the visual side of things, but we should at least tick off the other senses. And haptics is an interesting thing about virtual reality really doesn't have that aspect of touching things. You can move your hands around, you can do everything but its a disconnected experience because you know you don't have an actual solidity there. And I am pessimistic about progress in haptics technology. Almost all other areas I'm an optimist and I'm excited about what's coming up, but I don't have any brilliant vision about how we're going to revolutionize haptics and make it feel like we're touching the things in the virtual world.","118":"There was a huge concern about that at Oculus. And the term internally that went around was poisoning the well. They were very, very concerned. I mean for a long time there was a fight about whether gear VR should even be done, because the worry was if we let a product go out, like gear VR that didn't have those things. That if somebody saw it and it was bad, made them sick, made their eyes hurt, then they would be like I'm never going to try VR again. I tried it that time and it was terrible. And there was legitimate arguments about whether it was even a good idea to do that. And it turned out that yes, its obviously better to have all those things, but you can still do something that's valuable for the user without it. Its weird being at the beginning of a medium like this.","119":"So, when you say it's an inverse-square law, that means that the closer you are, the more strongly you feel the gravitational pull. And that makes sense. There's very few things that are stronger when you're further apart.","120":"So you can also think of a gravitational field, something that permeates all of space. Even though the earth is three stories below us, it's not as though it's pulling at us from a distance. We're actually interacting with the field at this point and there's a real interaction right here at this point. And that's nice, because people were worried that if things acted at a distance, that the way that old-fashioned inverse-square force law describes it, that it was as spooky as mind-bending a spoon, that it was like telekinesis. If you don't touch something, how do you affect it? And so the first step was to start to think of gravity as a field that permeates all of a space. And it's weaker very far from the Earth and it's closer very close to the Earth. So one way to think of this field as a field that's really describing a curved space-time that is everywhere. Forget the difficulty of the math, just the intuition comes from two kind of simple observations. One was what Einstein described as the happiest thought of his life. So, right now, you might feel heavy in your chair, and we might feel heavy on the floor and our feet, or standing in an elevator cab. And Einstein said, what does the chair have to do with it, or the floor, or the elevator? Those aren't gravitational objects. So he wanted to eliminate them, and one way to do the thought experiment is to imagine standing in an elevator that you can see out of, a black box. And imagine the cable is cut and you and the elevator begin to fall.","121":"You can make somebody look like they're in the International Space Station by flying up in a plane and then just free-falling, the plane just drops out of the air. And while it's falling, they will float weightlessly, and there's been a lot of experiments about it, but you don't want it to end unhappily, so the plane has to scoop back up, and then you see them become pinned to the floor of the plane, because then the plane is interrupting their fall. So that's the first thought, and then the next is, what is the shape that's chased? So if you were floating in empty space, really empty space, and you had an apple, and you threw the apple, what shape do you think it would chase, the path?","122":"Yeah, it would chase a curve, it would chase an arc. And the faster you throw it, the kind of longer the arc. So the second step to think about curved space-time is to say that when things fall freely around a body like the Earth, they trace curved paths, as though space-time itself, space itself was curved.","123":"You went, Oh. [Janna and Lisa laugh] So, that's the intuition, that's how Einstein gets from thinking that space-time is curved from the idea that, well, there's this field that permeates all of space, and what is really describing is the curves that things fall along. And from there, it's a very long path to finding the mathematics and the right description, that's really hard. But that intuition is so elegant and so beautiful and just comes from these two simple thought experiments.","124":"Well I'm thinking about the idea that there might be more than three dimensions of space. What is your impression of theoretical physicists who think about things like extra dimensions of space that they haven't ever seen?","125":"It does. In fact, one way that different universes might be created and be different from each other is that different universes could have effectively different numbers of dimensions. Like we have three dimensions around us, but there's people out there, aliens, who could live in five dimensional universes.","126":"We think that it would be, no all of this is incredibly speculative, and we don't know for sure. But the idea is that there is some deep down underlying laws that are universal and the same, but they show up differently, so they appear different. So the specific particles and forces and masses would be completely different in different parts of the multiverse.","127":"From membranes, you know. We have lines, one dimension. We have two dimensional surfaces. So if you have a line that is a vibrating physical thing, you call it a string, right?","128":"It's even better. It's the theory of everything. What would you tell a friend of yours if they asked you what dimensions are, what extra dimensions are, what a brane is?","129":"That's right. And we could live there. The world we see around us, the three dimensions of space around us could reflect the fact that we are somehow stuck on a three dimensional brane trying to escape.","130":"Yeah, that's exactly right. And you can append it. You can sort of add new information that's more current, but you can't actually go erase anything.","131":"Yeah. One of the problems that Bitcoin has faced is Bitcoins getting stolen or lost. But a lot of that actually comes from people trying to recentralize Bitcoin in different ways making themselves actually a pretty easy target.","132":"Because the materials are so small, they're at the nanoscale, their properties are dominated by quantum mechanics, which means that even slight changes in their size, in their orientation give profound changes in their properties. And while that's very scientifically interesting, and it allows you to tune their properties by making subtle changes, from a technology point of view, it's a bit of a headache in the sense that in technology want to optimize for a property and then repeat that over and over again. So what are some of the challenges that you face in the lab related to working with these materials and then trying to incorporate them into the batteries?","133":"The first thing I want to show you is origami in the real world. This is the origami lamp. It comes shipped flat but it folds, clip holds it together. The lamp has LEDs on the inside so when we power it up we get light, we have a lampshade and we get the base.","134":"Origami applications have in common, is that at some stage the thing is flat and so whenever you need to either start from a flat state and then take it to a 3D state, or conversely, for deployables like space, you want to have it in a fully folded flat state but then take it to a 3D state, or possibly an unfolded flat state. Whenever a flat state is involved, origami is a really effective way of making the transition between those states.","135":"Another origami challenge that comes up with these patterns is if we're going to make an aircraft out of this thing we're going to need hundreds of yards of folded origami. We're not going to do it by hand and this might be the new frontier in origami engineering, which is the design of machines that can fold patterns that have applications.","136":"When we were much smaller societies, you and I could trade in our community pretty easily. As the distance in our trade grew, we ended up inventing institutions, right? If you Uber or you use Airbnb or you use Amazon even, these are just digital marketplaces and platforms that help us facilitate an exchange of value. But today, we actually have a technology that allows us to trade one to one but at scale, and it's called blockchain technology. There is some kind of interface for it. You could have an app, or you could use a computer to do it, but instead of there being a company in the middle that's helping you make that transaction, it's a bunch of software code.","137":"And so it's being run by all of these different computers that have like a node. So they're all running the same software and guaranteeing your transactions as they happen.","138":"In some cases, yeah, it is. And a lot of people in the financial industry, in particular, are looking at it from the banking side of how do we use this technology to trade things like Bitcoin or other tokens that are easier to use instead of today's currency. A lot of people think about blockchain as Bitcoin because it's sort of in the news a lot, and it's this new cryptocurrency. And it's kind of exciting. But we're actually seeing a lot more use cases for blockchain that aren't around the currency side. They're more around, how do you take any asset and be able to trade that using this same technology.","139":"So today, a lot of people are working on how to create identity structures that leverage blockchains. And one of the tools for doing that is being able to cryptographically sign for a given attribute. So your government could sign that you have a US passport or a university could sign that you are a currently enrolled student. And you could then dole out that information and control it yourself and be able to show people those certifications on an as needed basis.","140":"Really glad that you could join us. So we've been talking about sleep today, various levels of complexity. But now with you, I really want to talk about what do we know about sleep and the aging brain. Can you tell me a little bit about some of the work that you've been doing in that area?","141":"So it's interesting, so I also saw that there was also a recent meta-analysis around sleep disturbances and dementia risk, and in that study, they looked about 250,000 people in this meta-analysis, and they followed them around for 10 years, and you know, when they pulled all the samples together, they found there was a 1.2 fold increased risk for developing all caused dementia, so it sounds like both sleep apnea and then maybe sleep disturbances more generally are associated with increased risk for dementia. When I think about that, I think about how sleep lives in the brain, these neurodegenerative diseases live in the brain, and so what do we know about the causality of this? Could it be that individuals who have early onset of say, Alzheimer's, have then poor sleep kind of as a consequence of that?","142":"So within dementia risk in particular, Alzheimer's for instance, there are kind of two clear features that seem to be part of the pathology, right? So there's beta-amyloid which accumulates in the brain, and then there's kind of these tangles, this tauopathies, right? And so it sounds like sleep seems to be related to the tauopathies. What about kind of beta-amyloid?","143":"Okay, so there is this bio-directional piece, but I think perhaps the most exciting thing that happened in the sleep field, at least in my view, has been understanding the role of sleep and its clearance of beta-amyloid in the brain. This idea that sleep is kind of the dishwasher of the brain, it seems like, that you know A betta accumulates as we kind of use energy, and you know it's kind of a waste product, and the idea that if you don't clear it out, that it's going to build up and accumulate.","144":"I'm excited about the future of sleep medicine. I think there are incredible innovations that are happening in the basic sciences, kind of really starting to understand what are the clear biological processes that underly some of these things as they relate to disease risk, and what is the true function of sleep, kind of the why we sleep phenomenon, right?","145":"To figure out how to do that we need to learn a little bit about what makes a point. So, let's come back to the crane. You can probably tell that the corners of the square ended up as points, right?","146":"The crane has four circles but, actually, there's a little bit of a surprise because what about this? There's a fifth circle, which is like that, but does the crane have a fifth flap in it? Let's refold it and put the wings up. Well, yes, there is, there's another point and that point is the fifth circle of our crane.","147":"And to do that we use a new technique called circle packing in which all of the long features of the design are represented by circles. So, each leg becomes a circle, each wing becomes a circle and things that can be big and thick, like the head or the abdomen, can be points in the middle. Now we have the basic idea of how to design the pattern, we just count the number of legs we want. We want a spider, if it's got let's say eight legs, it's also got an abdomen, that's another point, and it's got a head, so maybe that's 10 points. If we find an arrangement of 10 circles we should be able to fold that into the spider. So in this book, Origami Insects II, it's one of my books and has some patterns, and this is one of them for a flying ladybug and, in fact, it is exactly this flying ladybug. We've got the crease pattern here in the circles and you might now be able to see which circles end up as which parts, knowing that the largest features like the wings are going to be the largest circles, smaller points will be smaller circles. So any thoughts which might be?","148":"Origami artists all around the world now use ideas like this to design, not just insects, but animals, and birds, and all sorts of things that are, I think, unbelievably complex and realistic but most importantly, beautiful.","149":"I remember reading your papers when I was a student and we're all trying to create these materials and finding ways to exploit their properties. What I love, and I'm delighted that you're here to talk to us about is how you took inspiration from nature and sort of recognize that nature's figured out a way to both synthesize incredibly complex nanostructures with high functionality and how you sort of were inspired by that to do the research that you're doing now.","150":"So you've evolved, and I suppose, trained these viruses to build the materials that you want them to build by exposing them to the raw materials and then evolving their function. We're talking about the electronics from nanomaterials. That critical issue that we're facing is how do you go from those single experiments with a single material, understanding its properties, how do you scale that to the billions of devices that you need in a technology? It is a chemistry driven approach. We're not going to grow them exactly where we want them, but to take that one step, and to tie into what you're doing, tt sounds like there could be an area of collaboration where instead of using conventional chemistry, that we can train some of these biological elements to do that work work for us.","151":"One of the things I love about about nanoscience is it tends to break up the silos between those traditional scientific disciplines. My training was in chemistry, but I had to very quickly merged chemistry and physics. And now I see an area where chemistry, physics, and biology are coming together to produce new materials and new technology, and to advance the field forward. And so being in this field, you kind of have to cross pollinate between these different disciplines and kind of advance the field together.","152":"Whenever there's a part of a spacecraft that is shaped somewhat like paper, meaning it's big and flat, we can use folding mechanisms from origami to make it smaller.","153":"Telescopes, solar arrays, they need to be packed into a rocket, go up, but then expand in a very controlled, deterministic way when they get up into space.","154":"So when we start sticking together vertices like this, if they're individually single degree of freedom then we can make very large mechanisms that open and close but with just one degree of freedom. So, these are examples of a pattern called the Miura-Ori. When you stretch them out they're pretty big.","155":"And it's exactly the difference between the motions of these two vertices. So these angles are closer to right angles and the closer you get to a right angle the more asymmetry there is between the two directions of motion. And then the other difference is how efficiently they pack, so these started at about the same size but when they're flat notice that yours is much more compact. So if I were you making a solar array, I'd say, oh, I want that one. But if I say, well, I want them to open at the same rate, then I want this one.","156":"There's an engineering trade-off to get them both to work. And there's another place that shows up in deployable structures in a very cool structure. This is a folded tube, it sort of pops out like this but it has this neat property that if you twist it quickly, it changes color. There's a Mars Rover application where they need a sleeve that protects a drill and as the drill goes down, the sleeve is going to collapse and they're using a pattern very much like this.","157":"That's actually a really good description. The idea is that if you've got a system here that can make you see whatever we want you to see, then we can make you believe that you're anywhere else, like on top of a mountain, or in a dungeon or under the ocean.","158":"Essentially what harmony is, is like a language, right? And so as with any language, the more words you're capable of speaking in a language, the more you can say. All right, so in harmony, this might be how many notes you can think to add to a chord to make it feel a different way. Have you ever heard of the circle of fifths?","159":"Okay, that's great. On one side, we have a lot of the notes which make us feel brighter, you know, like these kinds of, (keyboard music) these really bright sounds. And the other side is a lot more to do with the darkness of a key center. So we're home in F, but imagine we're taking a quick visit to B-flat, but then the sun comes out.","160":"You got it. Ooh! Yeah? Yeah, yeah. So this is really, this is like a gleaming glade or something, you know? Let's play this tune, Amazing Grace. Let's play it in its simplest form.","161":"All right, so we're gonna start in F, right? Yeah. So say. \u266a I once \u266a F, yeah. (Amazing Grace) B-flat, yeah. F. C. F. So we're home.","162":"Just to see how things feel. Yeah. All right, lets do it. (both playing Amazing Grace) So it's F major seven, but its over A. Which is F seven over A. (both playing) B flat major seven with an A and a G in it. F major seven with an E and a D and a G, yeah. (laughter) D minor seven with a G in it. C softs, or minor, nice. B flat major. G seven, F sharp major seven. Home, yeah! I like that. So what harmony does is just gives us even more tools to tell those stories. Cool, yeah. Nice, man.","163":"So those are the dimensions. That's how we think about dimensions. Remember, we just needed one number to find ourselves on the line, we need two numbers to find ourselves on the plane.","164":"This is why physicists think about things we don't know about. We're wondering whether there could be extra dimensions you've never seen. Yeah. That are tinier than atoms. So, okay. So what have you learned? What do you know about dimensions now? How do you think about dimensions in a slightly different way than you did before?","165":"I think so. I think you're right. All right Hank, we want you to keep up studying, learn a lot of math and physics and help us discover new dimensions some day. Does that sound like a fun idea?","166":"Absolutely. And that's a great example because you have models that are operating to do things like figure out if a new email is spam or not. So what would you think about if you were looking at an email and trying to decide if it went in one category or another?","167":"Supervised learning, we have our labels and we're trying to figure out what statistically indicates if something matches one label or another label. Unsupervised learning, we don't necessarily have those labels. That's the thing we're trying to discover. So reinforcement learning is another technique that we use sometimes. You can think about it like a turn in a game and you can play, you know, millions and millions of trials so that you're able to develop a system that by experimenting with reinforcement learning can eventually learn to play these games pretty successfully. Deep learning, which is essentially using neural networks and very large amounts of data to eventually iterate on a network structure that can make predictions.","168":"So typically, you would choose deep learning if you have sufficient high quality data, hopefully labeled in a useful way. If you really are happy not to necessarily understand or be able to interpret what your system is doing or you're willing to invest in another set of work afterwards to understand what the system is doing once you've already trained it. And this also comes down to the fact that some things are actually really easy to solve with linear regression or simple statistical approaches. And some things are impossible.","169":"You build a system that could actually be useless. So years ago, I had a client that was a big telecom company and they had a data scientist who built a deep learning system to predict customer churn. It actually was very accurate, but it wasn't useful because nobody knew why the prediction was what it was. So they could say, you know, Sunny, you're likely to quit next month. But they had no idea what to do about it. And so, I think there are a bunch of failure modes.","170":"Yeah. This is actually a good example of a very real world kind of machine learning problem where the solution to this was to build an interpretable system on top of the accurate predictions not to throw it away, but to do a bunch more work to figure out the why.","171":"It's actually fairly new that we're able to solve all of these problems and start to build these products and apply it in businesses and apply it, you know, everywhere. And so, we're still developing good practices and what it means to be a professional in machine learning. We're really developing a notion of what good looks like.","172":"So and a musician, how much of it do you think is in your hands versus in your brains? Meaning like, you do have connections in your muscles from the nerves that are from your spinal cord, what if some of the learning is there?","173":"Good to see you Mike, nice to have you here with me. So we go way back. 1991, the year I got married, I moved across the country, left my husband in New Jersey, to work with you in Livermore.","174":"Okay, but that's kind of cheating. That's not getting to 10 to the 29. If you could do it with 100% efficiency that's all we need.","175":"Or we need, going around and giving my talks now, I show how we're plateauing. I showed how there was a plateau, CPA raises it up, but we're sort of starting to plateau again and we need another Nobel Prize winning idea. And so do you think it's on the horizon? Do you see anything out there that really says, oh yeah that's a good way to go? 'Cos we're gonna have to get out to the x-rays right? We can't stay in the visual.","176":"And right across the beam. Don't you think that's gonna be the challenge? 'Cos it's not like our beams are as perfect as we like to think they are.","177":"So where people are swiping credit cards, those credit card numbers were stolen. They hired a company to come in and perform a penetration test to see, can the good guys essentially break in again to prevent this sort of thing in the future? And when this team came in, they found they actually were able to get pretty much to the same point of sale system, and the way they did that was by exploiting an internet-connected deli meat scale. Once the company was able to essentially get into the deli scale, because the deli scale was on the internal network, then they were able to really escalate privilege and find a vulnerability within another system. Essentially, that just got them into the network. and once you're in the network, it's often really easy to then escalate from there.","178":"Yeah, that's another interesting concept. It's really just different layers that we have for protection, because often when you're talking about something like a corporate network, or even your home network, you typically have sort of one level of defense, right? If someone can break that or it can get in through some other system that is connected or exposes some other protocol, like Bluetooth, right? You can connect to a Bluetooth device without being on the wireless network, without being on the LAN. That potentially gives you another place that you can pivot on and then access other devices, because if something has both Bluetooth and also Wi-Fi, well, if you can get in through Bluetooth, then you can then access the Wi-Fi and get to other devices on the network. Are you familiar with buffer overflows?","179":"That's true, that laser's just a dot. And so the other thing to notice though is that, like if I shine it in your eyes and I'm sorry if I do! But it seems awfully bright doesn't it? And yet when, you know, you shine this down and you put the laser, which one do you see easier?","180":"And that's because the light will go through this glass and, when it hits that corner, it has to bend. And we actually send laser beams down glass fibers, the size of your hair.","181":"Oh you got to see a shooting star? Well that's cool, that's nature giving you the show there. So what do you think about lasers? You think they're fun?","182":"The risk right now, just during this quarantine, is actually massive now that we think about it, because you might have these legacy systems. You know, they were built 20, 30 years ago, and it's too costly to upgrade, but now you can't actually have a lot of people in a single location, so potentially, they actually do have to now add some sort of remote capabilities to these systems that were never meant to be on the internet. Have you ever had any ethical concerns with the stuff you're interested in or the work you do?","183":"What if it were illegal? Would you then do it? Fortunately it's not today, right? It hasn't been, you know, despite their attempts, none of that has been passed, but if you had a vehicle and you wanted to inspect it, but all of a sudden, it passed, I mean.","184":"But the laws don't always equate to hurting anyone. I ethically think similar to you in that, you know, what is moral to me is as long as I'm not intentionally hurting others, right?","185":"We have a lot of companies that sort of help us make sure that our trades happen, but if we could guarantee the same trade using technology as sort of a technological trust, then we wouldn't really need all those middlemen in between.","186":"So it's kinda this like really big ledger or accounting system for all sorts of things that get traded, but instead of being owned by one company, it's owned by everybody.","187":"Excellent. I got an engineering physics degree. There you go, something in common. We're here today talking about lasers. So have you have had much exposure to lasers yet at school?","188":"Okay. As opposed to the experimental side and seeing things? Okay so I'm much more, I like to see the things happening. So then the question is, what's so special about making a light that's intense enough to actually possibly blow things up? Certainly we can blow atoms up with the laser hammer and when the laser light comes in and just smacks the electrons right off the atom. And so the question really is how do you make that? Back in the 70s and into the 80s, I know that was a long time ago for you, we had big energy lasers and we had short pulse lasers, we couldn't have big energy, short pulse lasers and actually it was my supervisor and I that figured the way around that and we got something called chirped pulse amplification. Have you heard of chirped pulse amplification by any chance?","189":"One nice emotional device when it come to harmony is just thinking about how to arrive somewhere. You know, it can be so sparse, it can be so rich, and it can be really emotional. So this idea of the overtone and the undertone in the harmonic series, how much do you know about this?","190":"I think that people forget that you can work with the notes you already have by just rearranging them, just the simple idea of inversion, inversion of the simple triad, of F major. \u266aI once was lost and now I'm found \u266a \u266a Was blind \u266a \u266a But now I see \u266a Now how home do I want to go here, you know? Is there another verse to come?","191":"Because I can delay the gratification of going home. First of all, just by using inversions, even before we add the notes to the chord. One thing that I was very joyful to discover is that every single melody note works with every single base note.","192":"That's it! (laughs) A flat soft, A flat major seven. A flat major seven sharp five, with a sharp 11. Essentially, what that demonstrates is that every note and every base note are compatible. So once we realize this its like, that's great! Now what should we do? What, how, what should we, what should we, how, what am I supposed to do? What to do, right. And sometimes the paralyzing thing when it comes to arranging, there are too many options, too many things are possible. So that's when it becomes super, super important to be aware of what you wanna try and say emotionally.","193":"So essentially, the way I'd apply negative harmony would be this idea of polarity, you know, between the overtone series and the undertone series, or you know, the one side and the other side. The perfect and the play goal. The feeling of a minor perfect-- (keyboard music) Resolving, it's so moving, you know? And it's a good alternative to something like, (keyboard music)","194":"So, there's a lot about context, I think. Once you have a language, it's about using it and applying it in those emotional ways. I think that's what makes the difference.","195":"That's good, that's a great place to start. There are cells in your brain. Those brain cells are connected by wires to each other. Electricity travels down those wires and communicates from one part of the brain to the other part of the brain, and each of those brain cells makes, you know, a thousand connections, it's something like a hundred trillion connections.","196":"I would say that that map also has your feelings in it because, here's why, your feelings, most neuroscientists think, come from your brain anyway, and amazingly, whether when you feel happy or sad or angry or scared, that's just brain cells communicating with each other.","197":"This is where it gets really crazy. Could we simulate that map inside a computer and would that computer then be thinking like that original brain from which we made the map?","198":"Huh. It would be like if you simulated a hurricane. Imagine we could keep track of every variable of a hurricane. Ever. Wind speed, every water molecule, et cetera, et cetera. Temperature. And we put that inside a super-fast computer and we simulated it, right? I don't think anyone would think that the inside of the computer would get wet. Even though we had simulated the hurricane perfectly, that wetness is consciousness, it's what we are. Is it ethical to imagine mapping a male brain versus a female brain to look for differences between those, to explain alleged behavioral differences between them?","199":"So you're asking like, why shouldn't I just share my secrets with somebody? People don't trust each other. And if I was able to prove that I've done something correctly to someone without having to reveal my secrets, then that person would trust me more.","200":"What would you guys do? You'd probably first get together and like, figure out some secret code, right? And then like, write messages to each other in that code. But what if you've never met the person before? What if you wanna exchange secret messages with me and we've never met each other before? How could we possibly do that?","201":"Is there any particular memory for you that you feel has been either kind of influential in your, in deciding which areas to pursue or that you feel is sort of emblematic of what it is to have a memory?","202":"I've got one too. I was nine and we were at the science expo in San Francisco. Two scientists were dissecting an eye, a cow's eye. And I was like that is the coolest thing I've ever seen. And something about that that carried me forward. Something happened so long ago, it left some long lasting trace through neural circuits and it continues to shape the decisions we make about what to study and what to do.","203":"The best way to kind of think about that distinction really goes back historically to one of the most important discoveries in memory research. The patient was referred to famously as patient HM. The neurosurgeon went in and removed the tissue that happened to be right around the hippocampus on both the left side and the right side of HM's brain. But then they started noticing something odd in his behavior. He was not able to create new memories of the experiences he had after the surgery. And that led Brenda Milner and her colleagues to report that the hippocampus was very important for memory, but a one particular kind, these sort of explicit, or as now referred to them episodic memories. But the hippocampus was not necessary for learning skills like mirror tracing, things that you can't necessarily articulate but you just get better at over time. And it really led to a couple of decades or more even of an enormous amount of very important work that kind of kept on breaking memory down further and further into different types. Episodic and semantic as both forms of explicit memory where episodic refers to memory for an event that happened like what you did yesterday morning and semantic refers to general knowledge about the world. Implicit memory is being broken down into a bunch of different kinds like skills or habits or conditioning. And when I started graduate school, many of us felt kind of the next question was really to understand how do we now understand how they work together. This was right around when functional magnetic resonance imaging started becoming a popular tool for measuring brain activity. We could scan the entire brain and we could ask questions about multiple brain regions at once. And we discovered that what we might expect during a skill learning task that only the striatum might show activity, that we also saw the activity in the hippocampus. Or when we asked someone to form an episodic memory that we thought might depend only on the hippocampus we suddenly also saw activity in the prefrontal cortex. And so the confluence of these new ideas and questions about how different forms of memory interact together with the development of new tools for studying the human mind and brain allowed us to kind of adjust our view of memory systems, to think of them less as multiple completely separate independent systems and instead to try to understand how they really work in concert with each other and give rise to all kinds of behaviors that might not fit neatly into one category or another.","204":"I love math for the same reason. Today, I'm gonna tell you about a thing called zero-knowledge proof. So in a zero-knowledge proof, there are two people. There's a prover and a verifier. And I wanna prove that something is true to you. But the weird thing is, I wanna prove to you that it's true without telling you any reasons why. I remember when I first heard about it, I was like, wait, what? How can that possibly be? Right?","205":"So when you look at this board, we don't know where the photo was, right? Was the photo like with the corner here? In which case the puffin would be all the way at this side. Or was the photo with the corner here? In which case the puffin would be on the other side. So this is a really simple example of a zero-knowledge proof. I convinced you that I knew where the puffin was, but you didn't learn anything else.","206":"Because then even if the hacker hacked into the computer, he wouldn't learn anything. Because even the computer doesn't learn anything. So Chelsea, in your own words, what is a zero-knowledge proof?","207":"Yeah, that's absolutely right. So infinity gets used a lot of different ways in mathematics. There's a way that mathematicians think of infinity as a number, just like the number 13, just like the number 10 million. So the reason that mathematicians consider infinity to be a number is that it is a size of a set. So the first example of an infinite set in mathematics is the set of all counting numbers. So one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, et cetera. That list goes on forever. That is an infinite set. And to be a little bit more precise, it's a countably infinite set. But as a number, infinity is pretty strange.","208":"Adding infinities. Multiplying infinities. And there's a sense in which it's very similar to the arithmetic that you learned about already. But it's also totally different. It has some very weird properties. Welcome to Hilbert's Hotel. Unlike an ordinary hotel, has accountably infinitely many rooms. Suppose a new guest shows up, you might think that the new guest could take the room that's all the way down at the end of the hall, all the way at infinity, except there isn't a room like that. The rooms each have a number, and even though there's infinitely many rooms, each room is only a finite distance away. So here's how we're gonna make room for the new guest. I'm gonna ask the guest in room one to move into room two, and then we're gonna ask the guest in room two to move into room three, and we'll continue this all the way along. It looks to me like there's space for the new guest. Where is it?","209":"Room number one. Exactly. I'm gonna use this symbol for infinity, but what we've just shown is that one, the one new guest plus infinity is equal to the same infinity. What happens if we had a second guest?","210":"They can't live together. That would be a great solution. I don't know. I think these people don't really get along. So I need to somehow create infinitely many new rooms, but I can only ask each person in the hotel to move a finite distance away. So let's take the guest who is originally in room one and move them into room two. So that's creating one new space for us. And I'm gonna take the guest who was originally in room two and move them into room four. Are you starting to see a pattern here?","211":"Infinity, great. Hilbert's Hotel is a story that mathematicians have been telling themselves for almost 100 years because it's a really visceral way to think about some of the counterintuitive properties of the arithmetic of infinity.","212":"So when I'm teaching calculus and talking about concepts like limits and derivatives, those are only defined precisely with infinity. Teaching algebra, which is meant in a different sense about number systems, we deal with infinite families of numbers in their operations. Infinite sets are somehow very exotic. They're not found so commonly in their real world, but they're all over mathematics.","213":"It describes something in AI, which is that things that are really intuitive and easy for humans, are actually really difficult to build into AI systems. And on the flip side, picking up an object, really simple for people, but it's actually really difficult to build that into robotic systems. So do you have any experience working with robots or other AI systems?","214":"Yeah, exactly. One thing that my research has been looking into is, if we can have robots learn from data, we'll collect data from the robot sensors. And if the robot has sensors in its arm, to figure out the angle of one of its wrist, for example, then we'll record that angle. And all of the robots experience will go into a data set, that if we wanted a robot to solve a task, like, I don't know, picking up a cup, and then maybe you want to pick up a different cup, if it only had the data of picking up the first cup, do you think it would be able to perform well on the second cup?","215":"So you can think of robotics as having two core components. One is perception, being able to see and feel and so forth, and action, where the robot actually figures out how to move its arm. And both components are really essential, and both components are quite difficult. If you train a perception system independently of how to choose actions, then it might make errors in a way that mess up the system that selects actions And so if you instead try to train these two systems together, to have it learn perception action for the goal of solving these different tasks, then the robot can be more successful. One thing that's really difficult about robotics is, there actually isn't that much data of robots in the world. On the internet, there's all sorts of text data, all sorts of image data that people upload and write. But there isn't a lot of data of doing a simple thing, like tying your shoe, for example, because it's so basic. One challenge is even just getting data sets that allow us to teach robots to do these simple kinds of tasks.","216":"Deep learning is a common toolbox for addressing some of these challenges, because it allows us to leverage large data sets. And so, deep learning is basically, corresponds to methods for training these artificial neural networks. Another common method that comes up is reinforcement learning. A third kind of algorithm is meta learning algorithms. And these algorithms learn not just from the most recent experience on the current task, but leverage experience from other task in the past. And they're not just completely separate. We can combine the aspects of these algorithms into a single method that gets the benefits of each of them.","217":"But if you take a more interesting shape, some kind of fractal shape, like let's say the coastline of great Britain and you start doing this box, counting experiment, something really interesting happens as you make these boxes smaller, the number of boxes you need to cover the coastline grows faster than it would for just a straight line.","218":"And so what this box counting is getting at is saying, well, I still can never decide what the length of the coastline is, but what I can do is I can see how quick does the number of boxes grow relative to how it would grow just for an ordinary one dimensional curve, like a line or a circle.","219":"Yeah like perlin noise is a great example, right? Perlin noise was one of the early ways of synthesizing additional texture at any level of detail that you needed to make things look natural and realistic. I have a, a random question. Do you know how the research into fractals began? You can look pretty far back in history to see kind of glimmers of this idea of fractals in science in the 19th century, people were trying to look for examples of things in mathematics that were very unnatural. So there was, for instance, this guy named Georg Cantor, who was showing that you can have these sets with really strange properties, or you can have functions with really strange properties. This thing called the devil staircase and so on. And it wasn't until about a century later where someone named Mendel Brock said, Oh, actually this strange mathematics that was meant to show how unnatural things can happen is actually a perfect description of things that really do happen in nature. And from there, people really ran with it and said, Oh, okay, well, if these fractal descriptions are good for nature, we can also use that for creating really realistic and believable pictures in computer graphics.","220":"Exactly, right? That seemed pretty simple for the robot to do. Say we even just move the cup over here. Do you think the robot would still be able to stack the cups?","221":"Exactly. So, Moravec's paradox is something that means that these really simple things, like stacking cups, is really, really hard for robots, even though it's really easy for us. While robots are actually really good at really complicated and really difficult things. Think about the task of multiplying two really big numbers together.","222":"And the way we're gonna approach this is through something called NP-completeness. What an NP-complete problem is, it's a problem that's really hard to solve. But if you can solve it, you can solve any problem that's in the class NP. And that includes a vast number of problems. And what we're gonna do is we're gonna use an NP-complete problem to actually prove an incredible variety of statements through a zero-knowledge proof. And the specific Np-complete problem that we're gonna be looking at is called map three-coloring. Okay, so here we have a map. Okay. And these are a bunch of countries. And we've arranged them so that no countries that have the same color share a border. That's what makes a map like this validly colored. And now you might think, well, why should we care? It turns out that whether or not a map can be three-colored in this way is an example of an NP-complete problem. And it turns out that, you know, maybe what you really wanna do, is you wanna give a zero-knowledge proof that you have at least 0.3 Bitcoins, right? That would be cool.","223":"Without revealing what the address is of your account. It turns out I can take that statement that I have at least 0.2 Bitcoins, and convert it into a map of countries. And that map of countries will be three-colorable like this only if you have at least 0.2 Bitcoins.","224":"But as you'll see, now it's not green, it's blue. And this one on the other hand, is green. Okay. The colors I showed you last time, don't work with these new colors, right? This wouldn't have worked before.","225":"Exactly. Right. But it works for this coloring that I'm showing you right now. So what we've done is we've made it impossible for you to put the pieces together. And if you do this, let's say, a thousand times. And if I correctly showed you different colors, each thousand times, you'd be really convinced. And that's it. That's the entire zero-knowledge proof.","226":"It's not about making something more efficient. It's about doing things that we just didn't know how to do before. I can actually prove to you without revealing to you any of my secrets that I use to behave honestly. Right? I could prove to you that I signed some encrypted document correctly. Right? Without revealing to you what that secret document was. That ability to change the game. Like, really just change what we can do is what zero-knowledge brings to the table.","227":"One great example is like in elections. If you could prove that an election was correctly conducted. That every vote was counted, and it all added up to one person winning with a particular total, in zero-knowledge, then you don't have to give up the actual votes of any person. And yet everyone could see that, hey, yeah, it was done correctly.","228":"So what's so fascinating about the continuum hypothesis, if you take a subset of the real line that's infinite, does it necessarily have either the cardinality of the naturals or the cardinality of continuum, or is there some sort of third possibility? What's very surprising is the continuum hypothesis has been completely resolved in the sense that we now know for absolute certain that we will never know whether it's true or false. So this is a little bit confusing. The standard foundational axioms of mathematics that we take for granted are completely insufficient to prove the continuum hypothesis one way or the other. Mathematicians among other things have been very clear about exactly what they're taking as an assumption and exactly what they're concluding from it. So mathematical practice is to be exact transparent about the hypotheses you need to prove your theorem. So now I think of a proof of a theorem more like constructing a function where the domain of that function is all of the hypotheses that I'm assuming and then the target of that function is maybe a particular element in some universe that is the modularized space of the statement that I'm trying to prove or something like this. If the foundations were to change, if set theory were replaced by something else, maybe dependent type theory, do you think the theorem you've proven would still be true?","229":"The hippocampus is a part of your brain that if you kind of took it out and looked at it, it looks a lot like a seahorse and it plays a really important role in creating those kinds of memories that help you two years after your vacation share with me what happened that day, all these details of that day. There's another part of the brain. It's actually also important for memory and it's called the amygdala and it is important for keeping all the kind of emotional processing going for memory. So memory for things that are really scary, it's gonna talk to the hippocampus now and get that memory to be really strong. Why do you think it might be important to remember scary things?","230":"Right? Yeah. So that's already a really good idea of what a fractal is. It has some really, really interesting detail at all, scales that makes it hard to talk about standard quantities like lengths and areas and volumes.","231":"Yeah, so if you look at kind of the wrinkly surface of an asteroid, each one of those little wrinkles adds a little bit to the surface area. And so it's really hard to say, what is the area of an asteroid? Let's take a look at a little example of where fractals actually show up in nature. What we're gonna try to do is we're gonna try to say what the length of the coastline of great Britain is. So we're gonna start out with the blue ones, which are spaced further apart. We're gonna ask you to connect the blue pins with a piece of string so we can get a measurement of the coastline. So we have our first measurement of the length of the coastline, and we're gonna do it over again. But this time we're gonna use the white pins, which are spaced closer together. So we measured the coastline again. And what do you think happens?","232":"Yeah, totally.  Like it's a shape that you can't use sort of the ordinary language that we use to talk about shapes you really need some other ideas or concepts to talk about.","233":"Our topic today is quantum sensing. So quantum is about the study of stuff that's really, really, really small and sensing is about measuring. So the word sensing comes from kind of like our senses. So do you know what your five senses are?","234":"Touch, exactly. So it's kind of really important for us to be able to have these senses, so we know what's happening in the world around us, right? In doing quantum sensing is we're trying to measure things that can be hard to see. Let me show you. Can you see inside it with your eyes?","235":"You wouldn't be able to see into the middle. If you had the right tools, you could start to think about ways to look inside the ball without cutting it open. That would then, you'd still have your ball. We could still play with it.","236":"In a way, it's part of the same continuum. What you're doing is changing the technological platform and you're actually able to probe it more sensitively. The resolution you're able to get is much higher, so you can see smaller signals in a much smaller volume.","237":"I think as you said, you know, anything that interferes with my signal is noise, but it can come from different sources. In some ways, the operation of the quantum system itself, as it's sensitive to different physical phenomena, the ones that I don't like, I call noise. The ones I do like, I call signal and that's an artificial definition that I'm making when I choose to build a sensor. One of the challenges we have is, we're trying to figure out if I wanna control it, where is it coming from? I remember we had experiments running in our lab one day and we were running these experiments about 100 megahertz. All of a sudden, we saw these big spikes coming in and we realized we're picking up the local FM stations.","238":"Right, it could give you information if you read it out, about what's happening or you have to find smart ways to suppress it so that you can focus on what you really do care about.","239":"So one of the things that we're interested in is looking at, suppose, I want to build an entangled quantum sensor, when I put a number of spins together, in addition to being sensitive to an external field, they're sensitive to each other and they start talking to each other. You don't just see the external spins, you see the fluctuations of all the other spins in your system. So what you wanna do is make sure that they don't interact with each other, but they still stay sensitive to everything else. And there, you could think about the local interactions, the magnetic interactions between the spins as a form of noise. In some ways, it's interfering with what you wanna measure, which is the magnetic field outside the sample.","240":"So do you think you can integrate multiple NV centers or multiple optical sensors? So are there ways in which you can overcome this question of there's a spot size and that limits how many NVs I can pack into a certain region?","241":"Right. People bring in very different perspectives into what used to be a very niche field. I remember in physics, you'd only talk to people in your subfield and now we're picking up the phone and talking to people in the different departments, completely different areas and we're forced to learn different languages.","242":"it's something that we've already figured out for classical computing like something that amazes me is all the parallels between what we're going through now for quantum computing and what we went through for classical computing","243":"it let's talk about some of the things we think need to happen between now and fully fault tolerant quantum computers to get us to that reality i mean there's so many things that need to happen in my mind one of the things we need to do is build all these different layers of abstraction that make it easier for programmers to come in and just enter at the ground level you know","244":"Yeah it looks really blocky. And it's the same thing not only with shapes and games, but also colors and textures. And this is an especially a big problem in virtual reality because you have no control over where people are gonna go. What they're gonna look at, how close they're gonna get to various objects. So fractals on the other hand are these things that have infinitely, you know, nice details you get closer and closer and closer. And so this is something that can help us solve this problem in computer graphics of generating more detail. One of the reasons why fractals are really nice for computer graphics is because the algorithms that we use to draw images also have this kind of recursive flavor. What's recursion?","245":"They're easy for a computer to execute, right? It just has to run this recursive procedure over and over and over again. We can kind of get as much detail as we want or need. When I think about fractals and kind of what they've done for computer graphics. The example I think is subdivision surfaces. Did you, did you encounter subdivision surfaces in your graphics class at all?","246":"Because I want to draw a smooth curve on the screen, but all my computer can do is draw straight lines. And that's actually too true of GPUs. It's kind of interesting. GPUs are basically really fast machines that can only draw one thing and that's a flat triangle. And so if we keep doing this with our paper, you kind of get pretty quickly the idea of what's gonna happen. So when you go to see a Pixar movie, for instance, every surface has been subdivided down. So you have tiny little triangles called micro polygons that are even smaller than the size of a pixel.","247":"Well, because people who really need to use these subdivision services for everything, people who worked hard over the years to make this super, super fast. In fact, subdivision services were invented basically at Pixar. There's this guy, Ed Capel, and he was harshly responsible for one of the most famous kinds of subdivision surfaces called Capel Clark subdivision surfaces. And in fact recently won the touring award for these subdivision services.","248":"Okay, back into the 1960s, there was a research agency in the United States called DARPA, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency. Actually, it was called ARPA at the time. They wanted to build this notion of a packet-switching network. Not a circuit switch network like a phone network where you get a dedicated path and a dedicated set of bandwidth and links from source to destination.","249":"There's a lot big, right? And so remember, this was a Department of Defense, was they wanted to have forms of of communication that were very robust, that were survivable. Packets could all find their own ways, be routed differently through the network. So if parts of the network failed, you could route around failures.","250":"So you can sort of see how the network architecture that wasn't designed to be 100% reliable inside the core of the network, and had that complexity built into the edges of the network. And to me, the really cool thing is you put this infrastructure in place, and then all these super creative people think about amazing things to build on top of it. And you see this proliferation of amazing applications.","251":"Ah ha! Spoken like a real computer scientist, right? You're a computer scientist. I'm a computer scientist. We talk about APIs, application programming interfaces. The API for the internet is something called a socket. And a socket simply says, I can communicate if I know your internet address, you know, 128.119.40.186, that number is the IP address of my server, the University of Massachusetts. If you know that, you can write a program anywhere in the world and send a message, and it'll pop out at my end.","252":"Okay, well I don't know about the number seven, but there's something in the internet that's sort of similar to that. It's called the Domain Name System. The DNS's role is to translate names like gaia.cs.umass.edu, or ibm.com, or facebook.com to an IP address so that your application can actually send a message to that name, to that named service.","253":"That's 98% true. And if you own a network, like you're att.com, or your verizon.com, you can do, within that network, you can do what you want, right? So in that sense, the internet is very decentralized, that the control of the network is up to whoever owns the network. The 2% where you said there's nobody in control, there's a little bit of centralized control. There's an organization called the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers. Its responsibility is to handle, as the name ICANN suggests, names and numbers. It's that little bit of centralization, central authority that you need.","254":"In terms of tenfold speeds of increases, depending on what device you're using right now, it's available, all you need to do is upgrade. So the Wi-Fi protocol's called 802.11. And this is sometimes a source of confusion for people. How can it be that I've got a connection at 100 megabits per second from our TV into our router? 100 megabits per second not enough?","255":"Exactly, right. And maybe they're dropped in your apartment, but much more likely, they're dropped because of congestion somewhere between the Hulu or the Netflix or the Disney server, if you're watching a video, and your home. So even though you've got 200 megabits per second on that last hop, you don't have 200 megabits per second from the server into your apartment.","256":"Yeah. It is exactly using quantum phenomena to sense and measure things and the idea is that, if I can harness quantum phenomena and I can push the limits that are possible, I can get something that's ultimately more precise and potentially more accurate over time too.","257":"So I study spins. And so, spins are one of the platforms that people have suggested is a useful platform for building quantum technologies and I study spins on the solid state. And one of the platforms I work on is nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond.","258":"So in some sense, the phenomena we're studying essentially is nuclear magnetic resonance or electron spin resonance which is a very similar phenomena, but uses the spin of the electron rather than the spin of the nuclei.","259":"So rather than trying to build a lot of complex algorithms and gates with it, what you do is, you take these quantum bits and you take them out into the world and say, what do you see? What are you sensitive to? So you can use an idea called entanglement to make an even more sensitive quantum sensor, but it's even more fragile. So there's always this trade-off between being super fragile and being super sensitive at the same time.","260":"So entanglement is the idea that two particles are correlated. They're essentially in the same quantum state, so that you can't disturb one particle without disturbing the second particle. And so, if I have a large number of quantum sensors that are entangled, then they're all going to interact much more strongly than if I just had one of them interact at a time.","261":"So some ways, you know, when atomic clocks were designed and built, we didn't necessarily think of GPS, but technology often works that way is that, there are new discoveries and then someone else comes along and says, hey, this is a great tool for some other application.","262":"Well, we're gonna be talking about computers here today, and we're gonna be talking about the internet. I always like to think of the internet by analogy to say road systems for example, where you have roads in your neighborhood. You have state roads, you have the Interstate Highway System. And so the internet is a lot like that. It's an interconnection of local roads, local networks like the network in your house for example.","263":"Wow. Great question. Often, it's a little blue wire called an ethernet cable. So that cable is able to bring bits of information up into your apartment at say, a billion bits per second. That's pretty fast, right? Literally a wire that goes between a box in your apartment, sometimes called a router or a modem in your apartment that comes from an internet service provider come into this first network and then that network connects to another network connects to another network connects to another network.","264":"We could talk about that by analogy to a road system. It's not just one big, super highway. It's a lot of smaller super highways that are all interconnected. And those interchanges are what are called routers. That's where the links come together. You're talking about talking to a friend in Australia. So oh, it's coming in from the East Coast of the United States to this router, and it's going out say, that routers in San Francisco, it's going out on an underseas cable over to Australia rather than in this direction up to Japan.","265":"That's really what we call the first hop. It's like from your phone, from your tablet, from the computer that you're on, there's no cables coming in. You go over a wireless connection. Wi-Fi is the protocol that allows your computer to talk to that first hop router over a wireless communication link.","266":"Ah, another great question. There's a couple of things that could happen inside the internet. Information is sent in these little packets of information from the Netflix server to your display device. And literally, each packet that arrives says, This is the first packet for Jenna. This is the second. This is the third. This is the fifth. This is the fourth. And they're reordered for you. Matter of fact, your computer will say, using the TCP protocol to the server, Hey, I didn't get packet four, can you resend it again? And again, the Netflix server is very happy to send you packet four again. The other is the internet protocol. If you think about sending letters through the US Postal Service, how you've got an address on it. So every packet that flows from the Netflix server to you has an address on it. It says, This is going to Jenna. It's going to the what's called the Internet Protocol address of your device. Think of all the range of devices that are hooked up to the internet. It's totally amazing, right? Every single one of them has one thing in common, and that is they speak the IP protocol, the Internet Protocol. That was a great question.","267":"That's the computer science brain thinking right there. So we wanna think of a function as procedure or mapping between sets. So a function defines a one-to-one correspondence if it defines a perfect matching between the elements of its domain set and the elements of its output set. We call such functions bijections or isomorphisms. So the reason I'm so interested in this idea of a bijective function or a one-to-one correspondence that guarantees that every element of one set gets matched with an element of the other set, no matter how many elements there are, these bijections or these one-to-one correspondences as they help mathematicians reason about infinity.","268":"Today we're gonna think about infinity as a cardinality, which is a technical term for a number that could be a size of a set. And we're gonna use this idea of one-to-one correspondence to try and investigate the question of whether all infinite sets have the same size. So what I've drawn here are some pictures of some of the infinite sets that appear in mathematics. So the natural numbers are the prototypical example of an infinite set. So the natural numbers are clearly a subset of the integers. Both of these are infinite sets. Are they the same size infinity or different size infinities?","269":"I'm gonna now try and convince you that they are in fact the same size infinity. And this is using this idea of a one-to-one correspondence which was applied in this context by Georg Cantor. What he says is if we can match up the elements of the integers with the elements of the natural numbers so that there's nothing left over, so that there's a bijective function between them, then that's a proof that there's exactly as many natural numbers as there are integers. Start by matching zero with zero and one with one. But then we wanna include the negatives in the list. So which natural number would we match with negative one?","270":"Great. So now I have a much harder question. So we have the same challenge, again, evidently there are way, way, way more rational numbers than there are integers. Does that mean this is a larger infinite set than the integers? What do you think?","271":"So I'm going to use this picture to count the rational numbers by actually counting the elements of this larger set because it'll be clearer geometrically. What I've drawn in this picture is the integer lattice. So Z cross Z refers to the set of all of these dots. So I'll start by counting the number at the origin, and you can see I'm just labeling the dots around the origin, moving in a counterclockwise fashion and getting progressively further away. And this process could continue, but maybe by now you see the pattern, though it'd be a little bit difficult to describe as a function.","272":"Exactly. That's exactly right. So we were hoping to compare the size of infinity of the rational numbers with the size of infinity of the natural numbers. What we've done is introduced an intermediate set, these pair of integer points, and this proves that this size of infinity is smaller than this size of infinity. Since we also have an injective function the other way, this size of infinity is smaller than this size of infinity so therefore they must be the same size.","273":"Georg Cantor proved that it is impossible to count all real numbers like we've just counted the rational numbers or just counted the integers. This is called the cardinality of the continuum, it is uncountable. What I'm going to do now is form a new real number that I guarantee is not on this list. Okay, so here's how we do this. What I'm gonna do is I'm gonna look at the diagonal elements. So I'll highlight them. This continues forever, and now I'm going to form a new real number by changing all of these.","274":"So we've started to explore some of the counterintuitive properties of infinity. On the one hand there are infinite sets that feel very different like the natural numbers, the integers, the rational numbers that nevertheless have the same size or the same infinite cardinality. While there are other infinities that are larger. So there's more than one size of infinity, not all infinities are created equal.","275":"yeah this whole infrastructure is all about creating levels that get progressively colder as you go from top to bottom down to the quantum chip which is how we actually control the state of the cupids","276":"okay so it's this idea that you have two objects and when you entangle them together they become connected and then they're sort of permanently connected to each other and they behave in ways that are sort of a system now so superposition is one quantum property that we use entanglement is another quantum property and a third is interference how much you know about interference","277":"so you can have constructive interference and you can have destructive interference we have constructive interference you have amplitudes wave amplitudes that add until the signal gets larger and if you have destructive interference the amplitudes cancel by using a property like interference we can control quantum states and amplify the kinds of signals that are towards the right answer and then cancel the types of signals that are leading to the wrong answer so given that you know that we're trying to use superposition entanglement and interference for computation how do you think we build these computers","278":"it's a perfect question i mean it's very early for quantum computing but we're building assembly languages we're building layers of abstraction that are going to get you to a point as a programmer where you can interchangeably be programming something the way that you already do and then make calls to a quantum computer so that you can bring it in when it makes sense we're not envisioning quantum computers completely replacing classical computers anytime soon we think that quantum computing is going to be used to accelerate the kinds of things that are really hard for for classical machines","279":"So black holes, you describe them as huge. The interesting thing about black holes is they're hugely heavy, but they're actually physically really small. What really matters is the density. Do you know what density is?","280":"I can also ask how big it is, which is a question about its volume. If I make it smaller, then what's happening is it's becoming more dense. So imagine I crushed this really, really small. It would weigh the same, it would have the same mass, but it would be much more dense.","281":"Well, that's a really good question. So interestingly, the sun itself isn't heavy enough. So it has to be heavy enough that when it begins to collapse, it just overcomes all attempts to fight it. If you made something really dense, you would have to travel faster than the speed of light to actually escape. That's 300,000 kilometers per second.","282":"So one of my main research areas is something called category theory, it's been described as the mathematics of mathematics. It's a language that can be used to prove very general theorems. And an interesting aspect of being a researcher in category theory that doesn't come up as much in other areas is that we have to really pay attention to the axioms of set theory in our work. When you're proving theorems, have you ever used the axiom of choice?","283":"So the way I think about it is if you have an infinite or an arbitrary family of sets and you know for sure that none of these sets are empty, then a choice function would allow you to select an element from each set sort of all at once. When you've used the axiom of choice in proofs, do you know which incarnation of this you've used?","284":"We're used to ethernet cables that can handle many hundreds of gigabits per second over a wired device. What are the typical data rates for IoT devices? I mean, not hundreds of gigabits.","285":"My sense is you're spot on, that they'll produce over time, a lot of data. And that a lot of IoT is about computing on that data. That computation happened mostly at the edge, or somehow a combination between the edge and something happening in a far away data center.","286":"If you can already predict the answer, then you must not be gaining any knowledge by that interaction. This insight of being able to predict the future accurately, and that being an evidence of a lack of new knowledge,","287":"Yeah, I think it's a really good question. The only mechanism that we know for sure can form black holes is to collapse of very massive stars. So it's sensible to think, well maybe some very massive stars in a young universe collapsed under their own weight and then they merged and after some time they got big enough, but the black holes from stars can be tens of times the mass of the sun, maybe hundreds of times to the mass of the sun if they merge. To get to millions and billions, and if you just do the simple arithmetic of how many years that would take, there aren't enough years in the 14 billion years of the universe's lifetime. So they must have come from somewhere else.","288":"Yeah, I think that's right. I think people are really perplexed about how you make something so big in such a short period of time. It's kind of funny, the bigger you make a black hole, it seems maybe counterintuitive, but the less dense the material has to be out of which you make it. So you can, out of something the density almost of air, you can make a supermassive black hole. You can't make a star out of that, but weirdly, if you skip the star phase altogether, it's conceivable that they directly collapse. And so there's suddenly a new way to make black holes that nature has figured out.","289":"There might be many alternate routes. It might be in the very early universe that bubbles in unusual phase transitions from very high energy universe to a low energy universe can make black holes. Like, we haven't really thought of the range of possibilities.And so there could also be primordial black holes that are still around that also skipped the star stage altogether that were formed really in the very earliest phases. And I think the interesting thing is, with your looking at like the Large Magellanic Cloud, is to wonder if we're gonna merge.","290":"It's a great question. I once did a calculation of using a black hole made out of the moon and the strongest magnet we could find on Earth to see if I could make an electronic battery. And honestly, you only get about enough energy to power New York City. But we have to find one in our neighborhood first.","291":"and actually machine learning is one research direction where we're really hoping that we're going to find um key parts of the machine learning computation that can be sped up using quantum computing","292":"you can change the magnetization to be pointing up or pointing down right quantum systems we're still manipulating a device and changing the quantum state of that of that device you can imagine if it's a spin that you could have spin up and spin down but you can also if you isolate it enough you can have a superposition of up and down","293":"so you need a chip with qubits each qubit is a carrier of quantum information and the way we control the state of that qubit is using microwave pulses you send them all the way down these cables and we've calibrated these microwave pulses so that we know exactly this kind of pulse what this frequency and this duration will put the cupid into superposition or we'll flip the state of the qubit from zero to one or if we apply a microwave pulse between two qubits we can entangle them","294":"i'm glad you're interested i think the place where lots of people can get involved right now is by going and trying it out and thinking about what they could do with it there's a lot of opportunity to find these near-term applications that are only going to be found by trying things out","295":"One thing I find really fascinating about robotics is that the things that are so simple for us, like feeding yourself broccoli, so second nature to us, are really hard for robotics. When you try to take a robot and train it to do a task and simulation, and the simulation isn't perfectly accurate, it's really hard to actually model the physics of how tofu crumbles.","296":"So a fractal is something that we see every day, but it's a little bit hard to describe. It's it's a shape that if you look at it really far away, or you look at it really up close, it has kind of a similar appearance. And actually that word fractal sounds a little bit like fraction.","297":"Like coding, exactly. That's what actually a lot of the artists for the movies are working with code rather than with a paintbrush. So in your own words, how would you describe a fractal to somebody?","298":"We're in level five now. So you're the expert-expert. I'm a huge fan of the work that you did in RCP, the Routing Control Platform being a precursor to software-defined networking and the notion that rather than having protocols actually always compute things, that we could compute things in data centers. I'd be interested if you could sort of just reflect back on that time and sort of the beginnings of SDN and where it's come since then.","299":"Right, so some people have called that the flattening of the internet, right? I think it used to be on average, you would go through 10 different networks to get from a source to a destination.","300":"You're one of the most awesome networking researchers that I know. I'm curious, just to pick your brain, what do you think are some of the hot topics in networking research? Where do you think the field is heading?","301":"You know, we've had cellular networks now for 20, 30 years. So when we hear about 5G, what's trumpeted the most is the fact that oh, super high bandwidth, right? But I sense that the exciting things are more than just the network being faster.","302":"It turns out that there are only three quantities that define a black hole, its electric charge, its mass, and its spin. So the most general black hole can also spin and it can also be electrically charged. Whether or not they are has to do with how they formed. If a star collapses, it will likely be spinning when it collapses and the remnant black hole that formsbwill likely be spinning. A black hole of a certain mass, charge, and spin is indistinguishable from any other black hole with those same properties. So in some sense, they're like fundamental particles, which makes them absolutely exceptional for any other astrophysical object. Have you heard the stories about what happens inside a black hole?","303":"So from the outside, if you're an astronaut, you're watching your friend, another astronaut going into the black hole, it's as though your times become rotated relative to each other. So the profound thing is as an astronaut on the outside, looking at this round event horizon, you think of the center of black hole as a point in space, but to the person who's fallen in, it's not a point in space at all, it's a point in time. The singularity, or the end of it all, the crush in the center of a black hole is in their future. So they can no more avoid the singularity than you can avoid the next instant of time coming. So the death in the singularity is inevitable. Although we don't really think the singularity necessarily exists.","304":"The beauty of being a student of something like black holes is you never stop having new impressions of what this enigmatic phenomena is. So in a year, I'll tell you what I learned that's new.","305":"So what you're describing is the famous Hawking radiation where a black hole cleverly kind of steals energy from the quantum vacuum and radiates and in the process of evaporates. And of course this caused a big kerfuffle because when the black hole evaporates, eventually that event horizons is yanked up. And the question is, where did everything go that had once fallen in?","306":"Do you think there's ever a hope that the kind of information that you think about, the quantum gravity aspects of the universe that you think about, whether it will pan out or not, will ever be viably observed in these astronomical pursuits of the event horizon?","307":"It is amazing in the numerical simulations of two black holes merging, you really see the event horizons bobble around. And we were talking earlier about how really black holes are flawless, they don't tolerate those kinds of imperfections. And so you can so quickly watch the system wring away that misshapen merger. And it comes out in the gravitational waves, which is literally the ripples in the shape of spacetime until it settles down, and then it's utterly flawless again. It really happens fast. It's quite amazing.","308":"Right, and it allows you to prove that you've been behaving honestly, without revealing any of the secrets involved that you use to actually behave honestly. So we of course know that zero-knowledge proofs for NP-complete languages plays such a huge role in cryptography. I'm curious. What was your first experience with Np-completeness like?","309":"Exactly. Right. Because random is unpredictable and that's what we want. Right. We want that unpredictability around us to be utilized, to actually hide the information that we wanna hide. How have you used your knowledge in the projects that you've worked on? What are the challenges that you find?","310":"And on one hand memory is like a record of something that happened in the past that we can carry with us and we can like bring it back to mind. And on the other hand we need to be a little bit suspicious sometimes because we might get it wrong. In what world would that memory of the orange juice maybe be useful?","311":"There you go, there is your decision. Okay, you can take those. It took you some time there. You looked like you were really working hard at that problem. And that's interesting because actually we know that from research that when people have to make a decision between two things they like equally, some people like economists think oh those are the easiest decisions because they're both good options. But as psychologists and neuroscientists we know it's the opposite. One of the reasons is because there's no simple answer of like I know that one's better I'm just gonna go with it. And so we think that that's the kind of decision where memory is especially important because you have to kind of come up with more information.","312":"The internet is, physically, these computers that all talk to each other. Billions of computers, in the case of the internet. The internet allows us to do a lot of really, really interesting, what we call applications. You ever think about how that video gets to you over the internet?","313":"Matilda. All right. We're gonna actually build an internet. I've got a couple of things here that I wanna show you, or a couple of toys, actually. Okay, let's pretend that these round balls are computers. And the internet is something that connects them. And right now, the internet is just one communication link. And Matilda is sent over the internet from this computer to your computer. So the internet is a network for carrying information from one computer to another. Now this network here looks pretty simple, doesn't it? Right? It's just one thing. Should we add some more friends in?","314":"That's right. So that's pretty cool. There are actually lots of different ways to actually go through the internet to get from what we call a source, the place that's sending the information, to the receiver, the place that's actually gathering the information together. And that's something we actually call routing.","315":"Yeah. So that's a really good observation. In most pieces of the internet, that's exactly what would happen. We want to take what's called a shortest path. But still, there are multiple paths. And why do you think that might be valuable?","316":"Exactly. So, Skylar, that was a great discussion about what we just built. And I wanted to talk to you about, or ask you about maybe one other really important part about networks. And it's not so much the thing itself, the physical thing, but more about the rules about communication. That's governed by something that are called protocols. Are you up for one?","317":"Lettuce go on. [Skylar and Jim laughing] A knock, knock joke is an example of a protocol, right? The computer that you are using say, makes a request, you ask for something, you get something in return. In the internet, there are protocols everywhere. So that two computers that have never talked to each other before know the rules for talking to each other. This global internet with billions of people using it are just lots of smaller networks that are all hooked together to each other. But also, what the internet allows are all of these what we call applications, Zoom, video playing services, can all run on top of the same internet.","318":"Memories as models or models first and memory as part of what helps build the model starts generating new predictions. Exactly the kind you just brought up or other ways of thinking about things because an efficient model needs to let go of information, right? I just heard a colleague of mine joking about the fact that the principles of neuroscience textbook keeps growing and growing. And that if we had enough strength in theoretical neuroscience, if our models of neuroscience were good enough, that book should shrink back. We know that memory retrieval is essentially construction. And so you don't need to store all those separate memories. You need to construct them. But if you have a good model, let go of all those details and just construct them to feel as if it's a memory. But really all you're doing is using the model to fill the details. It's kind of like the matrix, you know.","319":"Getting way out there, but, but it is a way in which if you have the right model, it should be an efficient one. I'm wondering what you, what you think about what all this means for kind of a redefinition of what memory is, in many ways a revision or expansion of that notion. Would you be willing to try to help me think about how to define it?","320":"It's a great question. If I didn't see you playing the guitar, I would recognize the sound of a guitar. And even if I had never heard of a guitar before I could figure out the frequencies that the string was playing, I could tell how strongly it had been plucked, and I could tell the length of it and where it was pinned down from the harmonics of the string. And I can tell the different lengths of the strings from the notes that they play. So I can actually reconstruct the instrument that's playing it. And it's very similar to LIGO, we can listen to the notes, the amplitude, the harmonics, and we can deduce the size and shape of the objects doing that. And they're very massive and they're very small and they have all the markings of a black hole.","321":"I like that description, because it conveys how much complexity there is to these really basic tasks that we're doing. Is there a definition for the simple tasks that we do versus things that are more complex, like playing chess?","322":"That notion of hierarchy is really interesting, because it is these higher level things, like playing chess, for example, that are easier for AI systems. And the reason why they're easier is that we're providing the abstraction for the system already, then when we give the game of chess to an AI system, we abstract away all the challenges of like picking up pieces and moving them, and we say, 'Okay, there's this board of however many boxes on it.' And you just need to figure out within that very narrow, small world, what to do. But handling and learning what those abstractions should be and handling everything from low level sensory inputs to that higher level processing is really, really hard.","323":"I suspect that we'll start by doing whatever is most convenient, 'cause that's whatever we can get. But I think that for robots to be capable alongside humans, in a world with humans, I think that we may need to actually use human experience, human learning, to inform how robots learn, if we want them to follow the same kind of mistake pattern as humans, so that humans can interpret robots, and humans can understand what robots will and will not do.","324":"Right, like it reminds me so much of, you know, what we in the field would refer to as statistical learning. On one hand we might have like a one-shot memory, a memory of something that we saw yesterday, like what we did or what we ate or where we were. But a lot of our memories and our knowledge instead are based on many, many, many experiences.","325":"Some of those examples really remind me also some of the questions about kind of abnormalities in, in memory or trauma or disruptions in memory and how they also play out in terms of not just what people remember but what they do with those memories right?","326":"You know when I look back at, some of the work for my own lab and in the field in general, I really feel like some of the most exciting discoveries were not an answer to a question that was around before, but they were discoveries that made us realize we weren't asking the right question. I think one example of that even has to do with the connection between memory and decision-making. There was a discovery about how the striatum responds to rewards and to learning that just all of a sudden flipped the way we thought about the role of reward and learning and memory, and may force us to realize there was something fundamentally connected between these processes. And that discovery just raised a whole new set of questions that didn't exist before.","327":"And things that are hard for humans should also be hard for robots and humans to do. But it turns out that it's actually the opposite. I wanna try a little demo.","328":"So I have a penny in my hand and I'd like you to pick it up with your right hand and put it into your left hand. So that was pretty easy, right?","329":"We're gonna make this a little bit harder now. So, can you put these on? And we'll try to do the same thing again with your eyes closed. There you go. Let's try that one more time, and see if you can do any better. So close your eyes.","330":"Yeah. So that you're able, with a bit more practice, you're able to figure it out. When it fell on the ground, how did you know to pick it up off the ground?","331":"Yeah. It's really unintuitive. In order to survive, we need to pick up objects and everything. Basically many, many, like billions of years of evolution actually created humans and the ability to manipulate objects like that. So, it actually turns out that things that are really basic for us are actually just really complex tasks in general.","332":"That's a great question. So in reinforcement learning, the robot tries the task, and then it gets some sort of reinforcement, some sort of feedback. It's similar to how you might train a dog.","333":"We give robots a camera and the camera produces this array of numbers. Basically, each pixel has three different numbers, one for R, for G and for B. And so the robot sees this really massive set of numbers. And it has to be able to figure out, from that massive set of numbers, what is in the world. There is a number of different ways to have the robot see, but we use a technique called neural networks, that tries to take out in those big numbers and form representations of the objects in the world, and where those objects are.","334":"It depends on how you program the robot. If you program the robot to follow exact motions and follow a very specific program, then it won't go off that program. It will always do those actions. But if something unexpected happens, that the program wasn't designed to handle, then the robot might go off court.","335":"So one of the things I guess that touches on is this question about controllability or the ease of, with which everybody can create these worlds. Not just people, not just mathematicians, not just, you know, trained computer scientists. One thing when I think about Ken Musgraves working about this program, Bryce, this one I felt like I could really use, what do you think we still need to do in terms of putting these kinds of tools in, in people's hands, making it easier for people to use procedural machine learning, to build these kind of worlds?","336":"Yeah, you can see them all. And in fact, if we were really, really, really patient, we could do the same thing as with the Skittles. But here's another question. You said that there's a finite amount of glitter in that jar, and I agree. So how many jars would we need to hold an infinite amount of glitter?","337":"so did you know that there's certain kinds of problems that computers sort of run out of space almost like you're trying to solve the problem and just like how you run out of space on your iphone when you're trying to take a picture if you're trying to solve the problem you just run out of space and even if you have the world's biggest supercomputer did you know that can still happen","338":"i don't know what it's worth but uh i can put it face up right in that heads i can put it face down right so at any given time point in time if i ask you is my penny heads or tails probably you could answer it right","339":"it's sort of it's sort of a combination of heads and tails right would you say so superposition is this idea that my penny is not just either heads or tails it's in this state which is a combination of heads and tails this quantum property is something that we can have in real real physical objects in the world so that's super position and the second thing that we'll talk about is called entanglement so now i'm going to give you a penny","340":"but in the quantum world when we entangle things they're really now connected it's much much harder to separate them again so using the same analogy we spin our pennies and eventually eventually they both stop right and when they stop it's either heads or tails right so in my case i got tails and you got heads you see how they're totally disconnected from each other right our pennies in the real world now if our pennies were entangled and we both spun them together right when we stopped them if you measured your penny to be ahead i would measure my penny to be ahead and if you measured your penny to be a tails i would measure my opinion to be a tails if we measured it at exactly the same time we would still find that they were both exactly correlated","341":"the way that we are able to actually see these quantum properties is by making our quantum chips really really cold so that's what this is all about actually this is called a dilution refrigerator and it's a refrigerator it doesn't look like a normal refrigerator right but it's something that we use actually there's usually a case around it to cool our quantum chips down cold enough that we can create superpositions and we can entangle qubits and the information isn't lost to the environment","342":"And at some level, there's different set of rules that seem to come into play 'cause you can have particles at very microscopic scales seem to do really strange things. But one of the quests of quantum sensing is to harvest some of these unique properties at the micro scale. We are really interested in quantum sensors because we think they can give us the ultimate limit of sensitivity. So they're really, really sensitive to small changes, but they're also gonna be really reliable. Every time I make that measurement, I'll always get the same results.","343":"And what the MRI scanner is doing is, it's measuring the signal from all the water molecules that are present and specifically the hydrogen atom. In our bodies, we have these hydrogen atoms that are essentially spinning around magnetic fields all the time and we just don't know them. So in some sense, you've already used a quantum sensor.","344":"And then the different chemicals in the cells. If you look at the MRI images, you can see that they give you the broad features of what the tissue looks like. But if you wanna zoom in a little bit more and see what's actually happening inside a tissue or inside a cell and you need a different type of sensor that's gonna be more sensitive and for something like that, you're gonna need a quantum sensor.","345":"So there are quantum sensors that are sold for very specific applications, one of them is a magnetometer and those can be really, really sensitive to measure small variations in magnetic fields. They are trying to develop sensors that are gravitational sensors. Right now, we have no way of probing what's under the ground without digging into the ground."},"dialogue":{"0":"Explainer: Great.\nExplainee: I'm biased because I study one of the other sub-critical parts of the brain, the cerebellum.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Great.\nExplainer: Okay.

All right. The thing about relativity is that they really want you to think of spacetime as one four dimensional thing, right? It's kind of like space. It's not just three dimensions of space and one dimension of time.\nExplainee: Why though?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Okay.\nExplainer: So let me draw spacetime. Here's how we usually draw it. I'll just say X, but all of space is condensed in this one direction, and this is time, okay? So if you're a little person and you started some event, so you start, you're located somewhere in space, somewhere in the three coordinates of space, and whether you like it or not, you're moving through spacetime just by getting older.\n","19":"Explainer: Why? This is a very good question. So, let's just start with space, right? We know a little bit about space. So here's my simple minded way of drawing space two dimensions, because that's how many I can draw on the blackboard. Let's say X and Y. And what is special about space, there's many things, but one is that if I have a curve or a path between two points, there's a distance that you can calculate, right? And the distance between those two points doesn't depend on your coordinates. It doesn't depend on whether you're in radial coordinates or Cartesian coordinates, or whatever. I'm allowed to imagine a curve that does something like this between those two points, and if I were a person walking on that curve, I would have an odometer with me maybe, and I would know, you would know, even without having done that, this path is always gonna be longer than that path. There's a formula, Pythagoras' Theorem that tells you what the shortest distance path is. That's the point. The physical-ness of what is real is the distance along a certain curve. So spacetime is like that. That's why it is useful to think about spacetime.\nExplainee: Okay.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Yeah.\nExplainer: When people ask me can you travel through time? I say yes, yesterday I traveled 24 hours into the future and here I am, a day later. So that's just this. Okay, you're moving through time, like it or not. So what Einstein says is look, I can travel through spacetime in different ways, like I could hop in a rocket ship and fly out and then fly back, and then I could meet you there. So this is a different trajectory through spacetime, right?\n","20":"Explainer: When people ask me can you travel through time?

Or our base time?\nExplainer: Well kind of. What Einstein wants to get across is there's no such thing as fundamental, like there's the universe's time, this big letter T that might tell you how old the universe is, but then every individual has a clock with them, and they measure their own time depending on how they're moving through the universe.\n","21":"Explainer: Well kind of.

And spacetime has its own metric which says the following thing, that the path between two events in spacetime that is a straight line, will always be the longest time.\n","22":"Explainer: And the crucial difference is that time is not the same for this person who stayed behind and sat in their chair, and this person who zoomed out there.\nExplainee: Why is that, that this one's shorter then?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: I see. Oh, okay.\nExplainer: [Sean] That's the difference.\n","23":"Explainer: So when Einstein had this idea, oh gravity could be related to the curvature of spacetime, he did some equations, so he got it, that's a long story, we'll put that aside. What he figured out was that rather than gravity living on top of spacetime, it's a manifestation of the curvature of spacetime so when you have like the earth, the sun, the moon, they cause a gravitational field, they're actually warping the spacetime around them. They're giving it a different geometry.\nExplainee: Would it be if I had like a spring or not a spring, but like a sheet, and I dropped a book in the sheet, curves down?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: I see.\nExplainer: Einstein says that gravity is just like that.\n","24":"Explainer: But there are no straight lines, because spacetime itself is curved. So do you think if you had to explain relativity what would you say?\nExplainee: I think I'd go with kind of the train paradox. Let's say I'm stationary, and someone's moving past me on the train, they think they're stationary on the train. Like they think that they're not accelerating, but if they start walking through the train cars, then they are accelerating in their frame, but then from my outside frame where I'm completely removed, I see they are accelerating. So I guess that relativity is all about perspective, I guess in a way.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: That was pretty good.\nExplainer: [Sean] Yeah. I learned a lot.

If you imagine starting with this big piece of paper you couldn't wrap up everything, but within some region of space you could make a tube.\nExplainee: Okay.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Hmm. Okay, that's nice.\nExplainer: [Sean] You think that sounds plausible to you?\n","30":"Explainer: Why don't you explain to us what a black brane is?\nExplainee: Well in some ways, it's very much like a black hole in that you have far away from it you have these large just flat dimensions. As you move in, there's something in the interior. It has, itself, higher dimensions, and so because physicists love to joke they thought, well it's like a membrane but it can have many different dimensions. Let's use P to stand in for those number of dimensions, and so they called them P-branes.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Yeah. Yeah. So, a lot of the branes that are relevant for studying things to do with anti-de Sitter spacetimes in various dimensions actually start out as these non-singular type brains, and then you find in the core, there's actually an anti-de Sitter spacetime.\nExplainer: Right. Imagine that rather than going down to a point, it just asymptotes to some fixed radius that continues infinitely far down there. But then you can ask, okay what about the rest of the universe? You have some sphere, some two dimensions compactified, and the balance between the cosmological constant and the electromagnetic field keeps it at a fixed distance.\n","31":"Explainer: But then the other dimensions, the transverse dimensions, don't need to be anti-de Sitter. They can have either positive, zero, or negative cosmological constant. So you can basically get any sort of cosmological solution times a compactified sphere.\nExplainee: Is it that these have the lowest action of all the things that could possibly, all the possible solutions?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Okay, that's fair.\nExplainer: I mean it's one of the things that could happen, so I mean it obviously, You know, we know--\n","32":"Explainer: If the viewers wanted to know more about how spacetime can emerge from quantum mechanics, they could read the graphic novel you just wrote.\nExplainee: Right, yes. I wrote and drew a graphic novel called The Dialogues: Conversations About the Nature of Universe.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Excellent.\n","33":"Explainer: It's what keeps us on the earth.\nExplainee: What?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Nice.\nExplainer: The main thing about black hole to remember is that it's just, like I said, how the earth holds you down, the black hole pulls you in, as well. Now, try and take the ball from me, black hole--\n","34":"Explainer: Try look over there and concentrate on his face over there. Can you see me waving my hand without turning your eyes?\nExplainee: No.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Uh, three?\nExplainer: You can just barely tell. And you can see that even, like if you hold out your hand and you focus on your hand, then your foot would be blurry because there's that difference there. And you can change between that, like you can then focus on your foot and your hand gets blurry. Because your eyes can see different amounts of detail in different places. So we're hoping in the future, that hardware can be like that. Where we can make a display that puts lots of detail right where you're looking. And every time you look someplace else, it moves the detail over to there. So we don't need to render a hundred times as much as we've got right now. Figuring out where you're looking is a pretty hard problem. What we try to go about this, is by taking a camera and looking at people's eyes and then try to figure out is the eye looking over here or up here. We're working hard on stuff like this right now so we hopefully can have a virtual reality that's as detailed and realistic feeling as the reality that we've actually got around us. But its going to be a long time before we get to where we can really fool people.\n","35":"Explainer: Do you know a lot about lasers? Or just about the laser that you use.\nExplainee: Not a lot, just a little bit.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: I feel like the continuous laser delivers power at a continuous rate, whereas you want all that power to be delivered in a really, really short time with your amplification.\nExplainer: And so we get the power with a lot less energy 'cause its power is energy per unit time. So we aren't depositing much energy in comparison. Can I just ask, 'cause you are using the thermal process of it heating up, but have you ever had the opportunity to use laser tweezers?\n","36":"Explainer: Yes. And maybe what, do pump-probe spectroscopy and watch the cell? Or to ionize it?\nExplainee: I mean I was thinking more on the lines of if we want to, let's say destroy one cell, like a tumor cell or something like that. So that the neighboring areas are not affected but just the cell burns.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: I think short pulses might help in my experiment in the sense that if I drive my swimmers with a continuous wave as opposed to a pulsed wave, maybe a continuous wave would heat up the sample too much and a pulse laser would deliver power exactly where I need it so that I could run my experiment longer.\nExplainer: That's true. Thank you very much.\n","37":"Explainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: That's one of the things we're trying to figure out, from an artist and storytelling perspective, what are the things that will make this meaningfully different from what we're used to, like a television on our wall. And we've been finding a lot of things, aspects of virtual reality that very much do that in my opinion. Things that allow you to feel presence, first and foremost, where you get lost, and you have to remind yourself, this isn't actually happening. And things that ultimately allow you to embody other characters. Things where you can actually change your own self-perception and play with neuro-plasticity and teach yourself things that are bizarre and unique.\nExplainer: As an engineer of course, I love quantifiable things. I like saying here's my 18 millisecond motion to photon, here's my angular resolution that I'm improving. I'm doing the color-space right. But you can look not too far back where you say we have blu-ray DVDs at this amazing resolution, but more people want to watch Youtube videos at really bad early internet video speeds. Where there are things that if you deliver a value to people then these objective quantities may not be the most important thing. And while we're certainly pushing as hard as we can on lots of these things that make the experience better in potentially every way or maybe just for videos or for different things. I don't think that its necessary. I've commented that I think usually my favorite titles on mobile that are fully synthetic are ones that don't even try, they just go and do light-mapped, black-shaded. And I think its a lovely aesthetic. I think that you don't wind up fighting all of the aliasing. While you get some other titles that, oh we're gonna be high-tech with our specular bump maps with roughness. And you've got aliasing everywhere, and you can't hold frame rate and its all problematic. While some of these that are clearly very synthetic worlds where its nothing but these cartoony flat-shaded things with lighting, but they look and they feel good. And you can buy that you're in that place. And you want to know what's around that monolith over there.\n","38":"Explainer: Right, you know the difference between like one dimension two dimensions, three dimensions, et cetera. So let's do a little experiment here. So there's one dimension. I'll give that to you. Now, here's your task. I'm going to give you another dimension, and I'm gonna ask hold those two things at right angles to each other. It's easy to do. Yeah, so there's no trick here.\nExplainee: [laughing] Yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Um ...\nExplainer: There you go. So what that's doing is when you had just two that was describing a two dimensional plane, right? Like the two things pick out a plane, the three things pick out all three dimensional space. I'm gonna give you one more, and I'm gonna ask you to hold that fourth one so that it's at a right angle to all the other three at the same time.\n","39":"Explainer: That's right. So that's exactly what these would be. Have you heard that there are other coordinate systems other than XYX?\nExplainee: No.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Yeah.\nExplainer: So that's a different way of giving you two numbers and locating yourself, and we call those polar coordinates. It's a different coordinate system. What we want to do as physicists is look for extra dimensions. Can you imagine, can you think of any way that there could be extra dimensions?\n","40":"Explainer: It's exactly the same thing as latitude and longitude but we put coordinates on the sky.\nExplainee: Oh.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: [Juliana] Yeah.\nExplainer: [Sean] And sort of the peels of an orange kind of thing, right?\n","41":"Explainer: So far, what do you know about black holes?\nExplainee: I never knew beforehand how hard it was to get actual data of the black holes itself, first of all, they're dark, and, like, they're so far away, it's almost impossible just to get a good image of them. They were discussing a project in which multiple radio telescopes of some sort, like, are, like, pinpointed all across, from Greenland to South America, and, like, and they're trying to get an image of the black hole in the center of our galaxy because, as opposed to just recording its impact on the surrounding stars and planets.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: What sort of technology and, like, I guess tools have you been using in your studies, or, like, just in general, in the study of black holes?\nExplainer: For my studies, I actually, when I started at UCLA in graduate school, I worked with a professor named Matt Malkin who was, gotten a lot of data observations from the Hubble Space Telescope, so that was one of my very first projects to work on, so any, space-based observatories have been a really big advantage, and then I've moved on now to the Spitzer Space Telescope. In addition to that, then there's other people who've used a lot of X-ray telescopes, NuSTAR, Chandra have used data from that. It's been a combination of both ground-based observatories, as well as space-based ones, and going everywhere from X-ray observations, not done by me, but certainly ultraviolet, and then optical, and infrared, particularly, those are the ones that I've been most involved with.\n","42":"Explainer: So we've been, we've had, now, effectively two different ways of getting more direct measurements, one is the LIGO, which is the Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory, which is where, getting the ripples in space time, coming off of the merging of black holes. The other one that you're mentioning is actually called the Event Horizon Telescope, where they're using radio waves to actually image the event horizon, that region where light cannot escape from the black hole at the center of our galaxy, which I know they're working on it right now. It's an amazing thing, but that'll be the most direct imaging of a black hole. LIGO is a direct detection of the consequence of the merging of black holes. The critical part has been, like, for the super massive black hole at the center of our galaxy, we've seen the stars orbiting it, and we've measured the mass, so that way, so if you look at a spinning black hole, it actually fundamentally alters the emission that's coming off the stuff that's falling into it. These are discovered as what are called X-ray binaries, that is, you know, there's an X-ray member of the binary that is emitting in the X-rays, and it's really not very bright in the optical (mumbles) at all, so there's always, people are looking at these X-ray binaries.\nExplainee: What sort of technology and, like, I guess tools have you been using in your studies, or, like, just in general, in the study of black holes?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","43":"Explainer: They say that astronauts in space, definitely their spine elongates. There were two twin astronauts, one who stayed here on Earth and the other who went to the International Space Station. He was there for a long time, and when he came back, he was actually taller than his twin brother.\nExplainee: Wow.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Mm-hmm.\nExplainer: Isaac Newton would ponder, how does the Earth cause things to fall? There's a famous story that Isaac Newton was sitting under a tree and the apple fell from the tree and hit him on the head and he had an epiphany and understood this law, this mathematical law for how that works. I don't actually think that's a true story, though.\n","44":"Explainer: Isaac Newton would ponder, how does the Earth cause things to fall?

I don't actually think that's a true story, though.\nExplainee: Yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: So, if we both dropped down from a plane, we would both land at the same time, but you would land heavier?\nExplainer: Yep, so like a penny from the Empire State Building will fall at the same rate as a bowling ball.\n","45":"Explainer: And a heavy object.\nExplainee: Oh my God. [Janna laughs]\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: I've learned that the person that learned about the apple.\nExplainer: Newton.\n","46":"Explainer: It turns out, for people that are between the ages of 18 and 65, the agreed upon amount of sleep that people should get is between seven and nine hours, and it's really at least seven hours per night, to maintain optimal health as an adult. So at least seven hours. When we look at across all of the data that is available on like sleep and health, and sleep and psychiatric illness and those types of things, the largest risk is when people get five hours or less. What do you think is responsible for driving how much sleep you need, and things like that?\nExplainee: I mean, I know sleep is kind of regulated by the thalamus and the suprachiasmatic nucleus sending signals to the pineal gland to which kind of secretes melatonin, which tells us when it's time to go to sleep.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: I'm from Hoi, so we have very long days. We have early sunrises, late sunsets. Does that signify less sleep, because we have a shorter amount of time for melatonin to be released?\nExplainer: Yeah, no, that's a really great question, and the same is true in places where the sun never goes down during the summer, and when it's dark all the time during the winter, and it turns out light isn't the only thing that kind of gates your circadian rhythm. But I think the thing that's really important, again there are two processes, that the other one is the S process, and that one's just kind of a really important driver of sleep. One name we call it is the homeostatic sleep drive. Kind of the longer you're awake, the sleepier you get. You stay up, you get sleepy. Time goes by, you get sleepier. Time goes by, you get sleepier. But it's actually kind of a fundamental principle for how sleep is regulated, and it's really kind of akin to like a balloon, okay? So you wake up in the morning and your balloon is flat. You've kind of like drained out all of the sleepiness. But then as you kind of go throughout the day, it kind of fills up, so you use your energy, it gets filled up. And then it gets filled up more as you get towards nighttime, right? And then when it's at this optimal amount is when you kind of go to sleep and let out all of the sleepiness again. And this is really what underlies why napping can also be bad for you. So napping's not inherently bad, but if you actually let out some of this air during the day, it's going to take longer for the balloon to get bigger, right, I see to where you feel sleepy, right?\n","47":"Explainer: Right. You can do part of this level, and you can do the other part, clearly. Got some expertise under your belt, and that's awesome, because I think that everyone should know more about sleep. And so the way that we think about what drives sleep are two independent but related processes and so they have kind of lame names. Process S and process C, and what you've kind of described is process C, and that's the master clock, right? And it helps regulate kind of the rhythms like all over your body, all your cells, and all those kind of things. It drives the release of melatonin from the pineal gland, and melatonin comes online under darkness, so when the sun goes down, your brain knows okay it's time to start getting ready for sleep, and so you start releasing melatonin, which really kind of sets the table for sleeping.\nExplainee: I'm from Hoi, so we have very long days. We have early sunrises, late sunsets. Does that signify less sleep, because we have a shorter amount of time for melatonin to be released?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainer: Right.\nExplainer: What did you learn about sleep today?\n","48":"Explainer: That's right. All the force that we apply here, goes all the way through but then it can only basically come out when it contacts the wood in that one tiny spot. And so sometimes it's the force that you push something with but sometimes it is that force per unit area. But sometimes it's not even the force per unit area 'cos, you know, push down as hard as you can on that and see if we can get it pushed in. See it doesn't really work does it?\nExplainee: So the laser needs ultimately many things. It needs to be centered, it needs time to actually penetrate and then it needs--\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: So it's kind of like a magnifying glass? Like it magnifies the light down to a point?\nExplainer: Exactly. You know sometimes you want to have all of your energy not just in a small area but in the small volume and so one of the other dimensions is time or length. But with light, time and length are the same thing because light always travels at the speed of light.\n","49":"Explainer: Exactly. You know sometimes you want to have all of your energy not just in a small area but in the small volume and so one of the other dimensions is time or length. But with light, time and length are the same thing because light always travels at the speed of light.\nExplainee: Exactly.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: There'd be like little concentrated beams of light just flying everywhere?\nExplainer: Exactly. And so now, if we have light like that that we wanna machine with. I bring this funnel and so, if we had a lens here and the light was coming down--\n","50":"Explainer: But if you send a one second long light pulse out into the skies there, the beginning of the pulse is actually two thirds of the way to the moon. It's 300,000 kilometers long. So now, if you talk about light being concentrated, that doesn't seem very concentrated. The type of lasers I play with in my lab will be no thicker than this piece of paper. So we take that energy that might be in three hundred thousand kilometers and we squeeze it all the way down into just this piece of paper and actually the beams are more the size of this piece of paper and so, in my lab, pieces of paper like this would be flying through the sky but we can't see them. 'Cos they don't come in our eyes, they fly by us and they're infra red.\nExplainee: There'd be like little concentrated beams of light just flying everywhere?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: It funnels into--\nExplainer: Into a spot. So here would be my light coming from my laser and it would just be coming down, down, down, down, down. Hit a lens and it would have to focus down. But now, all the light started out with this big of a spread so concentrated this much. Eventually it would be here, more concentrated. But by the end, right at the focal spot, that's when I get all of my light, all of the energy has been squeezed down into fitting inside this piece of paper and that's why I say that I built a laser hammer. Because when this hits a piece of glass, it just smacks hose electrons right off the atoms and there's nothing else for them to do, they have to fly away. So can you tell me what you learned and maybe about the focusing of the light?\n","51":"Explainer: You know, everybody's been just coming at it from different wavelengths at the optical infrared, and, but definitely the X-rays has been one of those things where it's like, oh, finally.\nExplainee: And we've come a long way by seeing a wider range of the spectrum, we can elucidate more about the circumnuclear geometry, and there's just been so much progress made with all these new spectral models that we use to fit AGN spectra, and the different types of classes of AGN, like type one and type two are believed to be just a viewing angle effect of seeing this torus at different angles.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Yeah, and I think, you know, pushing towards the future, that, like, this whole multi-messenger era, and like, you know, utilizing all the different wavelength telescopes that we can is really the way to go. We cannot just build up a picture purely from X-rays alone, or purely from infrared, and, you know, I think there should be increased effort to try and have more coordinated observations with the different telescopes, like NuSTAR--\nExplainer: Oh, that makes sense, but it's always so difficult to get that.\n","52":"Explainer: But being off is not just being off. There's lots of things that are happening. We're gonna kind of talk about those different pieces of sleep.\nExplainee: Okay.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Okay. Are you like able to tell how much sleep someone's getting or what their sleep schedule is by REM?\nExplainer: When we measure all of that, we're able to see how much time someone's asleep, and how many times they wake up and stuff during the night. You know, we're also really interested in kind of, the amount of non-REM sleep someone gets and the amount of REM sleep that someone gets, because each part of those types of sleep do different things for the body. And so it's important to get both of those. And so within non-REM sleep, there are three stages ranging from N-1 to N-2 to N-3. So not particularly clever in our naming, but that's how we know what stages they are. And what they do is it moves from lightest to deepest sleep, okay? N-1, it's more kind of light, wakefulness sleep, kind of in and out of sleeping. Then you go into N-2, which is where we spend 45 to 55 percent of our sleep. And it's more this kind of light sleep, but then we get into kind of the really restorative sleep, and that's N-3. And in N-3, when we look at someone's EEG wave, we see these big slow waves, and it's called slow wave sleep. And so we spend about 20% of our sleep in slow wave sleep, though it can vary on a day to day.\n","53":"Explainer: So our sleep is made up of different types, okay? The first one is called non-rapid eye movement sleep, or non-REM, okay? Or NREM. And then the other one, which might not be a surprise, is called REM. Rapid eye movement sleep. And those are the two main types of sleep that happen. The way that we measure that as a sleep scientist is that we'll actually bring people into the lab where they can do this at home, where we put electrodes on their scalp while they're sleeping, and that allows us to measure the brain activity that's going on during the night.\nExplainee: Okay. Are you like able to tell how much sleep someone's getting or what their sleep schedule is by REM?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Oh wow.\nExplainer: Okay? When do you think you experience the most REM?\n","54":"Explainer: Okay? When do you think you experience the most REM?\nExplainee: Well I've heard that you don't really go into like a deeper sleep, so I'm guessing like N-3, or really any of the N's at all, really, if you are on technology right before you sleep. And also if there's too much light, or if you're listening to music while you're asleep or anything like that, you're not experiencing deep sleep, right?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Oh.\nExplainer: Okay? So we wake up a lot during the night, and we just don't remember it. And you'll go back down into deep sleep, and then up again into REM, you know, in kinda these cycles.\n","55":"Explainer: You know, some of that is totally accurate, that like when your brain's more engaged by being on your phone or doing things that you really enjoy or things that stress you out or any of those types of things, it's harder to get to sleep and to kind of fall into that deeper levels of sleep. Most of the REM sleep, this dreaming sleep, happens in the second half of the night.\nExplainee: Oh.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Oh wow.\nExplainer: Do you ever take naps?\n","56":"Explainer: One to six hours? That's a long nap.\nExplainee: It is a long nap.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: So N-1 being like light sleep, still a lot of brain activity going on. I can imagine that happens right after you fall asleep. Asleep. And then N-2 being light, moderate activity in your brain, still sleep, but still kind of consciously aware, and N-3 being the deepest form of sleep.\nExplainer: I want to know if you agree, sleep is the coolest thing you've ever heard of.\n","57":"Explainer: So have you taken a quantum mechanics course?\nExplainee: I have. I took that last year.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Yes.\nExplainer: So these are typically semiconductors. They can be cadmium selenide cadmium sulfide, zinc selenide and they're small clusters of atoms. They can be from 2 to 10 nanometers. What's interesting about these materials?\n","58":"Explainer: I think to really get deep into nanomaterials and nanoscale devices, you really have to understand to some level, quantum mechanics. What it teaches us as we make these devices smaller and smaller, their properties begin to now depend on the size and the orientation of these devices. There are materials, and you're taking a 2D materials class, you know about this, that are intrinsically thin. As they're grown, as they're fabricated, they're already at the nanoscale and they possess these quantum confinement properties that as a nanotechnologist, you try to exploit. And so the first ones I wanted to talk to you about are quantum dots, have you heard of quantum dots before?\nExplainee: Yes.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Well, the other day we were talking about the different dimensions you can have of nanotechnology. So all the way from like 0D to 3D. If I remember correctly, my professor labeled it as 0D?\nExplainer: That's correct. Yeah. Because of quantum confinement, once you get below this 15 nanometer range, the band gap of the material depends completely on the size of the material. So in bulk materials, if you want to change the band gap, you have to change the material, right? But in these quantum dots specifically, just by changing the size, you can change their band gap. And because their band gap is changing, their optical properties are different. And you can precisely tune the wavelength of light that they emit just by changing their size.\n","59":"Explainer: So these are typically semiconductors.

The science has really been worked out. The health stuff, because of all of the things you have to consider when you're putting something in someone's body is definitely further out there. For example, some of them are made from cadmium. Cadmium's toxic. You would never put that in someone's body. But there are other materials like gold and silver and titanium dioxide, which are less toxic and people are exploring using those. So have you learned about graphene?\n","61":"Explainer: Do you know what this is?\nExplainee: Carbon nanotube?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: So you've been talking about the different ways you can say, roll these nanotubes. So how do you go about building and controlling these nanotubes in terms of their diameter?\nExplainer: You're speaking my language. This is what I spent many years of my life working on. You don't physically roll up graphene. You grow nanotubes by basically taking nanocrystals and you deposit them on a surface. And then you do a CVD process, chemical vapor deposition. So you basically flow in a carbon source, the carbon dissolves in a nanocrystal and then once nanocrystal is saturated, the nanotubes precipitate out of them in tubes. Then you have to develop ways to go into this pile of nanotubes and pull out exactly the ones that you want. So I have to find ways to program them to go exactly in the places that I want. I modify the surface of the nanotube with specific molecules that recognize one type of surface over another. And then I just pattern the surface and the tubes just land exactly where we want them to. And it's still very much in the research stage. The ultimate goal is to build functional high-speed electronics using these new materials.\n","62":"Explainer: You're speaking my language. This is what I spent many years of my life working on.

I modify the surface of the nanotube with specific molecules that recognize one type of surface over another. And then I just pattern the surface and the tubes just land exactly where we want them to. And it's still very much in the research stage. The ultimate goal is to build functional high-speed electronics using these new materials.\nExplainee: In my nanomaterials class, actually just a couple of days ago, we were talking about different applications of nanotechnology and things we know. And we touched on the topic that right now, silicon is down to the smallest level that it can get. And so we have scientists out there researching other materials, to replace silicon.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: I gotta ask. The lights that are behind you, is that related to the quantum dots that you work with at all?\nExplainer: It's just pretty lights. [laughing] But now that you suggested it, these were inspired by the array of quantum dots that we showed earlier. So that's the story I'm going to stick with. [laughing] I like it.\n","63":"Explainer: Do you know what machine learning means? Have you heard that before?\nExplainee: No.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Sure.\nExplainer: [Hilary] So is this a dog or a cat?\n","64":"Explainer: And what makes a dog, a dog and a cat, a cat?\nExplainee: Well, dogs are very playful, I think, more than cats. Cats lick themselves more than dogs, I think.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Yeah. Yeah.\nExplainer: What about this one?\n","65":"Explainer: What about this one?\nExplainee: A dog. A cat. I think, a cat? Because it's more skinny. And also, its legs are like really tall and its ears are a little pointy.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: [Brynn] None.\nExplainer: [Hilary] None. What is it?\n","66":"Explainer: And how did you know that it's not a cat or a dog?\nExplainee: Because cats and dogs... Because they walk on their paws and their ears are like right here, not right here, and they don't wear watches.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Yeah, I have. After every unit, we have a review and then we have a test.\nExplainer: Are those like the practice problems you do before the test?\n","67":"Explainer: Do you know why we're here today?\nExplainee: Because we're talking about science.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Um, something that helps you remember things.\nExplainer: Definitely. So what we're gonna talk about, this is something that people study in the brain called the connectome.\n","68":"Explainer: What have you been up to? And yeah, what are you working on?\nExplainee: Lately I've been doing, you know, always a little bit of side channel analysis. So what I really do, you know, is all hardware layer. So I've been looking, you know, at some various devices lately, at how susceptible they are to fault attacks, what that sort of means in real life. You know, not just purely the research side, but also how much should you care about it.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: One of them was looking at, like, a little hardware Bitcoin wallet, and you could use fault injection to actually recover secrets from it, and a lot of devices. I mean, the whole idea is pretty cool, right? Because you tell the device, Hey, I want to authenticate, and it's supposed to run some really crazy math that authenticates it, but instead of doing that crazy math and attacking the math, you just attack the check at the end.\nExplainer: We're also scratching the surface of, like, what is possible? It's not necessarily just the system itself and not necessarily that algorithm itself. Like you said, you don't necessarily need to attack the math in some cases. You can just attack that check. And I think something that's been pretty cool is looking at higher energy particles. It's going to be maybe hard to entirely confirm, but I think it'd be really, really cool to actually see. Like, I want to see one of these faults because I haven't seen it myself. And also, how do you know that you've seen it? I've started playing with, like, setting up a cloud chamber. A cloud chamber lets you actually view high energy particles going through sort of like in a small jar with some evaporated alcohol. And I thought it'd be really cool if we put some memory chip in there, like a basic memory chip and we just fill it with some data, but then you put a camera on that area and you just watch. Assuming that there is a high energy particle that actually hits that memory, that should potentially flip the energy state of that bit. The outside microcontrollers should be able to read that and actually say, Oh wait, the data, even though I'm not changing data, I'm only reading data, and we should be able to visibly or optically see it. What I'm wondering is could that be a next area of research? Because I don't think anyone's actually looking at intentionally injecting high energy particles to take over a computer, when really, you know, that's another technique for fault injection, technically speaking.\n","69":"Explainer: You mean flipping bits within flash?\nExplainee: Yeah, exactly, right. So flipping it in this sort of flash memory. And so someone's done it with x-rays. There's actually, I forget who now. There's a paper, at least one, and it's just like a little plate they make with like a hole in it to concentrate the x-ray source and it works, so yeah, it's super interesting. Like, one bit in memory means a lot, especially in the flash memory side. Yeah, visualizing it would be cool though.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Yeah, so actually, so it's funny you mentioned, like, making it more obvious. I mean, staying on fault injection right now, this is lately what I've been up to. A lot of making a little kind of, you know, like electronics kits of old, right? And you can assemble it all yourself and see how it works. So making something like that for fault injection. So all kind of older logic and stuff like that. So, I mean, it's sort of based on, like, you're presented the little MUX chip. You know, voltage switcher. That sort of idea, using just discreet logic to generate the actual glitch itself. So, but you know, it's part of, I think, this stuff, right? It's like people don't know about it sometimes. Like, even engineers designing systems. It's new to a lot of people.\nExplainer: The thing is, even if you know about that, then there's so many others that someone won't necessarily know about, because there's so many, I guess, potential areas for a fault to occur. Where do you think security is going or new research is going? Are there any new areas you think are coming out or are going to be more interesting, you know, pretty soon?\n","70":"Explainer: For me, I think the things that have been recent and super interesting are typically down to physics-level effects that maybe we haven't seen before. I think my mind was blown with the, there was the light commands research, and they were able to modulate sound, although it's purely over light using a laser, they would hit the MEMS microphone, and it was picking that up and was able to then interpret it and essentially take control over light.\nExplainee: I'm curious of the backstory to how they found that. Because if you told me that, right? So you said like, Hey, Colin, you should test this out. I probably would be like, It probably won't even work. Which is like a lot of side channels. When I first heard about it, you know, working, doing firmware stuff, it was like, Oh, that sounds like it's not gonna work. Like, that sounds impossible. You know, the whole area of hardware hacking, it feels kinda like cheating because, you know, as you said, someone designing the system needs to know about so many different ways, right? So there's so many ways to break the system, and if you're designing them, you need to know all of them, but when you're attacking it, you really need to know one, right? So I can know nothing about, like, how does ECC actually work? You know, I have some vague hand-waving I can tell you about, but if you gave me a pen and told me, like, Okay, write it down, specifically the equations and what they mean and how the point model works and stuff. Right, no idea, but designers are like the other side. It's almost like, I don't wanna say the lazy side of it.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Yeah. There's no downsides is what you're saying.\nExplainer: Yeah, only when you get caught.\n","71":"Explainer: You got, pretty much, you got a very good idea about it. Basically you have a star, at the core its generating energy, which is countering the pressure of all that mass trying, being pulled in by gravity. Once it can't generate that energy anymore, the core collapses, once the core is collapsing, it keeps collapsing, and collapsing, and collapsing, and that's the critical thing that makes a black hole. You have enough mass in the volume, such that the escaped velocity becomes the speed of light, once light can't escape, hence the black part. (laughs) But that's the thing, is that just because there's an intense amount of gravity very close to a black hole, things don't start behaving differently. And my favorite analogy is a vacuum, everybody thinks, like, if you point a vacuum cleaner at something, it's just gonna suck everything in--\nExplainee: But no, the wind, the pull isn't, if you're not close enough, it doesn't work.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: So are there any movies that actually do, like, get space right?\nExplainer: I wouldn't call them educational, but the movie Interstellar actually had, as one of the people involved in both writing it, and as a science advisor, Dr. Kip Thorne, who's a Professor at Caltech, who was part of the team that detected gravitational waves, and just won a Nobel Prize for it. So he made sure to try and get it as accurate as possible, so Interstellar, I think, is one of the best examples of getting black holes right.\n","72":"Explainer: Right, you will feel the gravitational pull, and it'll redirect you in some way, and if you're far enough way, it's just like you're very far away from the sun, or something else. If you're close enough, it will divert your path more, if you're close enough still, then you will get what are called tidal forces, where the difference between, for example, if you're standing next to a black hole, the difference in gravity between your feet and your head actually becomes significant. Next time you see a science fiction movie, if somebody says, Oh, my god, we've been caught in the gravitation field of a black hole, and we're gonna fall in, it's like, no, no, just, if you're far enough away, just thrust a little bit this way, and then you'll slingshot around the black hole.\nExplainee: So are there any movies that actually do, like, get space right?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: So it's, I'm assuming it's hard to, like, detect a black hole, besides if it's, if things are close enough that they're being pulled in, so it's basically a theory?\nExplainer: It's, there're multiple theories, there's observational evidence, more than some other theories that are really feeding into this because now we have the instrumentation, both in X-rays and infrared, in particular, because we don't have a direct optical line of sight to the center of our galaxy because there's just a lot of dust in the way. But the infrared can penetrate the dust, the X-rays can penetrate the dust, the radio can penetrate all of that dust, so by combining all of these different wavelengths, people are really coming to a point of okay, how is this happening, by looking at different wavelengths of light, we can get a better sense, but they're still working on the theory, it's not all done.\n","73":"Explainer: I wouldn't call them educational, but the movie Interstellar actually had, as one of the people involved in both writing it, and as a science advisor, Dr. Kip Thorne, who's a Professor at Caltech, who was part of the team that detected gravitational waves, and just won a Nobel Prize for it.

And I'm almost struggling to figure out whether it's a blessing or curse that it has become as accessible and as democratized and as easy to execute and you just build another new company from scratch. And so, what's been, kind of, your reflection on that?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: In contrast, what I'm struggling with, the friend of mine who asked me to look at some health care data for him. And despite the capabilities that we're having in all of the, kind of, bigger societal problems alongside with data collection engineering, all the gnarly stuff, that is actually not the machine learning itself, it's the rest of it where certain data isn't available. And to me, it's staggering how difficult it is to get it off the ground and actually use.\nExplainer: And part of the challenge of it is not the mathematics of building models, but the challenge is making sure that the data is sufficiently representative, potentially high quality.\n","75":"Explainer: Well, you're absolutely right that the attention machine learning gets has grown dramatically. 20 years ago, going to gatherings and telling people what I was working on and seeing the blank face or the like, Where's the turn? and walk away. Like, Oh, no. The accessibility of the tooling, like, we can now do in, like, five lines of code something that would have taken 500 lines of very mathematical, messy, gnarly code even, you know, five years ago. And that's not an exaggeration. And there are tools that mean that pretty much anyone can pick this up and start playing with it and start to build with it. And that is also really exciting.\nExplainee: In contrast, what I'm struggling with, the friend of mine who asked me to look at some health care data for him. And despite the capabilities that we're having in all of the, kind of, bigger societal problems alongside with data collection engineering, all the gnarly stuff, that is actually not the machine learning itself, it's the rest of it where certain data isn't available. And to me, it's staggering how difficult it is to get it off the ground and actually use.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: And how transparent do I need to build it for it to be adopted at some point? What types of biases in the data collection, and then also in the usage? We now call it the bias, but we're still struggling with the society not really living up to its expectations and then machine learning, bringing it to the forefront.\nExplainer: Right. And so, to say that another way, when you're collecting data from the real world and then building machine learning systems that automate decisions based on that data, all of the biases and problems that are already in the real world then can be magnified through that machine learning system. And so, it can make many of these problems much worse.\n","76":"Explainer: A lot of origami is animals, birds and things. There's also a branch of origami that is, it's more abstract or geometric, called tessellations. Tessellations, like most origami, are folded from a single sheet of paper but they make patterns, whether it's woven patterns like that, or woven patterns like this. If you hold them up to the light you can see patterns.\nExplainee: Wow.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: They weren't cut?\nExplainer: There's no cuts in these just folding. We can build these up from smaller building blocks of folds, learn how to fold little pieces and put them together in the same way that a tiling like this looks like it's built up of little pieces. Can you make a fold that starts at the dot that doesn't run all the way across the paper?\n","77":"Explainer: So they're all reversible and it turns out that in every origami shape that folds flat, it's going to be either three mountains and a valley or, if we're looking at the backside, three valleys and a mountain, they always differ by two.\nExplainee: Oh.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Twists?\nExplainer: If I had another twist in the same sheet of paper I could make these folds connect with that, and these folds connect with that. And if I had another one up here, I could make all three. And if I had a square array and all the folds lined up I could make bigger and bigger arrays, like these, because these are just very large twists. In this case it's an octagon rather than a square, but they're arranged in rows and columns. And let's just try going along. All right, there is our tessellation with squares and hexagons. So you have now designed and folded your first origami tessellation and perhaps you can see how just using this idea of building up tiles and small building blocks you could make tessellations as big and complex as you want.\n","78":"Explainer: That's a rule of all flat origami no matter how many folds come together at a point and I'm going to show you a building block of tessellations, it's called a twist because that center square, as I unfold it, it twists, it rotates.\nExplainee: Twists?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: That was cool.\nExplainer: Yeah, so what do you think now of origami and tessellations?\n","79":"Explainee: So how do you do your observations in optical and infrared?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: So do you get dimensions of the disk out of that?\nExplainer: Yeah, again, we don't know exactly where X, Y, Z, zero is, we're assuming that it's something, you know, the X-rays that are coming out are very close to the event horizon of the black hole, but this is still, you know, your realm of X-rays, to really figure out those kinds of things. But once the X-rays, once the photons hit the corona, and are re-scattered, and up, energized, and then they start illuminating the accretion disk, it heats it up, and so just by the light travel time, when the optical, if it gets, you know, brighter and fainter, and then the infrared gets brighter and fainter, two weeks later, then the dust is two light weeks away from that. So it's a one dimensional one, so we're averaging, so we don't get the two dimensional, or even three dimensional one. And then we've done it now, of course, we have better telescopes, there was a project where you could do it with the Hubble Space Telescope and the ultraviolet, you used the Swift Observatory, which had optical and ultraviolet, and then from ground base, we did optical, and then from space we did it with Spitzer and the infrared. So you could actually see this bright flash go off in a nearby AGN called NGC5548, and then you see it propagate as it warms up the disk, as all that light is falling onto it, and then eventually you hit the, the, further away, where the dust is, and the dust tends to radiate in an infrared. So we got basically a structure, and you just, you see this flashbulb go off, and then it illuminates, effectively, the structure.\n","80":"Explainer: So fortunately there's, I'm also doing it from space with the Spitzer Space Telescope, so particularly in the infrared, and my main interest has been to try and study the environment around the super massive black holes, not as close as where the X-rays are coming from, but clearly there's something from the X-ray corona that illuminates the rest of the accretion disk, and the dust that's further out. And so fundamentally, that's one of the key things that I'm trying to use, is trying to see how long, once you've got this sort of pulse that's generated close to the black hole, it propagates out, and so you can use optical wavelengths to see that the accretion disk lights up in the optical a little bit as it gets heated up from the X-ray, and then later on, the infrared dust, the dust absorbs it, and emits it in the infrared. And so that, I love that, the ability to exchange time for resolution, because these structures are so far away that we're never gonna get a telescope big enough where that has the resolution to see the accretion disk, or the dust distribution around--\nExplainee: So do you get dimensions of the disk out of that?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: So you can map out the dust, where do you see it?\nExplainer: So you do see it, basically the dust sublimation radius, and you see it at, and it tells you, depending on what kind of dust it is, and it's actually one of the problems for me studying, whenever we try and do X-ray studies of low luminosity active galactic nuclei in your, by galaxies, because there're all these X-ray binaries that are also emitting X-rays, which make our lives difficult. But they're also in black holes, when it's this really interesting sort of both, it's great, but ugh, it's also a source of noise for those of us who are trying to do X-ray observations of nearby galaxies.\n","81":"Explainer: Yeah, again, we don't know exactly where X, Y, Z, zero is, we're assuming that it's something, you know, the X-rays that are coming out are very close to the event horizon of the black hole, but this is still, you know, your realm of X-rays, to really figure out those kinds of things.

So we got basically a structure, and you just, you see this flashbulb go off, and then it illuminates, effectively, the structure.\nExplainee: So you can map out the dust, where do you see it?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: We have the same problem, we can't see the actual black hole underneath all these very bright X-ray binaries.\nExplainer: It's a weird thing to be sitting in your own galaxy, but not be able to separate all these, four million solar mass black hole creating, next to, how massive, it's like two to three solar masses for the X-ray binaries?\n","82":"Explainer: And this goes to the idea that you don't have a core balance, that a supernova with a black hole as its final result, actually never has any kind of expulsion, that it all just goes. (imitates sucking)\nExplainee: Yeah, that might be, yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","83":"Explainer: So when we're talking about the multiverse or the Big Bang, we are really talking about gravity ultimately, and we're talking about how a theory of gravitation which we know think of as a theory of space-time has a quantum explanation, has a quantum paradigm imposed on it that will help us understand these things, and we don't have that yet. One of the things that I think is so amazing is that the terrains in which we're going to understand quantum gravity are very few. It's the Big Bang, because that's where we know that quantum and gravity both were called into action. And there's black holes. One of the most interesting discoveries is of course Hawking's discovery, kick-started a kind of crisis, right? In thinking about why quantum mechanics and gravity were so knocking heads. It was one of the most beautiful examples.\nExplainee: Sure, yeah, it is a beautiful, beautiful idea. So, first of all, to be totally clear, though, we've never observed Hawking radiation, which is what he predicted, directly. I don't think very many people doubt that it's there, but yeah, Hawking discovered mathematically that when you have a black hole, it's got an event horizon, it's got a surface which is a point of no return. If you fall through that surface, no matter what you have, no matter how powerful the rocket you've got, even if you beam a flashlight back behind you in the direction you fall from, nothing escapes, not even light. It all gets sucked in and spaghettified and destroyed at the singularity, or something, something happens, but it doesn't get out. But in quantum mechanics, you can't really pin down the location of something precisely. If you try to pin down an electron in a tiny circuit in a microchip, sometimes you discover it's not actually there and then your computer crashes.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Exactly, yeah, so when you get the blue screen of death, that might be because of quantum mechanics.\nExplainer: Right.\n","84":"Explainer: That's a nice way of looking at it. So that you're not actually violating classical relativity once you're in a regime where the wave function has really peaked around a very well-defined stage.\nExplainee: That's right, and one of the most exciting developments in the last 10 or 20 years is called holography, and it's called holography because a hologram is a two-dimensional surface that creates a three-dimensional image. It's got sort of 3D information built into it. And this, in a fundamental way, really has that 3D or higher dimensional information built into it. It's exactly the same as this theory of gravity and more dimensions.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: That's true.\nExplainer: [Janna laughs]\n","85":"Explainer: Do you think it's possible that gravity is really ultimately just quantum mechanics and doesn't exist at all in the fundamental ways that we've been talking about so far, like the Newtonian way and the space-time way, that those are just these kind of macroscopic illusions? Sometimes I talk about it in terms of temperature. Temperature is not a thing. There is no single thing called temperature. It's a macroscopic illusion that comes from the collective behavior, really quantum behavior of random motions of atoms. And is it possible that the whole of gravity is some kind of emergent illusion from what's really quantum phenomenon underlying it?\nExplainee: If we buy the idea of holography, then absolutely, that's for sure, that's what it's telling us. Although which side is the illusion and which side is the reality? They're the same.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Right, so I guess with the holographic description we've got two sides, which are actually secretly the same. On one side there's definitely no gravity. On the other side, well, it's a quantum theory of gravity, whatever that means. But the point is you can get it out, it's equivalent to this theory.\nExplainer: So that's just like saying there's the idea of a dual description. It's just saying there's a perfect dictionary between these two descriptions, and so to belabor which one's real is silly. It's like saying, is French or is English real?\n","86":"Explainer: [Robert] Would you like to give it a try?\nExplainee: Sure.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: That's awesome.\nExplainer: So you ready?\n","87":"Explainer: Okay. We're going to start with a model that every Japanese person learns in kindergarten, it's called a crane, traditional origami design, it's over 400 years old. So, people have been doing what we're about to do for 400 years.\nExplainee: Wow.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Yeah.\nExplainer: It's called a petal fold, it's a part of a lot of origami designs and it's key to the crane. Now we're ready for the magic. We're going to hold it in between thumb and forefinger, reach inside, grab the skinny point that's between the two layers, which are the wings, and I'm going to slide it out so it pokes out at an angle. We'll take the two wings, we spread them out to the side and you have made your first origami crane.\n","88":"Explainer: It's called a petal fold, it's a part of a lot of origami designs and it's key to the crane.

We'll fold it in half like a book. On the folded side we'll take one of the folded corners and I'm going to fold it up through all layers. There's a pocket in the middle. We're going to spread the pocket and bring all four corners together. Where you have original corners of the square, we're gonna just pop those out. This is one of the most satisfying moments, I think-\n","89":"Explainer: Now, this is a traditional Japanese design but there are origami designs that have been around so long we're not entirely sure where they originated. We're going to learn how to fold a cootie catcher.\nExplainee: Okay, good.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Yeah.\nExplainer: because it suddenly changes shape.\n","90":"Explainer: Where is this technology? Why haven't I seen any change yet?\nExplainee: (laughs) Yes, yes, yes.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Yes.\nExplainer: It will develop. It will take five years. It will take 10 years. That kind of time is necessary. One of the areas that brought me to supply chain research is the fact that we're not just gonna see blockchain emerge. We're gonna see artificial intelligence continue to evolve. We're gonna see connective devices and this sort of growing internet of things and machinery that can do a lot more and have a wallet and transact on their own. And so I actually think a lot of where blockchain and other technologies are headed is this interesting synergy that will help us elevate the kinds of institutions we've used in the past and cobbled together to create that identifiable, verifiable trust.\n","91":"Explainer: And it's because we've had a lot of PR, a lot of proof of concept, but truthfully, this is more like a science, right?\nExplainee: Yes.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Yes, and one of the most interesting ideas to me that came out of the currency side of the blockchain project was the notion around like coloring coins, right, assign properties to a particular coin, and in particular to assign those properties in ways that would allow you to do things like bring in the graph of previous transactions.\nExplainer: [Bettina] Right.\n","92":"Explainer: In that it's hard to compare it to some perfect future. Just like you compare autonomous vehicles to this very high standard because machines are doing it. It should be perfect. There should be zero car deaths.\nExplainee: (laughs) Yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","93":"Explainer: What they're trying to do is they're trying to even prevent the bad hackers from getting in in the first place.\nExplainee: So they put like a protection account or something.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: What would they do about the people and the broken lock?\nExplainer: In many cases, they'll send them a new lock. So it's an upgraded, better version. Sometimes that's new features, but sometimes that's bug fixes and ways to protect you as well.\n","94":"Explainer: Yeah, exactly. They're looking for ways that they can create protection. It's kind of like the lock on your front door. That lock is to essentially prevent bad people from coming in or people accidentally coming in when they shouldn't. A hacker is essentially looking at a way, how can I get into this lock? But then there are the good ones who are trying to unlock it so that they can tell the company that made the lock, hey, we can actually protect people by making the lock a little harder.\nExplainee: What would they do about the people and the broken lock?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: But like, they may get arrested because they might get mistaken.\nExplainer: That's a very good point. You should definitely make sure that you're obeying the law. They might work with the lock company and say, I'm trying to improve your product. And they're trying to find these holes or problems, and then share that with the company. Even though the good hacker is doing exactly the same thing as the bad hacker, it's the same exact skillset, and you're using the same exact techniques and information to try to break that lock, but your goal as a good hacker is really to help everyone like you and me to make sure that our stuff is protected. So hopefully they don't get in trouble because they're the good guys.\n","95":"Explainer: In many cases, they'll send them a new lock. So it's an upgraded, better version. Sometimes that's new features, but sometimes that's bug fixes and ways to protect you as well.\nExplainee: But like, they may get arrested because they might get mistaken.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: When did you start doing, like, the good hacking?\nExplainer: I started doing the good hacking when I turned nine years old.\n","96":"Explainer: What do you think of when you think of nanotechnology?\nExplainee: It kind of seems very science fiction.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: My phone?\nExplainer: Yeah, so modern computer chips rely heavily on nanotechnology. Does this look familiar to you? Can you guess what this might be?\n","97":"Explainer: Yeah, so modern computer chips rely heavily on nanotechnology. Does this look familiar to you? Can you guess what this might be?\nExplainee: I don't know.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: OK.\nExplainer: I went through my kid's Lego bins to build a very simple model of a transistor. And these are wired together in circuits so that you can do computation. You can do logic with them. Where nanotechnology comes into play, the way you double the number of transistors on a chip. Can you guess what you would have to do to this transistor?\n","98":"Explainer: So this is a silicon wafer, and they're embedded in basically almost every object that you use, from a laptop, to a phone, to cars, television sets, appliances. We ended up cutting these into little squares and those repeating patterns, each of those is a processor. And those chips are what goes into all of these objects. What I want to talk to you about is how we got from where we started, and how we're able to actually fit 18 billion of these little devices in a little one inch by one inch area. They're called transistors. It's a switch. Very simply, think of it as a light switch that turns on and turns off using an electric field by applying a voltage.\nExplainee: OK.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: You make it smaller?\nExplainer: You have to make it smaller. Exactly. But here's the problem. So about 10 to 15 years ago, the devices got so small that if you shrunk them this gate, that actually turns it on and off loses its ability to control the channel. And so what they did, was they took devices like this into these things, we call them, FinFETs, kind of like a fin on a fish. So they're very thin transistors. The width of these fins is only six nanometers. Okay? So 6 nanometers is 25 to 30 atoms across. And they repeat this over the entire wafer just about perfectly. It's just a huge feat in engineering. But these types of devices are exactly the kind of devices that your phones and computers either have, or will have in the near future. And it's a way that nanotechnology is directly impacting you right now.\n","99":"Explainer: I went through my kid's Lego bins to build a very simple model of a transistor.

Obviously it's not handmade, so is it factories and stuff?\nExplainer: Exactly. So these are made using a technique called lithography. You basically coat the silicon wafer with a polymer. Then you put a mask on it and then you shine light through it. And the features of the mask, the size of those holes determine the feature size in the chip. It's not just the size of the mask that matters. It's the wavelength of the light that's used. We talked about nanotechnology being science fiction before, but this is real stuff that's being produced, that's being made, that's being used every day by people.\n","100":"Explainer: You have to make it smaller.

But those are the really big, comical, like plugging in Legos and stuff. When we saw the picture of all of the little ones, it's like a city, it's crazy how simple and complex it is at the same time.\nExplainer: Exactly. I couldn't put it any better. That's right.\n","101":"Explainer: Yeah.\nExplainee: If I could trade with any kid, I would trade, well, I would trade something I don't like so much.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Really?\nExplainer: Really.\n","102":"Explainer: Oh, that's pretty cool. What do you know about computer hacking?\nExplainee: I don't really know much about computer hacking actually.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Yeah.\nExplainer: Okay. With computer hacking, it's actually the same thing. Really, you have some sort of system and you have a bunch of inputs and you have some sort of output, and actually you, as the designer, you're essentially designing games and software. You're saying, well, I will only allow a user to really control these inputs. Can you think of any inputs the computer might have?\n","103":"Explainer: So on code.org, one of the things you've been doing is actually building a game or that they have a game and then you can actually rewire some of the inputs and outputs of that. Is that right?\nExplainee: Yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: [Linda] Space bar.\nExplainer: Yep, there's also things like your mouse and there's even things like the microphone itself is actually an input device. It's taking something from you, which is the sound and it's then transmitting that, ad it's actually sending it to me. Are there any other things that you can talk to a computer? You can give it information.\n","104":"Explainer: So you're saying gravity pulls things down, yet we've launched things into space. Do you ever wonder how we do that?\nExplainee: Isn't it like a slingshot, like if you pull something back enough it'll go in the opposite direction?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: And does the gravity pull it or is it just floating?\nExplainer: In a weird way, that is gravity pulling it. So have you ever had a yo-yo where you swing it around like this? The string is pulling it in at all times, but you've also given it this angular momentum. And as long as you give it the angular momentum, pulling it in actually keeps it in orbit. And so the Earth is pulling it in at all times, so that's why it doesn't just travel off in a straight line. It keeps coming back around. So it's funny, people think that the International Space Station is so far away that they're not feeling gravity, and that's not the case at all. They're absolutely feeling gravity. They're just cruising so fast that, even though they're being pulled in, they never get pulled to the surface.\n","105":"Explainer: Yeah. You ever had that experience where you're sitting in a train and the other one moves and for a second you're not sure if you're the one moving?\nExplainee: Yeah, 'cause I go on the train every day to go to school, but I never feel like I'm moving when I'm in the train, and then I'm like, wait, what?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Isn't that kinda crazy? Amazing.\nExplainer: So imagine you were an astronaut and you were floating in empty space. You can't see anything. There's no stars, there's no Earth. You can ask yourself, am I moving? There's really no way for you to tell. So you would probably conclude, well, I'm not moving. So then your friend Marina comes cruising past you, and maybe she's going thousands of kilometers a second, and you say, Marina, you're cruising at thousands of kilometers a second, you're going so fast. But she had just done the same experiment. She was just floating in space thinking, Am I moving? There's no way to know which one of you is moving and there's no meaning to the absolute motion. The only thing that's true is that you're in relative motion, that's true. You both agree you're in relative motion, and that's clear. But neither of you can say it's actually you who's moving and I'm stationary.\n","106":"Explainer: So let me tell you where it gets really crazy.\nExplainee: [Maria laughs]\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Yeah.\nExplainer: So you would say, oh Marina is gonna measure a different speed of light. But she comes back and she says, No. 300,000 kilometers per second. Because from her perspective, she's standing still, and the laws of physics have better be the same for her. The speed of light is a fact of nature that's as true as the strength of gravity. And the two of you are in this quandary because if one of you is the preferred person who correctly measures the speed of light, that ruins everything about the idea of the relativity of motion. Which one of you should it be? So Einstein decides they must both measure the same speed of life. How could that possibly, possibly be the case? And he thinks, well, if speed is how far you travel, your spatial distance, in a certain amount of time, then there must be something wrong with space and time. And he goes from the constancy of the speed of light and a respect for this idea of relativity to the idea that space and time must not be the same for you and for Marina. And that's how he gets the idea of the relativity of space and time. [laughs] You have the best expression on your face. [laughs] It's pretty wild, but that is a starting point, actually, of the whole theory of relativity. That starting point leads to this complete revolution in physics where we suddenly have a Big Bang and black holes and space-time. Just from that one simple starting point. So, is your impression of gravity different than when we started the conversation?\n","107":"Explainer: So, let's say you and Marina are floating in space and you can't tell who's moving. Let's say you both see a flash of light. A flash of light comes from somewhere, you don't know where. So you measure the speed of light to be 300,000 kilometers per second. But here comes Marina and she's racing at the light pulse, as far as you can tell. Two cars driving towards each other seem like they're going faster towards each other than somebody who's standing still relative to one of the cars, right?\nExplainee: Yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Yeah, 'cause I knew that when I was on the train it didn't feel like I was moving, but I didn't know why or that it was a thing and I wasn't crazy. [Janna and Maria laugh]\nExplainer: And it's a really deep principle. And what about the theory of gravity?\n","108":"Explainer: Mine too, because I get to spend all day studying it. Because you know what sleep does for you?\nExplainee: It rests your body, like an electric car.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Whoa.\nExplainer: So today, we're going to talk about some animals and how they sleep. So here's the first one. What's that?\n","109":"Explainer: They're pretty cool, right?\nExplainee: Mhm.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: And how does it like recharge, like humans?\nExplainer: So we think it works the same way, but maybe just like more efficiently. And so we're still really learning about how this works. Sleep science itself is kind of a new field.\n","110":"Explainer: And how did you feel?\nExplainee: Really tired.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: It affects what you can do in your daily life.\nExplainer: Excellent. So now I want to tell you about another animal and how they sleep, okay? So we have this one. What's that?\n","111":"Explainer: A hippopotamus. They have a different challenge. They sleep underwater.\nExplainee: I could never do that, I would pass out.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: That's cool.\nExplainer: Would it be cool to have that power?\n","112":"Explainer: A dolphin! Yes. So dolphins, kind of like hippos, have to sleep in the water, okay? But because they're mammals, right, they need to breathe. Dolphins breathe air. They have to go up to the surface and breathe, right? And for an animal like that, it needs to figure out a way that it can sleep but also still survive, right? You know how dolphins sleep?\nExplainee: How?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: That's cool.\nExplainer: So what'd you learn today?\n","113":"Explainer: I wanted to talk to you about a specific type of science called nanotechnology. Have you ever heard of this word before?\nExplainee: Nhn nhn.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: A baby ant?\nExplainer: A baby ant? Very good. So I have over here a meter stick, let me show it to you. And so that's a meter and if I divide it by 1000, I get a millimeter. So milli just means 1000. There's all these little lines on the ruler. And each of those little lines is one millimeter. So a baby ant is probably a couple of millimeters. So even the thing, that's the smallest thing you can think of, it's a million times bigger than a nanometer. Tiny, tiny, tiny.\n","114":"Explainer: A baby ant? Very good.

Tiny, tiny, tiny.\nExplainee: Tiny, tiny, tiny, tiny.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Yes. I first heard of them on a show I watched called StoryBots. They're just little things that make up everything on Earth, even earth.\nExplainer: That was a perfect explanation. But what if I told you that scientists invented a special type of microscope that not only lets you see atoms, but also lets you move them around and build things with them. Would you think that would be pretty cool?\n","115":"Explainer: If I took this stick and I was to draw 1 billion lines, the distance between those two lines would be one nanometer. So that's really all it is. It's just a measure of size. But it's really, really, really tiny, smaller than anything that we can see with our eyes. The reason why, in nanotechnology, scientists, we care about things that are that small, is because there are objects called atoms. Have you ever heard of atoms before?\nExplainee: Yes. I first heard of them on a show I watched called StoryBots. They're just little things that make up everything on Earth, even earth.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Yeah!\nExplainer: So it's called a scanning tunneling microscope. And not only can you see the atoms, but you can move them around. Atoms are kind of sticky. You can actually build things using this instrument with actual individual atoms. So if I gave you that machine, would you want to make something? Would you want to look at something very carefully?\n","116":"Explainer: You are definitely a second grader! [laughing] My daughter would probably answer the exact same way. A unicorn would be awesome.\nExplainee: Why do you study stuff so small?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Cool.\n","117":"Explainer: You know an interesting topic is: what are the limits to what we can do with virtual reality? Where I'm pretty pleased with what we have today. What we can show people and say virtual reality, its cool. People get an amazing response from it. But we're still clearly a very, very long ways from reality.\nExplainee: That kinds of notes back to Realism in our history and how Realism was a response to Romanticism. And Realism was meant to capture the mundane, everyday lives of individuals and not idealize any of their activities in any way. And I think that that's really important for virtual reality. I think its kind of rite-of-passage for any kind of our technology to go through.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: So I've tried the demos, at VRLA there's one that has waves, like audio waves I believe, that come up and then you can put your hands through that and feel the waves whenever you're supposed to be feeling bubbles or any kind of force field or something. And those are pretty interesting. I've seen some pretty interesting things that you can do with audios, you can cut down a lot of the storage I guess and the power that you would need in order to power a huge scene, you can just mimic the sounds of those scenes actually being there and they're not actually. For example, a professor at USC would have the sound of a train drive by without actually rendering the sound. And you would feel like you're deeply immersed in this world without having to have such an expensive scene built around you. So I think those are pretty significant.\nExplainer: Yeah, that is one potential quality improvement that is still on the horizon is when we do spatialization, we use HRTF, the Head Relative Transfer Function, to make it sound like its in different places. But usually we just use this one kind of generic, here's your average human, HRTF function. Its possible, that of course, if you are right in the average then its perfect for you. But there's always people off to the extremes, that it doesn't do a very good job at. And there may be better ways to allow people to sample their own perfect HRTF which can improve the audio experience a lot. It all comes down to all these trade-offs.\n","118":"Explainer: Yeah, that is one potential quality improvement that is still on the horizon is when we do spatialization, we use HRTF, the Head Relative Transfer Function, to make it sound like its in different places.

And there may be better ways to allow people to sample their own perfect HRTF which can improve the audio experience a lot. It all comes down to all these trade-offs.\nExplainee: You know, with display and with resolution, its one of those things where if people have one bad experience they kind of, oh well everything else. Its really difficult to build trust again with people who haven't done VR before but its easy to break off that trust when they have a bad experience.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Right, I'm very excited to see how filmmakers tackle creating content and those things. Especially if they're experienced with traditional medium.\n","119":"Explainer: So, from your perspective, how would you describe gravity?\nExplainee: I'm taught that it's a force. It's described by inverse law. But I also know that it's a field. And there's a recent discovery with gravitational waves, although I don't know the specific details about that.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Yeah.\nExplainer: So you can also think of a gravitational field, something that permeates all of space. Even though the earth is three stories below us, it's not as though it's pulling at us from a distance. We're actually interacting with the field at this point and there's a real interaction right here at this point. And that's nice, because people were worried that if things acted at a distance, that the way that old-fashioned inverse-square force law describes it, that it was as spooky as mind-bending a spoon, that it was like telekinesis. If you don't touch something, how do you affect it? And so the first step was to start to think of gravity as a field that permeates all of a space. And it's weaker very far from the Earth and it's closer very close to the Earth. So one way to think of this field as a field that's really describing a curved space-time that is everywhere. Forget the difficulty of the math, just the intuition comes from two kind of simple observations. One was what Einstein described as the happiest thought of his life. So, right now, you might feel heavy in your chair, and we might feel heavy on the floor and our feet, or standing in an elevator cab. And Einstein said, what does the chair have to do with it, or the floor, or the elevator? Those aren't gravitational objects. So he wanted to eliminate them, and one way to do the thought experiment is to imagine standing in an elevator that you can see out of, a black box. And imagine the cable is cut and you and the elevator begin to fall.\n","120":"Explainer: So, when you say it's an inverse-square law, that means that the closer you are, the more strongly you feel the gravitational pull. And that makes sense. There's very few things that are stronger when you're further apart.\nExplainee: Yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: So, in free fall?\nExplainer: You're in total free fall. Now, because things fall at the same rate, including the elevator and you, you can actually float in the elevator. If you just floated in the elevator, the two of you would drop, and you might not even know you're falling. You could take an apple and drop it in front of you, and it would float in front of you. You would actually experience weightlessness. It's called the equivalence principle. It was Einstein's happiest thought that what you're really doing when you're experiencing gravity isn't being heavy in your chair, it's falling weightlessly in the gravitational field. And that was the first step, to think of gravity as weightlessness and falling.\n","121":"Explainer: Yeah, exactly.\nExplainee: Yeah, yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Well, if I threw it straight, I would think it would go straight.\nExplainer: Yeah, it would just go straight. But if you did that on the Earth, what would happen?\n","122":"Explainer: Yeah, it would just go straight. But if you did that on the Earth, what would happen?\nExplainee: It would just go down.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Oh.\nExplainer: You had that moment, I saw that it your face!\n","123":"Explainer: You had that moment, I saw that it your face!\nExplainee: Yeah, yeah, yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: That's amazing.\nExplainer: Isn't it kind of amazing?\n","124":"Explainer: I'm sure you've heard about extra dimensions a little bit.\nExplainee: I've heard it, yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: I get a little scared, [laughing] because I think how can you prove these theories?\nExplainer: Right.\n","125":"Explainer: Mm-hmm.\nExplainee: Is that an extra dimension? Does that fit into that, or is that something?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: And are each of those dimensions, are they governed by the same laws of physics, or is there like a separate Lagrangian for each universe--\nExplainer: It's a, yeah.\n","126":"Explainer: It's a, yeah.\nExplainee: [Bela] Or how does that work?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Okay.\nExplainer: Why in the world would you think that there are extra dimensions, right? So you've heard of string theory?\n","127":"Explainer: [Sean] Do you know where it comes from?\nExplainee: No.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Right.\nExplainer: If you have a two dimensional surface that vibrates and is a physical thing, we call that a membrane. Membrane theory goes back, it never was as popular as string theory, but it's been around for a while. But if you had extra dimensions of space, then you can three dimensional vibrating things, and four dimensional vibrating things.\n","128":"Explainer: Yes, string theory's even better. So the phrase Grand Unified Theory was coined in the 1970s for theories that joined electricity and magnetism. So a good string theory is gravity plus the Grand Unified Theory.\nExplainee: Okay.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: So we have three spatial dimensions. A brane is sort of the next level. So a brane is a higher dimensional object that vibrates through space.\nExplainer: That's right. And we could live there. The world we see around us, the three dimensions of space around us could reflect the fact that we are somehow stuck on a three dimensional brane trying to escape.\n","129":"Explainer: It's even better. It's the theory of everything. What would you tell a friend of yours if they asked you what dimensions are, what extra dimensions are, what a brane is?\nExplainee: So we have three spatial dimensions. A brane is sort of the next level. So a brane is a higher dimensional object that vibrates through space.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: It was really cool to learn about strings and branes and how looking at gravity on small scales is actually connected to what I do in looking at gravity on these cosmological scales, and it's definitely something I'm gonna think about in my research.\n","130":"Explainer: [Bettina] Have you ever heard of blockchain?\nExplainee: I have. Whenever we have a transaction, and let's say I buy something from you, this information gets logged. And it gets verified by a third person or third party. And then if like all this information verified and it all matches, right, the transaction goes through without any intermediary basically, right? It gets stored, and when you make further transactions, this information is ready, embedded. It's in the ledger.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Absolutely. The way the technology's changing, nothing's gonna be like it used to be. And there's no like firm, and then the buyer and the seller, it basically, we'll have to rewrite a lot of rules in economics as well.\nExplainer: For sure. A lot of the assumptions won't hold true.\n","131":"Explainer: We're gonna have to create entire new concepts of how they do trade and how they work with us, too. What kind of barriers or road blocks would you imagine are gonna happen in the blockchain space?\nExplainee: So at least when we talk about Bitcoin, there are some trust issues and some hacks. So there's obviously a need to work on trust and feeling that it's a safe technology.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Absolutely, so education will be a big part before we actually can use the technology in a wide sense. Right?\nExplainer: Yeah. To actually transition into the mainstream and make it useful for average people to use, we're going to need to make sure we have a lot more education, a lot more standards and probably work with a lot of enterprises to create sort of a user experience around this being a technology that is safe and usable and understandable. What is the current state of blockchain in your understanding? What's gonna have to happen next?\n","132":"Explainer: What is it exactly that you're trying to tease out of these materials to improve the battery's performance?\nExplainee: At first, one of the main things that we did was use nanomaterials to add conductivity. And so carbon anodes and graphene are really good at adding conductivity to batteries. And then in the subsequent years, nanomaterials have been really interesting from things like incorporating sensors into batteries, to increasing the functionality of batteries, having some responsive materials that use things like graphene sheets that are incorporated into a matrix, and then you add a safety functionality to a battery. We're trying to squeeze out almost all the functionality that we can. And as new nano materials are being discovered and there're new properties being discovered, a lot of the time that someone tries to think of a way to translate that into a battery.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: I think every step of a process in a battery is something where you have to think about how would this translate to making a battery in terms of the production? One thing that I think is very interesting about the field of nanoscale materials in general, is that how you make the material changes the properties a lot. And so we claim that this 2D material has this property, then tying that to the battery performance is something that's pretty difficult to do. It takes a few steps in between. So we have to think kind of creatively with how we can do that.\nExplainer: That's actually, I think a very common problem. We can build a device in the lab it could be a transistor, can be a battery. And then you ask the question, okay, so what's the next step? How do we take it from that lab demonstration into a technology? The kind of work that I'm very interested in is developing tools to make the exact type of materials that you want. The tools that we've used in the past for conventional fabrication just don't work with these materials because they're all grown from the bottom up. They're intrinsically small, and you have to find ways to either use chemistry or some other means to get them to assemble into the structures that you want to actually either grow specifically what you want or after you grow them, to pull out the ones that you want. You need to be able to build that same thing over and over again, with the exact same properties. No one institution, no one research lab, no one national lab is gonna solve all of these problems on their own because they are difficult problems. And there is a real important payoff at the end. And it's gonna take all of us, making our contributions to push this field forward.\n","133":"Explainee: I'm Tom Hull, I'm a math professor, a mathematician. I've been doing origami since I was eight years old and studying the mathematics of origami ever since grad school, at least.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Why does origami lend itself to, say, this type of application?\nExplainer: Origami applications have in common, is that at some stage the thing is flat and so whenever you need to either start from a flat state and then take it to a 3D state, or conversely, for deployables like space, you want to have it in a fully folded flat state but then take it to a 3D state, or possibly an unfolded flat state. Whenever a flat state is involved, origami is a really effective way of making the transition between those states.\n","134":"Explainer: The first thing I want to show you is origami in the real world. This is the origami lamp. It comes shipped flat but it folds, clip holds it together. The lamp has LEDs on the inside so when we power it up we get light, we have a lampshade and we get the base.\nExplainee: Why does origami lend itself to, say, this type of application?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Another aspect of origami and origami mechanisms that has leant itself to many different uses is the fact that it's scalable. When you have an origami crease pattern like the Miura-Ori used in solar panel deployment, the type of motion that you see happening here will happen whether this is on a piece of paper that's small like this, or on a larger scale, or even on a smaller, smaller, smaller, smaller scale. Engineers, in particular robotics engineers, are turning to origami toward designing mechanisms that will either be really big or really, really small. This looks like the most promising way of getting nano robotics to work.\nExplainer: This is another real-world application but this particular implementation is used to make a wheel for a Rover.\n","135":"Explainer: New problems arise when we try to make origami out of things other than paper, but also new opportunities. An example here which is a kind of a variant of the Miura-Ori. It's got a three-dimensional structure. If I stretch it one way, it expands the other but because it has these S-bends in the pattern, if you squeeze it, it doesn't go all the way flat. This is a epoxy impregnated aramid fiber and so if I put this fold pattern into it and then compress it and then put a skin on the top and bottom, this becomes incredibly lightweight but incredibly strong.\nExplainee: Yeah!\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: So you're talking about a machine that is actually folding it into this, not just making the creases but actually folding it.\nExplainer: Yeah, so what goes in as sheet and what comes out is this, or something this wide.\n","136":"Explainer: We're gonna talk about blockchain technology. Have you heard of blockchain?\nExplainee: I've heard of the words blockchain, but I'm not sure I know what it is.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Okay.\nExplainer: And so it's being run by all of these different computers that have like a node. So they're all running the same software and guaranteeing your transactions as they happen.\n","137":"Explainer: When we were much smaller societies, you and I could trade in our community pretty easily. As the distance in our trade grew, we ended up inventing institutions, right? If you Uber or you use Airbnb or you use Amazon even, these are just digital marketplaces and platforms that help us facilitate an exchange of value. But today, we actually have a technology that allows us to trade one to one but at scale, and it's called blockchain technology. There is some kind of interface for it. You could have an app, or you could use a computer to do it, but instead of there being a company in the middle that's helping you make that transaction, it's a bunch of software code.\nExplainee: Okay.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: I mean, I would assume this technology is taking away business or activity from these middlemen.\nExplainer: In some cases, yeah, it is. And a lot of people in the financial industry, in particular, are looking at it from the banking side of how do we use this technology to trade things like Bitcoin or other tokens that are easier to use instead of today's currency. A lot of people think about blockchain as Bitcoin because it's sort of in the news a lot, and it's this new cryptocurrency. And it's kind of exciting. But we're actually seeing a lot more use cases for blockchain that aren't around the currency side. They're more around, how do you take any asset and be able to trade that using this same technology.\n","138":"Explainer: And so it's being run by all of these different computers that have like a node.

And one of the tools for doing that is being able to cryptographically sign for a given attribute. So your government could sign that you have a US passport or a university could sign that you are a currently enrolled student. And you could then dole out that information and control it yourself and be able to show people those certifications on an as needed basis.\n","139":"Explainer: In some cases, yeah, it is.

We mainly work on population studies. We work on thousands and even millions of population, and we use statistical modeling to find out the association between different sleep disturbances and also genetics related to sleep disturbances and link that to their risk of developing ADMPD.\nExplainer: So how strong is the link?\n","141":"Explainer: So how strong is the link?\nExplainee: Our study has found really strong associations looking at these populations, for example, with sleep apnea. We've done one meta-analysis and it's showed that those with sleep apnea, they have a ratio of 1.26, which means that those who have sleep apnea have 26% elevated risk of developing Alzheimer's compared to those without sleep apnea.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Yeah, so I think what's really fascinating is all these bio-directional relationships that's being identified in animal studies especially, showing that sleep changes actually occur very early on in the disease process, so it could be a prodromal stage of Parkinson's, and also in transgenic model of AD, they're already showing a lot of circadian abnormalities in this mouse.\nExplainer: So within dementia risk in particular, Alzheimer's for instance, there are kind of two clear features that seem to be part of the pathology, right? So there's beta-amyloid which accumulates in the brain, and then there's kind of these tangles, this tauopathies, right? And so it sounds like sleep seems to be related to the tauopathies. What about kind of beta-amyloid?\n","142":"Explainer: So it's interesting, so I also saw that there was also a recent meta-analysis around sleep disturbances and dementia risk, and in that study, they looked about 250,000 people in this meta-analysis, and they followed them around for 10 years, and you know, when they pulled all the samples together, they found there was a 1.2 fold increased risk for developing all caused dementia, so it sounds like both sleep apnea and then maybe sleep disturbances more generally are associated with increased risk for dementia. When I think about that, I think about how sleep lives in the brain, these neurodegenerative diseases live in the brain, and so what do we know about the causality of this? Could it be that individuals who have early onset of say, Alzheimer's, have then poor sleep kind of as a consequence of that?\nExplainee: Yeah, so I think what's really fascinating is all these bio-directional relationships that's being identified in animal studies especially, showing that sleep changes actually occur very early on in the disease process, so it could be a prodromal stage of Parkinson's, and also in transgenic model of AD, they're already showing a lot of circadian abnormalities in this mouse.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Yes, in the transgenic mouse models of AD, including those expressing human mutant amyloid precursor protein, APP type or both, so that's kind of showing the sleep changes in both of these pathologies.\nExplainer: Okay, so there is this bio-directional piece, but I think perhaps the most exciting thing that happened in the sleep field, at least in my view, has been understanding the role of sleep and its clearance of beta-amyloid in the brain. This idea that sleep is kind of the dishwasher of the brain, it seems like, that you know A betta accumulates as we kind of use energy, and you know it's kind of a waste product, and the idea that if you don't clear it out, that it's going to build up and accumulate.\n","143":"Explainer: So within dementia risk in particular, Alzheimer's for instance, there are kind of two clear features that seem to be part of the pathology, right?

I think there are incredible innovations that are happening in the basic sciences, kind of really starting to understand what are the clear biological processes that underly some of these things as they relate to disease risk, and what is the true function of sleep, kind of the why we sleep phenomenon, right?\n","144":"Explainer: Okay, so there is this bio-directional piece, but I think perhaps the most exciting thing that happened in the sleep field, at least in my view, has been understanding the role of sleep and its clearance of beta-amyloid in the brain.

How would you make one point out of this sheet of paper?\n","146":"Explainer: Yeah, exactly. Actually you've discovered something pretty neat because you made your point not from a corner so you've already discovered one of the key insights. Any flap, any point, leg of the ant, takes up a circular region of paper. Here's our boundary. To make your point from an edge you use that much paper and the shape, it's almost a circle. If we take the crane we'll see if the circles are visible in the crane pattern. Here's the crane pattern, and here's a boundary of the wing, and here's the other wing.\nExplainee: Okay.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Okay.\nExplainer: And to do that we use a new technique called circle packing in which all of the long features of the design are represented by circles. So, each leg becomes a circle, each wing becomes a circle and things that can be big and thick, like the head or the abdomen, can be points in the middle. Now we have the basic idea of how to design the pattern, we just count the number of legs we want. We want a spider, if it's got let's say eight legs, it's also got an abdomen, that's another point, and it's got a head, so maybe that's 10 points. If we find an arrangement of 10 circles we should be able to fold that into the spider. So in this book, Origami Insects II, it's one of my books and has some patterns, and this is one of them for a flying ladybug and, in fact, it is exactly this flying ladybug. We've got the crease pattern here in the circles and you might now be able to see which circles end up as which parts, knowing that the largest features like the wings are going to be the largest circles, smaller points will be smaller circles. So any thoughts which might be?\n","147":"Explainer: The crane has four circles but, actually, there's a little bit of a surprise because what about this? There's a fifth circle, which is like that, but does the crane have a fifth flap in it? Let's refold it and put the wings up. Well, yes, there is, there's another point and that point is the fifth circle of our crane.\nExplainee: Okay.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Well, the legs and the antenna would probably have to be these smaller ones, in the middle.\nExplainer: Yeah, that's right.\n","148":"Explainer: You've got it, so you are ready to design origami.\nExplainee: Awesome.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Wow, that's so impressive. I think I learned how to make one of these paper cranes when I was in third grade but I guess I never unfolded it to actually see where it was coming from. And so now that it's all broken up into circles it makes these super complicated insects and animals and everything seem so much simpler, so that's so cool. I'm pretty excited about it.\nExplainer: That's so cool.\n","149":"Explainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Life gave us this toolkit that is already on the nanoscale. So we think that that's a great place to think about making materials on the nano scale and manipulating materials on the nano scale, and wiring them together as well. This abalone shell, you can see the exquisite beautiful colors and structures of it. This is a nano composite material. If you take this and fracture it, and you look at it in a scanning electron microscope, what you'll see is that it's made out of these beautiful tablets. And I studied that as a graduate student. I looked at that and I said, that is completely amazing. You have an organism in the ocean, that takes what's in its environment, which is calcium and carbonate. That's dissolved in the water and templates it into this really exquisite structure. And so you think that's great. Calcium carbonate is great, but what if we wanted to make a solar cell or a another electronic device or a battery, how would you get an organism to do that? And you say, okay, that's a really crazy idea. But is it really that crazy if this abalone, already figured out how to do it, 500 million years ago? So we're saying, okay, abalones build shells. Can viruses build solar cells, can viruses build catalysts? Can they build batteries using the same kind of idea?\nExplainer: It's really fascinating work, especially now we're all familiar with the viruses and how they act. And I'm not aware of any viruses that build nanostructures. So how did you come to that? And then how do you actually program a virus to do your bidding?\n","150":"Explainer: It's really fascinating work, especially now we're all familiar with the viruses and how they act. And I'm not aware of any viruses that build nanostructures. So how did you come to that? And then how do you actually program a virus to do your bidding?\nExplainee: We work on something called bacteriophages, it's a virus with DNA. This particular bacteriophage called M13 bacteriophage is made up of single stranded DNA and proteins. It's long and thin. So it's 880 nanometers in length, and it's about 9 nanometers in diameter. And so one of the reasons I love it is it spans the nanoscale and almost the micron scale at the same time. Take the single strand DNAs, obviously a model, and you can cut it with molecular scissors. And you can put a new piece of DNA in between. And so you put a small piece of DNA in there that doesn't belong there. And that piece of DNA is going to randomly code for a protein. Now, the next time that that virus is replicated within a bacterial host, it'll be able to put a new protein sequence on the coat, just a short protein sequence on the coat, maybe like 8 or 12 amino acids in length. And just like that abalone is going to grab calcium and build calcium carbonate. We're going to have our viruses build iron phosphate for a battery electrode material or Gallium arsenide or cad sulfide for a semiconductor material.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Biology is chemistry. Molecules, proteins, and DNA work with all the same kinds of bonding and things that the chemicals that you're gonna be looking for in these processes. It's put together in a way that when a protein or enzyme folds, it almost always folds correctly. That's kind of the beauty of it, the predictable aspect of it encoded in its DNA. If we need to make it the same over and over again, then as long as you have the right DNA sequence, DNA is a beautiful structure on the nanoscale. And there's really, really cool, incredible work on DNA origami, when DNA can fold into just the right structure. And so I can see that as an interface, that would be really cool and interesting in your work. And you can have the virus make the DNA for the DNA origami, and then you use DNA to assemble your beautiful structures.\nExplainer: It's really fascinating. You have all these little worker viruses building the materials for you. How are you then applying these materials that you're building?\n","151":"Explainer: Looking ahead, 5 years, 10 years, where do you see your own work, and maybe the field more broadly?\nExplainee: The future I'd like to see is environmentally friendly chemistry and materials synthesis. And I think that we're really going that way. If we think about batteries of the future, solar cells of the future, thinking about earth abundant materials and processes that are compatible with the earth and environment.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: I agree completely. We like to solve problems. Nano bio is the toolkit that we bring a lot. It happens to be a very strong and evolving toolkit. That's another thing that I love about biology is if you can come up with a solution that's not perfect at all to begin with when you're making a battery electrode material or any kind of material you're making, you have evolution on your side to try to make it better and better as a function of time. That can be quite rapid.\nExplainer: So Angela, thank you so much for joining us. And I look forward to seeing more work coming out of your lab in the future.\n","152":"Explainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Right.\nExplainer: Telescopes, solar arrays, they need to be packed into a rocket, go up, but then expand in a very controlled, deterministic way when they get up into space.\n","153":"Explainer: Whenever there's a part of a spacecraft that is shaped somewhat like paper, meaning it's big and flat, we can use folding mechanisms from origami to make it smaller.\nExplainee: Right.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Okay.\nExplainer: These are the building blocks of many, many origami deployable shapes, it's called a degree-4 vertex. It's the number of lines. So in this case, we use solid lines for mountain, we use dash lines for valley. We're going to fold it and use these two to illustrate some important properties of origami mechanisms. It's important in the study of mechanisms to take into account the rigidity. So what we're going to do to help simulate rigidity is to take these rectangles and we're going to fold them over and over so that they just become stiff and rigid.\n","154":"Explainer: So this is what's called a single degree of freedom mechanism. You have one degree of freedom, I can choose this fold, and then if these are perfectly rigid every other fold angle is fully determined. One of the key behaviors here is that with the smaller angles up here, the two folds that are the same parity and the folds that are of opposite parity move at about the same rate but with this, as we're getting closer to 90 degrees, we find they move at very different rates and then at the end of the motion, the opposite happens. This one is almost folded but this one goes through a much larger motion so the relative speeds differ.\nExplainee: Right.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Okay.\nExplainer: And they fold flat and a pattern almost exactly like this was used for a solar array for a Japanese mission that flew in 1995.\n","155":"Explainer: So, sadly, the only way to get them at exactly the same rate is when these are microscopic slivers and then that's not useful.\nExplainee: For sure, right, right.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: So, it's kind of a trade-off?\nExplainer: There's an engineering trade-off to get them both to work. And there's another place that shows up in deployable structures in a very cool structure. This is a folded tube, it sort of pops out like this but it has this neat property that if you twist it quickly, it changes color. There's a Mars Rover application where they need a sleeve that protects a drill and as the drill goes down, the sleeve is going to collapse and they're using a pattern very much like this.\n","156":"Explainer: And it's exactly the difference between the motions of these two vertices. So these angles are closer to right angles and the closer you get to a right angle the more asymmetry there is between the two directions of motion. And then the other difference is how efficiently they pack, so these started at about the same size but when they're flat notice that yours is much more compact. So if I were you making a solar array, I'd say, oh, I want that one. But if I say, well, I want them to open at the same rate, then I want this one.\nExplainee: So, it's kind of a trade-off?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Interesting.\nExplainer: There are many open mathematical questions and so room for mathematicians, like yourself, to have a big impact on the world of origami and mechanisms. And even though those studies are mathematically interesting, they're going to also have real-world applications in space, solar arrays, drills, telescopes, and more. Any questions or thoughts about this?\n","157":"Explainer: So do you know what virtual reality is?\nExplainee: Yes, its simple. Its like a video game except it feels like you're in the video game.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Or in Minecraft.\nExplainer: Yeah, or in Minecraft. When you look at a TV on the wall there showing like a picture of a mountain or something, how can you tell that its not just a window and there's something else behind it. Because it always doesn't look quite right if you have a static picture of a person on a screen and you move around like this, its not really changing. And its interesting, those are things we have to figure out We need to figure out when you look at something in reality how can you tell whether its real or not. Have you been to a 3-D movie where you put on the little glasses?\n","158":"Explainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Mm-hmm.\nExplainer: Okay, that's great. On one side, we have a lot of the notes which make us feel brighter, you know, like these kinds of, (keyboard music) these really bright sounds. And the other side is a lot more to do with the darkness of a key center. So we're home in F, but imagine we're taking a quick visit to B-flat, but then the sun comes out.\n","159":"Explainer: Essentially what harmony is, is like a language, right?

The news would be spreaded around the world rapidly.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Yeah.\n","166":"Explainer: So in your studies, have you learned about machine learning?\nExplainee: Yeah, I have. So to me, machine learning is essentially exactly what it sounds like. It's trying to teach a machine specifics about something by inputting a lot of data points and slowly, the machine will build up knowledge about it over time. For example, my Gmail program, I assume that there would be a lot of, like, machine learning models happening at once, right?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: I'd probably look at certain keywords. Maybe if the recipient and the sender had exchanged emails before and generally, those fell into in the past.\nExplainer: So these are things we would call features. And we go through a process where we do feature engineering, where somebody looks at the example and says, Okay, these are the things that I think might allow us to statistically tell the difference from something in one category versus another. So for example, perhaps you don't speak Russian, you start getting a lot of email in Russian.\n","167":"Explainer: This is a great question because it really gets to the difference between some of our different tools in our machine learning tool belt in addressing problems like this. So if we were to use a supervised learning classic classification approach, a person would need to think about those features and creatively come up with them in approach we call the kitchen sink approach, which is just try everything you can possibly think of and see what works. Unsupervised learning, where we don't have labeled data and we're trying to infer some structure out of the data is you're projecting that data into a space and looking for things like clusters. And there's a bunch of really fun math about how you do that, how you think about distance and by distance, I mean that if we have two data points in space, how do we decide if they're similar or not?\nExplainee: And how do the algorithms themselves usually differ between unsupervised and supervised learning.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: With reinforcement learning versus deep learning, it seems to me that reinforcement learning, is it sort of like the kitchen sink approach that you were talking about earlier, where you're just kind of trying everything?\nExplainer: It is, but it also thrives in environments where you have a decision point, a pallet of actions to choose from. And it actually comes historically from trying to train a robot to navigate a room. If it bonks into this chair, it can't go forward anymore. And if it falls into that pit, you know, it's not going to succeed. But if it keeps exploring, it'll eventually get to the goal.\n","168":"Explainer: [Hilary] Yes. [both laugh]\nExplainee: Oh, I didn't realize it was that deep, almost. Is there a situation which you'd want to use a deep learning algorithm over a reinforcement learning algorithm?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: What would be the outcome if you were to choose the, quote-unquote, wrong approach?\nExplainer: You build a system that could actually be useless. So years ago, I had a client that was a big telecom company and they had a data scientist who built a deep learning system to predict customer churn. It actually was very accurate, but it wasn't useful because nobody knew why the prediction was what it was. So they could say, you know, Sunny, you're likely to quit next month. But they had no idea what to do about it. And so, I think there are a bunch of failure modes.\n","169":"Explainer: So typically, you would choose deep learning if you have sufficient high quality data, hopefully labeled in a useful way. If you really are happy not to necessarily understand or be able to interpret what your system is doing or you're willing to invest in another set of work afterwards to understand what the system is doing once you've already trained it. And this also comes down to the fact that some things are actually really easy to solve with linear regression or simple statistical approaches.

This is actually a good example of a very real world kind of machine learning problem where the solution to this was to build an interpretable system on top of the accurate predictions not to throw it away, but to do a bunch more work to figure out the why.\n","170":"Explainer: You build a system that could actually be useless.

We do a lot of X-ray in addition to EM and this is actually, I'm not saying it's the only problem, but it's the only problem that needs to be solved right away, is that the data analysis, right? In fact, I think we calculated that there aren't enough humans ever to map a mouse brain where you collect every connection and et cetera so the problem is to get algorithms to trace, to recognize things in brains the way humans would recognize things in brains, or map things, trace things in brains. It's gonna cost a lot of money to imagine setting the gold standard for the wiring diagram even once and those are the kinds of ethical concerns that I'm worried about.\n","173":"Explainee: Hello Donna, good to see you.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: I remember very much and how hard it was to convince you to travel across the country and work at the lab.\nExplainer: And stay there.\n","174":"Explainer: That's right, if you can do that, go for it.\nExplainee: And then we will shine that laser onto that electron beam, and the electron's rest frame, we beat the Schwinger limit.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: That's why I wanna cheat.\nExplainer: That's the Nobel Prize winning idea though if we can come up with it.\n","175":"Explainer: And that's, like you said, we're stuck a little bit, we're not up to that kind of acceleration, so that would be a Nobel Prize winning possible idea.\nExplainee: Absolutely.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: So actually there's a potential ways of doing it with optical or near optical radiation. And there's been a lot of work done in the defense department and so on, how do I combine laser beams together?\nExplainer: Okay.\n","176":"Explainer: Okay.\nExplainee: And make them act as one coherent source. So one of the things that we'll be doing with our two petawatts, we're going to see if we can actually combine them into a 50. If you can do that, you can begin to imagine doing this with many lasers. Many petawatt lasers of the scale we're talking about. So one could possibly see an exawatt from that. People have been able to combine 10s of lasers together for a coherent source so you have to be able to phase lock them, you have to be able to make their phases be exactly connected and related and be able, as they propagate through all the different optical components, whatever it may be--\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: So that's right so you have to have the aperture size, you have to have them phase locked across the entire aperture. Which will be a great challenge and people have done it, again, with small lasers. The lasers we'll be trying to do is about a 40cm aperture. So we'll begin to start looking at this. And actually wavelength control and then be able to adaptive optics other ways which you can control the uniformity of the phase is something that's been developed in lots of ways now. For defense applications, for science applications. So we will do our best to make use of all these technologies. Lasers I think have progressed so much. Just like the semi conductor did, 'cos there's such a market for it, there were so many different applications for that.\nExplainer: Okay so there's a lot of us working around the world on these high intensity lasers and so, what do you think the real fun is? What do you see the real excitement being?\n","177":"Explainer: Have you heard of the breach of Target where they were breached many years ago and their point of sale systems were hacked?\nExplainee: Yes, I heard about that.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: I've heard about similar attacks in hospitals using hospital equipment, but I'm surprised that something as simple as a meat scale would have been used in such an attack. We discussed it in class as how hackers look at some of the weakest links in these large networks and use those to tap into networks.\nExplainer: Yeah, that's another interesting concept. It's really just different layers that we have for protection, because often when you're talking about something like a corporate network, or even your home network, you typically have sort of one level of defense, right? If someone can break that or it can get in through some other system that is connected or exposes some other protocol, like Bluetooth, right? You can connect to a Bluetooth device without being on the wireless network, without being on the LAN. That potentially gives you another place that you can pivot on and then access other devices, because if something has both Bluetooth and also Wi-Fi, well, if you can get in through Bluetooth, then you can then access the Wi-Fi and get to other devices on the network. Are you familiar with buffer overflows?\n","178":"Explainer: So where people are swiping credit cards, those credit card numbers were stolen. They hired a company to come in and perform a penetration test to see, can the good guys essentially break in again to prevent this sort of thing in the future? And when this team came in, they found they actually were able to get pretty much to the same point of sale system, and the way they did that was by exploiting an internet-connected deli meat scale. Once the company was able to essentially get into the deli scale, because the deli scale was on the internal network, then they were able to really escalate privilege and find a vulnerability within another system. Essentially, that just got them into the network. and once you're in the network, it's often really easy to then escalate from there.\nExplainee: I've heard about similar attacks in hospitals using hospital equipment, but I'm surprised that something as simple as a meat scale would have been used in such an attack. We discussed it in class as how hackers look at some of the weakest links in these large networks and use those to tap into networks.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: No, I am not familiar with that.\nExplainer: If we were to write a program that asked for your name and you typed in your name, but before you could type in your name, in a low leveling, which is like C or C++, you'd have to allocate some memory. So you might allocate a buffer of a hundred bytes because whose name is going to be longer than a hundred bytes or a hundred character? But what happens if you were to not really check that they limited to a hundred bytes? Do you know what happens if they essentially start typing over that hundred bytes?\n","179":"Explainer: Well one of the fun things people do with lasers, the cat will try to grab that dot. I'm sure what you have at home is a flashlight. I brought a cute little one.

So which one do you think's more powerful?\n","180":"Explainer: One of the things that lasers are great for is that because it's a directed beam, we can actually put that light where we want the light to go and sometimes you maybe just want to see something around the corner and you can't see it.

And so instead of sort of there being one company with one database that holds all the information, the same sort of list is held by all these different people. Like, you could have it on your computer. And then it gets validated by everyone, and basically, that turns into the next part of the list. So it's sort of constantly updating itself.\n","186":"Explainer: [Bettina] Exactly.\nExplainee: That's cool.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: That's cool.\nExplainer: Yeah.\n","187":"Explainer: [Donna] And what's your major?\nExplainee: I'm an engineering physics major with a minor in math. I'm in the three, two program for biomedical engineering.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Not yet. I'm really hoping that we will. I think it's super interesting just the field in general because I really do enjoy examining all the calculations and being able to do a little bit more of the math side of physics.\nExplainer: Okay. As opposed to the experimental side and seeing things? Okay so I'm much more, I like to see the things happening. So then the question is, what's so special about making a light that's intense enough to actually possibly blow things up? Certainly we can blow atoms up with the laser hammer and when the laser light comes in and just smacks the electrons right off the atom. And so the question really is how do you make that? Back in the 70s and into the 80s, I know that was a long time ago for you, we had big energy lasers and we had short pulse lasers, we couldn't have big energy, short pulse lasers and actually it was my supervisor and I that figured the way around that and we got something called chirped pulse amplification. Have you heard of chirped pulse amplification by any chance?\n","188":"Explainer: Excellent. I got an engineering physics degree. There you go, something in common. We're here today talking about lasers. So have you have had much exposure to lasers yet at school?\nExplainee: Not yet. I'm really hoping that we will. I think it's super interesting just the field in general because I really do enjoy examining all the calculations and being able to do a little bit more of the math side of physics.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Vaguely.\nExplainer: Well I brought a little bit of a prop to explain how chirped pulse amplification works. Our short pulses are made of different colors. So I've got a colored slinky here. We probably could've called it stretched pulse amplification but that's kind of boring so we used the word chirped. The word chirped comes around because birds chirp. When the birds are singing, the notes are actually changing audio frequency with time and that's a chirp. The point is is that when all the light is squeezed together like this, it's a short pulse. And that's when it's a hammer because all of the light is now concentrated and you can imagine if this was coming along and also using a lens to focus it small, then all of that light at the focal spot, concentrate. And so that was the laser hammer. So we can't have that in the laser. So the question is what could we do? The fact that it's different colors and different colors because of dispersion, travel different speeds inside material. So we used a long fiber, 1.4 kilometers of fiber but, in fiber, the red colors really haven't got that much in common with the glass atoms and so they spend very little time interacting and they travel fast. The red is going to start traveling faster than the green, faster than the blue and, as you travel down the fiber, next thing you know, you have a long pulse and it's chirped from red at the beginning to blue at the back. And so the frequencies go hoo! Like this okay? So this is a chirped pulse and now it's a long pulse. And so, first this is what we did, we chirped it, we stretched it, then we can safely amplify it because it's not all concentrated and, after we amplify it, then we use something called a compressor and we put all of the colors back together and it was back being a short pulse but a high energy pulse. And then we really had what I like to call a laser hammer. When this laser pulse goes inside, it smacks those electrons right off the atom.\n","189":"Explainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Only until I started listening to singing, like barbershop quartet, and, and as I was a violinist as well--\nExplainer: Right.\n","190":"Explainer: Yeah. The amazing thing about harmony is that it exists in nature. So, take the harmonic series of the note F, for example. Okay. You have the ups on the fifth and the fourth and then the, (hums) That seemed a little bit sharp, but that's fine. And then tones get increasingly small. Beneath that note, you have the undertone series, which essentially is like a reflection of something. In the same way that when a tree grows in nature, you have the branches which grow upwards and the roots which go downwards. So it's quite a nice thing to thing about, this being the key center, the floor, the ground, and then these two different directions of ways in which it can express itself, and the differences in the sensations with that. Lots of the time I think when it comes to reharmonization or harmonization, people think that the solution to the problems come when we add more notes.\nExplainee: Yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Right.\nExplainer: Because I can delay the gratification of going home. First of all, just by using inversions, even before we add the notes to the chord. One thing that I was very joyful to discover is that every single melody note works with every single base note.\n","191":"Explainer: I think that people forget that you can work with the notes you already have by just rearranging them, just the simple idea of inversion, inversion of the simple triad, of F major. \u266aI once was lost and now I'm found \u266a \u266a Was blind \u266a \u266a But now I see \u266a Now how home do I want to go here, you know?

And then, G seven with a flat 13\nExplainee: (laughs)\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: But what about negative harmony, the dark side?\nExplainer: So essentially, the way I'd apply negative harmony would be this idea of polarity, you know, between the overtone series and the undertone series, or you know, the one side and the other side. The perfect and the play goal. The feeling of a minor perfect-- (keyboard music) Resolving, it's so moving, you know? And it's a good alternative to something like, (keyboard music)\n","193":"Explainer: That's it! (laughs) A flat soft, A flat major seven. A flat major seven sharp five, with a sharp 11.

What, how, what should we, what should we, how, what am I supposed to do? What to do, right. And sometimes the paralyzing thing when it comes to arranging, there are too many options, too many things are possible.

And I would love to hear more about your side of memory and the mechanisms that you're studying.\nExplainer: So we're interested in the idea that memory is kind of a pervasive force that shapes all our behaviors. And we're trying to understand how different kinds of memory are organized in different structures of the brain. And then to understand how those different structures work together to orchestrate complex cognitive behaviors like decision-making or reasoning and thinking.\n","203":"Explainer: My work has actually kind of pushed against that distinction between memories that kind of are consciously accessible versus unconscious.\nExplainee: When you say that you don't necessarily look at implicit and explicit memory as anything different, if you were to take a step back, what would you define as implicit and explicit memory?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Are the connectivities that you're seeing using the FMRI in your studies, are they different when you look at the implicit and explicit memories? Are you seeing more activity in the striatum in comparison to the hippocampus or the prefrontal cortex?\nExplainer: Yeah, you know things are kind of breaking down in unexpected ways I'd say. I think there's been a lot of really great work out of multiple labs showing hippocampal activity related to behaviors that don't look anything like episodic memories, but which might depend on episodic memories right? So for example also when you're making a decision about how to choose between two good options that suddenly you might see activity in the hippocampus related to the choice itself, others have found that you find activity in the hippocampus not only when people are forming memories, but also when they're imagining events that are gonna happen in the future. So it kind of forced us to rethink the way we define what the hippocampus might be doing in a way that can account for creating memories, thinking about the future, making decisions and other kinds of behaviors that involve what we would refer to you in the field as relational processing. And that raises all kinds of new questions about what memory really is. Reminiscing about our early influences that made us want to be scientists is that, you know, of course we know, we know better than to think that those are necessarily accurate memories. You know this reminds me of sort of the classic example from literature when people talk about memory of course is Marcel Proust's Madeleine in Remembrance of Things Past. Where in the book it's this taste for the, for the protagonist this taste of the crumbs of the Madeleine cookie and the tea that bring him back to his childhood.

The rooms each have a number, and even though there's infinitely many rooms, each room is only a finite distance away. So here's how we're gonna make room for the new guest. I'm gonna ask the guest in room one to move into room two, and then we're gonna ask the guest in room two to move into room three, and we'll continue this all the way along. It looks to me like there's space for the new guest. Where is it? \n","208":"Explainer: Yeah, that's absolutely right. So infinity gets used a lot of different ways in mathematics. There's a way that mathematicians think of infinity as a number, just like the number 13, just like the number 10 million.

So one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, et cetera. That list goes on forever. That is an infinite set. And to be a little bit more precise, it's a countably infinite set.

Suppose a new guest shows up, you might think that the new guest could take the room that's all the way down at the end of the hall, all the way at infinity, except there isn't a room like that. The rooms each have a number, and even though there's infinitely many rooms, each room is only a finite distance away. So here's how we're gonna make room for the new guest. I'm gonna ask the guest in room one to move into room two, and then we're gonna ask the guest in room two to move into room three, and we'll continue this all the way along. It looks to me like there's space for the new guest. Where is it? \nExplainee: It'll be in room number one.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Would it be two plus infinity equals infinity?\nExplainer: Absolutely. So now I'm gonna make this story a little more complex. That there's another Hilbert's Hotel down the street and they're having plumbing issues and we need to find room for them.\n","210":"Explainer: Absolutely. So now I'm gonna make this story a little more complex. That there's another Hilbert's Hotel down the street and they're having plumbing issues and we need to find room for them.\nExplainee: They can't live together?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Yes. You're going up one each time?\nExplainer: Yeah, I'm increasing by one more each time. So I'm doubling the room number in fact. So this is some of the strange arithmetic of infinity. So we have two Hilbert Hotels, each of which have infinitely many guests, then this is equal to?\n","211":"Explainer: Yeah, I'm increasing by one more each time. So I'm doubling the room number in fact. So this is some of the strange arithmetic of infinity. So we have two Hilbert Hotels, each of which have infinitely many guests, then this is equal to?\nExplainee: Infinity.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: How does infinity come across in mathematics for you?\nExplainer: So when I'm teaching calculus and talking about concepts like limits and derivatives, those are only defined precisely with infinity. Teaching algebra, which is meant in a different sense about number systems, we deal with infinite families of numbers in their operations. Infinite sets are somehow very exotic. They're not found so commonly in their real world, but they're all over mathematics.\n","212":"Explainer: Infinity, great. Hilbert's Hotel is a story that mathematicians have been telling themselves for almost 100 years because it's a really visceral way to think about some of the counterintuitive properties of the arithmetic of infinity.\nExplainee: How does infinity come across in mathematics for you?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","213":"Explainer: Yeah. That's what it's called.\nExplainee: Yeah. yeah, I haven't heard of it before.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Yeah, I did work with robots, but they weren't doing like artificial intelligence type of stuff. We were just sending like instructions and the robot would do, like, perform like a simple task. I wasn't so used to the aspect of, like, teaching computer how to do stuff. So I'm always on that other end of like giving instructions, more focused on the data analysis and machine learning aspect of it.\nExplainer: And how would you just describe machine learning, like in one sentence?\n","214":"Explainer: Do you have any thoughts on like what the data might look like in a robotic setting, if you were to apply machine learning to robots?\nExplainee: I think of like coordinates.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: I don't think so. I feel like that might be a problem.\nExplainer: Yeah, so there's this generalization gap, this gap between what it was trained to do and the new thing.\n","215":"Explainer: Yeah, so there's this generalization gap, this gap between what it was trained to do and the new thing.\nExplainee: So what's like the most complicated thing for a robot to learn, is it motion?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Do you think that we'd be able to kind of accelerate that process of collecting data? Or do you think, is it the way that we've been collecting those types of data sets, Is that what's keeping us behind?\nExplainer: That's a great question. I think we should be able to accelerate the data collection process by having robots collect more data autonomously on their own. And by doing that, we might be able to overcome some of the challenges of Moravec's paradox.\n","216":"Explainer: That's a great question. I think we should be able to accelerate the data collection process by having robots collect more data autonomously on their own. And by doing that, we might be able to overcome some of the challenges of Moravec's paradox.\nExplainee: What are some common algorithms that are used in these types of techniques as the robot is learning?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","217":"Explainer: And if I cut that box in half again, how many boxes do I need to cover the line.\nExplainee: two\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Four.\nExplainer: And so what this box counting is getting at is saying, well, I still can never decide what the length of the coastline is, but what I can do is I can see how quick does the number of boxes grow relative to how it would grow just for an ordinary one dimensional curve, like a line or a circle.\n","218":"Explainer: But if you take a more interesting shape, some kind of fractal shape, like let's say the coastline of great Britain and you start doing this box, counting experiment, something really interesting happens as you make these boxes smaller, the number of boxes you need to cover the coastline grows faster than it would for just a straight line.\nExplainee: Four.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Yeah, I've, I've heard about that. Where if you, if you change the amount of measurement for a coastline, you can actually change like how much of the coast that, that there is like if you measure in mile lengths, you're gonna get a much different estimate than if you measure in one inch increments.\nExplainer: So procedural computer graphics, which kind of came out of thinking about fractals is one answer to this question about how do you add more detail without for instance, consuming tons of memory or requiring artists to paint ultra detail the textures. So if, if you can instead describe at least some aspect of what you're looking at in a procedural or recursive way, then you can add as much detail as you need when you get close to objects.\n","219":"Explainer: Yeah like perlin noise is a great example, right? Perlin noise was one of the early ways of synthesizing additional texture at any level of detail that you needed to make things look natural and realistic.\nExplainee: Oh, you mean like perlin noise?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: I have a, a random question. Do you know how the research into fractals began?\n","220":"Explainer: And then program the robot to move over here and open the- \nExplainee: And drop it.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Yes.\nExplainer: We can see what happens. So it's gonna, we programed the robot to move to the same exact position as before.\n","221":"Explainer: When we gave it instructions, did we tell it to look at where the cup was? Or did we tell it to just move over here?\nExplainee: We told it to just move over here.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Okay.\nExplainer: Does that seem like a hard task or an easy task?\n","222":"Explainer: What you're basically asking is, wait, what? Right? Right. So this is what makes zero-knowledge proof so fascinating, and so counter-intuitive. And I think the best way I can explain it to you is by means of an example. But before we do that, I have to decide what I'm gonna prove to you in a, with a zero-knowledge proof.\nExplainee: Sounds good.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Yeah.\nExplainer: Without revealing what the address is of your account. It turns out I can take that statement that I have at least 0.2 Bitcoins, and convert it into a map of countries. And that map of countries will be three-colorable like this only if you have at least 0.2 Bitcoins.\n","223":"Explainer: And the way we're gonna approach this is through something called NP-completeness. What an NP-complete problem is, it's a problem that's really hard to solve. But if you can solve it, you can solve any problem that's in the class NP. And that includes a vast number of problems. And what we're gonna do is we're gonna use an NP-complete problem to actually prove an incredible variety of statements through a zero-knowledge proof. And the specific Np-complete problem that we're gonna be looking at is called map three-coloring. Okay, so here we have a map. Okay. And these are a bunch of countries. And we've arranged them so that no countries that have the same color share a border. That's what makes a map like this validly colored. And now you might think, well, why should we care? It turns out that whether or not a map can be three-colored in this way is an example of an NP-complete problem. And it turns out that, you know, maybe what you really wanna do, is you wanna give a zero-knowledge proof that you have at least 0.3 Bitcoins, right? That would be cool.\nExplainee: Yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: How would we turn something like this into a zero-knowledge proof?\nExplainer: Of course, the first step is we have to erase all the colors. What I've done is I've put a color inside each of these envelopes. Now, how do you know that it's a valid coloring? You don't. Right? You have to pick any two neighboring countries. You can pick them however you like. At random.\n","224":"Explainer: Nice. And that's smart of you to check with the same one of the ones you already had. Right?\nExplainee: Mm-hmm.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Yeah, because of this one, right?\nExplainer: Exactly. Right. But it works for this coloring that I'm showing you right now. So what we've done is we've made it impossible for you to put the pieces together. And if you do this, let's say, a thousand times. And if I correctly showed you different colors, each thousand times, you'd be really convinced. And that's it. That's the entire zero-knowledge proof.\n","225":"Explainer: But as you'll see, now it's not green, it's blue. And this one on the other hand, is green. Okay. The colors I showed you last time, don't work with these new colors, right? This wouldn't have worked before.\nExplainee: Yeah, because of this one, right?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Oh, okay.\nExplainer: Okay?\n","226":"Explainer: You would use encryption. Right. But it's really, this is the protocol.\nExplainee: So what are the broader implications of like, zero-knowledge proofs. Are they supposed to be like, more practical for like, implementation, and or, are they supposed to like, structurally prove something?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Where do you think we could build like, more trust using like, zero-knowledge proofs?\nExplainer: Right.\n","227":"Explainer: Right.\nExplainee: And it's implementations?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","228":"Explainer: I mean I think that's another common misconception about mathematics is that it's so far removed from the humanities, for instance. I mean it's hard to ignore some of these philosophical questions, particularly when we're talking about certain things like infinity. And I think one of the most difficult things to really be precise about and to explain to students is the continuum hypothesis. What do you say to students about the continuum hypothesis?\nExplainee: The most fun thing to teach when you teach about infinity, when students realize that you are talking about different sizes of infinity, but then a natural thing is for them to think about what is the next size of infinity that I can think about? And sort of the continuum hypothesis is sort of one of these really hard things to grasp.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: There's a lot of math that we sort of take for granted as this is the thing that you can do without really admitting that we are creating the foundations that are the basis for the work we do later. And so yes, I think that if we change the foundations, we would change mathematics. But I think that's also very humbling in that it's not that we're sort of discovering a universal truth, it's we are humans constructing meaning. It's abstract art in a sense. There is something there even if you can't see all the pieces for particular things. And I think that it's really fascinating. I was thinking about this on the drive here. The way that I interact with infinity I mentioned earlier is sometimes we, in number theory especially, we say, does this type of equation have infinitely many solutions? And then the question is are there infinitely many, are there not? Or are there infinitely many twin primes? These are sort of interesting ideas but I don't think that knowing if it's infinite or not is necessarily the most interesting thing for me. What's been most interesting to me is all the math that gets developed to be able to answer that question.\nExplainer: Given current technology. And who knows what mathematics will look like in 100 years. 150 years ago when we barely knew infinity, and look where we are today.\n","229":"Explainer: Yeah, that's a great insight. Basically we can't remember everything. So when you tell us this memory of that vacation and your brain is able to kind of play almost this movie of a memory, a moment, a day that you had in your life a while ago, where do those memories come from?\nExplainee: I do know that there's different parts of the brain. So there's probably a part of your brain that remembers a bunch of stuff.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Let's say you, you accidentally cut yourself. Then your brain makes a note and says don't get too close to sharp things, or you're going to cut yourself again.\nExplainer: You got it. And so we don't just remember everything and we don't remember random things. We remember the things that matter to us the most. So Abigail based on our conversation today, can you tell me what is a memory?\n","230":"Explainer: And so you can't actually measure the length.\nExplainee: Yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Would a planet or an asteroid be a fractal?\nExplainer: Yeah, so if you look at kind of the wrinkly surface of an asteroid, each one of those little wrinkles adds a little bit to the surface area. And so it's really hard to say, what is the area of an asteroid? Let's take a look at a little example of where fractals actually show up in nature. What we're gonna try to do is we're gonna try to say what the length of the coastline of great Britain is. So we're gonna start out with the blue ones, which are spaced further apart. We're gonna ask you to connect the blue pins with a piece of string so we can get a measurement of the coastline. So we have our first measurement of the length of the coastline, and we're gonna do it over again. But this time we're gonna use the white pins, which are spaced closer together. So we measured the coastline again. And what do you think happens?\n","231":"Explainer: Right? Yeah. So that's already a really good idea of what a fractal is. It has some really, really interesting detail at all, scales that makes it hard to talk about standard quantities like lengths and areas and volumes.\nExplainee: Would a planet or an asteroid be a fractal?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: There's more in and out. Therefore probably takes more string for this one.\nExplainer: I think I agree with you, but I think to really validate our scientific experiment, we should probably compare the length of the string. A lot of extra slack in that pig of string. So what we noticed with great Britain is we were never able to measure it's length. It just kept getting longer and longer. This is called the coastline paradox where there's not really one definite number you can assign to the length of the coastline, but it depends on how you measure it. Like if we kept going to really get this to be accurate, we might have to like actually go down the beach and start measuring these tiny little details along the coastline. But really there's so much detail. We would probably never get a definite answer for how long the coastline is. Fractals also give us a really nice language. We're talking about how smooth or rough some kind of shape is. And actually a lot of people, engineers and scientists use this idea of fractals and this language of fractals to compare different shapes, not in terms of their size, but in terms of their roughness. So based on everything we talked about today, how would you describe a fractal to somebody in your own words?\n","232":"Explainer: I think I agree with you, but I think to really validate our scientific experiment, we should probably compare the length of the string.

Just.\nExplainee: Yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Yeah, yeah, it would be cool if we like used something like an x-ray, we build an x-ray\nExplainer: Yeah.\n","236":"Explainer: Yeah, I started out doing magnetic resonance, studying things like bone and biomedical magnetic resonance. Ended up playing with spins for a long time and the physics of spins just fascinated me.\nExplainee: So what do you think is a big difference between imaging large biological objects versus sensing very small quantum objects, I guess?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: How is the resolution higher?\nExplainer: So it's because the nitrogen-vacancy center is a single defect. So you can actually see a single electron. In normal magnetic resonance, you don't have the sensitivity.\n","237":"Explainer: [Sekhar] Yeah.\nExplainee: And those are very sensitive to fluctuations. Yeah. I guess any fluctuations can kick your quantum system either out of the state that it's in to another state.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Oh, yeah.\nExplainer: And that was a source of noise, like, it's completely random, but it is still there. And then the other form is very much what is intrinsically within your experiment itself because some of the materials that you have have defects that are coupling into your sensor, into your quantum system and are also producing noise.\n","238":"Explainer: And that was a source of noise, like, it's completely random, but it is still there.

You don't just see the external spins, you see the fluctuations of all the other spins in your system. So what you wanna do is make sure that they don't interact with each other, but they still stay sensitive to everything else. And there, you could think about the local interactions, the magnetic interactions between the spins as a form of noise. In some ways, it's interfering with what you wanna measure, which is the magnetic field outside the sample.\n","239":"Explainer: Right, it could give you information if you read it out, about what's happening or you have to find smart ways to suppress it so that you can focus on what you really do care about.\nExplainee: So what are the kind of noise and fluctuations that you're worried about?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","240":"Explainer: Right.\nExplainee: But I don't know that there's necessarily a limit. I mean, it keeps expanding. I mean, I think that there are some groups that are able to identify, you know, 30, 40 individual nuclear spins around a single electron and control 10 or 15 of them.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: That's another great question. A couple of groups actually that are working on trying to read out the spin state of NV centers electrically, instead of optically. If you could do that, then you could pack a whole lot more into a smaller space using tiny electrodes.\nExplainer: Right.\n","241":"Explainer: Yeah.\nExplainee: And that I think is gonna make real breakthroughs in the next 10 years, is the fact that we're just having this much larger group of scientists.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","242":"Explainer: so steve tell me about your research and the work you've been doing in quantum computing\nExplainee: I'm a theoretical physicist. I started out in condensed matter theory, the theory that studies superconductors and magnets and I had to learn a new field of quantum optics and apply those ideas. One of the nice things about being a theorist Is you get to keep learning new things.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: My main focus right now is quantum error correction and trying to understand this concept of fault tolerance which everybody thinks they know it when they see it but nobody in the quantum case can precisely define it.\nExplainer: common myth how many qubits do you have that's the only thing that matters like just add more qubits what's the big deal pattern them on your chip\n","243":"Explainer: exactly so i think something that frustrates a lot of people about quantum computing is the concept of decoherence right you can only keep your information quantum for so long right and that limits how many operations you can do in a row before you lose your information\nExplainee: The great power of a quantum computer is also it's Achilles's heel. That it's very very sensitive to perturbations and noise and environmental effects. You're just multiplying your problems if all your doing is adding qubits.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: That's the challenge I would say. As much progress as we've made it's a frustration to still be facing it.\nExplainer: another common myth in the next five years quantum computing will solve climate change cancer [Laughter]\n","244":"Explainer: What happens in Minecraft if you get really, really close to a shape?\nExplainee: Well, it just looks like a block.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Recursion is a function that uses itself or calls itself in it's definition. And basically with that, you can figure out minute details such as searching for a value in a binary tree. It's kind of like iterating through itself, but it's often more sophisticated in that it's easier to write.\nExplainer: They're easy for a computer to execute, right? It just has to run this recursive procedure over and over and over again. We can kind of get as much detail as we want or need. When I think about fractals and kind of what they've done for computer graphics. The example I think is subdivision surfaces. Did you, did you encounter subdivision surfaces in your graphics class at all?\n","245":"Explainer: Yeah it looks really blocky. And it's the same thing not only with shapes and games, but also colors and textures. And this is an especially a big problem in virtual reality because you have no control over where people are gonna go. What they're gonna look at, how close they're gonna get to various objects. So fractals on the other hand are these things that have infinitely, you know, nice details you get closer and closer and closer. And so this is something that can help us solve this problem in computer graphics of generating more detail. One of the reasons why fractals are really nice for computer graphics is because the algorithms that we use to draw images also have this kind of recursive flavor. What's recursion?\nExplainee: Recursion is a function that uses itself or calls itself in it's definition. And basically with that, you can figure out minute details such as searching for a value in a binary tree. It's kind of like iterating through itself, but it's often more sophisticated in that it's easier to write.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: The name doesn't really ring a bell.\nExplainer: So subdivision surface is a way of describing a smooth shape on a computer rather than some complicated fractal shape. So meshes and computer graphics are usually made of these flat polygons with kind of sharp edges. And so the question is how can I get something nice and round and smooth out of these sharp looking polygons? What I can do is I can start cutting one at a time, the corners of this paper off, it still looks very angular. I still have these really sharp points.\n","246":"Explainer: So subdivision surface is a way of describing a smooth shape on a computer rather than some complicated fractal shape.

In fact, subdivision services were invented basically at Pixar. There's this guy, Ed Capel, and he was harshly responsible for one of the most famous kinds of subdivision surfaces called Capel Clark subdivision surfaces. And in fact recently won the touring award for these subdivision services.\n","247":"Explainer: Because I want to draw a smooth curve on the screen, but all my computer can do is draw straight lines. And that's actually too true of GPUs. It's kind of interesting. GPUs are basically really fast machines that can only draw one thing and that's a flat triangle. And so if we keep doing this with our paper, you kind of get pretty quickly the idea of what's gonna happen. So when you go to see a Pixar movie, for instance, every surface has been subdivided down. So you have tiny little triangles called micro polygons that are even smaller than the size of a pixel.\nExplainee: How long does this process take?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: What do you think are the current shortcomings in, I guess applying fractals to computer science right now, what are, what is the cutting edge?\nExplainer: So we've, talked a little bit about the positive features of fractals and procedural graphics, which is you can write one simple recursive program and the computer creates a lot of detail for you. So that's really nice, right? It's saving you a lot of work, but the downside is you lose a lot of control. So because the only thing you're describing is this short little program, you don't have complete control over how this is gonna end up. And so adding more controllability to procedural graphics is something people have been thinking about for many years. So how has our conversation changed your understanding of what fractals are all about?\n","248":"Explainer: I wanted to ask you a little bit about what you know about the history of the internet.

And so remember, this was a Department of Defense, was they wanted to have forms of of communication that were very robust, that were survivable. Packets could all find their own ways, be routed differently through the network. So if parts of the network failed, you could route around failures.\n","249":"Explainer: Okay, back into the 1960s, there was a research agency in the United States called DARPA, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency. Actually, it was called ARPA at the time. They wanted to build this notion of a packet-switching network. Not a circuit switch network like a phone network where you get a dedicated path and a dedicated set of bandwidth and links from source to destination.\nExplainee: So what would packet switching enable?

[Jim laughs] I've heard that there are like seven keys to the internet, something like that.\nExplainer: Okay, well I don't know about the number seven, but there's something in the internet that's sort of similar to that. It's called the Domain Name System. The DNS's role is to translate names like gaia.cs.umass.edu, or ibm.com, or facebook.com to an IP address so that your application can actually send a message to that name, to that named service.\n","252":"Explainer: Ah ha! Spoken like a real computer scientist, right? You're a computer scientist. I'm a computer scientist. We talk about APIs, application programming interfaces. The API for the internet is something called a socket. And a socket simply says, I can communicate if I know your internet address, you know, 128.119.40.186, that number is the IP address of my server, the University of Massachusetts. If you know that, you can write a program anywhere in the world and send a message, and it'll pop out at my end.\nExplainee: I will be remembering that. [Jim laughs] I've heard that there are like seven keys to the internet, something like that.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: This whatever quantity of people is able to have some form of control?\nExplainer: So that's a great question. Who do you think controls the internet?\n","253":"Explainer: Okay. What does that mean?\nExplainee: No one authority holds control over any sort of decisions or destinations.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: When can we see the next tenfold increase in in Wi-Fi speed?\nExplainer: In terms of tenfold speeds of increases, depending on what device you're using right now, it's available, all you need to do is upgrade. So the Wi-Fi protocol's called 802.11. And this is sometimes a source of confusion for people. How can it be that I've got a connection at 100 megabits per second from our TV into our router? 100 megabits per second not enough?\n","254":"Explainer: That's 98% true. And if you own a network, like you're att.com, or your verizon.com, you can do, within that network, you can do what you want, right? So in that sense, the internet is very decentralized, that the control of the network is up to whoever owns the network. The 2% where you said there's nobody in control, there's a little bit of centralized control. There's an organization called the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers. Its responsibility is to handle, as the name ICANN suggests, names and numbers. It's that little bit of centralization, central authority that you need.\nExplainee: When can we see the next tenfold increase in in Wi-Fi speed?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Packets dropping?\nExplainer: Where do they get dropped, do you think?\n","255":"Explainer: Where do they get dropped, do you think?\nExplainee: Somewhere in their travel process.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: I see.\nExplainer: I'm curious, has our conversation sort of changed your view or sort of taught you new things about the internet?\n","256":"Explainer: Cool. What do you think of when you hear the words quantum sensing?\nExplainee: I think that using some sort of quantum computing to sense some quantum level molecules or particles, like interactions and stuff, maybe.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Okay.\nExplainer: We believe quantum mechanics tells us what the true laws of physics are, and so a quantum sensor, in that sense, would reach the limits of what's attainable.\n","257":"Explainer: It would be the top tier.\nExplainee: What are you doing? Like, what are you studying?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Okay.\nExplainer: Which is a really nice platform because the spins show their quantum properties, even at room temperature.\n","258":"Explainer: Which is a really nice platform because the spins show their quantum properties, even at room temperature.\nExplainee: So, are you studying the spins of the electrons?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: So you mentioned the diamonds that are used to create the sensors.\nExplainer: Right.\n","259":"Explainer: So that's in some ways the key to both quantum sensing, as well as quantum computing. It's the idea that you can take a system and put it in a superposition of two states. Normally we think of classically a bit can be a zero or a one. So switch is either on or off. Whereas in a quantum system, it can be in what's called a superposition. So it can be partially on and partially off. But one of the challenges with quantum systems is that these superpositions are really hard to maintain because we don't see superpositions in the world around us. In quantum computing, you try really hard to isolate everything so that you can maintain this quantum property and the fact that it's actually going to lose its quantum properties as it interacts with the world also makes it a great sensor because now you're actually, you're using that fact that it's interacting with the world to say, wait, it's sensing something.\nExplainee: Okay, so it's like using like, the quantum computer would be kind of like the base level and then like you take it out into the world and see how like it differs?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: How does entanglement work into it?\nExplainer: So entanglement is the idea that two particles are correlated. They're essentially in the same quantum state, so that you can't disturb one particle without disturbing the second particle. And so, if I have a large number of quantum sensors that are entangled, then they're all going to interact much more strongly than if I just had one of them interact at a time.\n","260":"Explainer: So rather than trying to build a lot of complex algorithms and gates with it, what you do is, you take these quantum bits and you take them out into the world and say, what do you see? What are you sensitive to? So you can use an idea called entanglement to make an even more sensitive quantum sensor, but it's even more fragile. So there's always this trade-off between being super fragile and being super sensitive at the same time.\nExplainee: How does entanglement work into it?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Okay.\nExplainer: And so that gives you a boost in sensitivity when you have an entangled\n","261":"Explainer: In some ways, it is and you know, atomic clocks are remarkable devices and being able to measure time that precisely has really important consequences. In fact, our old GPS system is based on the accuracy of atomic clocks. They're a set of satellites, each of which has an atomic clock on board and they send out a timestamp and so, once it gets a signal from three different satellites, it can triangulate and figure out exactly where you are. Now, if you could make those clocks even more precise, you could actually accurately position where you are even more accurately.\nExplainee: Okay, that's really cool.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","262":"Explainer: So you're a student in high school, is that right?\nExplainee: Yes, I'm a sophomore.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: How does like all of the networks in my house connect to all the city networks?\nExplainer: Wow. Great question. Often, it's a little blue wire called an ethernet cable. So that cable is able to bring bits of information up into your apartment at say, a billion bits per second. That's pretty fast, right? Literally a wire that goes between a box in your apartment, sometimes called a router or a modem in your apartment that comes from an internet service provider come into this first network and then that network connects to another network connects to another network connects to another network.\n","263":"Explainer: Well, we're gonna be talking about computers here today, and we're gonna be talking about the internet. I always like to think of the internet by analogy to say road systems for example, where you have roads in your neighborhood. You have state roads, you have the Interstate Highway System. And so the internet is a lot like that. It's an interconnection of local roads, local networks like the network in your house for example.\nExplainee: How does like all of the networks in my house connect to all the city networks?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: You could FaceTime somebody who's like in Australia. You can talk to them at the same time, and like you're reaching the same signals. So how is it that it gets there so fast?\nExplainer: We could talk about that by analogy to a road system. It's not just one big, super highway. It's a lot of smaller super highways that are all interconnected. And those interchanges are what are called routers. That's where the links come together. You're talking about talking to a friend in Australia. So oh, it's coming in from the East Coast of the United States to this router, and it's going out say, that routers in San Francisco, it's going out on an underseas cable over to Australia rather than in this direction up to Japan.\n","264":"Explainer: Wow.

And if you just play it, it just knows what to play. Like they're all in one spot.\nExplainer: Ah, you said they're all in one spot. In fact, they're in lots of spots in Netflix. And so most applications would like to connect you with a server that's close to you.

Functions are one of the most fundamental concepts in mathematics, but they aren't always so clearly defined. What would you say a function is?\nExplainee: I would say a function is a procedure that takes an input and does some operation and returns an output.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: How can you compare something that is endless?\nExplainer: Today we're gonna think about infinity as a cardinality, which is a technical term for a number that could be a size of a set. And we're gonna use this idea of one-to-one correspondence to try and investigate the question of whether all infinite sets have the same size. So what I've drawn here are some pictures of some of the infinite sets that appear in mathematics. So the natural numbers are the prototypical example of an infinite set. So the natural numbers are clearly a subset of the integers. Both of these are infinite sets. Are they the same size infinity or different size infinities?\n","268":"Explainer: That's the computer science brain thinking right there. So we wanna think of a function as procedure or mapping between sets. So a function defines a one-to-one correspondence if it defines a perfect matching between the elements of its domain set and the elements of its output set. We call such functions bijections or isomorphisms. So the reason I'm so interested in this idea of a bijective function or a one-to-one correspondence that guarantees that every element of one set gets matched with an element of the other set, no matter how many elements there are, these bijections or these one-to-one correspondences as they help mathematicians reason about infinity.\nExplainee: How can you compare something that is endless?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Yes, the integers would, there'd be more integers than natural numbers.\nExplainer: I'm gonna now try and convince you that they are in fact the same size infinity. And this is using this idea of a one-to-one correspondence which was applied in this context by Georg Cantor. What he says is if we can match up the elements of the integers with the elements of the natural numbers so that there's nothing left over, so that there's a bijective function between them, then that's a proof that there's exactly as many natural numbers as there are integers. Start by matching zero with zero and one with one. But then we wanna include the negatives in the list. So which natural number would we match with negative one?\n","269":"Explainer: Today we're gonna think about infinity as a cardinality, which is a technical term for a number that could be a size of a set.

I would imagine there might be some bijective function for mapping natural numbers to rational numbers.\nExplainer: So I'm going to use this picture to count the rational numbers by actually counting the elements of this larger set because it'll be clearer geometrically. What I've drawn in this picture is the integer lattice. So Z cross Z refers to the set of all of these dots. So I'll start by counting the number at the origin, and you can see I'm just labeling the dots around the origin, moving in a counterclockwise fashion and getting progressively further away. And this process could continue, but maybe by now you see the pattern, though it'd be a little bit difficult to describe as a function.\n","271":"Explainer: Great. So now I have a much harder question. So we have the same challenge, again, evidently there are way, way, way more rational numbers than there are integers. Does that mean this is a larger infinite set than the integers? What do you think?\nExplainee: By intuition I would say yes, but that was the same case with the integers. I would imagine there might be some bijective function for mapping natural numbers to rational numbers.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Oh is it for each rational number, there's a pair of integers that represent that rational number?\nExplainer: Yeah, that's exactly right. And now for each pair of integers, I'm gonna represent it by a corresponding natural number. That's what's going on with this counting.

Why is that?\n","274":"Explainer: Great. That's exactly right. So what we've proven is that this number is missing, and therefore it is impossible to define a bijection between the natural numbers and the real numbers.\nExplainee: Oh wow.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: I was wondering what the kind of practical implications are, what you can do with this sort of knowledge.\nExplainer: Really glad you asked me that. There's a practical implication for computer science. Alan Turing, he came up with a mathematical model of a computer, something called a Turing machine. So Turing was wondering is it possible to compute every real number, an arbitrary real number to within arbitrary precision in finite time? He defined a real number to be computable< if you could calculate its value, maybe not exactly, but as accurately as you'd like in a finite amount of time. And because there are uncountably infinitely many real numbers, but only a countably infinitely many Turing machines, what that means is that the vast majority of real numbers are uncomputable.

Normally we think okay, well if you have two lines like this, you'd keep drawing them, they intersect right here.

Infinity is like this perfect concept for what we can add to a space that allows lines to have this more uniform property.

Have you heard a lot in your studies about these super massive black holes that we think lurk in the centers of very nearly every galaxy?\nExplainee: So, I think the prevailing wisdom for a while was no, but my answer honestly is I'm not sure.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: So I don't study AGN a lot, but I do have a long term interest in black holes, it's one of the reasons I entered the field. I always was curious about how a black hole of that size was able to form. Was it the result of mergers between smaller black holes, ultimately creating gravitational well deep enough to contract a protogenic disc for a whole galaxy? Or, man, what happened?\nExplainer: Yeah, I think that's right. I think people are really perplexed about how you make something so big in such a short period of time. It's kind of funny, the bigger you make a black hole, it seems maybe counterintuitive, but the less dense the material has to be out of which you make it. So you can, out of something the density almost of air, you can make a supermassive black hole. You can't make a star out of that, but weirdly, if you skip the star phase altogether, it's conceivable that they directly collapse. And so there's suddenly a new way to make black holes that nature has figured out.\n","288":"Explainer: Yeah, I think it's a really good question. The only mechanism that we know for sure can form black holes is to collapse of very massive stars. So it's sensible to think, well maybe some very massive stars in a young universe collapsed under their own weight and then they merged and after some time they got big enough, but the black holes from stars can be tens of times the mass of the sun, maybe hundreds of times to the mass of the sun if they merge. To get to millions and billions, and if you just do the simple arithmetic of how many years that would take, there aren't enough years in the 14 billion years of the universe's lifetime. So they must have come from somewhere else.\nExplainee: So I don't study AGN a lot, but I do have a long term interest in black holes, it's one of the reasons I entered the field.

So a black hole that can take, like a giant magnet, astronomical magnet in the form of another collapsed star, like a neutron star, and flip it around so fast, near the speed of light, that it actually creates an electronic circuit out of this moving magnet. And so that the power that can come out of these electronic circuits created by these batteries can be tremendous.\nExplainee: They're kind of misunderstood giants in a way.

And after our discussion, what is it that has changed for you in your perspective or what is it that excites you?\n","291":"Explainer: i have colleagues here that tell me it can take up to weeks to train certain neural networks right\nExplainee: Certainly, depending on the complexity of your model then computational speed is one thing.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Sure, yeah.\nExplainer: if you think about even just classical information like bits right at the end of the day when you store a bit in your hard drive there's a magnetic domain and you have a magnetic polarization right\n","292":"Explainer: if you think about even just classical information like bits right at the end of the day when you store a bit in your hard drive there's a magnetic domain and you have a magnetic polarization right\nExplainee: So in a classical computer, you know, you have all sorts of logical gates that perform operations and they change an input to some sort of output but I guess it's not immediately obvious how you do that with quantum computers.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Sure.\nExplainer: so what we do when we try to solve problems with a quantum computer is we encode parts of the problem we're trying to solve into a complex quantum state and then we manipulate that state to drive it towards what will eventually represent the solution \n","293":"Explainer: yeah that's a really good question this actually is a model of the inside of one of our quantum computers\nExplainee: So how do we actually encode it to start with?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Okay.\nExplainer: yes exactly also through microwave signals\n","294":"Explainer: yeah they also unfortunately require fault tolerance right now the algorithms that we know of today to do those things um on a quantum computer require you to have millions of error-corrected qubits today we're at like 50. it's actually amazing that we're at 50. there's things that we know or we have strong reason to believe um are going to be faster to do on a quantum computer and then there's things that we'll discover just by virtue of having one\nExplainee: Yeah certainly having a search algorithm is very useful. Factoring, those are definitely useful things that I would imagine could be done a lot faster on a quantum computer.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Sure, how could someone like me who's a grad student, get involved in this or what kinds of challenges are you facing that someone like me could help out with?\n","295":"Explainer: What are some of the challenges that you've run into when trying to work with robots and do these tasks?\nExplainee: So, I was really interested in the problem of scooping peas on a plate. They're relatively homogenous, but when it came to more complex foods, like broccoli, or deformable foods, like tofu, that can crumble, that gets a lot more complex to simulate.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Right.\nExplainer: What algorithms do you think are most promising for handling non-rigid deformable objects and the other things you've been looking at?\n","296":"Explainer: Have you heard of fractals before?\nExplainee: No, absolutely not.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Yes.\nExplainer: Right? So actually fractals are in some way fractions, but for shapes. Have you ever seen a movie called Moana?\n","297":"Explainer: On a computer if you wanna learn to draw fractals, then you might need to learn a little bit about programming. [Keenan] Programming. Yeah.\nExplainee:  Programming.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Like coding.\nExplainer: Definitely that is totally what fractals are all about.\n","298":"Explainer: So hey, Jen, it's great to see you again.\nExplainee: Good to see you, Jim.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Yeah, and when we were at AT&T, the thing we found most frustrating is AT&T would buy routers, and they would come pre-baked with a set of protocols instead of knobs that you could turn if you wanted to influence how the traffic flowed, and a set of dials you could read to understand what was going on inside the network.\nExplainer: Right, you couldn't directly do what you wanted to.\n","299":"Explainer: Yeah, do you see the softwarization of the internet as a whole happening?\nExplainee: So, so far, it hasn't very much. I mean, basically, software-defined networking exists, let's say within a single provider backbone, or a single cloud provider's network or a single campus. There's been some work on doing it at the juncture points between a pair of networks. But one other trend that's happening that makes it more possible is it used to be that to get from one end to the internet to the other, you have access networks getting much closer to, say Google or Microsoft or other large cloud providers, where even, you might only go through two networks\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Right, exactly. And if you take that even further, they're starting to be more edge computing where you might imagine you might have a cell tower connected to a small number of routers, connected directly to a server that's gonna be running the application. In that case, the entire infrastructure might be controlled by a single party.\nExplainer: It's totally fascinating to me that we have such an important global infrastructure, and yet, the laws that that govern it tend to be very, very local.\n","300":"Explainer: So you can infer or guess a lot of things.\nExplainee: Exactly.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Yeah, I'm excited about the convergence of wireless communications, cellular networks, Wi-Fi with networking and cloud computing. And in particular, we're seeing in edge computing, a convergence of all three. Where you might have a mobile phone or a drone or some other kind of device connecting over the wireless medium directly to a network that connects you directly to the server that might run your application.\nExplainer: So you want the computation close to where the endpoint is.\n","301":"Explainer: So you want the computation close to where the endpoint is.\nExplainee: Exactly, and I think that what's now exciting about that is all three of these technologies, wireless, networking and cloud, which are normally three different communities, three different sets of technologies, three different sets of standards or practices, now have to work together in close harmony to be able to service applications that are really critical and that that might be interacting with the physical world in ways where safety is a potential concern.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: I agree. It's both the high bandwidth, it's the low delay so that you can have these applications that interact with the physical world and need answers in real-time. It's about having the compute really close so that you can integrate computation and communication. It's about having more coverage.\nExplainer: Coming back again to the softwarization. SDN and softwarization is a maybe a little bit behind the covers, that you wouldn't normally see it as a user going from 3G to 4G to 5G. You just see an increase in speed. But yet, the way the network is now being managed again, I think is bringing the cellular networking world sort of into the internet world in terms of the softwarization-\n","302":"Explainer: So that's a great definition and I wanna pick that apart a little bit. So what you described is just right. Stars, when they run out of thermonuclear fuel are gonna collapse under their own weight. It'll explode in a supernova, it'll leave a core, and if the core itself is heavy enough, it will keep collapsing. It does, as you say, reach this point where not even light can escape. But the amazing thing is it leaves that point, you called it rightly the event horizon, it leaves it behind kind of like an archeological record because the start itself can no more sit at the event horizon than it can race outward at the speed of light. So the core of the star keeps collapsing and where it goes nobody knows. So in a weird way, the black hole isn't anymore a crush of matter. It left it behind in its wake, but the stuff of the star is gone.\nExplainee: So it's a star that has collapsed. It has so much concentrated mass and gravity that there's a point outside of the black hole called the event horizon. So once you get past the event horizon, nothing, not even light can escape from that.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: I've heard of Schwarzschild black holes, which is a black hole that is static, a Kerr black hole or a Kerr-Newman black hole, which is a black hole that rotates, but what makes a black hole static versus rotating? And what's more common?\nExplainer: So from the outside, if you're an astronaut, you're watching your friend, another astronaut going into the black hole, it's as though your times become rotated relative to each other. So the profound thing is as an astronaut on the outside, looking at this round event horizon, you think of the center of black hole as a point in space, but to the person who's fallen in, it's not a point in space at all, it's a point in time. The singularity, or the end of it all, the crush in the center of a black hole is in their future. So they can no more avoid the singularity than you can avoid the next instant of time coming. So the death in the singularity is inevitable. Although we don't really think the singularity necessarily exists.\n","303":"Explainer: It turns out that there are only three quantities that define a black hole, its electric charge, its mass, and its spin. So the most general black hole can also spin and it can also be electrically charged. Whether or not they are has to do with how they formed. If a star collapses, it will likely be spinning when it collapses and the remnant black hole that formsbwill likely be spinning. A black hole of a certain mass, charge, and spin is indistinguishable from any other black hole with those same properties. So in some sense, they're like fundamental particles, which makes them absolutely exceptional for any other astrophysical object. Have you heard the stories about what happens inside a black hole?\nExplainee: I've heard of Schwarzschild black holes, which is a black hole that is static, a Kerr black hole or a Kerr-Newman black hole, which is a black hole that rotates, but what makes a black hole static versus rotating? And what's more common?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: I remember that once you pass the event horizon space becomes time and time becomes space, in like, a coordinate sense.\nExplainer: So the singularity is definitely predicted in Einstein's general theory of relativity and that's purely a theory of spacetime. And in the theory of spacetime, there is no question that a singularity would form when the star collapses catastrophically inside the black hole. Now, even when people talked about singularities back in the '60s, they thought, you know, quantum mechanics is part of the story of the whole of physics. It's not just gravity. And if we understand quantum gravity we'll realize that singularity probably doesn't ever actually form.\n","304":"Explainer: I would say to some extent we don't know for sure. What we have found is that the mathematics is so unbelievably powerful that we're able to disprove wrong ideas just in pen and paper. Just very recently, within the past couple of years, the first ever human-procured image of a black hole showed us what we expected to see of the event horizon. So Jayda, after our conversation today, what would you say a black hole is?\nExplainee: So since we obviously have never been to a black hole, how do we know for sure, like, what happens after you cross the event horizon or what happens inside a black hole? Is it just like, inferred from the math?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Something that I had never thought of before is a black hole as kind of a type of quantum fundamental particle. I've also learned how event horizon of a black hole kind of hides a singularity.\nExplainee: Awesome!\n","305":"Explainer: Talk us through Hawking's initial revolution that led to a lot of these conversations about the information around black holes.\nExplainee: Hawking's big insight was that he had to apply both the rules of quantum mechanics and the rules of gravity to really understand how black holes behaved. But Hawking took a point of view where he brought quantum mechanics into the game. He really that if you took that into account, that it's actually not quite true that black holes are black, that actually things can escape from black holes.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: A way to think about Hawking radiation is to imagine that pairs of particles and antiparticles appear out of the quantum vacuum and the particle can escape the black hole, but the antiparticle falls in. But the particle and antiparticle are a pair and if the antiparticle really falls into the black hole and is destroyed at the singularity, that poor particle outside the black hole has lost his partner. It also violates the rules of quantum mechanics. If you have two particles that are entangled, that has to be preserved.\nExplainer: Now, to be clear, nobody disputes that black holes will quantum radiate, that Hawking radiation is a solid prediction. The black holes should in fact evaporate, that's not disputed, right?\n","306":"Explainer: There's this domain of black holes in astrophysics where we see stars collapse, and we know that they exist and there's whole observational astronomy around them. And then there's this domain that we're talking about, where, as you said, black holes are so special because they're kind of guiding us in the right direction to understand the very nature of reality. And that makes them really unusually special. And one of the things I wanted to draw out is that we talk about the fundamental forces of nature. So there's the matter forces, and then the outlier is gravity. We've quantized all the matter forces in a way that we're rather comfortable with. Gravity keeps resisting quantization of gravity itself. And now we're thinking in a way that you're describing that, well, maybe it's only the quantum forces altogether.\nExplainee: The pursuit of quantum gravity has taken us to places we never expected to be. I think what's exciting about physics, about theoretical physics, that you start following a thread, you start developing a chain of logic, and you never know where it's gonna end up.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: It's a real challenge, but astronomical observations have gotten so fantastically precise. And there is some hope that if you looked at things like two black holes merging, each black hole comes in with its own event horizon, but then when the black holes merge, there's a very complicated process where these two event horizons merge and oscillate and vibrate, and then settle down into a single event horizon for the final black hole. There is some hope that if we can make sufficiently detailed observations of this process, if we could really see the way the event horizon is behaving as it settles down to this final state, that maybe that could reveal some of these quantum effects that we've been talking about.\nExplainer: It is amazing in the numerical simulations of two black holes merging, you really see the event horizons bobble around. And we were talking earlier about how really black holes are flawless, they don't tolerate those kinds of imperfections. And so you can so quickly watch the system wring away that misshapen merger. And it comes out in the gravitational waves, which is literally the ripples in the shape of spacetime until it settles down, and then it's utterly flawless again. It really happens fast. It's quite amazing.\n","307":"Explainer: Do you think there's ever a hope that the kind of information that you think about, the quantum gravity aspects of the universe that you think about, whether it will pan out or not, will ever be viably observed in these astronomical pursuits of the event horizon?\nExplainee: It's a real challenge, but astronomical observations have gotten so fantastically precise. And there is some hope that if you looked at things like two black holes merging, each black hole comes in with its own event horizon, but then when the black holes merge, there's a very complicated process where these two event horizons merge and oscillate and vibrate, and then settle down into a single event horizon for the final black hole. There is some hope that if we can make sufficiently detailed observations of this process, if we could really see the way the event horizon is behaving as it settles down to this final state, that maybe that could reveal some of these quantum effects that we've been talking about.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Yeah, it's a spectacular process.\n","308":"Explainer: That's near and dear to my heart. Multi-party computations.\nExplainee: Obviously, zero-knowledge proofs are about proving things to another person without revealing the details of what it is that you're proving. But, you know, in my mind, zero-knowledge actually goes even further beyond that. It's like this overarching concept that you can see a lot in multi-party computation, where you wanna accomplish some sort of task without revealing anything more than exactly what you need to accomplish that task.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Yeah, so my first encounter with NP-completeness was in my very first algorithms class that I took as an undergraduate. So that was my first introduction. Is that an NP-complete language is this amazing problem that not only tells you about itself, but solving this problem can actually tell you about an entire class of really interesting problems.\nExplainer: When you first start to think about proofs as an interactive game where we're talking to each other, did that make zero-knowledge possible?\n","309":"Explainer: Indeed.\nExplainee: But once you flip that on its head and you're no longer trying to do that, suddenly all of the bad properties of randomness become good.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: In my experience, usually the hardest part is figuring out exactly where the best place is to use it. I've written some papers in the past that have used zero-knowledge in a more theoretical way. But when it comes to applications, some of the most exciting applications that I've seen so far have been in the blockchain space.\nExplainer: So what are some of the efficiency bottlenecks that you find?\n","310":"Explainer: What do you know about memory?\nExplainee: I know when you see something you could like kind of like picture it, like in your head you can imagine it. I remember yesterday I got like orange juice, but let's say like a year or two, you might think like, oh, that day I got water.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Let's say you grew up in a place that the orange juice is just meh, and then you go on vacation going somewhere and then it might change how you feel about orange juice.\nExplainer: Sometimes, you know, memory is doing something much simpler but no less important for us, which is it's helping us figure out what's good and what's bad. And if we can remember what's good and what's bad from what we did in the past, that can help us make decisions about what to do next time. So Dylan, you may be surprised to learn this, but we asked your mom what some of your favorite candies are. So you have to make a decision between these two candies and whichever one you pick, you actually get to take with you.\n","311":"Explainer: Sometimes, you know, memory is doing something much simpler but no less important for us, which is it's helping us figure out what's good and what's bad.

And you don't know.\nExplainer: Everything you just said is exactly what we know from research. All the thoughts running through your mind, were really at kind of about a prediction into the future, right? You're like, how, how will this taste if, when it's in my mouth or how will I feel about my decision down the road? You know we think of memory as something in the past, but it's an example of how you use your memories of these two candies to predict what's gonna happen in the future so that you can make a decision in the present. But you did it, you made your way through that torture. And now you've got to keep the candy.\n","312":"Explainer: What's your conception about what the internet is?\nExplainee: The internet? For me, it's just something to use when I need like to search up something or watch videos.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Yeah, I have no idea.\nExplainer: Got a favorite movie?\n","313":"Explainer: Got a favorite movie?\nExplainee: Matilda.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Yeah.\nExplainer: Let's say we want to get a video from here, over to here. How do you think that video would sort of travel through this network?\n","314":"Explainer: Let's say we want to get a video from here, over to here. How do you think that video would sort of travel through this network?\nExplainee: Maybe it could go to here, to here, to here, to here.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Huh, but wouldn't it just be easier for it to go from here to here, instead of going from here to here, to here to here?\nExplainer: Yeah. So that's a really good observation. In most pieces of the internet, that's exactly what would happen. We want to take what's called a shortest path. But still, there are multiple paths. And why do you think that might be valuable?\n","315":"Explainer: That's right. So that's pretty cool. There are actually lots of different ways to actually go through the internet to get from what we call a source, the place that's sending the information, to the receiver, the place that's actually gathering the information together. And that's something we actually call routing.\nExplainee: Huh, but wouldn't it just be easier for it to go from here to here, instead of going from here to here, to here to here?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Maybe one way is messed up or broken. So you go the other way.\nExplainer: Exactly. So, Skylar, that was a great discussion about what we just built. And I wanted to talk to you about, or ask you about maybe one other really important part about networks. And it's not so much the thing itself, the physical thing, but more about the rules about communication. That's governed by something that are called protocols. Are you up for one?\n","316":"Explainer: Yeah. So that's a really good observation. In most pieces of the internet, that's exactly what would happen. We want to take what's called a shortest path.

There's one internet and lots and lots and lots of things that you can do on top of it.\n","318":"Explainer: It's really interesting. And I think it also really speaks to the kind of pervasive and circular role of memory, right? Because the maps are dependent on memories, they're built from memories and experiences. So there's this kind of dialogue with memory creating maps, maps creating experiences, experiences creating memories, affecting the maps, and really makes me think even of a question a friend asked me recently about moods and mental health and this feeling of like how do some people get kind of trapped in a state of mind where all they can see is a particular way forward. But then something happens in the world that shifts them to another model.\nExplainee: Which is actually really interesting because you can make different maps in different physical spaces too, right? As you walk into a new room you make a new map of that room. So what are the doorways basically for mental models? And I think that often we sort of fall into this pattern of, of thinking about memory as, as always additive, that we always just keep gathering more information and update what we currently have. We don't as often speak about deleting pieces of information or, or perceptions or something that we thought was a, was a useful fact but actually it's not a fact.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Right.\nExplainer: Getting way out there, but, but it is a way in which if you have the right model, it should be an efficient one. I'm wondering what you, what you think about what all this means for kind of a redefinition of what memory is, in many ways a revision or expansion of that notion. Would you be willing to try to help me think about how to define it?\n","319":"Explainer: Memories as models or models first and memory as part of what helps build the model starts generating new predictions. Exactly the kind you just brought up or other ways of thinking about things because an efficient model needs to let go of information, right? I just heard a colleague of mine joking about the fact that the principles of neuroscience textbook keeps growing and growing. And that if we had enough strength in theoretical neuroscience, if our models of neuroscience were good enough, that book should shrink back. We know that memory retrieval is essentially construction. And so you don't need to store all those separate memories. You need to construct them. But if you have a good model, let go of all those details and just construct them to feel as if it's a memory. But really all you're doing is using the model to fill the details. It's kind of like the matrix, you know.\nExplainee: Right.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: I think it's information certainly that, that is stored in the brain and that can then affect our behavior. I think getting your behavior in there somewhere seems, seems important. But also is it just a record of the past or is it, you know, our perceptions of, of what happened in the past, or how we've changed how we think about that past event or have we deleted that event completely and then gathered this higher level structure or mental model that then allows us to behave differently in the future? So it's more alive, it's more changing. It's more, I think it's bubbling out and gathering, gathering and growing and becoming more flexible, but it's also sort of bubbling in, in the sense of deleting and removing and forgetting. So yes, I think that what we need to add perhaps is that changeability and perhaps the behavioral relevance of that changeability. I don't know, what do you think?\nExplainer: I agree. I think, you know, as you were speaking I was thinking maybe the most important word to replace there is record. Record implies an etching of something as it was. And maybe what we need instead is that it's a model, it's an approximation, it's an abstraction that can help us create the illusion of constructing your record. But that it's the model that's the important thing that drives the whole thing.\n","320":"Explainer: Okay, you wanna do the demo for me? So the LIGO instrument electronically records the ringing of the shape of space with its very complicated instrument. It stands for Laser Interferometric Gravitational-Waves Observatory and the design was incredibly difficult and they didn't know if they would succeed. I think of the instrument as like the body of the electric guitar. And then they take the readout of the motions of the waves that they're recording, just like that guitar is recording the motions of the waves on the string. Now just play it like a little bit. And you can't hear anything, right? You're not meant to hear an electric guitar when it's not plugged in. What's happening is the guitar strings are ringing, but so quietly that we can't actually hear the sound. And this is like the gravitational waves, which are ringing the drum of spacetime, but so quietly that they're not move the air and we're not hearing them. So now play and I'm gonna turn the volume up a little bit. While I can't actually hear the ringing of the strings themselves, I can hear the data of the shape of the string recorded and played through this amplifier. And that's kind of the idea behind the LIGO instrument.\nExplainee: How do you know that it's like the black hole that's making this sound and nothing else?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Is there anything that like gets affected on Earth because of those waves?\nExplainer: It's a really good question. Only this instrument, and that's why it was so hard to build. And by the time it gets here, it's so weak that it's only squeezing and stretching space at like the fraction of a nucleus over very large distances. Has your understanding of black holes changed over the course of our conversation?\n","321":"Explainer: I think it's interesting. And also a huge challenge. I think that it's interesting that if a person sees a robot doing something that seems very capable, they assume that the robot can do all sorts of other capable things. It's a huge challenge, because that's actually not the case.\nExplainee: When we think about babies on their social cognition, we actually start from the idea that they have a notion of what an agent is. An agent is something that's self-propelled, that has its own internal states, like goals and beliefs. And so, it's very natural to imagine that when you see a seemingly, they call it propulsive, action by a robot, you're thinking, 'Hey, this thing has a desire. It has a goal. It's accomplishing it with its. So what if I give it a different goal? Why couldn't it do that?' They call it promiscuous generalization about agents, right? I think that the electrical outlet looks like a face. I think that my computer's mad at me. And so I think it, the challenge actually is to stop people from doing that, and to recognize limitations where there are some. Or we bring to bear our knowledge, sometimes incredibly quickly, to parse an uncertain image. So our experiences go all the way down to our very first impressions of the sensory signal.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: I guess I like to think about this hierarchical cascade, where, at first, vision starts with the sensory signal and parses it into gradually more complex units. I think it does make sense to talk about lower level, meaning closer to sensation and perception and action, and higher level meaning more deliberative, more mediated by memory and language and judgment.\nExplainer: That notion of hierarchy is really interesting, because it is these higher level things, like playing chess, for example, that are easier for AI systems. And the reason why they're easier is that we're providing the abstraction for the system already, then when we give the game of chess to an AI system, we abstract away all the challenges of like picking up pieces and moving them, and we say, 'Okay, there's this board of however many boxes on it.' And you just need to figure out within that very narrow, small world, what to do. But handling and learning what those abstractions should be and handling everything from low level sensory inputs to that higher level processing is really, really hard.\n","322":"Explainer: I like that description, because it conveys how much complexity there is to these really basic tasks that we're doing. Is there a definition for the simple tasks that we do versus things that are more complex, like playing chess?\nExplainee: I guess I like to think about this hierarchical cascade, where, at first, vision starts with the sensory signal and parses it into gradually more complex units. I think it does make sense to talk about lower level, meaning closer to sensation and perception and action, and higher level meaning more deliberative, more mediated by memory and language and judgment.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Our impression that it's purely discrete and symbolic might be, just that might be an impression, because we talk about it in a language. And actually, the fact that it's connected up to all these perception and sensation and action systems means that it's probably grounded in a more continuous set of representations. I wonder, is there gonna be a point where what you really want to know is what are the experiences that a human has? [indistinct] human speech own project. His idea was, 'Well, I need the exact data that my son gets in order to train my robot to be like my son.' Or do you think that we're gonna end up in a world that's more like the large language models and that'll have to do?\nExplainer: I suspect that we'll start by doing whatever is most convenient, 'cause that's whatever we can get. But I think that for robots to be capable alongside humans, in a world with humans, I think that we may need to actually use human experience, human learning, to inform how robots learn, if we want them to follow the same kind of mistake pattern as humans, so that humans can interpret robots, and humans can understand what robots will and will not do.\n","323":"Explainer: That notion of hierarchy is really interesting, because it is these higher level things, like playing chess, for example, that are easier for AI systems. And the reason why they're easier is that we're providing the abstraction for the system already, then when we give the game of chess to an AI system, we abstract away all the challenges of like picking up pieces and moving them, and we say, 'Okay, there's this board of however many boxes on it.' And you just need to figure out within that very narrow, small world, what to do. But handling and learning what those abstractions should be and handling everything from low level sensory inputs to that higher level processing is really, really hard.\nExplainee: Our impression that it's purely discrete and symbolic might be, just that might be an impression, because we talk about it in a language. And actually, the fact that it's connected up to all these perception and sensation and action systems means that it's probably grounded in a more continuous set of representations. I wonder, is there gonna be a point where what you really want to know is what are the experiences that a human has? [indistinct] human speech own project.

I think this sort of reminds me of another project that I'm doing. It's fairly easy to get different participants to experience consistent negative emotions to the same stimuli, but with positive emotions it's so much harder to study. I might not react the same to like this like cute cat video than someone else. And I definitely believe that people's memory that they're bringing up unconsciously when they're experiencing something to make an emotional judgment informs especially our experience with positive emotion possibly more than negative emotion.\nExplainer: Some of those examples really remind me also some of the questions about kind of abnormalities in, in memory or trauma or disruptions in memory and how they also play out in terms of not just what people remember but what they do with those memories right?\n","325":"Explainer: Right, like it reminds me so much of, you know, what we in the field would refer to as statistical learning. On one hand we might have like a one-shot memory, a memory of something that we saw yesterday, like what we did or what we ate or where we were. But a lot of our memories and our knowledge instead are based on many, many, many experiences.\nExplainee: Oh, absolutely. I think this sort of reminds me of another project that I'm doing.

How does it get updated based on experiences? Why does that sometimes happen and sometimes not? There are actually people who are born without a hippocampus. They have disruptions to episodic memories. They have trouble after this conversation remembering what the conversation was about, but they do have pretty good semantic information. They have a good sense of knowledge about the world. And that's interesting for two reasons. One, it shows this association between the role of the hippocampus and these two forms of memory, episodic memories and semantic memory. The other reason it's interesting is that people often assume that we get to semantic memory through episodic memory, that we encounter one dog and then another dog, and then another dog and then we learned the concept, the semantic notion of a dog. And these people, their profile suggests that you can learn semantic information. You can learn general knowledge about the world, even without ever having the capacity to build those individual memories.\n","326":"Explainer: I think what we're still kind of trying to understand as a field is the more kind of detailed and bigger picture of where does this model live?

And we just sort of have to infer and guess at what strategies that they're doing. Is there's a particular research question that the answer you think is gonna inform the research in your lab and perhaps in the rest of your field?\nExplainer: Each project should be very focused and rigorous and know what a study is designed for. But at the same time we have to keep our minds open, our eyes open for what else is happening. Some of the most interesting discoveries didn't make sense at first.\n","327":"Explainer: Typically you would think that things that are easy for humans, are also easy for robots and computers to do.\nExplainee: Right.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Okay.\nExplainer: So I have a penny in my hand and I'd like you to pick it up with your right hand and put it into your left hand.

Then this is what's called a perception action loop in robotics. So if the object moves, the robot can then adapt what it's doing and change what it's doing to successfully pick up the object. It's really important for robots to be able to leverage, not just like the past hour of experience, but also ideally many years of experience, in order to do the kinds of things that you did.\n","331":"Explainer: So when a robot tries to do something, like pick up an object, not only do you need to program exactly like what the motors should do, the robot also needs to be able to see where the object is.

They know.\nExplainer: That's a great question. So in reinforcement learning, the robot tries the task, and then it gets some sort of reinforcement, some sort of feedback. It's similar to how you might train a dog.\n","332":"Explainer: Yeah. It's really unintuitive. In order to survive, we need to pick up objects and everything. Basically many, many, like billions of years of evolution actually created humans and the ability to manipulate objects like that. So, it actually turns out that things that are really basic for us are actually just really complex tasks in general.\nExplainee: So do robots know, like, they messed up? They know.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Yeah.\nExplainer: So you could give it feedback like that. So it won't necessarily know itself, especially on the first few tries, but it's trying to figure out what the task is even.\n","333":"Explainer: So you could give it feedback like that.

If you program the robot to follow exact motions and follow a very specific program, then it won't go off that program. It will always do those actions. But if something unexpected happens, that the program wasn't designed to handle, then the robot might go off court.\n","334":"Explainer: We give robots a camera and the camera produces this array of numbers. Basically, each pixel has three different numbers, one for R, for G and for B. And so the robot sees this really massive set of numbers. And it has to be able to figure out, from that massive set of numbers, what is in the world. There is a number of different ways to have the robot see, but we use a technique called neural networks, that tries to take out in those big numbers and form representations of the objects in the world, and where those objects are.\nExplainee: Can a robot ever go off the program?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Do you think robots will take over the world? Just being honest.\nExplainer: I think that robotics is really, really hard. Having robots do even really basic stuff, like pick up objects, is really, really hard.

In terms of the impact of amphetamines on sleep quality, it is questionable. While they stimulate the wake system, their prolonged use can affect the sleep-wake cycle, causing sleep problems. Recovering from the stimulating effects of amphetamines can require a period of time, during which the sleep system might naturally compensate for the over-activated wake system.","2":"So, in terms of the impact of amphetamines on the quality of sleep, it's not as straightforward. While they can help promote wakefulness during the day, they can disrupt the normal sleep cycle and overall sleep quality. As for the stages of the sleep cycle that are affected, it's not entirely clear. However, there's evidence to suggest that the REM stage, which is crucial for memory consolidation, can be disrupted by the use of amphetamines. And as for the effects on the sleep cycle, it's possible that it could make it harder for individuals to transition through each of the sleep periods, but more research is needed to definitively establish this.","3":"And while amphetamines indeed push the sleep-wake system towards wakefulness, their effect on sleep quality is less clear. It is important to note that when the body is stimulated to maintain wakefulness for a longer period, the body will eventually demand for sleep. The sleep system, which works as a counterpoint, relies on the VLPO (ventral lateral pre-optic nucleus) to get pushed back to sleep. The VLPO releases inhibitory neurotransmitters (GABA and galanin) that work against the wake promoting neurons. In the context of your cognitive neuro-science training, it is indeed specific and focused in a particular part of the brain, the cerebellum. However, it is also crucial to ensure that participants get a good night's sleep before they come in for the study. The better rested participants are, the more consistent and accurate their responses will be.","4":"It is less clear about which stages of the sleep cycle are affected when one takes amphetamines. As different studies might focus on different aspects of sleep architecture and the effects of amphetamines, it is difficult to generialize the impact on sleep stages.","5":null,"6":"it's not immediately clear how this chord fits in traditional functional harmony, and the lack of a dominant tone could potentially make it sound unresolved.","7":"He said that dissonance is what makes the harmony interesting, and that tension and release form the basis of music harmony.","8":"I've been trying to understand its chord progression and I think it uses a lot of modulation and changing keys.","9":"Now let's listen to this version of Amazing Grace. It will help you understand. The first one is a simple melody with just the vocal, but this second one, there's a piano accompaniment. Here, I'll play the first verse of each for you.","10":"Could you explain why you think it sounds better? Are there specific elements in the harmony that you prefer?","11":"Games that feel really good, they've got that sense of it happening instantly, or in other words, they have low latency.","12":"The more advanced hardware and technology allows for more complex and immersive virtual reality experiences, which were not possible with the hardware constraints of the past. So now, any wild idea someone might have could potentially be turned into a unique and fascinating virtual reality game.","13":"So, with VR, not only can you make games but also more immersive experiences that make you feel like you're really there, not just a passive observer.","14":"For example, if you like Melanie Martinez, a recommendation system could suggest similar artists that you may also enjoy, like Rina Sawayama or Halsey.","15":"It can learn patterns and make predictions, like predicting what music the user might enjoy. This helps companies like Spotify deliver more suitable music, increasing user engagement and satisfaction.","16":"Machines can perform many tasks with great speed and accuracy, such as complex calculations, sorting, and recognizing patterns. However, they lack human capabilities like empathy, creativity, and subjective judgment, which are essential in understanding complex social situations and generating novel ideas. Therefore, while we've come a long way, there are still many things that machines might never be able to do, particularly those that require human-like intuition and emotional intelligence.","17":"Why, a dimension is the way we perceive space or the world around us, usually in three: length, width, and depth, but there are also theories about higher dimensions.","18":"So time is considered as the 4th dimension because if you observe an event in spacetime, you need to specify your position in three dimensions of space and one dimension of time to uniquely identify where and when an event happens","19":"So the question is, in this context, can we travel through the fourth dimension (let's call it Z)? My answer is we can, but our perception is limited. For instance, even while we sleep, we journey through the Z dimension in a sort of 'timeless' manner, although not consciously. However, physically moving through the fourth dimension requires advanced understanding and technology, just like moving through the third dimension requires a vehicle.","20":"So it's like each object or entity in the universe has its own time, which is a function of its motion through the universe's spacetime.","21":"So the faster you move, the more you contract spacetime, making your clock run slower than someone who is stationary when viewed by a distant observer.","22":"Well, in relativity, time dilation occurs when an object is moving at a high velocity relative to an observer. The faster the object moves, the slower time passes for it compared to an observer who is stationary. So, when you 'zoomed out there,' as you said, time passed more slowly for you compared to the person who stayed behind, and that's why your journey seemed to be shorter for you in terms of time spent.","23":"So if you imagine the sheet as a 2D representation of the universe, and the book as a point mass like a planet, then when you drop the book on the sheet, it creates a bend or a curve in the sheet. Similarly, objects like planets create curvature in the 4D universe (spacetime), which causes the phenomenon we call gravity.","24":null,"25":" Major chords are usually perceived as happy or bright, while minor chords create a more somber or melancholic feeling.

The symmetry restoration at low energies allows the dimensions to expand, leading to effective four-dimensional spacetime. This new method could be a novel approach to explain phenomena like the hierarchy problem, potentially without the need for extra Planck-scale physics.","30":"You can think of black branes as black holes in higher dimensions. The key difference is that, unlike black holes, black branes have an extent in all directions, giving them the nickname 'membranes'. They can have different numbers of dimensions, which we denote as P. So, a 5-brane has 5 spatial dimensions, a 3-brane has 3, and so on.","31":"I mean it's one of the things that could have the lowest action among all possible solutions, so I mean it obviously, You know, we know--","32":"In the book, I explain how spacetime can emerge as a result of certain quantum mechanical relationships.","33":"It's a point in space where gravity pulls everything towards it, so strongly that nothing can escape, including light.","34":"But right now, we're not able to achieve that level of detail. So we're working on improving the technology to be able to do that.","35":"What is your understanding of lasers? Are you familiar with the concept, or just the one you work with specifically?","36":"Indeed, short pulsed lasers would be beneficial for your experiment as they can deliver high power in a very short period, thus preventing excessive heating of the sample and making it possible to run the experiment for a longer duration. This is because the laser pulse is rapidly absorbed by the target cell, causing its destruction, while the surrounding cells are unaffected due to the swift removal of the heat source.","37":null,"38":"Please add another object, making sure it is perpendicular to the other three at the same time.","39":"(explainer tries to explain the concept of extra dimensions, like strings or curled up dimensions in higher-dimensional spaces, using simple and relatable examples, to help the explainee grasp the idea of the existence of extra dimensions)","40":"Each point of light you see in the sky is a star, and you draw imaginary lines across these points.

In addition, we also rely on computer simulations and mathematical models to better understand the behavior and properties of black holes.","43":"That's why he wrote about gravity. Gravity is what makes objects fall to the ground, and it's also the force that keeps us on the ground when we walk.

The professor was explaining that they are small clusters of atoms ranging from 2 to 10 nanometers in size.","60":null,"61":"There are several methods to control the diameter of the carbon nanotubes. One of the most common is through chemical vapor deposition (CVD), where you introduce a catalyst to control the growth of the nanotubes. The catalyst, typically a metal like nickel or iron, is placed on a substrate, and a carbon source, such as methane or ethylene, is introduced. The carbon atoms bind with the catalyst atoms and grow into nanotubes, with the diameter being controlled by the size and spacing of the catalyst particles.","62":"Actually, we use quantum dots for lighting applications because they can be tailored to produce specific colors of light due to their size. By adjusting the size of these semiconductor nanocrystals, we can control the wavelength of the emitted light. This is called 'quantum confinement'. This technology is more energy-efficient compared to traditional lighting and it's a promising development for future lighting applications.","63":"This question is just an example for a machine learning task.

Have you considered integrating that research with AI to predict the arrival and impact of those high energy particles? This could potentially improve the fault injection effectiveness and open up new possibilities for hacking.","69":"It's interesting that you mentioned making it more obvious. As for me, I've been lately working on creating a hands-on kit for fault injection, using older logic elements like MUX chips and voltage switchers. The idea is to help people understand the concept better, especially engineers who might not be familiar with these techniques. It's important to educate more people about these areas since they can be new to many. As for the future, I believe there are many unexplored areas in fault injection, and I think we'll continue to see new research and developments in this field.","70":"So I was looking into MEMS microphone vulnerabilities and came across a paper that suggested it might be possible to modulate sound using light. I was highly skeptical, but after some experimentation, I discovered that the photodiodes in MEMS microphones could indeed be affected by laser pulses, causing them to produce unwanted electrical signals that were interpreted as sound by the microphone. This led to the development of the light commands research, a novel method for taking control of light through sound modulation using lasers.","71":null,"72":"It's not easy to have an accurate portrayal of space phenomena in movies since the physics of blackholes and other celestial bodies can be very complex and difficult to understand or portray authentically. However, some movies do try to be as accurate as possible by consulting with experts and using computer simulations to create realistic depictions.","73":"Yes, detecting black holes directly is extremely challenging, but scientists have developed tools like LIGO (Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory) and Virgo to detect gravitational waves, which are ripples in spacetime caused by accelerating massive objects, such as black holes. When these objects merge, they can cause a burst of gravitational waves, which LIGO and Virgo were able to detect. We've been able to confirm the existence of black holes through the gravitational effects they have on nearby matter and the phenomena they create, like accretion disks and jets. So while we can't see black holes, we can infer their presence and study them in various ways.","74":"So, I'd say it's a bit of both. On one hand, the accessibility and democratization of machine learning has led to an explosion of innovative applications and companies.

So, the question then becomes, where does all that matter and energy end up? Is it just lost to the universe, or does it contribute to the black hole's growth in some way?","83":"What happens is that Hawking radiation, which is the result of virtual particle pairs created near the event horizon, causes the black hole to slowly lose mass over time. This radiation can be thought of as being emitted by the black hole, eventually leading to its demise.","84":"Holography indeed has a beautiful analogy with gravity. It suggests that the information about the three-dimensional space-time can be encoded into a lower dimensional surface, following the principle of 'black-hole thermodynamics'. This is called the 'holographic principle', which supports the idea of an extra dimension in the theory of gravity.","85":"It's like saying, is the microscopic quantum description or the macroscopic classical description real? From the holographic description, it suggests that both are perfectly interchangeable, and it's arbitrary to say which one is the fundamental reality.

Instead, it's done in specialized cleanrooms in a process called photolithography. Here's the gist of it: first, a silicon wafer is coated with photoresist, a substance that can be selectively removed by light. Then, a mask \u2013 essentially a stamp \u2013 covering the desired pattern is placed on top. The wafer is exposed to ultraviolet light through the mask, which hardens the photoresist where it's needed and causes it to be removed in other areas. This leaves behind a pattern on the wafer. Then, chemicals are used to etch the wafer, leaving behind the transistors you see in the picture.","101":"And the cryptocurrency or token for that would be securely stored and exchanged through a blockchain.","102":"So, in the context of hacking, you would be trying to find or manipulate more inputs than permitted to gain access to or alter information.","103":"So, are there other devices that can give information to a computer, like sensors or cameras?","104":"Yes, kind of like that. Imagine you're holding a yo-yo with a string, and you're whipping it around really fast. The string is pulling it in all the time, but because you're moving it so fast, it keeps coming back around instead of falling to the ground. The International Space Station is doing something similar; it's moving so fast that even though Earth is pulling it in, it never gets pulled to the surface. So it's being pulled by gravity all the time, it's just that its speed keeps it in orbit.","105":"But you can say that you're moving relative to the train, and the train is stationary.

So, if you and Marina are both seeing the flash of light, then according to your measurement, it's moving away from both of you at 300,000 kilometers per second. But since you can't tell who's moving, it seems like Marina is moving towards the light at that same speed, even though we know that's not possible. This shows that our relative motion is important in how we perceive things moving, similar to being on a train where you don't feel like you're moving even though you are.

Explicit memory, on the other hand, refers to memories that can be deliberately recalled, like remembering a phone number or a specific event.

The answer to this question has been one of the most elusive in mathematics, partly because the mathematics required to prove it is so sophisticated.

Classical white noise, for instance, is a stochastic process where the power spectral density is constant across all frequencies. This can affect the coherence and accuracy of quantum states in our measurement, making it harder to distinguish between different states. Additionally, there's quantum shot noise, which is a fundamental limit due to the discrete nature of particles. In a simple quantum sensor, the number of particles detected will fluctuate, and this can lead to measurement uncertainty, even if the measurement itself is perfect. Lastly, there's thermal noise, caused by the environment at temperature T. It creates fluctuations in the quantum system we're trying to sense, and again, this can introduce uncertainty in our measurements.","240":"That's exciting.

While amphetamines stimulate the wake-promoting system, the effect on sleep quality can vary. A key factor here is the VLPO (ventral lateral pre-optic nucleus), which releases inhibitory neurotransmitters like GABA and galanin to counteract the wake-promoting neurons. In essence, it's a complex interplay between these two systems. In the context of cognitive neuroscience, the focus is on the cerebellum, but it's crucial to ensure that participants get a good night's sleep before participating in the study to ensure consistent and accurate responses.","4":"Taking amphetamines can disrupt the sleep cycle in various ways, but the specific stages of sleep affected are not always consistent across studies, as different studies may focus on different aspects of sleep architecture. However, it is generally agreed that amphetamines can reduce total sleep time, decrease the amount of slow-wave sleep, and increase the amount of REM sleep.","5":"Ah, I see your point. That song, Don't Follow the Crowd, was indeed a product of my experience and introspection. It mirrors the feeling of unexpectedly veering off the established path, much like arriving at a new key in music. The song, just like life, can take us in directions we never foresee, leading to beautiful surprises.","6":null,"7":"Herbie laughs, then says, ''Oh, you're talking about Chris Anderson? Fascinating! He was all about the power of the Tension-Energy-Release (TER) model in music harmony. It really is the backbone of what makes music captivating, don't you think? Interestingly, that concept translates beautifully to content marketing, as well. A well-crafted story should build tension, keep the audience engaged, and then deliver a satisfying resolution - much like a great piece of music.","8":null,"9":"Here, I'll play the first verse of each for your comparison.

Can you elaborate on the specific elements that resonate with you?","11":null,"12":"As hardware and technology advance, they open up new possibilities for creating immersive and complex virtual reality experiences. While older games had limitations due to 8-bit processing, today we can transform those wild ideas into visually stunning and interactive video games.","13":"With VR, not only can we create unique video games, but we also have the ability to craft immersive experiences that make players feel like they're genuinely part of the action, not just passive observers.","14":"For instance, as a fan of Melanie Martinez, a recommendation system could introduce you to other artists that have similar music styles, such as Billie Eilish or Lorde. Would you like to listen to a sample of their music?","15":null,"16":"Machines can handle tasks requiring precision, speed, and pattern recognition quite well. However, their strengths stop at objective analysis. Human abilities like empathy, creativity, and subjective judgment - important for nuanced social interactions and innovative thinking - are yet to be replicated by machines. As a result, while AI has made significant strides, there remain tasks that may remain exclusive to humans, primarily those involving human-like intuition and emotional intelligence.","17":"A dimension can be thought of as our way of perceiving space or the world around us. We typically experience three dimensions: length, width, and depth. However, some theories propose the existence of higher dimensions.","18":"So time is considered as the fourth dimension because if you observe an event in spacetime, you need to specify your position in three dimensions of space and one dimension of time to provide a unique reference point for where and when an event occurs. This concept is useful for describing different events in the universe relative to each other. When I draw spacetime, I'll use X, Y, and Z for spatial dimensions and T for time, where the person is initially located at a unique point in the 4D spacetime diagram as they move through time.","19":null,"20":null,"21":"When you move faster, you contract spacetime, causing your clock to run slower than a stationary observer's. This is due to the metric of spacetime, which implies that the straightest path through spacetime, in terms of time travel, is the longest one.","22":"Well, in relativity, an object moving at high speed experiences time slower than a stationary observer. So, it seems like less time passed for you when you 'zoomed out there,' compared to the person who stayed behind. This difference is due to the phenomenon known as time dilation.","23":"So if you think of the sheet as a 2D representation of the universe, and the book as a point mass like a planet, then when you drop the book on the sheet, it creates a bend or a curve in the sheet. Similarly, objects like planets create curvature in the four-dimensional space-time (spacetime), which causes the phenomenon we know as gravity. This is based on Einstein's idea that gravity is not a force acting on objects, but a manifestation of the curvature of spacetime.","24":"That's a great explanation! I think I'd extend it a bit by using the twin paradox to explain the time dilation effect. When a space traveler moves away from a twin at near the speed of light, time appears to pass more slowly for the traveler. This means that when the astronaut returns, the twin on Earth has aged more. It's amazing how the laws of physics can alter our perception of time!","25":null,"26":"That's a great idea! Let's try incorporating a D7 chord followed by E major. If we do that, we could play the beginning of Amazing Grace together.","27":"Consider it like folding a fabric in extra dimensions. You can create a 'bridge' or 'tunnel', which we refer to as a 'wormhole'. This tunnel allows segments of the extra dimensions to 'link up' within a certain region of space. In essence, it's like compressing or 'twisting' the extra dimensions locally.","28":null,"29":"The central idea of our paper with Matt Johnson and Lisa Randall is a groundbreaking method for compactifying extra dimensions on the fly, dynamically. Picture this: if you had a large sheet of paper and could only roll up a specific area, you'd have a tube. This becomes possible through a symmetry that's initially broken at high energies. It keeps the compactified dimensions confined, expanding again as the symmetry is restored at low energies. This transformation lends itself as a potential answer to the hierarchy problem, potentially eliminating the necessity for Planck-scale physics.","30":"<model-generated> Black branes are essentially black holes in higher dimensions. They're distinct from black holes because, instead of being zero-dimensional points, black branes have an extent in all directions. This is why they are nicknamed 'membranes.' The number of dimensions a black brane has is denoted by P, so a 5-brane has 5 spatial dimensions and a 3-brane has 3 dimensions. <\/model-generated>","31":null,"32":null,"33":"A black hole is where gravity is so intense that nothing, not even light, can escape. It's like the earth's gravity, but incredibly strong. Imagine trying to take a ball from me in the presence of a black hole; it would be pulled towards the black hole instead of coming back to you.","34":"Right now, the technology doesn't allow us to accomplish that level of detail. However, our goal is to advance it, so we can create displays with high detail exactly where you're focusing. By understanding where you're looking, the hardware will focus the detail accordingly, decreasing the overall processing power required. This is a challenging problem we are addressing by studying human eye movements and patterns. Our hope is to eventually create a virtual reality as immersive and lifelike as the real world, but this will take time, and we have a long way to go before we can truly deceive the human senses.","35":"It's interesting that you mention the differences in the application of lasers! To answer your initial question, I am familiar with the general concept of lasers, but I work primarily with a continuous CO2 laser for my specific engineering project. Could you tell me more about the particular use case of delivering power in a very short time? Is this related to something like a pulsed laser? Besides, have you had any experience working with laser tweezers, which employ a process called photothermal or photochemical forces to manipulate micro- or nanoparticles?","36":"A laser pulse could be ideal for your experiment, as it provides a high power in a short time, minimizing the surrounding cells' exposure to heat. This allows you to run the experiment for a longer period without overheating the sample. By using a short pulse, energy will be rapidly absorbed by the target cell, causing its destruction, while the unaffected neighboring cells remain cool.","37":null,"38":"The next step is to imagine another object, positioned such that it is perpendicular to all the three previous ones, creating a 4-dimensional hypercube in your mind.","39":"Let's explore a fascinating concept now: extra dimensions in space, beyond the two dimensions (horizontal and vertical) we can visually perceive. Imagine if you could slide another length or rotate a plane from left to right on your tabletop without moving it forward or backward. That's kind of how extra dimensions might work, just unfamiliar to us. In our search as physicists, we aim to discover these hidden dimensions. Can you think of any possibilities or examples for extra dimensions in a practical, familiar sense?","40":"In essence, these celestial bodies we see in the sky are our stars, and to locate them, we draw lines like a grid over them. These lines, known as Right Ascension and Declination, function similarly to latitude and longitude on Earth, allowing us to pinpoint the exact positions of stars in our sky. The analogy with peels of an orange might be helpful, as both the Earth and sky can be understood as spherical and divided into sections by these lines of reference.","41":"Incredible! The study of black holes involves various space-based observatories such as the Hubble and Spitzer Space Telescopes. Additionally, research teams utilize ground-based observatories like NuSTAR and Chandra. Data collection spans across the electromagnetic spectrum, encompassing X-ray, UV, optical, and infrared observations.","42":null,"43":"That's why he wrote about gravity. Gravity is a force that pulls things towards each other, depending on their mass and the distance between them. In space, astronauts experience weightlessness, which causes their spines to elongate because they're no longer being pushed down by gravity.","44":"That's an interesting question! Yes, if we were in free fall from a plane, we would both hit the ground simultaneously since the force of gravity affects all objects equally. However, due to the different masses of you and a bowling ball, the bowling ball would exert more force when it lands, potentially causing a deeper impact.","45":null,"46":"It's actually fascinating! You're absolutely right that light is one of the key signals for our circadian rhythm. However, it's not the only driver. A fundamental principle for sleep regulation is the S-process, often called the homeostatic sleep drive. It's like a balloon that fills up as we stay awake, and gets emptied out when we sleep. The longer you stay awake, the more sleepy you become. It's akin to a balloon that gets inflated during the day - the longer it stays inflated, the harder it becomes to deflate it, making it harder to nap during the day and affecting the time it takes to feel sleepy again at night. What other factors do you think might influence the duration of sleep for someone in Hoi, given the unique daylight conditions there?","47":"Interestingly, with long days, your body might actually adapt to allow more melatonin to be released during the extended evening hours. However, I recommend taking care to still establish a consistent sleep-wake cycle, as maintaining regular patterns is crucial for overall sleep health. How does the concept of melatonin and its role in sleep seem to you? ","48":"It needs to be focused, so that the light energy is concentrated in a small volume for a sufficient period of time.","49":"The lens focuses the light into a smaller area, creating a more intense beam, which is the principle behind many different types of lasers. When we want to machine with such intense light, we can place a funnel in its path, so if the light was coming down this way, the lens here would focus it into a point, creating a precision tool for several applications.","50":"It gets focused into a small spot.","51":"I see. That certainly calls for a synergetic approach in astronomy. Utilizing multiple wavelength telescopes like NuSTAR as you mentioned will provide a more comprehensive understanding of AGN's spectrum and ultimately help us delve deeper into the mysteries of the cosmos.","52":"In other words, not only can we determine how long someone sleeps for, but we can also observe their sleep patterns and the stages of sleep they go through. We're particularly interested in the amount of non-REM sleep and REM sleep, as each stage has unique functions for the body. Non-REM sleep is further divided into three stages: N-1, N-2, and N-3, with N-3 being the most restorative stage, known as slow wave sleep. We spend 20% of our sleep in slow wave sleep, although this can vary daily.","53":null,"54":null,"55":"Would it be ok to discuss the impact of napping on our brain and sleep patterns?","56":"Indeed, it's fascinating!

A carbon source, like methane or ethylene, is then introduced, which allows carbon atoms to bond with the catalyst atoms and grow into nanotubes. The size of the catalyst particles plays a crucial role in determining the diameter of the nanotubes. By manipulating the catalyst's size and distribution, we can precisely control the growth of these nanotubes.","62":"Actually, quantum dots can be used for lighting applications because they can be tailored to produce specific colors of light. This is known as 'quantum confinement'. By adjusting the size of the semiconductor particles within each dot, we can control the wavelength of light they emit. This is a more energy-efficient technology compared to traditional lighting and it's a promising development for future lighting applications.

This radiation is essentially emitted by the black hole, ultimately contributing to its decay over time.","84":"Holography shares a striking similarity with gravity. It implies that the information about our 3D reality can be captured on a lower-dimensional surface, similar to the concept of 'black hole thermodynamics'. This is the 'holographic principle', a discovery that lends strong support to the hypothesis of extra dimensions in our understanding of gravity. A delightful, holographic twist in the tale of physics!","85":"Indeed, the holographic principle implies a sort of dual description, as if there are two sides to a single coin. On one side, there's no manifested gravity at all, while on the other, a quantum theory of gravity is presented, a somewhat cryptic concept. However, the significance lies in their equivalence - both can be derived from each other, mirroring how different languages can describe the same phenomenon, albeit in distinct ways.","86":"Let's immerse ourselves in the rich flavors of this origani. Shall we brew it together and savor its unique taste?","87":"Intriguing, aren't it? Let's continue the journey of a 400-year-old tradition. Now, let's focus on the magical petal fold\u2014a technique used in many origami designs. This crucial step is the foundation for our crane. Carefully, slide your thumb and forefinger up the middle point, between the wings. You'll feel the skinny point at the edges. Pull it out gently at an angle. Next, spread the wing-like flaps wide. You've just completed your first origami crane! Isn't it astonishing how a simple fold can create such beauty? Now, let's move on to the body and the long, graceful neck.","88":"So now you've made a square. It's going to be the base for our crane. Let's flip it over to the colored side. We'll fold it in half diagonally from corner to corner. Next, we'll fold each corner to the meeting point in the center. After that, we'll fold it in half like a book. Now, find one of the folded corners and lift it up through all layers. You should see a little pocket. Spread the pocket and move all four corners towards each other. The original corners of the square will pop out. You'll feel a nice click when they do - that's one of the best parts!","89":"Did you know that the cootie catcher, also known as a fortune teller, is a versatile origami design, capable of transforming into various shapes, often including a fold-out game?

Think of it as a toolbox for the very small, allowing us to create devices that were once only possible in science fiction. We're at a point now where nanotechnology is shaping the future of technology in significant ways.","97":"You're correct that I built a simple model of a transistor based on standard Lego parts, which can be useful for demonstrating its basic structure. Now, imagine you could reduce the size of this transistor by 50%. This reduction in size would allow you to pack twice as many transistors into the same space on a chip. This is one way we leverage nanotechnology to improve the performance and capacity of computer chips.","98":"You're saying these FinFETs are very thin transistors, right? With fin widths of just 6 nanometers, which is comparable to 25-30 atoms. Could you explain more about where this innovation came from and how FinFETs are revolutionizing the technology industry?","99":"You shrink the wavelength of the light that is used during the lithography process.","100":"The process is called photolithography. A silicon wafer is coated with a substance called photoresist, which hardens in areas exposed to ultraviolet light and can be removed in other areas. A mask or stamp with the desired pattern is placed on the wafer, and light passes through the mask to harden the photoresist in the pattern and leave it exposed. The unhardened photoresist is then removed, and chemicals are used to etch the wafer, leaving behind the transistors you see in the picture.","101":"In a peer-to-peer trade, the digital asset or crypto would be handled securely, and the transaction would be registered on a blockchain to ensure transparency and security. Blockchain technology is a game-changer for virtual trading, and it guarantees the robustness and reliability of transactions.","102":"<model-generated> Computer hacking involves trying to gain unauthorized access or control over a system by exploiting its vulnerabilities, and often manipulating user inputs or finding hidden functionalities.<\/model-generated>","103":"So, what about other sources of information for a computer? For instance, data from sensors, cameras, microphones, or user-supplied inputs like the mouse? Are there any other devices you can think of?","104":"Yes, I'd say it's like that. Imagine having a toy top with a string. You're whipping it around really fast. Even though the string is always pulling it towards you, it keeps spinning instead of falling to the ground because of your fast motion. That's similar to how the International Space Station moves. It's always being pulled towards Earth by gravity, but it's moving so fast that it never gets pulled to the surface and stays in orbit.","105":"But you can say that you're moving relative to the train, and the train is stationary. That's true not just for the train but for all objects in motion: you can always find something that is stationary in relation to it. This phenomenon is known as the relativity of motion, a principle that states that motion is only absolute when it is relative to something else.","106":null,"107":null,"108":"Alright, let's dive in!

Sleep science is kind of a new and exciting field!","110":"Wow, that sounds draining! Sleep deprivation can really hinder one's activities during the daytime. Let's switch gears now. Do you know about sleep patterns in elephants? They've got some unique qualities to their sleep times.","111":"It'd be quite intriguing to possess the ability to sleep underwater like a hippo. Would you find that captivating?","112":"When it comes to sleeping, dolphins have a unique way to ensure they can still breathe. One half of their brain sleeps while the other half remains awake. This way, they can come up to the surface and breathe whenever necessary.","113":"Nanotechnology refers to the manipulation of matter on an extremely small scale - at the nanometer level (a billionth of a meter). For comparison, a baby ant is about 2-3 millimeters in size, which is significantly larger.","114":"Wow, I'm impressed. Not only are baby ants really tiny, but they're a million times bigger than the smallest unit of measurement, a nanometer. Imagine a world where we can observe and manipulate atoms with the help of advanced microscopes. That would be like playing with tiny building blocks to create structures at an atomic scale. Isn't that fascinating?","115":null,"116":"Because studying the tiny things is like piecing together a big puzzle. We can learn so much from them, like what helps plants grow, or how a computer works. Fascinating, right?","117":"Actually, that's an intriguing thought. What if, in the future, our VR experiences could be customized to suit each individual's unique senses and perception \u2013 hearing, sight, and touch? This would enable a more immersive, personalized VR reality that feels remarkably real, rather than a generic one-size-fits-all experience. I've heard of research being conducted into this area, but it would be exciting to see it develop further.","118":"Indeed, the future of spatial audio could lie in the creation of personalized HRTF functions based on each user's unique anatomy, potentially enhancing the audio experience greatly. This could prove to be a significant shift, however, it would necessitate additional investments in data collection and processing.","119":"Of course! Gravity isn't just a simple force pulling us towards the earth, it's a fascinating field that permeates all of space-time. Imagine the elevator example I mentioned earlier, where the cable is cut, and you, along with the elevator, start to fall. Now, if you were to release a ball in this scenario, it would follow a curved path, falling towards the ground at the same rate as you, regardless of your starting position within the elevator. This curvature of space-time is due to the presence of massive objects like Earth, and it's amazing to think that this curvature affects everything, from the planets in our solar system to the expansion of the universe itself.","120":"So, that's correct. The inverse-square law dictates that the gravitational force decreases as the square of the distance increases. In essence, if you double the distance, the gravitational force becomes a quarter of its original value. This property holds true for all distances and objects, and it's why planets and satellites move along elliptical paths instead of straight lines.","121":"But that's an interesting point! If you threw it straight as if the Earth were not spinning, you'd expect it to go straight. However, the Earth's rotation causes the ball to curve in mid-air. Let's imagine a little experiment: if you threw a ball straight up here, where it would ideally come back down, would that really happen?","122":null,"123":"And that's exactly what you're implying - the apple falls because of its movement through space, as it tries to merge with Earth's path. Quite an intriguing concept, isn't it?","124":"Well, our current experiments have failed to directly detect extra dimensions, but they are based on a few assumptions. String theory, among others, suggests that there are more dimensions than the familiar three spatial and one time dimension. If an experiment could be designed to test these assumptions and confirm these additional dimensions, it would provide strong evidence supporting the theory.","125":"You're correct in asking about the laws of physics for each dimension. While they all follow the same fundamental laws, each might have a unique Lagrangian specific to its arrangement of strings and branes. So, in essence, the laws can seem different for each universe.","126":" I was just curious if you could help me understand String Theory and how it suggests the existence of extra dimensions.","127":"Membrane theory was first proposed to explain the behavior of physical objects within higher dimensional spaces. In simpler terms, a membrane can be thought of as a two-dimensional surface that vibrates and exists in the physical world. This concept has been around for some time, although it has been somewhat overshadowed by string theory.","128":null,"129":"And that's why they're called extra dimensions: they're the ones we can't directly see or experience. They're the levels beyond our three physical dimensions, and branes are objects that move within them. These ideas link the tiny world of particles to the vast universe we observe, making string theory quite fascinating.","130":"In simpler terms, blockchain is like a digital ledger where every transaction is recorded and verified by various computers in the network, eliminating the need for intermediaries like banks.

As technology evolves, it will significantly impact the economic landscape.","131":"In my understanding, while blockchain has shown great potential, it is still in the adoption phase and faces numerous challenges. For wider acceptance, I believe it's imperative to address concerns about scalability, security, regulation, user-friendliness, and reducing the energy consumption of mining processes. To achieve this, collaborations with enterprises to create reliable systems and educational programs, as well as continuous research, should be prioritized.","132":"One of the biggest challenges we're currently dealing with is scaling up our production processes.

In addition, the use of origami is found in solar panel deployment, where it helps in developing lightweight and efficient structures. Moreover, due to its scalability, origami is gaining traction in fields such as robotics, particularly nano robotics, where it can enable the creation of both large and small mechanisms that conform to various shapes.","135":"The process involves running the aramid fiber sheet through a machine that precisely folds it using the Miura-Ori pattern, transforming it into the final structure. The machine doesn't just make the creases, but actually folds the material, producing a finished product that's roughly as wide as what went in.","136":"In simpler terms, blockchain is a secure digital ledger created by a network of computers. Each node on this network records transactions, ensuring their validity through cryptographic techniques. This makes blockchain resistant to tampering or modification, as alterations in a transaction record would require changing every subsequent block.

The size of each circle corresponds to the size of the body part it symbolizes in the final folded figure. Larger circles indicate larger body parts (like wings), while smaller circles represent smaller body parts (like legs). This pattern-making method allows for a more streamlined and logical design process. We can determine the number of legs, abdomen, and head required for our desired creature, and then search for a suitable arrangement of these circles. For example, a spider with eight legs might require an additional two circles for the abdomen and one for the head, totaling 11 circles. In our book, Origami Insects II, there's a pattern for a flying ladybug, which demonstrates this technique perfectly.

However, it is essential to note that as of now, I'm not aware of any cases where viruses are used for this purpose. To achieve such feats, we would need to find a way to 'program' or manipulate the virus towards the desired assembly process. This could likely involve genetic engineering techniques, as you mentioned, to modify the genes involved in the virus's self-assembly process.","150":"That's captivating, it's essentially a nanofactory at our disposal.

I'd like you to wear these blindfolds and try the task again. Ready? Here they are. Now, let's see if you can perform the task with your eyes closed. Alright, close your eyes and let's give it a go.","329":"I'd mimic your action and pick up the penny from the ground, just as you did.","330":"Right. So, are you implying that a robot needs to have a similar level of perception and learning abilities as a human to perform tasks that we do, like picking up objects and solving problems? It's crucial for robots to be able to see where objects are, adapt to changes, and leverage both short-term and long-term experiences to perform tasks effectively, much like humans do.","331":"In reinforcement learning, the robot attempts the task and receives feedback, such as a positive or negative reward, which indicates whether its actions were successful or not. This feedback helps the robot adjust its actions to improve its performance in the future. This is similar to how you might train a dog.","332":"Well, they might not understand the intricacies of evolution, but they can be programmed to recognize and learn from their errors. So, you can provide feedback to help them understand the task better.","333":"A robot doesn't see like humans do. It doesn't have eyes or a visual cortex as we do. Instead, it interprets its environment through sensors and processes the data it receives using algorithms, which may not always correspond to human perception.","334":"Robots, as they are currently designed, don't have the ability to go off the program or make decisions independently. They can only perform the tasks they are programmed to do.","335":"To overcome the challenge of storing an entire world, you could generate the fractal dynamically, similar to how he created his 'happy little trees'. This approach allows for a more efficient use of resources and can potentially lead to more intricate and detailed landscapes.","336":"That's an interesting perspective! However, if we consider the physical limitations of space and the finite number of jars available, it's more likely that the total number of jellybeans would be finite, even if the number of jars could be infinite.","337":"Actually, I was referring to a common issue with photography. But, it's interesting that you're working on quantum computing! Can you tell me more about it? What kind of problems can it solve that classical computers can't?","338":"In the quantum world, a qubit can be in a state that's both heads and tails at the same time. This is called superposition. Let me show you with this penny.","339":"In everyday language, when we say something is entangled, we usually mean that two or more things are closely connected or intertwined, but in quantum physics, entanglement refers to a phenomenon where two particles can be linked in such a way that the state of one particle instantly affects the state of the other, regardless of the distance between them.","340":"That's fascinating! Quantum physics is like a whole new world, and this dilution refrigerator is our gateway to exploring it. It's not your typical refrigerator, but it's crucial for cooling our quantum chips to extremely low temperatures. This allows us to create superpositions, entangle qubits, and protect the information from getting lost to the environment. So, when you tell your friends about this, they'll be amazed too!","341":"That's fascinating! Quantum computers could potentially revolutionize our understanding of chemistry by simulating chemical bonding using quantum systems. This could lead to significant advancements in drug discovery and materials science.","342":"For instance, measurements like size, weight, position, velocity, temperature, and even more complex ones like electrical conductivity or chemical composition can be taken. These measurements can provide valuable insights into various physical phenomena, including bone fractures, as we'll discuss in more detail.","343":"In essence, MRIs are non-invasive imaging techniques that employ a strong magnetic field and radio waves to create detailed images of the body's internal structures by detecting the position of hydrogen atoms. This allows us to visualize the body's intricate details with remarkable clarity.","344":"Yes, there are different types of quantum sensors for various applications. The one I'm referring to, which is related to my work, is based on defects called nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond materials. This sensor is particularly sensitive to magnetic fields, making it useful for detecting and measuring them.","345":"Yes, one promising quantum sensor is the quantum magnetometer, which is still in development.
