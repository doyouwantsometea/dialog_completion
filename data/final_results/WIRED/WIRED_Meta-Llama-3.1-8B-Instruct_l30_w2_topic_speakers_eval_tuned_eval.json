The best way to think about this transition is really called, it's a flip flop switch, okay? So this term comes from engineering, and the idea is that in sleep, you basically have kind of this all of nothing experience. Certainly people kind of drift off to sleep, but then all of a sudden you're unconscious, right? So it seems like it's this flip flop between the arousal system and the sleep promoting system, and it's certainly regulated, and we'll get a little bit into that, but they're certainly kind of made up of two reciprocally inhibitory processes. Okay, so we have the ascending reticular activating system. It originates in the brain stem, and there's a dorsal and a ventral arm to this, and so the dorsal arm has neurons, cholinergic neurons, that go up to the thalamus and then it projections into the fore brain, and then there's the ventral arm, and this is comprised of a whole bunch of different types of neurons, so there are monominergic, so there's kind of dopaminergic neurons that come from the periaqueductal gray, serotonergic ones from the dorsal raphae nuclei, histaminergic neurons that come from the tuberomammillary nucleus of the hippothalamus, and then noradrenergic neurons from the locus coeruleus, and so all of those are kind of working in tandem to kind of drive wake within the brain. So if we just think about drugs that are available inducing wakefulness, we can certainly, kind of the dopaminergic ones jump out, right? So we have amphetamines that kind of drive those signaling, and then modafinil, which is a wake promoting drug for people that have kind of excessive day-time sleepiness that maintains alertness throughout the day.","1":"For the role that they play with respect to the sleep-wake system is really kind of amping up the wake system, right? And so certainly that has like down stream consequences for the sleep system, because now the flip flop switch is kind of pushed in a much stronger direction, and we have to kind of rely on what regulates sleep to get it pushed back to sleep.","2":"And do we know much about why, or which stages of the sleep cycle are affected? You know, if you take amphetamines, is it then when you go to sleep, that you're not able to transition through each of the sleep periods, or is that less clear?","3":"You know, so I think that's less clear. In some ways, you know, getting back to this idea of this wake-sleep system, we have this sleep system that is kind of the counterpoint to this wake arousal system, and so the primary nucleus region is the ventral lateral pre-optic nucleus, also called VLPO, and that has particular neuron outputs that release GABA and galanin, which work in an inhibitory way on kind of the wake promoting ones. And so, it's kind of this delicate balance of these two systems that are ongoing. In your cognitive neuro-science training, right, it sounds like it's pretty specific and focused in a particular part of the brain, the cerebellum, and one thing that I'm interested in is you bring a participant into the study, have you ensured that they got a good night's sleep? Have you asked them about their sleep?","4":"You know, what we do in our studies, is we actually track people, for say a week, and they have to get in within this range of amount of sleep and then it has to be both amount of sleep and how stable it is. That variability can kind of impact it and certainly might have an impact on the machinery that's happening in the brain.","5":"A lot of people will see you as somebody who's drank in harmony their whole life. They've seen so much harmony, heard so much harmony. How do you make the choices, there's so much that's possible when you know stuff. How do you have the courage to make a choice?","6":"Yeah, yeah, yeah. I find it fascinating in music to think about, you know, say I arrive in a place, if I'm going, say I'm going to D flat major. And there's something you once taught me. You taught me this song Don't Follow the Crowd.","7":"And there's that chord. It's not a Dennerman chord, but it functions as a dominant chord. But it doesn't matter, because you're still going to the place you're going to.","8":"But at that moment, I'm coming from here, and I wanna forge some, some solution. I get myself in a situation. (keyboard music)","9":"'Cause, you know, I just wouldn't think to use that chord in that situation. And there it was! And, you know, if you read the rule book, it's, that not in it.","10":"Something like that. And that's not 'cause like emotionally, it's almost like I'm here, I'm arriving here. But, if the base note is the same, it's like this inevitability about it, it's like I was there all along.","11":"Yeah, yeah. It's like one thing is moving in one direction and one thing has arrived, so it's this tension and it's glorious. I love thinking about these things emotionally, just because that's a feeling, I know that feeling in my life.","12":"And so, we could play a bit of that if you want to. And we could talk about some stuff. I've been doing it in F. (keyboards playing Amazing Grace) (laughing) Thanks Herbie, that was a trip.","13":"It's a good one. The melody on its own just goes. (hums Amazing Grace) That melody on its own is kind of lonely, right? And no one really knows how it feels. (plays and hums Amazing Grace) So which one did you prefer?","14":"Yeah, ah, that's great. I can decide how I want this melody to feel and the more notes there are, the more exciting it is. That's what musical harmony is. Does that make sense?","15":"Its basically a delay and it happens in all parts of the system: monitors can be a big one. Like consumer televisions can often have 15 milliseconds or more of latency just in the TV part. And then you've got the processing and the computer and all of these add up to the total latency.","16":"30 years ago, you had desktop PCs which were, you spent whatever on that, but there was always this idea well you could spend a million dollars and buy a super-computer and its gonna be a lot faster. And that's not really true today. For scalar processing, when you just do one thing after another, a high-end, overclocked, cool gaming PC is about the fastest thing in the world. It is within a very small delta, yeah for some things you'll get some IBM power system that might be a little bit faster, but not a whole lot. So if I'm looking at this and saying we need to be five times faster. What do you do? You can't just say make each thing faster. As a developer you're making a trade-off, I can put my effort into making this more efficient or making it more fun. And more fun usually wins out for very good reasons. So there's some good judgment and trickery that goes into the design of things. But you can always just design a game that will just not work well. (laughing) I mean in the old days, games had to be so precisely designed. Nowadays you've got a ton more freedom. You really can--","17":"But VR makes, you have to give up a little bit of that freedom, you have to not do so many crazy things, so you can wind up having it be as responsive and high quality as it needs to be.","18":"That's right. When we teach machines to learn from data, to build a model from that data or a representation of that, and then to make a prediction. One of the places we often find machine learning in the real world is in things like recommendation systems. So do you have an artist that you really like?","19":"So I'm gonna look up Melanie Martinez. And it says here, If you like Melanie Martinez, one of the other songs you might like is by Au\/Ra. Do you know who that is?","20":"And that's actually a really interesting thing to think about because that creepy vibe is something that you can perceive and I can perceive, but it's actually really hard to describe to a machine. What do you think might go into that?","21":"It's a great question. The machine can understand whatever we tell it to understand. So there might be a person thinking about things, like the pitch or the pacing or the tone, or sometimes machines can figure out things about music or images or videos that we don't tell it to discover, but that it can learn from looking at a lot of different examples. Why do you think companies might use machine learning?","22":"Sometimes, the ads you see are really uncanny. And I think that's because they're based on so much data. They know where you live. They know where your device is. It's also important to realize that people in aggregate are actually pretty predictable. Like when we talk to each other, we like to talk about the novel things, like here, we're having this conversation. We don't do this every day. But we probably still eat breakfast. We're gonna eat lunch. We're gonna eat dinner. You probably are going to the same home you go to most of the time. And so, they're able to take that data that we already give them and make predictions based on that as to what ads they should show us.","23":"So there are things that machines are really great at that humans are actually not great at. And imagine watching every video posted to TikTok every day. So we just don't have enough time to do that at the rate at which we can actually watch those videos. But a machine can analyze all of them and then make recommendations to us. And then thinking about things that machines are bad at and people are good at, people are really great with only one or two examples of learning something new and incorporating that into our model of the world to make good decisions. Whereas machines often need tens of thousands of examples, and that's not even getting into things like good judgment because we care about people, because we can imagine a future that we want to live in that doesn't exist today. And that's something that is still uniquely human. Machines are great at predicting based on what they've seen in the past, but they're not creative. They're not going to invent. They're not gonna, you know, really change where we're gonna go. That's up to us.","24":"Now, that makes the gravitational field incredibly strong around the neutron star. So what would happen if we were on a neutron star, because of the gravity?","25":"There isn't a sensible way to talk about it yet, and that probably means that's where Einstein's theory of gravity as a curved space-time is beginning to break down, and we need to take the extra step of going to some kind of quantum theory of gravity. And we don't have that yet. So even though the black hole isn't completely understood, we do know that they form astronomically, that in the universe things like neutron stars form and things like black holes form. The consequences are very much speaking to this curved space-time. So, for instance, if two black holes orbit each other, they're like mallets on a drum, and they actually cause space-time to ring, and it's very much part of gravitation. The ringing of space-time itself, we call gravitational waves. And this was something Einstein thought about right away in 1950-1960, he was thinking about that.","26":"[Janna] Yes, they ring space-time also like a drum, and you can record the sound of that ringing after a billion years, when it's traveled through the universe. But then the next thing that happens is those neutron stars collide, and because of this incredibly high energy state of matter, which you study, it becomes this firework of different explosions. It's really quite spectacular.","27":"So when the gravitational waves were recorded and they realized, oh this sounds like, you can reconstruct the shape and size of the mallets of the drum from the sound, these sounds like neutron stars colliding, not black holes. And so, like you said, there was a trigger for satellites and experiments all over the world to point roughly in the direction that the sound was coming from. So, from your point of view, they're like two super-conducting giant magnets colliding, an experiment you could never do on Earth. That's just the most tremendous scales and peculiarities of matter.","28":"Not an experimental one. So, our theme here today is dimensions. So this is great that you have some math background because mathematicians think about dimensions in a different way.","29":"Now, in some sense that's kind of trivial to you and me, because of course you have space, which is three dimensional, you have time which is one dimensional, so spacetime is four dimensional. But it didn't turn out, it didn't occur to anyone that that was a sensible way to talk until really relativity. This is the crucial thing, right? Is that what Einstein realized is that sure there's both time and space, but how we divide spacetime into time and space can be different for different people, and really there's a real sense in which four dimensional spacetime is kind of a generalization of three dimensional space. And I think to really explain this we're gonna need a blackboard.","30":"Let's bring one in. All right. The thing about relativity is that they really want you to think of spacetime as one four dimensional thing, right? It's kind of like space. It's not just three dimensions of space and one dimension of time.","31":"Why? This is a very good question. So, let's just start with space, right? We know a little bit about space. So here's my simple minded way of drawing space two dimensions, because that's how many I can draw on the blackboard. Let's say X and Y. And what is special about space, there's many things, but one is that if I have a curve or a path between two points, there's a distance that you can calculate, right? And the distance between those two points doesn't depend on your coordinates. It doesn't depend on whether you're in radial coordinates or Cartesian coordinates, or whatever. I'm allowed to imagine a curve that does something like this between those two points, and if I were a person walking on that curve, I would have an odometer with me maybe, and I would know, you would know, even without having done that, this path is always gonna be longer than that path. There's a formula, Pythagoras' Theorem that tells you what the shortest distance path is. That's the point. The physical-ness of what is real is the distance along a certain curve. So spacetime is like that. That's why it is useful to think about spacetime.","32":"And it's almost exactly like the space story. The space story says there's a distance, distance is different along different curves. Einstein says there's something that measures the length of these curves, and we call it the proper time. It is literally the time that you would read on your wristwatch.","33":"Well kind of. What Einstein wants to get across is there's no such thing as fundamental, like there's the universe's time, this big letter T that might tell you how old the universe is, but then every individual has a clock with them, and they measure their own time depending on how they're moving through the universe.","34":"And the crucial difference is that time is not the same for this person who stayed behind and sat in their chair, and this person who zoomed out there.","35":"There is what we call a metric on spacetime, and when we talk about Euclidean space versus a curved space, versus a sphere or something, that's a different metric. And spacetime has its own metric which says the following thing, that the path between two events in spacetime that is a straight line, will always be the longest time.","36":"So when Einstein had this idea, oh gravity could be related to the curvature of spacetime, he did some equations, so he got it, that's a long story, we'll put that aside. What he figured out was that rather than gravity living on top of spacetime, it's a manifestation of the curvature of spacetime so when you have like the earth, the sun, the moon, they cause a gravitational field, they're actually warping the spacetime around them. They're giving it a different geometry.","37":"Yeah, exactly. If you had a sheet that was originally flat, and you set a marble on it, it would go in a straight line, but then if you put something on it so it warps it, that marble is now gonna be deflected.","38":"So a nice place to start is with the idea of a triad. A triad is a three-part harmony, basically. (keyboard harmonic tone) So that's a triad. So this triad's called C major.","39":"So in Amazing Grace, you start with F. You know, if I go (melodic humming) \u266a How sweet the sound \u266a (scat singing) (laughs) Where am I right now? I don't know where I am. (scat singing) And my job is to get back home, but to make this chord make sense.","40":"You know, a lot of people, a lot of string theorists, they care a lot about all the different ways in which we could hide the extra dimensions. As someone who cares about cosmology, I wanna start asking why are the extra dimensions small at all? How did that happen? Is this something you think about yourself?","41":"The thing I want to talk about is this paper I wrote with Matt Johnson and Lisa Randall where we realize there's another way to compactify extra dimensions spontaneously, dynamically. If you imagine starting with this big piece of paper you couldn't wrap up everything, but within some region of space you could make a tube.","42":"Yeah. So we certainly assume that they're all large as a starting point, and it's worse than that. So in our paper we imagine you start in de Sitter space. You start in a universe with no matter, no anything like that, just empty space but with an energy that is positive and all the dimensions are large.","43":"Yeah, I've been trying to explain this to lower levels, and they always look at me like, are you pulling my leg here a little bit? Or is this the real thing that they use? Yes, it is the real thing they use. We study these branes in de Sitter space, and so what we found is that there are black brane solutions which instead of having a singularity inside are non-singular, and stable, and compactified. Is this a familiar thing? I know things like this have been discussed, right?","44":"Right. Imagine that rather than going down to a point, it just asymptotes to some fixed radius that continues infinitely far down there. But then you can ask, okay what about the rest of the universe? You have some sphere, some two dimensions compactified, and the balance between the cosmological constant and the electromagnetic field keeps it at a fixed distance.","45":"But then the other dimensions, the transverse dimensions, don't need to be anti-de Sitter. They can have either positive, zero, or negative cosmological constant. So you can basically get any sort of cosmological solution times a compactified sphere.","46":"I guess. I mean, maybe you'd think otherwise. Again or maybe you could change my mind, I think that as long as it can happen it will happen some of the time, right?","47":"And I just wrote a book called Something Deeply Hidden about many worlds, quantum mechanics, and how spacetime can emerge from it. Plenty of reading material for the audience out there.","48":"The reason we're not just flying off the earth is because earth has gravity, so if we throw something up, it comes back down, so that's why when we're walking on the earth, we don't fly off the earth because the earth has gravity, and it keeps us down.","49":"The main thing about black hole to remember is that it's just, like I said, how the earth holds you down, the black hole pulls you in, as well. Now, try and take the ball from me, black hole--","50":"Alright, so, at some point, you can probably see it right now? So without moving your eyes, this is kind of hard, tell me how many fingers I'm holding up?","51":"You can just barely tell. And you can see that even, like if you hold out your hand and you focus on your hand, then your foot would be blurry because there's that difference there. And you can change between that, like you can then focus on your foot and your hand gets blurry. Because your eyes can see different amounts of detail in different places. So we're hoping in the future, that hardware can be like that. Where we can make a display that puts lots of detail right where you're looking. And every time you look someplace else, it moves the detail over to there. So we don't need to render a hundred times as much as we've got right now. Figuring out where you're looking is a pretty hard problem. What we try to go about this, is by taking a camera and looking at people's eyes and then try to figure out is the eye looking over here or up here. We're working hard on stuff like this right now so we hopefully can have a virtual reality that's as detailed and realistic feeling as the reality that we've actually got around us. But its going to be a long time before we get to where we can really fool people.","52":"Okay. So this is about high intensity lasers. Not only how do you make them, but what was really stopping them being made in both cases is non linear optics. We wanna do something that requires a huge photon density application, and so that's how come we came up with chirped pulse amplification, so that we could stretch the pulse, safely amplify it, then compress it at the end, and then we're ready to do whatever we want at the end. So what do you think the main difference is between the continuous wave laser that you have that runs at 10 watts and a chirped pulse amplifier?","53":"And so we get the power with a lot less energy 'cause its power is energy per unit time. So we aren't depositing much energy in comparison. Can I just ask, 'cause you are using the thermal process of it heating up, but have you ever had the opportunity to use laser tweezers?","54":"I don't know if people are working on that because I'm not so much in the medical field, but I should look into that and see if that's a possibility. So after hearing about high intensity lasers, can you think about next time you go back to the lab and you're wondering how to do something in the lab with lasers, can you see how short pulses might help you?","55":"Mostly today, I've been talking a lot about what can we do, what's possible. We think might be possible in the next couple of years. But really at the professional level its more the question of wisdom of what should we be doing.","56":"As an engineer of course, I love quantifiable things. I like saying here's my 18 millisecond motion to photon, here's my angular resolution that I'm improving. I'm doing the color-space right. But you can look not too far back where you say we have blu-ray DVDs at this amazing resolution, but more people want to watch Youtube videos at really bad early internet video speeds. Where there are things that if you deliver a value to people then these objective quantities may not be the most important thing. And while we're certainly pushing as hard as we can on lots of these things that make the experience better in potentially every way or maybe just for videos or for different things. I don't think that its necessary. I've commented that I think usually my favorite titles on mobile that are fully synthetic are ones that don't even try, they just go and do light-mapped, black-shaded. And I think its a lovely aesthetic. I think that you don't wind up fighting all of the aliasing. While you get some other titles that, oh we're gonna be high-tech with our specular bump maps with roughness. And you've got aliasing everywhere, and you can't hold frame rate and its all problematic. While some of these that are clearly very synthetic worlds where its nothing but these cartoony flat-shaded things with lighting, but they look and they feel good. And you can buy that you're in that place. And you want to know what's around that monolith over there.","57":"The end goal of reality, of course in computer graphics people chase photo-realistic form for a long time. And basically, we've achieved it. Photo-realism, if you're willing to throw enough discreet path traced rays at things, you can generate photo-realistic views. And we understand the light really well. Of course it still takes a half hour per frame like it always has, or more, to render the different things. So its an understood problem and given infinite computing power we could be doing that in virtual reality. However, a point that I've made to people in recent years is that, we are running out of More's Law. Maybe we'll see some wonderful breakthrough in quantum structures or whatever--","58":"But if we just wind up following the path that we're on, we're gonna get double and quadruple, but we're not gonna get 50 times more powerful than we are right now. We will run into atomic limits on our fabrication. So given that, I'm trying to tell people that, start buying back into optimization, start buying back into thinking a bit more creatively. Because you can't just wait, its not going to get to that point where it really is fixed to those highest degrees just by waiting for computing to be advanced. If we want this to be something used by a billion people then we need it to be lighter, cheaper, more comfortable.","59":"I'm still a believer that the magic's out there. We haven't found it yet, so somebody's going to happen upon the formula. I feel like I've felt little pockets of magic.","60":"All right, you're in the wrong place. [laughs] We're not gonna be talking about biology or computer science. So we wanna talk about the idea of dimensions. Do you know what dimension is? How we would define dimensions?","61":"Right, you know the difference between like one dimension two dimensions, three dimensions, et cetera. So let's do a little experiment here. So there's one dimension. I'll give that to you. Now, here's your task. I'm going to give you another dimension, and I'm gonna ask hold those two things at right angles to each other. It's easy to do. Yeah, so there's no trick here.","62":"Well, we could also say how far we are away from the center, just the distance. And then the angle that our little line makes with let's say the X axis.","63":"So that's a different way of giving you two numbers and locating yourself, and we call those polar coordinates. It's a different coordinate system. What we want to do as physicists is look for extra dimensions. Can you imagine, can you think of any way that there could be extra dimensions?","64":"Time. Yes, Einstein said that we can think of time as a fourth dimension, and that's a very fascinating thing that we could talk about all by itself. But what about space? What about the solar system? Like, if you wanted to tell me where a certain star was in the sky, do you know how we do that?","65":"So astronomers call them right ascension and declination, which are two terrible words, but basically you've seen on the globe where you draw latitude and longitude, what it looks like.","66":"So you can define something as, well you know, how high above a certain location on earth it is, but the earth is rotating and revolving around the sun so we have to define separate celestial coordinates.","67":"We don't know. You know, the optimistic view is that there are six, but the thing is, some of them might be really, really, really, really, really small, like way too small for us to ever see.","68":"You know, honestly out there, if you go out onto campus and talk to the physicists, half of them will say probably extra dimensions exist, and half of them say no, that's just nonsense.","69":"So we've been, we've had, now, effectively two different ways of getting more direct measurements, one is the LIGO, which is the Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory, which is where, getting the ripples in space time, coming off of the merging of black holes. The other one that you're mentioning is actually called the Event Horizon Telescope, where they're using radio waves to actually image the event horizon, that region where light cannot escape from the black hole at the center of our galaxy, which I know they're working on it right now. It's an amazing thing, but that'll be the most direct imaging of a black hole. LIGO is a direct detection of the consequence of the merging of black holes. The critical part has been, like, for the super massive black hole at the center of our galaxy, we've seen the stars orbiting it, and we've measured the mass, so that way, so if you look at a spinning black hole, it actually fundamentally alters the emission that's coming off the stuff that's falling into it. These are discovered as what are called X-ray binaries, that is, you know, there's an X-ray member of the binary that is emitting in the X-rays, and it's really not very bright in the optical (mumbles) at all, so there's always, people are looking at these X-ray binaries.","70":"For my studies, I actually, when I started at UCLA in graduate school, I worked with a professor named Matt Malkin who was, gotten a lot of data observations from the Hubble Space Telescope, so that was one of my very first projects to work on, so any, space-based observatories have been a really big advantage, and then I've moved on now to the Spitzer Space Telescope. In addition to that, then there's other people who've used a lot of X-ray telescopes, NuSTAR, Chandra have used data from that. It's been a combination of both ground-based observatories, as well as space-based ones, and going everywhere from X-ray observations, not done by me, but certainly ultraviolet, and then optical, and infrared, particularly, those are the ones that I've been most involved with.","71":"That's pretty good. So gravity wants to attract us to the Earth, and the Earth to us. But the Earth is so much bigger that even though we're actually pulling the Earth a little bit to us, you don't notice it so much. You know, the Moon pulls on the Earth a little bit.","72":"[Janna] Exactly, the Moon is such a big body compared to anything else very nearby that it has the larger effect, pulling the water of the Earth. But more than the Moon, think about the Sun pulling on the Earth. We orbit the whole Sun, just the way the Earth pulls on the Moon and causes the Moon to orbit us. All of those things are acting on you and me right now.","73":"That's such a good question. No, we actually couldn't. In the Moon, gravity is weaker, you can almost float between footsteps if you look at the astronauts on the Moon. On the Earth, it's harder, 'cause it's bigger. If you go to a bigger, heavier planet, it gets harder and harder. But there are stars that have died that are so dense that there's no way we could lift our arms, no way we could step or walk. The gravity is just way too strong. Do you know how tall you are?","74":"Maybe four three. People think that while you're sleeping, your body has a chance to stretch out and gravity isn't crunching you together, but when you're standing or walking or sitting, the gravity contracts your spine ever so slightly, so that in the morning you might be a little bit taller than in the evening. See if it works for you. [Woman] Wow.","75":"They say that astronauts in space, definitely their spine elongates. There were two twin astronauts, one who stayed here on Earth and the other who went to the International Space Station. He was there for a long time, and when he came back, he was actually taller than his twin brother.","76":"Yeah, and that was because gravity wasn't compressing him all the time and he was floating freely in the International Space Station and his spine just kind of elongated. After a while here on Earth though he'll readjust, he'll go back to the same size. Have you ever heard of how gravity was discovered?","77":"Isaac Newton would ponder, how does the Earth cause things to fall? There's a famous story that Isaac Newton was sitting under a tree and the apple fell from the tree and hit him on the head and he had an epiphany and understood this law, this mathematical law for how that works. I don't actually think that's a true story, though.","78":"But it's a good story. So Isaac Newton realized that even if you're heavier, you will fall at the same rate as something much lighter, that that's the same. Once you hit the ground, if you're heavier, you'll hit the ground with much greater force, but you will hit the ground at the same time.","79":"They look the same, but this is much heavier, right? Okay, so try it, just try holding your arms up front, a little higher maybe, give them a chance to drop, and then drop them. [balls thud] [Janna laughs] Did they fall at the same time? Did they hit at the same time? So, Isaac Newton, he was also the one who realized that that's the same force that keeps the Moon in orbit around the Earth and the Earth in orbit around the Sun, and that's a huge leap. Here he is, looking at just things around him, and then looks at the stars and has this really big realization, that that's actually the same force. So, what have you learned today talking about gravity?","80":"It turns out, for people that are between the ages of 18 and 65, the agreed upon amount of sleep that people should get is between seven and nine hours, and it's really at least seven hours per night, to maintain optimal health as an adult. So at least seven hours. When we look at across all of the data that is available on like sleep and health, and sleep and psychiatric illness and those types of things, the largest risk is when people get five hours or less. What do you think is responsible for driving how much sleep you need, and things like that?","81":"Right. You can do part of this level, and you can do the other part, clearly. Got some expertise under your belt, and that's awesome, because I think that everyone should know more about sleep. And so the way that we think about what drives sleep are two independent but related processes and so they have kind of lame names. Process S and process C, and what you've kind of described is process C, and that's the master clock, right? And it helps regulate kind of the rhythms like all over your body, all your cells, and all those kind of things. It drives the release of melatonin from the pineal gland, and melatonin comes online under darkness, so when the sun goes down, your brain knows okay it's time to start getting ready for sleep, and so you start releasing melatonin, which really kind of sets the table for sleeping.","82":"So yeah it's a light bulb and there's a couple of mirrors. Now the light bulb has to be a little bit special. It has to be a type of material that can store the energy in an excited state right? It has to stay up there really energetic and sit there for a while so that when the light comes along, it takes that energy and becomes stronger light and then the mirror sends it back and it does it again and again and again and between these two mirrors, it makes the light come out in a nice beam. In a laser, it comes out as a single color. They all come out with their waves at the same time. Every wave peaks at the same time which then makes it a giant wave and it's this giant wave that has a tremendous amount of power. So it can do something like cutting steel. But when you cut steel, or if you were cutting this floor, it's gray, it actually will absorb the light. That's why the light, you don't see it because the light isn't bouncing back or through it. So I like to use demos to explain how my laser works. So I've brought basically a hammer and a nail. I'm sure you've probably hammered a nail before into a piece of wood but the question is, if you asked yourself why it is we hit the big end and it's the tiny end that we put on the piece of wood. We could never pick up a hammer and hit the sharp end and hope this would go in to the piece of wood.","83":"Exactly. You know sometimes you want to have all of your energy not just in a small area but in the small volume and so one of the other dimensions is time or length. But with light, time and length are the same thing because light always travels at the speed of light.","84":"But if you send a one second long light pulse out into the skies there, the beginning of the pulse is actually two thirds of the way to the moon. It's 300,000 kilometers long. So now, if you talk about light being concentrated, that doesn't seem very concentrated. The type of lasers I play with in my lab will be no thicker than this piece of paper. So we take that energy that might be in three hundred thousand kilometers and we squeeze it all the way down into just this piece of paper and actually the beams are more the size of this piece of paper and so, in my lab, pieces of paper like this would be flying through the sky but we can't see them. 'Cos they don't come in our eyes, they fly by us and they're infra red.","85":"Exactly. And so now, if we have light like that that we wanna machine with. I bring this funnel and so, if we had a lens here and the light was coming down--","86":"Into a spot. So here would be my light coming from my laser and it would just be coming down, down, down, down, down. Hit a lens and it would have to focus down. But now, all the light started out with this big of a spread so concentrated this much. Eventually it would be here, more concentrated. But by the end, right at the focal spot, that's when I get all of my light, all of the energy has been squeezed down into fitting inside this piece of paper and that's why I say that I built a laser hammer. Because when this hits a piece of glass, it just smacks hose electrons right off the atoms and there's nothing else for them to do, they have to fly away. So can you tell me what you learned and maybe about the focusing of the light?","87":"That was, it was like, oh, wow, this might be it, and then, but very early on, it was, as I just started my, it was basically my second year of graduate school, it was like, uh, this is not that simple.","88":"You know, everybody's been just coming at it from different wavelengths at the optical infrared, and, but definitely the X-rays has been one of those things where it's like, oh, finally.","89":"It does seem to be that it may not even, in parts, it may not be even connected to this tiny, little torus at all because part of the work that I did, and others have done, is that type twos preferentially live in different kinds of galaxies than type ones, which should not in any way have to do with something such a small scale. They tend to be in smaller bulged, SB and SC type spiral galaxies. So there's something also having to do with environment that gets you to be a type two, and you can still maybe, timing wise, but there's something else that's going on on a larger scale because the type of the AGN should not really correspond to the host galaxy, but it seems to. And that was one of the things that we were finding out, and that was one of the early little ideas that the, individually, just as the torus model, the unified model, can't explain everything that we were observing at the time. But it is one of those things that it's, they're super luminous, they're all over the place, and we don't have a really good picture of it, which makes it exciting to study.","90":"You try, we all gotta try. You've probably heard about sleep as this kind of, you know, it's a biological process that happens in your brain. It's really important for your body, but it's a lot more complex than that. Sleep is made up of different parts. You know, when you think about sleep, what do you think about?","91":"So our sleep is made up of different types, okay? The first one is called non-rapid eye movement sleep, or non-REM, okay? Or NREM. And then the other one, which might not be a surprise, is called REM. Rapid eye movement sleep. And those are the two main types of sleep that happen. The way that we measure that as a sleep scientist is that we'll actually bring people into the lab where they can do this at home, where we put electrodes on their scalp while they're sleeping, and that allows us to measure the brain activity that's going on during the night.","92":"When we measure all of that, we're able to see how much time someone's asleep, and how many times they wake up and stuff during the night. You know, we're also really interested in kind of, the amount of non-REM sleep someone gets and the amount of REM sleep that someone gets, because each part of those types of sleep do different things for the body. And so it's important to get both of those. And so within non-REM sleep, there are three stages ranging from N-1 to N-2 to N-3. So not particularly clever in our naming, but that's how we know what stages they are. And what they do is it moves from lightest to deepest sleep, okay? N-1, it's more kind of light, wakefulness sleep, kind of in and out of sleeping. Then you go into N-2, which is where we spend 45 to 55 percent of our sleep. And it's more this kind of light sleep, but then we get into kind of the really restorative sleep, and that's N-3. And in N-3, when we look at someone's EEG wave, we see these big slow waves, and it's called slow wave sleep. And so we spend about 20% of our sleep in slow wave sleep, though it can vary on a day to day.","93":"You know, some of that is totally accurate, that like when your brain's more engaged by being on your phone or doing things that you really enjoy or things that stress you out or any of those types of things, it's harder to get to sleep and to kind of fall into that deeper levels of sleep. Most of the REM sleep, this dreaming sleep, happens in the second half of the night.","94":"Okay? So we wake up a lot during the night, and we just don't remember it. And you'll go back down into deep sleep, and then up again into REM, you know, in kinda these cycles.","95":"Okay. Usually we want to keep naps, like 20 to 30 minutes. When people drop into deep sleep, and then they're woken up out of a nap, most people report that they feel way worse than they did before they took the nap, and that's because you've been in deep sleep, and it's this term called sleep inertia. So what are the stages of sleep?","96":"I think to really get deep into nanomaterials and nanoscale devices, you really have to understand to some level, quantum mechanics. What it teaches us as we make these devices smaller and smaller, their properties begin to now depend on the size and the orientation of these devices. There are materials, and you're taking a 2D materials class, you know about this, that are intrinsically thin. As they're grown, as they're fabricated, they're already at the nanoscale and they possess these quantum confinement properties that as a nanotechnologist, you try to exploit. And so the first ones I wanted to talk to you about are quantum dots, have you heard of quantum dots before?","97":"So these are typically semiconductors. They can be cadmium selenide cadmium sulfide, zinc selenide and they're small clusters of atoms. They can be from 2 to 10 nanometers. What's interesting about these materials?","98":"That's correct. Yeah. Because of quantum confinement, once you get below this 15 nanometer range, the band gap of the material depends completely on the size of the material. So in bulk materials, if you want to change the band gap, you have to change the material, right? But in these quantum dots specifically, just by changing the size, you can change their band gap. And because their band gap is changing, their optical properties are different. And you can precisely tune the wavelength of light that they emit just by changing their size.","99":"There are people that are exploring using these materials for diode lasers. There are companies that are building displays from these materials. And there're even people thinking about if I take these quantum dots, and I change the chemistry on the outside so they stick to specific types of cells or tissue, that I could really do some interesting imaging and therapeutic work to track disease, even maybe to treat disease, if you can very precisely control the chemistry.","100":"The optical applications are in development. The science has really been worked out. The health stuff, because of all of the things you have to consider when you're putting something in someone's body is definitely further out there. For example, some of them are made from cadmium. Cadmium's toxic. You would never put that in someone's body. But there are other materials like gold and silver and titanium dioxide, which are less toxic and people are exploring using those. So have you learned about graphene?","101":"Carbon nanotube, right. So if you roll up graphene, depending on how you roll it and the angle, you roll it with, it has different properties. So if I roll it one way, it'll act like a metal. If I roll it a different way, it'll act like a semiconductor. The one that gets everyone most excited is that the electrons and holes move very fast through graphene. And so there's a lot of interest in using these for certain types of high-speed electronics. The other interesting application is because it's one atom thin, it's very sensitive to changes in the environment. And so there's a lot of interest in using them as diagnostics. It's on us researchers to find ways to A, control that process and then B, to actually build some sort of interesting technology from them.","102":"You're speaking my language. This is what I spent many years of my life working on. You don't physically roll up graphene. You grow nanotubes by basically taking nanocrystals and you deposit them on a surface. And then you do a CVD process, chemical vapor deposition. So you basically flow in a carbon source, the carbon dissolves in a nanocrystal and then once nanocrystal is saturated, the nanotubes precipitate out of them in tubes. Then you have to develop ways to go into this pile of nanotubes and pull out exactly the ones that you want. So I have to find ways to program them to go exactly in the places that I want. I modify the surface of the nanotube with specific molecules that recognize one type of surface over another. And then I just pattern the surface and the tubes just land exactly where we want them to. And it's still very much in the research stage. The ultimate goal is to build functional high-speed electronics using these new materials.","103":"Yeah. 100%. That's right. And that's the motivation for looking at these emerging materials. But I would never bet against the innovation and the creativity in this nano electronic space. Tens of thousands of scientists, every time they hit a barrier, at least historically, as a guide, they have found a way to overcome it. It's a real marvel in ingenuity.","104":"So machine learning is a way that we teach computers to learn things about the world by looking at patterns and looking at examples of things. So can I show you an example of how a machine might learn something?","105":"That's true. Do you think, if we look at these pictures, do you think maybe we could say, Well, they both have pointy ears, but the dogs have a different kind of body and the cats like to stand up a little different.? Do you think that makes sense?","106":"This one's a jackal. And it's actually a kind of dog. But you made a good guess. That's what machines do too. They make guesses. Is this a cat or a dog?","107":"And so, you did something pretty amazing there. Because we asked the question, Is it a cat or a dog? And you said, I disagree with your question. It's a human. So machine learning is when we teach machines to make guesses about what things are based on looking at a lot of different examples. And I build products that use machine learning to learn about the world and make guesses about things in the world. When we try to teach machines to recognize things like cats and dogs, it takes a lot of examples. We have to show them tens of thousands or even millions of examples before they can get even close to as good at it as you are. Do you have tests in school?","108":"Which means that in the test, you're not seeing any problems that you don't know how to solve. As long as you did all your practice, right?","109":"So machines work the same way. If you show them a lot of examples and give them practice, they'll learn how to guess. And then when you give them the test, they should be able to do that. So we looked at eight pictures and you were able to answer really quickly. But what would you do if I gave you 10 million examples? Would you be able to do that so quickly?","110":"So one of the differences between people and machines is that people might be a little better at this, but can't look at 10 million different things. So now that we've been talking about machine learning, is this something you want to learn how to do?","111":"Yes, we're gonna talk about science and we're gonna talk about a very specific kinda science, about people who study brains. Do you know what a brain is? What is it?","112":"Okay, well there's more cells in your brain, like way more cells, than all the stars we can see. (Daniel gasps) (Bobby laughs) And so what the connectome is, is we'd like to know where every cell in your brain is and how it talks to every other cell in your brain.","113":"Maybe a mutual acquaintance of ours, Jasper gave a example of fault injection, and I like to use that as, when I'm trying to explain fault injection, he shows a pinball machine and the pinball machine, obviously the two inputs are the two plungers when you're playing a pinball machine, but fault injection, you can tilt the entire pinball machine, right? You're just introducing some external variable that's outside of the traditional inputs that you're used to and you've now controlled the environment in a advantageous way to the user or the player. Can you give an example of some type of fault injection that you're doing or working on?","114":"We're also scratching the surface of, like, what is possible? It's not necessarily just the system itself and not necessarily that algorithm itself. Like you said, you don't necessarily need to attack the math in some cases. You can just attack that check. And I think something that's been pretty cool is looking at higher energy particles. It's going to be maybe hard to entirely confirm, but I think it'd be really, really cool to actually see. Like, I want to see one of these faults because I haven't seen it myself. And also, how do you know that you've seen it? I've started playing with, like, setting up a cloud chamber. A cloud chamber lets you actually view high energy particles going through sort of like in a small jar with some evaporated alcohol. And I thought it'd be really cool if we put some memory chip in there, like a basic memory chip and we just fill it with some data, but then you put a camera on that area and you just watch. Assuming that there is a high energy particle that actually hits that memory, that should potentially flip the energy state of that bit. The outside microcontrollers should be able to read that and actually say, Oh wait, the data, even though I'm not changing data, I'm only reading data, and we should be able to visibly or optically see it. What I'm wondering is could that be a next area of research? Because I don't think anyone's actually looking at intentionally injecting high energy particles to take over a computer, when really, you know, that's another technique for fault injection, technically speaking.","115":"I've never seen... Maybe call it a verifiable visualization of it, right? We know it's true, you know, you can get skin cancer by going outside and having too many high energy particles hit you, but we've never seen it. And we know it can happen to a computer chip, but I've never seen both.","116":"For me, I think the things that have been recent and super interesting are typically down to physics-level effects that maybe we haven't seen before. I think my mind was blown with the, there was the light commands research, and they were able to modulate sound, although it's purely over light using a laser, they would hit the MEMS microphone, and it was picking that up and was able to then interpret it and essentially take control over light.","117":"It's the easier side. I would say my side is the easier side, right? I'm on the offensive side. I want to break into things. Someone on the defense side, they might have, you know, a system was developed and they now need to patch a hundred holes. They patch 99 of them. I only need to find that one.","118":"You got, pretty much, you got a very good idea about it. Basically you have a star, at the core its generating energy, which is countering the pressure of all that mass trying, being pulled in by gravity. Once it can't generate that energy anymore, the core collapses, once the core is collapsing, it keeps collapsing, and collapsing, and collapsing, and that's the critical thing that makes a black hole. You have enough mass in the volume, such that the escaped velocity becomes the speed of light, once light can't escape, hence the black part. (laughs) But that's the thing, is that just because there's an intense amount of gravity very close to a black hole, things don't start behaving differently. And my favorite analogy is a vacuum, everybody thinks, like, if you point a vacuum cleaner at something, it's just gonna suck everything in--","119":"Right, you will feel the gravitational pull, and it'll redirect you in some way, and if you're far enough way, it's just like you're very far away from the sun, or something else. If you're close enough, it will divert your path more, if you're close enough still, then you will get what are called tidal forces, where the difference between, for example, if you're standing next to a black hole, the difference in gravity between your feet and your head actually becomes significant. Next time you see a science fiction movie, if somebody says, Oh, my god, we've been caught in the gravitation field of a black hole, and we're gonna fall in, it's like, no, no, just, if you're far enough away, just thrust a little bit this way, and then you'll slingshot around the black hole.","120":"I wouldn't call them educational, but the movie Interstellar actually had, as one of the people involved in both writing it, and as a science advisor, Dr. Kip Thorne, who's a Professor at Caltech, who was part of the team that detected gravitational waves, and just won a Nobel Prize for it. So he made sure to try and get it as accurate as possible, so Interstellar, I think, is one of the best examples of getting black holes right.","121":"Well, you're absolutely right that the attention machine learning gets has grown dramatically. 20 years ago, going to gatherings and telling people what I was working on and seeing the blank face or the like, Where's the turn? and walk away. Like, Oh, no. The accessibility of the tooling, like, we can now do in, like, five lines of code something that would have taken 500 lines of very mathematical, messy, gnarly code even, you know, five years ago. And that's not an exaggeration. And there are tools that mean that pretty much anyone can pick this up and start playing with it and start to build with it. And that is also really exciting.","122":"And part of the challenge of it is not the mathematics of building models, but the challenge is making sure that the data is sufficiently representative, potentially high quality.","123":"Right. And so, to say that another way, when you're collecting data from the real world and then building machine learning systems that automate decisions based on that data, all of the biases and problems that are already in the real world then can be magnified through that machine learning system. And so, it can make many of these problems much worse.","124":"And so, it's not just the provenance of that data, but it's, sort of, deeply understanding, Why does it look the way it looks? Why was it collected this way? What are the limitations of it? We need to think about that in entire process, how we document that process. This is an issue in companies where somebody might create something that even their peers can't recreate.","125":"These are great questions. So things like actuarial science, operations research, where they actually are not using machine learning as much as you might think. And then you have other sorts of companies or on the FinTech side, or even the ad tech side of things where they perhaps are using machine learning to the point of even absurdity.","126":"I am incredibly optimistic and not... Perhaps it's a personality flaw, but I can't help but look at the potential of the technology to reduce harm, to give us information that help us make better decisions. And to think that we would choose to address the big problems ahead of us. I don't think we have a hope of addressing them without figuring out the role that machine learning will play. And to think that we would then choose not to do that is just unthinkable.","127":"A lot of origami is animals, birds and things. There's also a branch of origami that is, it's more abstract or geometric, called tessellations. Tessellations, like most origami, are folded from a single sheet of paper but they make patterns, whether it's woven patterns like that, or woven patterns like this. If you hold them up to the light you can see patterns.","128":"The thing that makes them cool is they're sort of like tilings, it looks like you could put this together by cutting little pieces of paper and sliding them together, but they're still one sheet.","129":"Mm-hmm. Each of these folds is peaked like a mountain and we call these mountain folds but if I made it the other way, then it's shaped this way and we call it a valley fold. In all of origami there's just mountains and valleys.","130":"So they're all reversible and it turns out that in every origami shape that folds flat, it's going to be either three mountains and a valley or, if we're looking at the backside, three valleys and a mountain, they always differ by two.","131":"That's a rule of all flat origami no matter how many folds come together at a point and I'm going to show you a building block of tessellations, it's called a twist because that center square, as I unfold it, it twists, it rotates.","132":"If I had another twist in the same sheet of paper I could make these folds connect with that, and these folds connect with that. And if I had another one up here, I could make all three. And if I had a square array and all the folds lined up I could make bigger and bigger arrays, like these, because these are just very large twists. In this case it's an octagon rather than a square, but they're arranged in rows and columns. And let's just try going along. All right, there is our tessellation with squares and hexagons. So you have now designed and folded your first origami tessellation and perhaps you can see how just using this idea of building up tiles and small building blocks you could make tessellations as big and complex as you want.","133":"Awesome, good. (laughs) It's a map of all the connections between every neuron in your brain. It literally, in a human brain, something like a map of the one quadrillion connections that a hundred billion neurons make with each other.","134":"We have to use electron microscopes and then what we have been developing a way to slice the brain into really thin slices, use an electron microscope to take a picture of each slice, and then use computers to put it all back. Imagine that we could get a map of every connection, right? And we knew how neurons fire. Do you think we could put that in a computer, that map, and then therefore, that computer should be able to think just like the brain that we extracted it from?","135":"Neurons are also digital. Meaning a Neuron either fires or it doesn't fire, so that's either one or zero. And it's the combination of those ones or zeros that actually produce the 10 thousand different answers that you say.","136":"Yeah, again, we don't know exactly where X, Y, Z, zero is, we're assuming that it's something, you know, the X-rays that are coming out are very close to the event horizon of the black hole, but this is still, you know, your realm of X-rays, to really figure out those kinds of things. But once the X-rays, once the photons hit the corona, and are re-scattered, and up, energized, and then they start illuminating the accretion disk, it heats it up, and so just by the light travel time, when the optical, if it gets, you know, brighter and fainter, and then the infrared gets brighter and fainter, two weeks later, then the dust is two light weeks away from that. So it's a one dimensional one, so we're averaging, so we don't get the two dimensional, or even three dimensional one. And then we've done it now, of course, we have better telescopes, there was a project where you could do it with the Hubble Space Telescope and the ultraviolet, you used the Swift Observatory, which had optical and ultraviolet, and then from ground base, we did optical, and then from space we did it with Spitzer and the infrared. So you could actually see this bright flash go off in a nearby AGN called NGC5548, and then you see it propagate as it warms up the disk, as all that light is falling onto it, and then eventually you hit the, the, further away, where the dust is, and the dust tends to radiate in an infrared. So we got basically a structure, and you just, you see this flashbulb go off, and then it illuminates, effectively, the structure.","137":"So you do see it, basically the dust sublimation radius, and you see it at, and it tells you, depending on what kind of dust it is, and it's actually one of the problems for me studying, whenever we try and do X-ray studies of low luminosity active galactic nuclei in your, by galaxies, because there're all these X-ray binaries that are also emitting X-rays, which make our lives difficult. But they're also in black holes, when it's this really interesting sort of both, it's great, but ugh, it's also a source of noise for those of us who are trying to do X-ray observations of nearby galaxies.","138":"It's a weird thing to be sitting in your own galaxy, but not be able to separate all these, four million solar mass black hole creating, next to, how massive, it's like two to three solar masses for the X-ray binaries?","139":"Which is great, although it still doesn't help us in the AGN community, because we don't know how the millions to billions solar mass black holes came to be. But it's, at least we're building up, or hopefully that at some point, and by understanding these lower mass, how these lower mass black holes came to be, then we can see where there are a large scale number of mergers can potentially give us this, or you really need something, other, another corridor to fundamentally get us something that's a million solar masses, you know, on the minimum side, but definitely, you know, we've gotten those which are billion. So we know we can merge the million solar mass black holes to get the bigger ones, but how do you get to those in the beginning, particularly so early in the universe, when you get quasars at really high red shifts, so they're really early on.","140":"Which was one idea, but again, it's, I'll leave this to your theoreticians, I think there are problems with that, as well. I call it job security. That's right. (both laugh) We have a lot of things about black holes, both in terms of their formation, or even how they exist as they are, and how they're interacting with their environment that we're still not understanding.","141":"Do you think there are going to be general principles that guide those decisions? Because right now, it's generally up to the machine learning engineer to decide what tools they want to apply.","142":"If you train a model off of language off the internet, it sometimes says uncomfortable things or inappropriate things and sometimes really biased things. Have you ever run into this yourself? And then how do you think about that problem of potentially even measuring the bias in a model that we've trained?","143":"I imagine in the last few years, we've seen a lot of changes and improvements in the capabilities of NLP systems. So is there anything in that that you're particularly excited about exploring further?","144":"So we've been talking about gravity from Newton and celestial bodies, the Earth, the Moon, pulling on each other in the conventional sense of gravity being an attractive force, to the Earth creating curves in space-time, then we moved on to just diffused seas of energy and space-time as the real universe and gravitation is really just talking about space-time in general, and here we are, and you're really hardcore in theoretical physics. Where would you take the exposition of gravity from that point?","145":"So when we think about quantum mechanics, we think about particles and their quantum charges in the Feynman way, the way that Feynman taught us. They come in and they exchange a force carrier and then they come out again, so that's how we think of an electron and light scattering, for instance, or something like that. And the language that Einstein gave us is so different. It's completely geometric, it's all this space-time. And it's also unnecessary.","146":"So when we're talking about the multiverse or the Big Bang, we are really talking about gravity ultimately, and we're talking about how a theory of gravitation which we know think of as a theory of space-time has a quantum explanation, has a quantum paradigm imposed on it that will help us understand these things, and we don't have that yet. One of the things that I think is so amazing is that the terrains in which we're going to understand quantum gravity are very few. It's the Big Bang, because that's where we know that quantum and gravity both were called into action. And there's black holes. One of the most interesting discoveries is of course Hawking's discovery, kick-started a kind of crisis, right? In thinking about why quantum mechanics and gravity were so knocking heads. It was one of the most beautiful examples.","147":"This is the Heisenberg's uncertainty principle in reality. You can't precisely say where the electron is, and you can't precisely say how quickly it's moving.","148":"This idea that the darkest phenomenon in the universe actually is forced to radiate quantum particles is pretty wild. I think everyone understood that it was a correct calculation, but I don't think a lot of people understood the implications, that it meant something really terrible was happening. Because this black hole, which could have been made of who knows what, is disappearing into these quantum particles which, in some sense, have nothing to do with the material that went in. So do you think that's a big crisis? The black hole evaporates, the information is lost?","149":"So this is a huge crisis 'cause either quantum mechanics is wrong, and as you described it, it's the most accurately-tested paradigm in the history of physics, how could it be wrong, right? Or the event horizon is letting information out and violating one of the most sacred principles of relativity.","150":"That's a nice way of looking at it. So that you're not actually violating classical relativity once you're in a regime where the wave function has really peaked around a very well-defined stage.","151":"Yes, so one of the things I like to think of with holography is that I can pack a certain amount of information in a black hole. I mean, you can literally think of it as throwing things into it. So let's say I have information in some volume and I'm under the illusion that I can just keep packing information in that volume, as much as the volume will contain. Eventually I'll make a black hole and I'll find out that the maximum amount of information I can pack into anything in the entire universe is what I can pack on the area. And since area is projecting the illusion, maybe, of volume, maybe the whole world is just a hologram. It's not a principle that only applies to black holes. It's saying that, if this theory of quantum gravity is correct, then this while three-dimensionality is an utter illusion and really the universe is two-dimensional. That's crazy.","152":"Do you think it's possible that gravity is really ultimately just quantum mechanics and doesn't exist at all in the fundamental ways that we've been talking about so far, like the Newtonian way and the space-time way, that those are just these kind of macroscopic illusions? Sometimes I talk about it in terms of temperature. Temperature is not a thing. There is no single thing called temperature. It's a macroscopic illusion that comes from the collective behavior, really quantum behavior of random motions of atoms. And is it possible that the whole of gravity is some kind of emergent illusion from what's really quantum phenomenon underlying it?","153":"Okay, so we'll do some, but I want to tell you a little bit about origami. Most origami follows two, I'll call them customs, almost like rules. It's usually from a square and the other is it's usually folded with no cuts. So these guys are folded from an uncut square.","154":"Okay. We're going to start with a model that every Japanese person learns in kindergarten, it's called a crane, traditional origami design, it's over 400 years old. So, people have been doing what we're about to do for 400 years.","155":"Let's fold it in half from corner to corner, unfold it and then we'll fold it in half the other direction, also corner to corner but we're going to lift it up and we're going to hold the fold with both hands. We're going to bring these corners together, making a little pocket and then, this is the trickiest part of this whole design, so you're going to put your finger underneath the top layer and we're going to try to make that layer fold right along the edge. Now you see how the sides kind of want to come in as you're doing that?","156":"It's called a petal fold, it's a part of a lot of origami designs and it's key to the crane. Now we're ready for the magic. We're going to hold it in between thumb and forefinger, reach inside, grab the skinny point that's between the two layers, which are the wings, and I'm going to slide it out so it pokes out at an angle. We'll take the two wings, we spread them out to the side and you have made your first origami crane.","157":"Now, this is a traditional Japanese design but there are origami designs that have been around so long we're not entirely sure where they originated. We're going to learn how to fold a cootie catcher.","158":"So we'll start with the white side up and we're going to fold it in half from corner to corner, in one fold and now we're going to fold all four corners to the crossing point in the center. We'll fold it in half like a book. On the folded side we'll take one of the folded corners and I'm going to fold it up through all layers. There's a pocket in the middle. We're going to spread the pocket and bring all four corners together. Where you have original corners of the square, we're gonna just pop those out. This is one of the most satisfying moments, I think-","159":"Yeah, but there's something else we can do with this model. If we set it down and push on the middle then pop it inside out so that three flaps come up and one stays down and then it's called talking crow because here's a little crow's beak and mouth.","160":"There's thousands of other origami designs but these are some of the first people learn and this was, in fact, one of the first origami designs I learned some 50 years ago.","161":"And it's because we've had a lot of PR, a lot of proof of concept, but truthfully, this is more like a science, right?","162":"It will develop. It will take five years. It will take 10 years. That kind of time is necessary. One of the areas that brought me to supply chain research is the fact that we're not just gonna see blockchain emerge. We're gonna see artificial intelligence continue to evolve. We're gonna see connective devices and this sort of growing internet of things and machinery that can do a lot more and have a wallet and transact on their own. And so I actually think a lot of where blockchain and other technologies are headed is this interesting synergy that will help us elevate the kinds of institutions we've used in the past and cobbled together to create that identifiable, verifiable trust.","163":"In that it's hard to compare it to some perfect future. Just like you compare autonomous vehicles to this very high standard because machines are doing it. It should be perfect. There should be zero car deaths.","164":"When you say, well, there's hundreds of thousands, millions of car deaths on the road due to human error today. I think we're in a similar place. We're going to see problems with this technology, and we are going to need to develop multiple kinds of standards that also have some flexibility. But it's going to also be a version, a system, that allows us to fix some of the things that are broken today.","165":"Yeah, it's crazy. They're really a lot of bad or malicious hackers out there who are doing just that. They're going into people's accounts and they're stealing money, but there's also another side of computer hacking where there are people who are trying to learn how those bad hackers are actually breaking in to the bank accounts.","166":"Yeah, exactly. They're looking for ways that they can create protection. It's kind of like the lock on your front door. That lock is to essentially prevent bad people from coming in or people accidentally coming in when they shouldn't. A hacker is essentially looking at a way, how can I get into this lock? But then there are the good ones who are trying to unlock it so that they can tell the company that made the lock, hey, we can actually protect people by making the lock a little harder.","167":"That's a very good point. You should definitely make sure that you're obeying the law. They might work with the lock company and say, I'm trying to improve your product. And they're trying to find these holes or problems, and then share that with the company. Even though the good hacker is doing exactly the same thing as the bad hacker, it's the same exact skillset, and you're using the same exact techniques and information to try to break that lock, but your goal as a good hacker is really to help everyone like you and me to make sure that our stuff is protected. So hopefully they don't get in trouble because they're the good guys.","168":"I started going on the computer and playing video games, but I had some ideas of my own, and that's where I started to learn how to hack. I wanted to play with my friends on this video game and just change the way that things look.","169":"When you have creative ideas like that, hacking can actually allow you to change the way a system works, and that means you can change a game and how the game is played, and then you can share that with your friends and other people who like that game. Once I started learning how to do it, I found that, things that were harder for me, I could make easier.","170":"You know, you're right. When you read about some of these technologies, it does feel like science fiction. But the part of nanotechnology I wanted to talk to you about is stuff that you probably use every day, most of your day, all of the time. Can you guess what aspect of nanotechnology I'm gonna talk to you about?","171":"So this is a silicon wafer, and they're embedded in basically almost every object that you use, from a laptop, to a phone, to cars, television sets, appliances. We ended up cutting these into little squares and those repeating patterns, each of those is a processor. And those chips are what goes into all of these objects. What I want to talk to you about is how we got from where we started, and how we're able to actually fit 18 billion of these little devices in a little one inch by one inch area. They're called transistors. It's a switch. Very simply, think of it as a light switch that turns on and turns off using an electric field by applying a voltage.","172":"I went through my kid's Lego bins to build a very simple model of a transistor. And these are wired together in circuits so that you can do computation. You can do logic with them. Where nanotechnology comes into play, the way you double the number of transistors on a chip. Can you guess what you would have to do to this transistor?","173":"Exactly. So these are made using a technique called lithography. You basically coat the silicon wafer with a polymer. Then you put a mask on it and then you shine light through it. And the features of the mask, the size of those holes determine the feature size in the chip. It's not just the size of the mask that matters. It's the wavelength of the light that's used. We talked about nanotechnology being science fiction before, but this is real stuff that's being produced, that's being made, that's being used every day by people.","174":"When you give up most of what you want? Well, sometimes that definitely happens for sure. What if I told you that this is the kind of technology that I work on that means you could trade with any kid all over the world?","175":"That's probably a good idea, maybe somebody else likes it more than you do. So normally, when people trade, they have to go to the store, or they have to know the person so they can get what they asked for. With blockchain, you can make that exact same trade, but you don't need the store, and you don't even necessarily need to know the other person.","176":"So on code.org, one of the things you've been doing is actually building a game or that they have a game and then you can actually rewire some of the inputs and outputs of that. Is that right?","177":"Okay. With computer hacking, it's actually the same thing. Really, you have some sort of system and you have a bunch of inputs and you have some sort of output, and actually you, as the designer, you're essentially designing games and software. You're saying, well, I will only allow a user to really control these inputs. Can you think of any inputs the computer might have?","178":"Yep, there's also things like your mouse and there's even things like the microphone itself is actually an input device. It's taking something from you, which is the sound and it's then transmitting that, ad it's actually sending it to me. Are there any other things that you can talk to a computer? You can give it information.","179":"That's absolutely another input that exists on your computer. That's how I try to think of things is there's just a bunch of inputs. Often, if you're trying to break something or hack something, you're really saying, okay, how can I control these inputs in a way that wasn't necessarily expected?","180":"Typically, it's going to be something like the keyboard, right? I'm just going to be typing keystrokes to be talking to some piece of software or hardware, but other times it can be other things like even the temperature of a computer can actually affect how the computer operates, and it might be advantageous to me to cool down the computer and actually slow down the movement of electrons in something like memory, so that if a computer shuts off, it stores something that wasn't memory like a password and stores it for a long enough time that I might be able to actually extract it through some other methods.","181":"It just depends what you're trying to do. In some cases, it could literally be seconds because you already know how the system works, and other times, it could be years. So what have you learned about hacking?","182":"Well, that's true, we do use slingshot technology once things are out in the solar system. So, for instance, we use Jupiter and other planets so that when some of the spacecraft gets close, it'll slingshot around and it'll cause it to speed up. But mostly, around the Earth, gravity pulls things down, so when we want to send a rocket into space, when we wanna go to the Moon, when we wanna send supplies to the International Space Station, the trick is to get something moving fast enough that it escapes the gravitational pull of the Earth. Have you heard the expression what goes up must come down? It's actually not true. If you throw it fast enough, you can actually get something that doesn't come back down again, and that's basically how rocket launches work. You have to get the rocket for the Earth to go more than 11 kilometers a second. Think of how fast it is. Just one breath and it's gone 11 kilometers. If you get it to go that fast, it's not gonna come back down again. So you know the International Space Station which is orbiting the Earth? That's going around the Earth at 17,000 miles an hour. It has no engines anymore, the engines are turned off. So it's just there falling forever. So once it's out there, it's not coming back down as long as it's cruising like that.","183":"In a weird way, that is gravity pulling it. So have you ever had a yo-yo where you swing it around like this? The string is pulling it in at all times, but you've also given it this angular momentum. And as long as you give it the angular momentum, pulling it in actually keeps it in orbit. And so the Earth is pulling it in at all times, so that's why it doesn't just travel off in a straight line. It keeps coming back around. So it's funny, people think that the International Space Station is so far away that they're not feeling gravity, and that's not the case at all. They're absolutely feeling gravity. They're just cruising so fast that, even though they're being pulled in, they never get pulled to the surface.","184":"Yeah, you feel pinned to that. It's exactly like that. There's something called the equivalence principle where people realized, especially Einstein, that if you were in outer space in a rocket ship and it was dark and painted and it was accelerating at exactly the right rate, you actually wouldn't know if you were sitting on the floor of a building around the Earth or if you were on a rocket ship that was accelerating.","185":"That's because in some sense, you're really not. Imagine you're in this train and it's going near the speed of light relative to the platform, but it's so smooth, then you should be in a situation in which there's no meaning to your absolute motion, there's no absolute motion. So that if you throw a ball up, you might think from the outside of the platform, be confused that when gravity pulls that back down, it's gonna hit you or something, but it'll land in your palm as surely as if you were in your living room.","186":"So imagine you were an astronaut and you were floating in empty space. You can't see anything. There's no stars, there's no Earth. You can ask yourself, am I moving? There's really no way for you to tell. So you would probably conclude, well, I'm not moving. So then your friend Marina comes cruising past you, and maybe she's going thousands of kilometers a second, and you say, Marina, you're cruising at thousands of kilometers a second, you're going so fast. But she had just done the same experiment. She was just floating in space thinking, Am I moving? There's no way to know which one of you is moving and there's no meaning to the absolute motion. The only thing that's true is that you're in relative motion, that's true. You both agree you're in relative motion, and that's clear. But neither of you can say it's actually you who's moving and I'm stationary.","187":"So, let's say you and Marina are floating in space and you can't tell who's moving. Let's say you both see a flash of light. A flash of light comes from somewhere, you don't know where. So you measure the speed of light to be 300,000 kilometers per second. But here comes Marina and she's racing at the light pulse, as far as you can tell. Two cars driving towards each other seem like they're going faster towards each other than somebody who's standing still relative to one of the cars, right?","188":"[laughs] That's exactly right. It kinda is like recharging your battery, right? And sleep is so critical for so many parts of our body and our mind, right? It plays a really important way that we learn, and it helps us kind of recover from the day before. It affects our immune system and our metabolism, all of these things that we need to kinda be healthy.","189":"And so what's really cool about this is that giraffes need to sleep like everybody else, and so the way that it does is it kind of slumps over and it gets down on its legs and it kind of becomes this ball, but what's crazy about the whole thing is they only sleep for like 30 minutes a day. 30 minutes! Because it can't waste any more time, because it can't be vulnerable for any longer. It can get eaten by lions and that kind of thing. It has kind of evolved in a way that it can still survive and still get all the restoration it needs under such a short period of time.","190":"So we think it works the same way, but maybe just like more efficiently. And so we're still really learning about how this works. Sleep science itself is kind of a new field.","191":"Really tired. Do you think you were a little crankier than usual? Yeah. That's actually really interesting, because what happens is humans and everything needs to sleep eventually, and so you can't stay up indefinitely, right? What do you think happens if you don't sleep?","192":"So now I want to talk about our last animal, and I think this one is probably the most amazing of all. Okay, so what's this?","193":"A dolphin! Yes. So dolphins, kind of like hippos, have to sleep in the water, okay? But because they're mammals, right, they need to breathe. Dolphins breathe air. They have to go up to the surface and breathe, right? And for an animal like that, it needs to figure out a way that it can sleep but also still survive, right? You know how dolphins sleep?","194":"Nano is kind of a funny word, right? It's a word that's used before another word, and it means one billion. What's the smallest object you can think of?","195":"If I took this stick and I was to draw 1 billion lines, the distance between those two lines would be one nanometer. So that's really all it is. It's just a measure of size. But it's really, really, really tiny, smaller than anything that we can see with our eyes. The reason why, in nanotechnology, scientists, we care about things that are that small, is because there are objects called atoms. Have you ever heard of atoms before?","196":"That was a perfect explanation. But what if I told you that scientists invented a special type of microscope that not only lets you see atoms, but also lets you move them around and build things with them. Would you think that would be pretty cool?","197":"So it's called a scanning tunneling microscope. And not only can you see the atoms, but you can move them around. Atoms are kind of sticky. You can actually build things using this instrument with actual individual atoms. So if I gave you that machine, would you want to make something? Would you want to look at something very carefully?","198":"I study it because objects that are that small have really interesting properties. They behave completely different than objects that are big. And because of that, we can build really cool things with them. Like really fast computers, for example, or new types of batteries or new types of solar cells. And a lot of nanotechnology is kind of like playing with Legos. You take these small objects and you put them together to build something new. Something interesting that no one's built before. It's like Legos for scientists.","199":"You know an interesting topic is: what are the limits to what we can do with virtual reality? Where I'm pretty pleased with what we have today. What we can show people and say virtual reality, its cool. People get an amazing response from it. But we're still clearly a very, very long ways from reality.","200":"Mostly in VR we talk about the display and optics, the visual side of things, but we should at least tick off the other senses. And haptics is an interesting thing about virtual reality really doesn't have that aspect of touching things. You can move your hands around, you can do everything but its a disconnected experience because you know you don't have an actual solidity there. And I am pessimistic about progress in haptics technology. Almost all other areas I'm an optimist and I'm excited about what's coming up, but I don't have any brilliant vision about how we're going to revolutionize haptics and make it feel like we're touching the things in the virtual world.","201":"Yeah, that is one potential quality improvement that is still on the horizon is when we do spatialization, we use HRTF, the Head Relative Transfer Function, to make it sound like its in different places. But usually we just use this one kind of generic, here's your average human, HRTF function. Its possible, that of course, if you are right in the average then its perfect for you. But there's always people off to the extremes, that it doesn't do a very good job at. And there may be better ways to allow people to sample their own perfect HRTF which can improve the audio experience a lot. It all comes down to all these trade-offs.","202":"There was a huge concern about that at Oculus. And the term internally that went around was poisoning the well. They were very, very concerned. I mean for a long time there was a fight about whether gear VR should even be done, because the worry was if we let a product go out, like gear VR that didn't have those things. That if somebody saw it and it was bad, made them sick, made their eyes hurt, then they would be like I'm never going to try VR again. I tried it that time and it was terrible. And there was legitimate arguments about whether it was even a good idea to do that. And it turned out that yes, its obviously better to have all those things, but you can still do something that's valuable for the user without it. Its weird being at the beginning of a medium like this.","203":"So, when you say it's an inverse-square law, that means that the closer you are, the more strongly you feel the gravitational pull. And that makes sense. There's very few things that are stronger when you're further apart.","204":"So you can also think of a gravitational field, something that permeates all of space. Even though the earth is three stories below us, it's not as though it's pulling at us from a distance. We're actually interacting with the field at this point and there's a real interaction right here at this point. And that's nice, because people were worried that if things acted at a distance, that the way that old-fashioned inverse-square force law describes it, that it was as spooky as mind-bending a spoon, that it was like telekinesis. If you don't touch something, how do you affect it? And so the first step was to start to think of gravity as a field that permeates all of a space. And it's weaker very far from the Earth and it's closer very close to the Earth. So one way to think of this field as a field that's really describing a curved space-time that is everywhere. Forget the difficulty of the math, just the intuition comes from two kind of simple observations. One was what Einstein described as the happiest thought of his life. So, right now, you might feel heavy in your chair, and we might feel heavy on the floor and our feet, or standing in an elevator cab. And Einstein said, what does the chair have to do with it, or the floor, or the elevator? Those aren't gravitational objects. So he wanted to eliminate them, and one way to do the thought experiment is to imagine standing in an elevator that you can see out of, a black box. And imagine the cable is cut and you and the elevator begin to fall.","205":"You're in total free fall. Now, because things fall at the same rate, including the elevator and you, you can actually float in the elevator. If you just floated in the elevator, the two of you would drop, and you might not even know you're falling. You could take an apple and drop it in front of you, and it would float in front of you. You would actually experience weightlessness. It's called the equivalence principle. It was Einstein's happiest thought that what you're really doing when you're experiencing gravity isn't being heavy in your chair, it's falling weightlessly in the gravitational field. And that was the first step, to think of gravity as weightlessness and falling.","206":"You can make somebody look like they're in the International Space Station by flying up in a plane and then just free-falling, the plane just drops out of the air. And while it's falling, they will float weightlessly, and there's been a lot of experiments about it, but you don't want it to end unhappily, so the plane has to scoop back up, and then you see them become pinned to the floor of the plane, because then the plane is interrupting their fall. So that's the first thought, and then the next is, what is the shape that's chased? So if you were floating in empty space, really empty space, and you had an apple, and you threw the apple, what shape do you think it would chase, the path?","207":"Yeah, it would chase a curve, it would chase an arc. And the faster you throw it, the kind of longer the arc. So the second step to think about curved space-time is to say that when things fall freely around a body like the Earth, they trace curved paths, as though space-time itself, space itself was curved.","208":"You went, Oh. [Janna and Lisa laugh] So, that's the intuition, that's how Einstein gets from thinking that space-time is curved from the idea that, well, there's this field that permeates all of space, and what is really describing is the curves that things fall along. And from there, it's a very long path to finding the mathematics and the right description, that's really hard. But that intuition is so elegant and so beautiful and just comes from these two simple thought experiments.","209":"So you described learning in a class about light the theory of special relativity where Einstein is really adhering to the constancy of the speed of light and questioning the absolute nature of space and time. And it seems like that has nothing to do with gravity, but he later begins to think about the incompatibility of gravity with his theory of relativity. So suppose the Sun were to disappear tomorrow. Some evil genius comes and just figures out a way to evaporate the Sun. In Newton's understanding of gravity, we would instantaneously know about it all the way over here at the Earth. And that's incompatible with the concept that nothing can travel faster than the speed of light. No information, not even information about the Sun, could possibly travel faster than the speed of light. So we shouldn't know about what happened to the Sun for a full eight minutes, which is the time it would take light to travel to us. And so he begins to question why gravity is so incompatible with relativity, but he already knows he's thinking about space and time in relativity. So then he gets to his general theory of relativity where he realizes if I eliminate everything but just the gravitational field of let's say the Earth and I look at how things fall and I see that they follow curves, well, then he realizes that space and time don't just contract or dilate, that they can really warp, that they can bend and that they can curve. And then he finds a way to make gravity compatible with relativity by saying if the Sun were to disappear tomorrow, the curves that the Sun imprinted in space-time would actually begin to ripple, and those are the gravitational waves, and they would change and they would flatten out, 'cause the Sun was no longer there. And that would take the light-travel time to get to us to tell us that the Sun was gone, and then we would stop orbiting and just travel along a straight line.","210":"Well I'm thinking about the idea that there might be more than three dimensions of space. What is your impression of theoretical physicists who think about things like extra dimensions of space that they haven't ever seen?","211":"It does. In fact, one way that different universes might be created and be different from each other is that different universes could have effectively different numbers of dimensions. Like we have three dimensions around us, but there's people out there, aliens, who could live in five dimensional universes.","212":"We think that it would be, no all of this is incredibly speculative, and we don't know for sure. But the idea is that there is some deep down underlying laws that are universal and the same, but they show up differently, so they appear different. So the specific particles and forces and masses would be completely different in different parts of the multiverse.","213":"Mm-hmm. So we have quantum mechanics, right? The theory of atoms and so forth and how those work, and then we have gravity, and gravity doesn't seem to fit in. It's the one force of nature that we can't really easily fit into this quantum mechanical framework, so string theory is one of the best ideas.","214":"That's the good news. The bad news is that it only seems to work if spacetime is ten dimensional. [chuckles] So you would say well then it's wrong. It can't be right. Spacetime is not ten-dimensional. Spacetime is four dimensional. We've observed that. But instead, we say if spacetime looks four dimensional to us, but string theory, which might be the best theory we have of quantum gravity says it must be ten dimensional, maybe we can hide those extra six dimensions somehow. So here's how we could get lucky. We could imagine that there are extra dimensions of space that are curled up somehow that are so small that we can't see them. This is actually an old idea. It goes back to Kaluza and Klein right after general relativity was invented in 1915. But there's a more recent idea that says there could actually be relatively large extra dimensions. There could be extra dimensions that are actually that big, like a millimeter across that you would not have noticed. But here's the new, exciting idea. So let's imagine, okay. This is a piece of paper. But let's imagine this is our entire world. So, in other words, our real world is three dimensional, but let's imagine that we're just idealizing it down to two dimensions, so we all live here. You and I live here. But let's imagine that we're embedded in this bigger space. So there are extra dimensions that are actually big, okay? And let's imagine that. When I say we live on this three dimensional world what I mean is imagine that the particles that you and I are made of, right, the quarks, the leptons, the electrons and everything, all the forces we know about, electromagnetism, the weak nuclear force, the strong nuclear force, imagine they can't leave this surface. This is what we call a brane. B-R-A-N-E. Have you heard this word before?","215":"From membranes, you know. We have lines, one dimension. We have two dimensional surfaces. So if you have a line that is a vibrating physical thing, you call it a string, right?","216":"If you have a two dimensional surface that vibrates and is a physical thing, we call that a membrane. Membrane theory goes back, it never was as popular as string theory, but it's been around for a while. But if you had extra dimensions of space, then you can three dimensional vibrating things, and four dimensional vibrating things.","217":"Well basically the strings are the particles that we see. It's exactly the same thing as we said for the straw, if you look at it far away it looks one dimensional. A little loop of string, so a little one dimensional circle that is vibrating. If you look at it from very, very far away, it just looks like a particle. So in string theory, an electron is a little string. A photon is a little string.","218":"It's even better. It's the theory of everything. What would you tell a friend of yours if they asked you what dimensions are, what extra dimensions are, what a brane is?","219":"That's right. And we could live there. The world we see around us, the three dimensions of space around us could reflect the fact that we are somehow stuck on a three dimensional brane trying to escape.","220":"Yeah, that's exactly right. And you can append it. You can sort of add new information that's more current, but you can't actually go erase anything.","221":"We're gonna have to create entire new concepts of how they do trade and how they work with us, too. What kind of barriers or road blocks would you imagine are gonna happen in the blockchain space?","222":"Yeah. One of the problems that Bitcoin has faced is Bitcoins getting stolen or lost. But a lot of that actually comes from people trying to recentralize Bitcoin in different ways making themselves actually a pretty easy target.","223":"Yeah. To actually transition into the mainstream and make it useful for average people to use, we're going to need to make sure we have a lot more education, a lot more standards and probably work with a lot of enterprises to create sort of a user experience around this being a technology that is safe and usable and understandable. What is the current state of blockchain in your understanding? What's gonna have to happen next?","224":"Well, we have a lot of public blockchains. Like we have Bitcoin. We have the Ethereum network and XT, but a lot of companies and consortiums are getting together to build private blockchains, so ones that are more closed off at first and then may evolve into a public network where people feel comfortable using it. And some are also proof of concept out in the real world, projects in energy and in pharmaceuticals and in retail and lots of different fields are starting experiments. And we'll see in the next few years how all of those interact and what we learn about the best use cases for blockchain and what it means for trade.","225":"That's actually, I think a very common problem. We can build a device in the lab it could be a transistor, can be a battery. And then you ask the question, okay, so what's the next step? How do we take it from that lab demonstration into a technology? The kind of work that I'm very interested in is developing tools to make the exact type of materials that you want. The tools that we've used in the past for conventional fabrication just don't work with these materials because they're all grown from the bottom up. They're intrinsically small, and you have to find ways to either use chemistry or some other means to get them to assemble into the structures that you want to actually either grow specifically what you want or after you grow them, to pull out the ones that you want. You need to be able to build that same thing over and over again, with the exact same properties. No one institution, no one research lab, no one national lab is gonna solve all of these problems on their own because they are difficult problems. And there is a real important payoff at the end. And it's gonna take all of us, making our contributions to push this field forward.","226":"The first thing I want to show you is origami in the real world. This is the origami lamp. It comes shipped flat but it folds, clip holds it together. The lamp has LEDs on the inside so when we power it up we get light, we have a lampshade and we get the base.","227":"Origami applications have in common, is that at some stage the thing is flat and so whenever you need to either start from a flat state and then take it to a 3D state, or conversely, for deployables like space, you want to have it in a fully folded flat state but then take it to a 3D state, or possibly an unfolded flat state. Whenever a flat state is involved, origami is a really effective way of making the transition between those states.","228":"New problems arise when we try to make origami out of things other than paper, but also new opportunities. An example here which is a kind of a variant of the Miura-Ori. It's got a three-dimensional structure. If I stretch it one way, it expands the other but because it has these S-bends in the pattern, if you squeeze it, it doesn't go all the way flat. This is a epoxy impregnated aramid fiber and so if I put this fold pattern into it and then compress it and then put a skin on the top and bottom, this becomes incredibly lightweight but incredibly strong.","229":"Another origami challenge that comes up with these patterns is if we're going to make an aircraft out of this thing we're going to need hundreds of yards of folded origami. We're not going to do it by hand and this might be the new frontier in origami engineering, which is the design of machines that can fold patterns that have applications.","230":"When we were much smaller societies, you and I could trade in our community pretty easily. As the distance in our trade grew, we ended up inventing institutions, right? If you Uber or you use Airbnb or you use Amazon even, these are just digital marketplaces and platforms that help us facilitate an exchange of value. But today, we actually have a technology that allows us to trade one to one but at scale, and it's called blockchain technology. There is some kind of interface for it. You could have an app, or you could use a computer to do it, but instead of there being a company in the middle that's helping you make that transaction, it's a bunch of software code.","231":"In some cases, yeah, it is. And a lot of people in the financial industry, in particular, are looking at it from the banking side of how do we use this technology to trade things like Bitcoin or other tokens that are easier to use instead of today's currency. A lot of people think about blockchain as Bitcoin because it's sort of in the news a lot, and it's this new cryptocurrency. And it's kind of exciting. But we're actually seeing a lot more use cases for blockchain that aren't around the currency side. They're more around, how do you take any asset and be able to trade that using this same technology.","232":"So today, a lot of people are working on how to create identity structures that leverage blockchains. And one of the tools for doing that is being able to cryptographically sign for a given attribute. So your government could sign that you have a US passport or a university could sign that you are a currently enrolled student. And you could then dole out that information and control it yourself and be able to show people those certifications on an as needed basis.","233":"Really glad that you could join us. So we've been talking about sleep today, various levels of complexity. But now with you, I really want to talk about what do we know about sleep and the aging brain. Can you tell me a little bit about some of the work that you've been doing in that area?","234":"So within dementia risk in particular, Alzheimer's for instance, there are kind of two clear features that seem to be part of the pathology, right? So there's beta-amyloid which accumulates in the brain, and then there's kind of these tangles, this tauopathies, right? And so it sounds like sleep seems to be related to the tauopathies. What about kind of beta-amyloid?","235":"I'm excited about the future of sleep medicine. I think there are incredible innovations that are happening in the basic sciences, kind of really starting to understand what are the clear biological processes that underly some of these things as they relate to disease risk, and what is the true function of sleep, kind of the why we sleep phenomenon, right?","236":"To figure out how to do that we need to learn a little bit about what makes a point. So, let's come back to the crane. You can probably tell that the corners of the square ended up as points, right?","237":"Yeah, exactly. Actually you've discovered something pretty neat because you made your point not from a corner so you've already discovered one of the key insights. Any flap, any point, leg of the ant, takes up a circular region of paper. Here's our boundary. To make your point from an edge you use that much paper and the shape, it's almost a circle. If we take the crane we'll see if the circles are visible in the crane pattern. Here's the crane pattern, and here's a boundary of the wing, and here's the other wing.","238":"The crane has four circles but, actually, there's a little bit of a surprise because what about this? There's a fifth circle, which is like that, but does the crane have a fifth flap in it? Let's refold it and put the wings up. Well, yes, there is, there's another point and that point is the fifth circle of our crane.","239":"And to do that we use a new technique called circle packing in which all of the long features of the design are represented by circles. So, each leg becomes a circle, each wing becomes a circle and things that can be big and thick, like the head or the abdomen, can be points in the middle. Now we have the basic idea of how to design the pattern, we just count the number of legs we want. We want a spider, if it's got let's say eight legs, it's also got an abdomen, that's another point, and it's got a head, so maybe that's 10 points. If we find an arrangement of 10 circles we should be able to fold that into the spider. So in this book, Origami Insects II, it's one of my books and has some patterns, and this is one of them for a flying ladybug and, in fact, it is exactly this flying ladybug. We've got the crease pattern here in the circles and you might now be able to see which circles end up as which parts, knowing that the largest features like the wings are going to be the largest circles, smaller points will be smaller circles. So any thoughts which might be?","240":"Origami artists all around the world now use ideas like this to design, not just insects, but animals, and birds, and all sorts of things that are, I think, unbelievably complex and realistic but most importantly, beautiful.","241":"It's really fascinating work, especially now we're all familiar with the viruses and how they act. And I'm not aware of any viruses that build nanostructures. So how did you come to that? And then how do you actually program a virus to do your bidding?","242":"So you've evolved, and I suppose, trained these viruses to build the materials that you want them to build by exposing them to the raw materials and then evolving their function. We're talking about the electronics from nanomaterials. That critical issue that we're facing is how do you go from those single experiments with a single material, understanding its properties, how do you scale that to the billions of devices that you need in a technology? It is a chemistry driven approach. We're not going to grow them exactly where we want them, but to take that one step, and to tie into what you're doing, tt sounds like there could be an area of collaboration where instead of using conventional chemistry, that we can train some of these biological elements to do that work work for us.","243":"One of the things I love about about nanoscience is it tends to break up the silos between those traditional scientific disciplines. My training was in chemistry, but I had to very quickly merged chemistry and physics. And now I see an area where chemistry, physics, and biology are coming together to produce new materials and new technology, and to advance the field forward. And so being in this field, you kind of have to cross pollinate between these different disciplines and kind of advance the field together.","244":"Whenever there's a part of a spacecraft that is shaped somewhat like paper, meaning it's big and flat, we can use folding mechanisms from origami to make it smaller.","245":"Telescopes, solar arrays, they need to be packed into a rocket, go up, but then expand in a very controlled, deterministic way when they get up into space.","246":"These are the building blocks of many, many origami deployable shapes, it's called a degree-4 vertex. It's the number of lines. So in this case, we use solid lines for mountain, we use dash lines for valley. We're going to fold it and use these two to illustrate some important properties of origami mechanisms. It's important in the study of mechanisms to take into account the rigidity. So what we're going to do to help simulate rigidity is to take these rectangles and we're going to fold them over and over so that they just become stiff and rigid.","247":"So this is what's called a single degree of freedom mechanism. You have one degree of freedom, I can choose this fold, and then if these are perfectly rigid every other fold angle is fully determined. One of the key behaviors here is that with the smaller angles up here, the two folds that are the same parity and the folds that are of opposite parity move at about the same rate but with this, as we're getting closer to 90 degrees, we find they move at very different rates and then at the end of the motion, the opposite happens. This one is almost folded but this one goes through a much larger motion so the relative speeds differ.","248":"So when we start sticking together vertices like this, if they're individually single degree of freedom then we can make very large mechanisms that open and close but with just one degree of freedom. So, these are examples of a pattern called the Miura-Ori. When you stretch them out they're pretty big.","249":"Yeah, so typically the mechanism will run from corner to corner, to diagonally to opposite corners because then you can stretch it out that way. Notice some differences between the one you have and the one I have in how this one sort of opens out almost evenly but this one opens out more one way and then the other.","250":"And it's exactly the difference between the motions of these two vertices. So these angles are closer to right angles and the closer you get to a right angle the more asymmetry there is between the two directions of motion. And then the other difference is how efficiently they pack, so these started at about the same size but when they're flat notice that yours is much more compact. So if I were you making a solar array, I'd say, oh, I want that one. But if I say, well, I want them to open at the same rate, then I want this one.","251":"There's an engineering trade-off to get them both to work. And there's another place that shows up in deployable structures in a very cool structure. This is a folded tube, it sort of pops out like this but it has this neat property that if you twist it quickly, it changes color. There's a Mars Rover application where they need a sleeve that protects a drill and as the drill goes down, the sleeve is going to collapse and they're using a pattern very much like this.","252":"There are many open mathematical questions and so room for mathematicians, like yourself, to have a big impact on the world of origami and mechanisms. And even though those studies are mathematically interesting, they're going to also have real-world applications in space, solar arrays, drills, telescopes, and more. Any questions or thoughts about this?","253":"Yeah, or in Minecraft. When you look at a TV on the wall there showing like a picture of a mountain or something, how can you tell that its not just a window and there's something else behind it. Because it always doesn't look quite right if you have a static picture of a person on a screen and you move around like this, its not really changing. And its interesting, those are things we have to figure out We need to figure out when you look at something in reality how can you tell whether its real or not. Have you been to a 3-D movie where you put on the little glasses?","254":"Essentially what harmony is, is like a language, right? And so as with any language, the more words you're capable of speaking in a language, the more you can say. All right, so in harmony, this might be how many notes you can think to add to a chord to make it feel a different way. Have you ever heard of the circle of fifths?","255":"Okay, that's great. On one side, we have a lot of the notes which make us feel brighter, you know, like these kinds of, (keyboard music) these really bright sounds. And the other side is a lot more to do with the darkness of a key center. So we're home in F, but imagine we're taking a quick visit to B-flat, but then the sun comes out.","256":"You got it. Ooh! Yeah? Yeah, yeah. So this is really, this is like a gleaming glade or something, you know? Let's play this tune, Amazing Grace. Let's play it in its simplest form.","257":"All right, so we're gonna start in F, right? Yeah. So say. \u266a I once \u266a F, yeah. (Amazing Grace) B-flat, yeah. F. C. F. So we're home.","258":"Just to see how things feel. Yeah. All right, lets do it. (both playing Amazing Grace) So it's F major seven, but its over A. Which is F seven over A. (both playing) B flat major seven with an A and a G in it. F major seven with an E and a D and a G, yeah. (laughter) D minor seven with a G in it. C softs, or minor, nice. B flat major. G seven, F sharp major seven. Home, yeah! I like that. So what harmony does is just gives us even more tools to tell those stories. Cool, yeah. Nice, man.","259":"Oh, very good. You've come to the right place. So we're gonna think about physics. Have you heard the word physics before? Do you know what that is?","260":"Okay. I just think of physics as the study of everything. What stuff is, what stuff does. So today we're gonna talk about space, and in particular the idea of dimensions. Have you heard about dimensions?","261":"And how would you find yourself, like if someone said where are you, could you use some words or ideas to say where you are on that line?","262":"But here's what I want you to think about. If I say I'm at this point on the line, I could translate that into saying I'm at the three centimeter point, if I were here I'd be at the four centimeter point, the five centimeter point, right?","263":"We need one number to tell you where we are. That's one dimension. That's what it means to be one dimensional. I only need to tell you one number to figure out where we are.","264":"There you go. Exactly. We're gonna build a little two dimensional space. You wanna do it? You wanna do the honors here? Why don't you put those two lines together?","265":"So those are the dimensions. That's how we think about dimensions. Remember, we just needed one number to find ourselves on the line, we need two numbers to find ourselves on the plane.","266":"This is why physicists think about things we don't know about. We're wondering whether there could be extra dimensions you've never seen. Yeah. That are tinier than atoms. So, okay. So what have you learned? What do you know about dimensions now? How do you think about dimensions in a slightly different way than you did before?","267":"I think so. I think you're right. All right Hank, we want you to keep up studying, learn a lot of math and physics and help us discover new dimensions some day. Does that sound like a fun idea?","268":"Absolutely. And that's a great example because you have models that are operating to do things like figure out if a new email is spam or not. So what would you think about if you were looking at an email and trying to decide if it went in one category or another?","269":"So these are things we would call features. And we go through a process where we do feature engineering, where somebody looks at the example and says, Okay, these are the things that I think might allow us to statistically tell the difference from something in one category versus another. So for example, perhaps you don't speak Russian, you start getting a lot of email in Russian.","270":"This is a great question because it really gets to the difference between some of our different tools in our machine learning tool belt in addressing problems like this. So if we were to use a supervised learning classic classification approach, a person would need to think about those features and creatively come up with them in approach we call the kitchen sink approach, which is just try everything you can possibly think of and see what works. Unsupervised learning, where we don't have labeled data and we're trying to infer some structure out of the data is you're projecting that data into a space and looking for things like clusters. And there's a bunch of really fun math about how you do that, how you think about distance and by distance, I mean that if we have two data points in space, how do we decide if they're similar or not?","271":"Supervised learning, we have our labels and we're trying to figure out what statistically indicates if something matches one label or another label. Unsupervised learning, we don't necessarily have those labels. That's the thing we're trying to discover. So reinforcement learning is another technique that we use sometimes. You can think about it like a turn in a game and you can play, you know, millions and millions of trials so that you're able to develop a system that by experimenting with reinforcement learning can eventually learn to play these games pretty successfully. Deep learning, which is essentially using neural networks and very large amounts of data to eventually iterate on a network structure that can make predictions.","272":"It is, but it also thrives in environments where you have a decision point, a pallet of actions to choose from. And it actually comes historically from trying to train a robot to navigate a room. If it bonks into this chair, it can't go forward anymore. And if it falls into that pit, you know, it's not going to succeed. But if it keeps exploring, it'll eventually get to the goal.","273":"So typically, you would choose deep learning if you have sufficient high quality data, hopefully labeled in a useful way. If you really are happy not to necessarily understand or be able to interpret what your system is doing or you're willing to invest in another set of work afterwards to understand what the system is doing once you've already trained it. And this also comes down to the fact that some things are actually really easy to solve with linear regression or simple statistical approaches. And some things are impossible.","274":"You build a system that could actually be useless. So years ago, I had a client that was a big telecom company and they had a data scientist who built a deep learning system to predict customer churn. It actually was very accurate, but it wasn't useful because nobody knew why the prediction was what it was. So they could say, you know, Sunny, you're likely to quit next month. But they had no idea what to do about it. And so, I think there are a bunch of failure modes.","275":"Yeah. This is actually a good example of a very real world kind of machine learning problem where the solution to this was to build an interpretable system on top of the accurate predictions not to throw it away, but to do a bunch more work to figure out the why.","276":"It's actually fairly new that we're able to solve all of these problems and start to build these products and apply it in businesses and apply it, you know, everywhere. And so, we're still developing good practices and what it means to be a professional in machine learning. We're really developing a notion of what good looks like.","277":"Sometimes when people get, they worry about connectomics, I think what they're actually worrying about is that it's the end of the that we used to do neuroscience.","278":"So and a musician, how much of it do you think is in your hands versus in your brains? Meaning like, you do have connections in your muscles from the nerves that are from your spinal cord, what if some of the learning is there?","279":"Yeah. We do a lot of X-ray in addition to EM and this is actually, I'm not saying it's the only problem, but it's the only problem that needs to be solved right away, is that the data analysis, right? In fact, I think we calculated that there aren't enough humans ever to map a mouse brain where you collect every connection and et cetera so the problem is to get algorithms to trace, to recognize things in brains the way humans would recognize things in brains, or map things, trace things in brains. It's gonna cost a lot of money to imagine setting the gold standard for the wiring diagram even once and those are the kinds of ethical concerns that I'm worried about.","280":"Good to see you Mike, nice to have you here with me. So we go way back. 1991, the year I got married, I moved across the country, left my husband in New Jersey, to work with you in Livermore.","281":"And I've been talking sort of, started with sort of what is a laser through linear optics, non linear optics, high intensity laser physics, and saying that you know, we're trying to get to that Schwinger limit of 10 to the 29 watts per square centimeter. We're about somewhere just shy of 10 to the 23 I think at this point. But even if we get to 100 petawatts and focus that down to a wavelength, we're not at 10 to the 29. So you're hoping to build the biggest laser.","282":"Okay, but that's kind of cheating. That's not getting to 10 to the 29. If you could do it with 100% efficiency that's all we need.","283":"And that's, like you said, we're stuck a little bit, we're not up to that kind of acceleration, so that would be a Nobel Prize winning possible idea.","284":"Okay so there's a lot of us working around the world on these high intensity lasers and so, what do you think the real fun is? What do you see the real excitement being?","285":"So where people are swiping credit cards, those credit card numbers were stolen. They hired a company to come in and perform a penetration test to see, can the good guys essentially break in again to prevent this sort of thing in the future? And when this team came in, they found they actually were able to get pretty much to the same point of sale system, and the way they did that was by exploiting an internet-connected deli meat scale. Once the company was able to essentially get into the deli scale, because the deli scale was on the internal network, then they were able to really escalate privilege and find a vulnerability within another system. Essentially, that just got them into the network. and once you're in the network, it's often really easy to then escalate from there.","286":"If we were to write a program that asked for your name and you typed in your name, but before you could type in your name, in a low leveling, which is like C or C++, you'd have to allocate some memory. So you might allocate a buffer of a hundred bytes because whose name is going to be longer than a hundred bytes or a hundred character? But what happens if you were to not really check that they limited to a hundred bytes? Do you know what happens if they essentially start typing over that hundred bytes?","287":"But what's really cool about that is, when you're going into memory, you're starting to cross over that boundary of that hundred byte allocation, and now you're starting to write over additional memory. That other memory is really important stuff. So you have your name, the hundred bytes there, and then right next to your name is the return address, and that's the address that the code is gonna execute and it's going to return to after that function is done, and it's going to jump to that address, but after you type your hundred bytes, the next few bites that you type, you're actually going to overwrite that return address. So that return address could essentially be another address in memory. So what you end up doing is you type a name and it's not really a name, it's really just code. And that code, you keep typing until you get to the return address, and you start typing an address, which is really the beginning of your name and your computer or your processor is actually going to read that address and it will jump back to the beginning and then execute that payload. So that was sort of the very first thing that I think was super exciting to me when I started learning about really reverse engineering.","288":"Ever since buffer overflow started many years ago, there been a lot of protection mechanisms built to make it difficult to exploit. More and more, we're actually using smaller and smaller computers with smaller amounts of compute power. If you take a car, you have hundreds of microcontrollers that are all running there. So they don't really have a sophisticated operating system that can try to prevent attacks like buffer overflows. So how do we keep these low cost computers in here while adding layers of protection to prevent malice and these types of attacks? Sometimes it actually is, how can we write software or how can we build a system that prevents these types of attacks from entering? But oftentimes, it's really looking for how can we find new attacks that we haven't even necessarily thought of? What got you interested in computer science and information security?","289":"You brought up China and Iran, and something that's interesting about those areas is really censorship, right? They have essentially censored internet. In the US, we have a really interesting internal struggle here where we actually have government agencies like the state department that are funding software to evade censorship, like Tor and other mechanisms. While then we also have an internal struggle where we have other organizations like the NSA who are specifically looking to break that exact same system that the US government is also funding.","290":"It's good for us to understand how these systems can really break down. Although, I think one thing that I see is that some of, let's say, the organizations that are looking to break this are not necessarily going to share once they actually learn that information. They might actually sort of hold that in their back pocket and use it when it's advantageous to them.","291":"You haven't got to play with lasers. So I brought one. It's my friend's cat toy. Do you ever use a laser as a cat toy?","292":"Well one of the fun things people do with lasers, the cat will try to grab that dot. I'm sure what you have at home is a flashlight. I brought a cute little one. So the question is, do you see any difference between what a flashlight does and what a laser does?","293":"That's true, that laser's just a dot. And so the other thing to notice though is that, like if I shine it in your eyes and I'm sorry if I do! But it seems awfully bright doesn't it? And yet when, you know, you shine this down and you put the laser, which one do you see easier?","294":"One of the things that lasers are great for is that because it's a directed beam, we can actually put that light where we want the light to go and sometimes you maybe just want to see something around the corner and you can't see it. But with a laser, you can actually and this is a smoky one so you can actually watch it go. You see it actually bending the corner?","295":"And that's because the light will go through this glass and, when it hits that corner, it has to bend. And we actually send laser beams down glass fibers, the size of your hair.","296":"You don't have a cat. So you don't need a cat toy no. Have you ever gone to a grocery store and just scanned your objects over?","297":"That's a laser. We cut steel with them now. We actually do surgery with lasers. You know when some people have either scars or birth marks that they don't want to see? We can actually remove those with lasers now. Never seen a laser light show? When they light up the sky with lasers, it's almost like fireworks.","298":"Oh you got to see a shooting star? Well that's cool, that's nature giving you the show there. So what do you think about lasers? You think they're fun?","299":"So the side channel analysis is really looking not at a vulnerability within a system, but really unintended consequences of what the system is built on. A very simple example of a side channel is putting your ear to the ground to hear if there are horses coming towards you, and the same thing applies to technology. So you can have something like a CPU, it's executing instructions, certain instructions that use a little bit more power, and power is reserved in these capacitors, which are like tiny batteries next to your CPU. And as they're pulling power, there's something in physics called the electrostrictive effect where the capacitor will move in a very, very tiny amount. And then although we can't hear it, the microphone on a mobile device can actually listen to that. If you then listen to that and you say, oh, I see a pattern here, and you can go all the way down and then extract and reveal the full password, the full key, even though it could be argued that the algorithm itself, there's no problem with it.","300":"Yeah, I suppose the physical adjacency of the underlying transistors and capacitors that are holding that storage. That's crazy. I think the first time I heard of an interesting attack like that was learning about the cold boot attack. Being able to, you know, someone enters their password on their computer and that decrypts their hard drive and then they walk away. Being able to extract that password is really difficult. If I can pull that memory chip out and extract that memory, put it in my own device, except the problem is memory is volatile, so it'll erase as soon as I pull it out. You can take something like canned air, turn it upside down, cool that computer, make it real nice and cool. Then you have a minute or two to pull out the memory, put into your own device, extract the memory, and then you're good. It's such a simple method to really extract something kind of critical. Like Rowhammer, it's such a low level of vulnerability and you could argue that it's not necessarily a vulnerability in the architecture itself, but rather exploitation of physics at that point.","301":"The risk right now, just during this quarantine, is actually massive now that we think about it, because you might have these legacy systems. You know, they were built 20, 30 years ago, and it's too costly to upgrade, but now you can't actually have a lot of people in a single location, so potentially, they actually do have to now add some sort of remote capabilities to these systems that were never meant to be on the internet. Have you ever had any ethical concerns with the stuff you're interested in or the work you do?","302":"Especially now that we're seeing more and more companies who are trying to make it illegal for you to inspect the vehicle that you've purchased, right? Something that you actually own.","303":"What if it were illegal? Would you then do it? Fortunately it's not today, right? It hasn't been, you know, despite their attempts, none of that has been passed, but if you had a vehicle and you wanted to inspect it, but all of a sudden, it passed, I mean.","304":"But the laws don't always equate to hurting anyone. I ethically think similar to you in that, you know, what is moral to me is as long as I'm not intentionally hurting others, right?","305":"So what if I told you that blockchain technology is basically a tool where you can do the exact same thing, but it goes to you and I directly? You wouldn't need an eBay or a brand in between.","306":"We have a lot of companies that sort of help us make sure that our trades happen, but if we could guarantee the same trade using technology as sort of a technological trust, then we wouldn't really need all those middlemen in between.","307":"It's basically a network of computers that all have the same history of transactions. And so instead of sort of there being one company with one database that holds all the information, the same sort of list is held by all these different people. Like, you could have it on your computer. And then it gets validated by everyone, and basically, that turns into the next part of the list. So it's sort of constantly updating itself.","308":"So it use cryptography, and that helps it basically encode all of the transactions. So you can't really see exactly what happened, but you can know it happened because it's like a marker.","309":"So it's kinda this like really big ledger or accounting system for all sorts of things that get traded, but instead of being owned by one company, it's owned by everybody.","310":"Excellent. I got an engineering physics degree. There you go, something in common. We're here today talking about lasers. So have you have had much exposure to lasers yet at school?","311":"Okay. As opposed to the experimental side and seeing things? Okay so I'm much more, I like to see the things happening. So then the question is, what's so special about making a light that's intense enough to actually possibly blow things up? Certainly we can blow atoms up with the laser hammer and when the laser light comes in and just smacks the electrons right off the atom. And so the question really is how do you make that? Back in the 70s and into the 80s, I know that was a long time ago for you, we had big energy lasers and we had short pulse lasers, we couldn't have big energy, short pulse lasers and actually it was my supervisor and I that figured the way around that and we got something called chirped pulse amplification. Have you heard of chirped pulse amplification by any chance?","312":"Well I brought a little bit of a prop to explain how chirped pulse amplification works. Our short pulses are made of different colors. So I've got a colored slinky here. We probably could've called it stretched pulse amplification but that's kind of boring so we used the word chirped. The word chirped comes around because birds chirp. When the birds are singing, the notes are actually changing audio frequency with time and that's a chirp. The point is is that when all the light is squeezed together like this, it's a short pulse. And that's when it's a hammer because all of the light is now concentrated and you can imagine if this was coming along and also using a lens to focus it small, then all of that light at the focal spot, concentrate. And so that was the laser hammer. So we can't have that in the laser. So the question is what could we do? The fact that it's different colors and different colors because of dispersion, travel different speeds inside material. So we used a long fiber, 1.4 kilometers of fiber but, in fiber, the red colors really haven't got that much in common with the glass atoms and so they spend very little time interacting and they travel fast. The red is going to start traveling faster than the green, faster than the blue and, as you travel down the fiber, next thing you know, you have a long pulse and it's chirped from red at the beginning to blue at the back. And so the frequencies go hoo! Like this okay? So this is a chirped pulse and now it's a long pulse. And so, first this is what we did, we chirped it, we stretched it, then we can safely amplify it because it's not all concentrated and, after we amplify it, then we use something called a compressor and we put all of the colors back together and it was back being a short pulse but a high energy pulse. And then we really had what I like to call a laser hammer. When this laser pulse goes inside, it smacks those electrons right off the atom.","313":"Well a lot of lasers and when lasers first came along, they were only single color. Your cat toy, would only be a single color, probably a red one and so that's just one color. And one color means that it has to really be there for the whole time. One color is one wave length of light and so it's just one wave that goes on and on and on. If you want a short pulse, you actually have to have all the colors. And if you can imagine that one point in time, and I like to say it's like a conductor of an orchestra. When you're listening to an orchestra warm up, they sound terrible, they're all playing their own notes. But when the conductor conducts them, they all play different notes but, together, it's beautiful music. So we have something in the laser called a mode locker and it's like the conductor and it says go now. And all the colors will start together but some colors are long wave length and others are shorter. So next thing you know, you have peaks meeting valleys and they cancel each other. And the more colors you can bring in, the faster that happens and the shorter the pulse you can make.","314":"The necklace is something that was designed for my Nobel prize. It's sold at the Nobel museum and it is a chirped pulse. So we've been talking a lot about lasers and applications, what have you learned about chirped pulses?","315":"One nice emotional device when it come to harmony is just thinking about how to arrive somewhere. You know, it can be so sparse, it can be so rich, and it can be really emotional. So this idea of the overtone and the undertone in the harmonic series, how much do you know about this?","316":"Yeah. The amazing thing about harmony is that it exists in nature. So, take the harmonic series of the note F, for example. Okay. You have the ups on the fifth and the fourth and then the, (hums) That seemed a little bit sharp, but that's fine. And then tones get increasingly small. Beneath that note, you have the undertone series, which essentially is like a reflection of something. In the same way that when a tree grows in nature, you have the branches which grow upwards and the roots which go downwards. So it's quite a nice thing to thing about, this being the key center, the floor, the ground, and then these two different directions of ways in which it can express itself, and the differences in the sensations with that. Lots of the time I think when it comes to reharmonization or harmonization, people think that the solution to the problems come when we add more notes.","317":"I think that people forget that you can work with the notes you already have by just rearranging them, just the simple idea of inversion, inversion of the simple triad, of F major. \u266aI once was lost and now I'm found \u266a \u266a Was blind \u266a \u266a But now I see \u266a Now how home do I want to go here, you know? Is there another verse to come?","318":"Because I can delay the gratification of going home. First of all, just by using inversions, even before we add the notes to the chord. One thing that I was very joyful to discover is that every single melody note works with every single base note.","319":"F major, F minor, D flat major seven G flat diminished, G flat minor major seven, G minor seven, G soft, G seven, G seven sharp 11. And then, G seven with a flat 13","320":"That's it! (laughs) A flat soft, A flat major seven. A flat major seven sharp five, with a sharp 11. Essentially, what that demonstrates is that every note and every base note are compatible. So once we realize this its like, that's great! Now what should we do? What, how, what should we, what should we, how, what am I supposed to do? What to do, right. And sometimes the paralyzing thing when it comes to arranging, there are too many options, too many things are possible. So that's when it becomes super, super important to be aware of what you wanna try and say emotionally.","321":"So essentially, the way I'd apply negative harmony would be this idea of polarity, you know, between the overtone series and the undertone series, or you know, the one side and the other side. The perfect and the play goal. The feeling of a minor perfect-- (keyboard music) Resolving, it's so moving, you know? And it's a good alternative to something like, (keyboard music)","322":"Exactly, yeah. No, for sure. And, you know, F major can be something you arrive in from, if you arrive in F major from D flat, then it's like the sun's come up.","323":"So, there's a lot about context, I think. Once you have a language, it's about using it and applying it in those emotional ways. I think that's what makes the difference.","324":"That's good, that's a great place to start. There are cells in your brain. Those brain cells are connected by wires to each other. Electricity travels down those wires and communicates from one part of the brain to the other part of the brain, and each of those brain cells makes, you know, a thousand connections, it's something like a hundred trillion connections.","325":"I would say that that map also has your feelings in it because, here's why, your feelings, most neuroscientists think, come from your brain anyway, and amazingly, whether when you feel happy or sad or angry or scared, that's just brain cells communicating with each other.","326":"This is where it gets really crazy. Could we simulate that map inside a computer and would that computer then be thinking like that original brain from which we made the map?","327":"Like how can that possibly be? What I wanna do is prove to you that I know this combination without revealing the combination to you. And what you could do is you could write a little note, a secret that I definitely wouldn't know. Fold it up, stick it in here. And then, if I know the combination, I should be able to open it and tell you what you wrote. All right. There we go. All right. So,My dog is named Doug. Did you figure out what the combination was?","328":"So you're asking like, why shouldn't I just share my secrets with somebody? People don't trust each other. And if I was able to prove that I've done something correctly to someone without having to reveal my secrets, then that person would trust me more.","329":"What would you guys do? You'd probably first get together and like, figure out some secret code, right? And then like, write messages to each other in that code. But what if you've never met the person before? What if you wanna exchange secret messages with me and we've never met each other before? How could we possibly do that?","330":"But it's not. You wouldn't use like, a physical lock, or a physical box. We would instead use mathematics to do these kinds of things. You could take a message and encrypt it using mathematics. And then, I could prove to you that I know the key, I could open it up, and send it back to you. That way I would be proving to you that I know the mathematical key to the mathematical lockbox. So based on what we've discussed today, in your own words, what is a zero-knowledge proof.","331":"Is there any particular memory for you that you feel has been either kind of influential in your, in deciding which areas to pursue or that you feel is sort of emblematic of what it is to have a memory?","332":"I've got one too. I was nine and we were at the science expo in San Francisco. Two scientists were dissecting an eye, a cow's eye. And I was like that is the coolest thing I've ever seen. And something about that that carried me forward. Something happened so long ago, it left some long lasting trace through neural circuits and it continues to shape the decisions we make about what to study and what to do.","333":"So we're interested in the idea that memory is kind of a pervasive force that shapes all our behaviors. And we're trying to understand how different kinds of memory are organized in different structures of the brain. And then to understand how those different structures work together to orchestrate complex cognitive behaviors like decision-making or reasoning and thinking.","334":"Yeah, you know things are kind of breaking down in unexpected ways I'd say. I think there's been a lot of really great work out of multiple labs showing hippocampal activity related to behaviors that don't look anything like episodic memories, but which might depend on episodic memories right? So for example also when you're making a decision about how to choose between two good options that suddenly you might see activity in the hippocampus related to the choice itself, others have found that you find activity in the hippocampus not only when people are forming memories, but also when they're imagining events that are gonna happen in the future. So it kind of forced us to rethink the way we define what the hippocampus might be doing in a way that can account for creating memories, thinking about the future, making decisions and other kinds of behaviors that involve what we would refer to you in the field as relational processing. And that raises all kinds of new questions about what memory really is. Reminiscing about our early influences that made us want to be scientists is that, you know, of course we know, we know better than to think that those are necessarily accurate memories. You know this reminds me of sort of the classic example from literature when people talk about memory of course is Marcel Proust's Madeleine in Remembrance of Things Past. Where in the book it's this taste for the, for the protagonist this taste of the crumbs of the Madeleine cookie and the tea that bring him back to his childhood. You know, seven volumes then emerge of memories of, of that childhood. Digging further into earlier drafts of Proust's novel that initially it didn't describe a Madeleine at all.","335":"You know I think these imperfections, I interpret them as an indication that the role of memory is much less about being accurate representation of the past and much more about being kind of a flexible compass into the future.","336":"I love math for the same reason. Today, I'm gonna tell you about a thing called zero-knowledge proof. So in a zero-knowledge proof, there are two people. There's a prover and a verifier. And I wanna prove that something is true to you. But the weird thing is, I wanna prove to you that it's true without telling you any reasons why. I remember when I first heard about it, I was like, wait, what? How can that possibly be? Right?","337":"But what if I could prove to you that I know where the puffin is without revealing to you where it is? Let me show you. I took that photo that we showed you. And I put it behind this poster here. Why don't you go take a look through that hole?","338":"So when you look at this board, we don't know where the photo was, right? Was the photo like with the corner here? In which case the puffin would be all the way at this side. Or was the photo with the corner here? In which case the puffin would be on the other side. So this is a really simple example of a zero-knowledge proof. I convinced you that I knew where the puffin was, but you didn't learn anything else.","339":"When I first learned about them, I just thought they were so cool. But it turns out they're also really useful, not just for finding like, puffins. If you just type in your password and the hacker hacks into the computer, they can just get your password. Right?","340":"What if instead, we could somehow use a zero-knowledge proof to log in. You would just be able to prove that, hey, I'm Chelsea, without revealing anything to them. If you could do that, then it would be amazing, right?","341":"Because then even if the hacker hacked into the computer, he wouldn't learn anything. Because even the computer doesn't learn anything. So Chelsea, in your own words, what is a zero-knowledge proof?","342":"Yeah, that's absolutely right. So infinity gets used a lot of different ways in mathematics. There's a way that mathematicians think of infinity as a number, just like the number 13, just like the number 10 million. So the reason that mathematicians consider infinity to be a number is that it is a size of a set. So the first example of an infinite set in mathematics is the set of all counting numbers. So one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, et cetera. That list goes on forever. That is an infinite set. And to be a little bit more precise, it's a countably infinite set. But as a number, infinity is pretty strange.","343":"Absolutely. So now I'm gonna make this story a little more complex. That there's another Hilbert's Hotel down the street and they're having plumbing issues and we need to find room for them.","344":"They can't live together. That would be a great solution. I don't know. I think these people don't really get along. So I need to somehow create infinitely many new rooms, but I can only ask each person in the hotel to move a finite distance away. So let's take the guest who is originally in room one and move them into room two. So that's creating one new space for us. And I'm gonna take the guest who was originally in room two and move them into room four. Are you starting to see a pattern here?","345":"Yeah, I'm increasing by one more each time. So I'm doubling the room number in fact. So this is some of the strange arithmetic of infinity. So we have two Hilbert Hotels, each of which have infinitely many guests, then this is equal to?","346":"So when I'm teaching calculus and talking about concepts like limits and derivatives, those are only defined precisely with infinity. Teaching algebra, which is meant in a different sense about number systems, we deal with infinite families of numbers in their operations. Infinite sets are somehow very exotic. They're not found so commonly in their real world, but they're all over mathematics.","347":"It describes something in AI, which is that things that are really intuitive and easy for humans, are actually really difficult to build into AI systems. And on the flip side, picking up an object, really simple for people, but it's actually really difficult to build that into robotic systems. So do you have any experience working with robots or other AI systems?","348":"Yeah, exactly. One thing that my research has been looking into is, if we can have robots learn from data, we'll collect data from the robot sensors. And if the robot has sensors in its arm, to figure out the angle of one of its wrist, for example, then we'll record that angle. And all of the robots experience will go into a data set, that if we wanted a robot to solve a task, like, I don't know, picking up a cup, and then maybe you want to pick up a different cup, if it only had the data of picking up the first cup, do you think it would be able to perform well on the second cup?","349":"So you can think of robotics as having two core components. One is perception, being able to see and feel and so forth, and action, where the robot actually figures out how to move its arm. And both components are really essential, and both components are quite difficult. If you train a perception system independently of how to choose actions, then it might make errors in a way that mess up the system that selects actions And so if you instead try to train these two systems together, to have it learn perception action for the goal of solving these different tasks, then the robot can be more successful. One thing that's really difficult about robotics is, there actually isn't that much data of robots in the world. On the internet, there's all sorts of text data, all sorts of image data that people upload and write. But there isn't a lot of data of doing a simple thing, like tying your shoe, for example, because it's so basic. One challenge is even just getting data sets that allow us to teach robots to do these simple kinds of tasks.","350":"That's a great question. I think we should be able to accelerate the data collection process by having robots collect more data autonomously on their own. And by doing that, we might be able to overcome some of the challenges of Moravec's paradox.","351":"The Mandelbrot set or the Julia set, you know, the idea is always, oh, I'm gonna apply some polynomial over and over again. Z squared plus C or something like that. When I think about fractals, I try to get away from these very specific examples and ask, what is it fundamentally that makes a fractal, a fractal. And one thing that I think you can be precise about, even if you can't really say exactly what a fractal is, is you can talk about this idea of fractal dimension. Have you ever heard of that?","352":"Yeah, great. So, so the real physical paper has some amount of thickness, but when we model this mathematically, we might ignore the thickness and say, yeah, this is really just kind of a two dimensional sheet of paper. And then you have your apple, how many dimensions is the apple?","353":"So it's not quite as solid as the apple, but it's also not quite as two dimensional as the original sheet of paper. And so for this reason, people associate this crumpled ball with a fractal dimension, maybe something like 2.5 dimensions instead of two or three, there are a lot of different definitions, precise definitions of fractal dimension. But I think the one that's easiest to understand is this thing called box counting dimension. You have, let's say an image and you want to decide what's the fractal dimension of this image. So what you're gonna do is you're gonna count the number of boxes, or you can imagine big pixels of this image that cover the boundary of this shape. And you're gonna see how does that counting compare with how the counts work for just an ordinary shape? So, so if I have a straight line and I start out with one big box that covers the whole line, and now I shrink my boxes by a factor of two, I just make boxes half as big. How many boxes will I need to cover that line?","354":"But if you take a more interesting shape, some kind of fractal shape, like let's say the coastline of great Britain and you start doing this box, counting experiment, something really interesting happens as you make these boxes smaller, the number of boxes you need to cover the coastline grows faster than it would for just a straight line.","355":"And so what this box counting is getting at is saying, well, I still can never decide what the length of the coastline is, but what I can do is I can see how quick does the number of boxes grow relative to how it would grow just for an ordinary one dimensional curve, like a line or a circle.","356":"So procedural computer graphics, which kind of came out of thinking about fractals is one answer to this question about how do you add more detail without for instance, consuming tons of memory or requiring artists to paint ultra detail the textures. So if, if you can instead describe at least some aspect of what you're looking at in a procedural or recursive way, then you can add as much detail as you need when you get close to objects.","357":"Yeah like perlin noise is a great example, right? Perlin noise was one of the early ways of synthesizing additional texture at any level of detail that you needed to make things look natural and realistic. I have a, a random question. Do you know how the research into fractals began? You can look pretty far back in history to see kind of glimmers of this idea of fractals in science in the 19th century, people were trying to look for examples of things in mathematics that were very unnatural. So there was, for instance, this guy named Georg Cantor, who was showing that you can have these sets with really strange properties, or you can have functions with really strange properties. This thing called the devil staircase and so on. And it wasn't until about a century later where someone named Mendel Brock said, Oh, actually this strange mathematics that was meant to show how unnatural things can happen is actually a perfect description of things that really do happen in nature. And from there, people really ran with it and said, Oh, okay, well, if these fractal descriptions are good for nature, we can also use that for creating really realistic and believable pictures in computer graphics.","358":"Exactly. So, Moravec's paradox is something that means that these really simple things, like stacking cups, is really, really hard for robots, even though it's really easy for us. While robots are actually really good at really complicated and really difficult things. Think about the task of multiplying two really big numbers together.","359":"this really specific combination of zeros and ones everything that your computer does showing you pink panther videos on youtube calculating things searching the internet it does all of that with a really specific combination of zeros and ones which is crazy right that would be like saying your computer only understands these quarters for each quarter you need to tell it that you're going to use heads tails and you assign it heads or tails so i can switch between heads and tails and i can switch the zeros and ones in my computer so that it represents what i wanted to represent like an a and with quantum computers we have new rules we get to use too we can actually spin one of our quarters so it doesn't have to choose just one or the other","360":"yeah they can especially if doing your homework involves calculating something or finding information but what if your homework was to discover something totally new a lot of those discovery questions are much harder to solve using the computers we have today so the reason we're building these kinds of computers is because we think that maybe one day they're going to do a lot of really important things like help us understand nature better maybe help us create new medicines to help people","361":"So actually, in the blockchain space is one of the spaces where we are seeing zero-knowledge proofs being implemented. And I think it's just the beginning. Let's talk about zero-knowledge proofs. At its core, a zero-knowledge proof is an interaction between two people. Then I should be able to convince you that some statement is true, but you won't have any idea why it's true.","362":"And the way we're gonna approach this is through something called NP-completeness. What an NP-complete problem is, it's a problem that's really hard to solve. But if you can solve it, you can solve any problem that's in the class NP. And that includes a vast number of problems. And what we're gonna do is we're gonna use an NP-complete problem to actually prove an incredible variety of statements through a zero-knowledge proof. And the specific Np-complete problem that we're gonna be looking at is called map three-coloring. Okay, so here we have a map. Okay. And these are a bunch of countries. And we've arranged them so that no countries that have the same color share a border. That's what makes a map like this validly colored. And now you might think, well, why should we care? It turns out that whether or not a map can be three-colored in this way is an example of an NP-complete problem. And it turns out that, you know, maybe what you really wanna do, is you wanna give a zero-knowledge proof that you have at least 0.3 Bitcoins, right? That would be cool.","363":"Without revealing what the address is of your account. It turns out I can take that statement that I have at least 0.2 Bitcoins, and convert it into a map of countries. And that map of countries will be three-colorable like this only if you have at least 0.2 Bitcoins.","364":"Of course, the first step is we have to erase all the colors. What I've done is I've put a color inside each of these envelopes. Now, how do you know that it's a valid coloring? You don't. Right? You have to pick any two neighboring countries. You can pick them however you like. At random.","365":"Right? So you have a little bit of confidence, right, that I have managed to color this correctly. but not that much confidence. 'Cause I've only shown you two of the countries.","366":"But as you'll see, now it's not green, it's blue. And this one on the other hand, is green. Okay. The colors I showed you last time, don't work with these new colors, right? This wouldn't have worked before.","367":"Exactly. Right. But it works for this coloring that I'm showing you right now. So what we've done is we've made it impossible for you to put the pieces together. And if you do this, let's say, a thousand times. And if I correctly showed you different colors, each thousand times, you'd be really convinced. And that's it. That's the entire zero-knowledge proof.","368":"It's not about making something more efficient. It's about doing things that we just didn't know how to do before. I can actually prove to you without revealing to you any of my secrets that I use to behave honestly. Right? I could prove to you that I signed some encrypted document correctly. Right? Without revealing to you what that secret document was. That ability to change the game. Like, really just change what we can do is what zero-knowledge brings to the table.","369":"One great example is like in elections. If you could prove that an election was correctly conducted. That every vote was counted, and it all added up to one person winning with a particular total, in zero-knowledge, then you don't have to give up the actual votes of any person. And yet everyone could see that, hey, yeah, it was done correctly.","370":"I'll grant you that Hilbert's Hotel does not exist. For me, infinite objects absolutely exist. And I can't read the thoughts in your head, but I have a high degree of confidence that we have a lot of the same ideas about infinity.","371":"I mean I think that's another common misconception about mathematics is that it's so far removed from the humanities, for instance. I mean it's hard to ignore some of these philosophical questions, particularly when we're talking about certain things like infinity. And I think one of the most difficult things to really be precise about and to explain to students is the continuum hypothesis. What do you say to students about the continuum hypothesis?","372":"It's pretty amazing, right? Because it happened like a year or two ago. Our memory is basically a record in our brain of something that happened in the past, but that record it created isn't perfect. So that day, do you remember was the pool at your hotel?","373":"Yeah, that's a great insight. Basically we can't remember everything. So when you tell us this memory of that vacation and your brain is able to kind of play almost this movie of a memory, a moment, a day that you had in your life a while ago, where do those memories come from?","374":"The hippocampus is a part of your brain that if you kind of took it out and looked at it, it looks a lot like a seahorse and it plays a really important role in creating those kinds of memories that help you two years after your vacation share with me what happened that day, all these details of that day. There's another part of the brain. It's actually also important for memory and it's called the amygdala and it is important for keeping all the kind of emotional processing going for memory. So memory for things that are really scary, it's gonna talk to the hippocampus now and get that memory to be really strong. Why do you think it might be important to remember scary things?","375":"You got it. And so we don't just remember everything and we don't remember random things. We remember the things that matter to us the most. So Abigail based on our conversation today, can you tell me what is a memory?","376":"Right? Yeah. So that's already a really good idea of what a fractal is. It has some really, really interesting detail at all, scales that makes it hard to talk about standard quantities like lengths and areas and volumes.","377":"Yeah, so if you look at kind of the wrinkly surface of an asteroid, each one of those little wrinkles adds a little bit to the surface area. And so it's really hard to say, what is the area of an asteroid? Let's take a look at a little example of where fractals actually show up in nature. What we're gonna try to do is we're gonna try to say what the length of the coastline of great Britain is. So we're gonna start out with the blue ones, which are spaced further apart. We're gonna ask you to connect the blue pins with a piece of string so we can get a measurement of the coastline. So we have our first measurement of the length of the coastline, and we're gonna do it over again. But this time we're gonna use the white pins, which are spaced closer together. So we measured the coastline again. And what do you think happens?","378":"I think I agree with you, but I think to really validate our scientific experiment, we should probably compare the length of the string. A lot of extra slack in that pig of string. So what we noticed with great Britain is we were never able to measure it's length. It just kept getting longer and longer. This is called the coastline paradox where there's not really one definite number you can assign to the length of the coastline, but it depends on how you measure it. Like if we kept going to really get this to be accurate, we might have to like actually go down the beach and start measuring these tiny little details along the coastline. But really there's so much detail. We would probably never get a definite answer for how long the coastline is. Fractals also give us a really nice language. We're talking about how smooth or rough some kind of shape is. And actually a lot of people, engineers and scientists use this idea of fractals and this language of fractals to compare different shapes, not in terms of their size, but in terms of their roughness. So based on everything we talked about today, how would you describe a fractal to somebody in your own words?","379":"Yeah, totally.  Like it's a shape that you can't use sort of the ordinary language that we use to talk about shapes you really need some other ideas or concepts to talk about.","380":"Our topic today is quantum sensing. So quantum is about the study of stuff that's really, really, really small and sensing is about measuring. So the word sensing comes from kind of like our senses. So do you know what your five senses are?","381":"Touch, exactly. So it's kind of really important for us to be able to have these senses, so we know what's happening in the world around us, right? In doing quantum sensing is we're trying to measure things that can be hard to see. Let me show you. Can you see inside it with your eyes?","382":"You wouldn't be able to see into the middle. If you had the right tools, you could start to think about ways to look inside the ball without cutting it open. That would then, you'd still have your ball. We could still play with it.","383":"For example, we want to go inside, let's say the human body and see what's happening. Sometimes we can look under the surface of the Earth and see what's underneath it. We can make really, really precise clocks that will tell us, that can measure time really, really accurately. And we can make very, very fine measurements that'll tell us about the rules of science and how the world works around us. But we need to build better tools that allow us to do that.","384":"Yeah, I started out doing magnetic resonance, studying things like bone and biomedical magnetic resonance. Ended up playing with spins for a long time and the physics of spins just fascinated me.","385":"In a way, it's part of the same continuum. What you're doing is changing the technological platform and you're actually able to probe it more sensitively. The resolution you're able to get is much higher, so you can see smaller signals in a much smaller volume.","386":"You have to be close to it. You can detect it optically because if we tried to detect the magnetic moment of the electron, we wouldn't be able to do that because there, the energy is too low compared to thermal energies. But what the diamond system gives you is a natural up conversion in energy. So you can couple into an optical photon, which is then much easier to detect a single optical photon than it is to detect a micro wave.","387":"One of the key challenges, I think for all, any quantum technology is really understanding what limits your coherence times. And then the next question that comes up often is how do we make this better? So if I take a single qubit or a single spin, there's a certain limit up to its sensitivity. But if I can take entangled spins, in principle, I could make the system much more sensitive, but it usually comes at a cost 'cause when I entangle something, it's much more sensitive to de-coherence as well.","388":"I think as you said, you know, anything that interferes with my signal is noise, but it can come from different sources. In some ways, the operation of the quantum system itself, as it's sensitive to different physical phenomena, the ones that I don't like, I call noise. The ones I do like, I call signal and that's an artificial definition that I'm making when I choose to build a sensor. One of the challenges we have is, we're trying to figure out if I wanna control it, where is it coming from? I remember we had experiments running in our lab one day and we were running these experiments about 100 megahertz. All of a sudden, we saw these big spikes coming in and we realized we're picking up the local FM stations.","389":"And that was a source of noise, like, it's completely random, but it is still there. And then the other form is very much what is intrinsically within your experiment itself because some of the materials that you have have defects that are coupling into your sensor, into your quantum system and are also producing noise.","390":"Right, it could give you information if you read it out, about what's happening or you have to find smart ways to suppress it so that you can focus on what you really do care about.","391":"So one of the things that we're interested in is looking at, suppose, I want to build an entangled quantum sensor, when I put a number of spins together, in addition to being sensitive to an external field, they're sensitive to each other and they start talking to each other. You don't just see the external spins, you see the fluctuations of all the other spins in your system. So what you wanna do is make sure that they don't interact with each other, but they still stay sensitive to everything else. And there, you could think about the local interactions, the magnetic interactions between the spins as a form of noise. In some ways, it's interfering with what you wanna measure, which is the magnetic field outside the sample.","392":"I would tend to agree that I think, in some sense, anything that uses superposition could be a quantum sensor, but then spectroscopy uses superpositions and has been around for 60, 70 years. I think what excites me most now is the idea that can we push the boundaries of how sensitive one can make this technique? How improving sensitivity, specificity, what other limits and we define it better, are there fundamental physical limits?","393":"Right. People bring in very different perspectives into what used to be a very niche field. I remember in physics, you'd only talk to people in your subfield and now we're picking up the phone and talking to people in the different departments, completely different areas and we're forced to learn different languages.","394":"it's something that we've already figured out for classical computing like something that amazes me is all the parallels between what we're going through now for quantum computing and what we went through for classical computing","395":"exactly so i think something that frustrates a lot of people about quantum computing is the concept of decoherence right you can only keep your information quantum for so long right and that limits how many operations you can do in a row before you lose your information","396":"it let's talk about some of the things we think need to happen between now and fully fault tolerant quantum computers to get us to that reality i mean there's so many things that need to happen in my mind one of the things we need to do is build all these different layers of abstraction that make it easier for programmers to come in and just enter at the ground level you know","397":"you know now that everybody around the world can access a quantum computer through the cloud people are doing all kinds of cool things they're building games we've seen the emergence of quantum gains right what do you think people want to do with them","398":"Yeah it looks really blocky. And it's the same thing not only with shapes and games, but also colors and textures. And this is an especially a big problem in virtual reality because you have no control over where people are gonna go. What they're gonna look at, how close they're gonna get to various objects. So fractals on the other hand are these things that have infinitely, you know, nice details you get closer and closer and closer. And so this is something that can help us solve this problem in computer graphics of generating more detail. One of the reasons why fractals are really nice for computer graphics is because the algorithms that we use to draw images also have this kind of recursive flavor. What's recursion?","399":"They're easy for a computer to execute, right? It just has to run this recursive procedure over and over and over again. We can kind of get as much detail as we want or need. When I think about fractals and kind of what they've done for computer graphics. The example I think is subdivision surfaces. Did you, did you encounter subdivision surfaces in your graphics class at all?","400":"So subdivision surface is a way of describing a smooth shape on a computer rather than some complicated fractal shape. So meshes and computer graphics are usually made of these flat polygons with kind of sharp edges. And so the question is how can I get something nice and round and smooth out of these sharp looking polygons? What I can do is I can start cutting one at a time, the corners of this paper off, it still looks very angular. I still have these really sharp points.","401":"Because I want to draw a smooth curve on the screen, but all my computer can do is draw straight lines. And that's actually too true of GPUs. It's kind of interesting. GPUs are basically really fast machines that can only draw one thing and that's a flat triangle. And so if we keep doing this with our paper, you kind of get pretty quickly the idea of what's gonna happen. So when you go to see a Pixar movie, for instance, every surface has been subdivided down. So you have tiny little triangles called micro polygons that are even smaller than the size of a pixel.","402":"Well, because people who really need to use these subdivision services for everything, people who worked hard over the years to make this super, super fast. In fact, subdivision services were invented basically at Pixar. There's this guy, Ed Capel, and he was harshly responsible for one of the most famous kinds of subdivision surfaces called Capel Clark subdivision surfaces. And in fact recently won the touring award for these subdivision services.","403":"So we've, talked a little bit about the positive features of fractals and procedural graphics, which is you can write one simple recursive program and the computer creates a lot of detail for you. So that's really nice, right? It's saving you a lot of work, but the downside is you lose a lot of control. So because the only thing you're describing is this short little program, you don't have complete control over how this is gonna end up. And so adding more controllability to procedural graphics is something people have been thinking about for many years. So how has our conversation changed your understanding of what fractals are all about?","404":"Okay, back into the 1960s, there was a research agency in the United States called DARPA, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency. Actually, it was called ARPA at the time. They wanted to build this notion of a packet-switching network. Not a circuit switch network like a phone network where you get a dedicated path and a dedicated set of bandwidth and links from source to destination.","405":"There's a lot big, right? And so remember, this was a Department of Defense, was they wanted to have forms of of communication that were very robust, that were survivable. Packets could all find their own ways, be routed differently through the network. So if parts of the network failed, you could route around failures.","406":"So you can sort of see how the network architecture that wasn't designed to be 100% reliable inside the core of the network, and had that complexity built into the edges of the network. And to me, the really cool thing is you put this infrastructure in place, and then all these super creative people think about amazing things to build on top of it. And you see this proliferation of amazing applications.","407":"Ah ha! Spoken like a real computer scientist, right? You're a computer scientist. I'm a computer scientist. We talk about APIs, application programming interfaces. The API for the internet is something called a socket. And a socket simply says, I can communicate if I know your internet address, you know, 128.119.40.186, that number is the IP address of my server, the University of Massachusetts. If you know that, you can write a program anywhere in the world and send a message, and it'll pop out at my end.","408":"In terms of tenfold speeds of increases, depending on what device you're using right now, it's available, all you need to do is upgrade. So the Wi-Fi protocol's called 802.11. And this is sometimes a source of confusion for people. How can it be that I've got a connection at 100 megabits per second from our TV into our router? 100 megabits per second not enough?","409":"Exactly, right. And maybe they're dropped in your apartment, but much more likely, they're dropped because of congestion somewhere between the Hulu or the Netflix or the Disney server, if you're watching a video, and your home. So even though you've got 200 megabits per second on that last hop, you don't have 200 megabits per second from the server into your apartment.","410":"So I study spins. And so, spins are one of the platforms that people have suggested is a useful platform for building quantum technologies and I study spins on the solid state. And one of the platforms I work on is nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond.","411":"So in some sense, the phenomena we're studying essentially is nuclear magnetic resonance or electron spin resonance which is a very similar phenomena, but uses the spin of the electron rather than the spin of the nuclei.","412":"So that's in some ways the key to both quantum sensing, as well as quantum computing. It's the idea that you can take a system and put it in a superposition of two states. Normally we think of classically a bit can be a zero or a one. So switch is either on or off. Whereas in a quantum system, it can be in what's called a superposition. So it can be partially on and partially off. But one of the challenges with quantum systems is that these superpositions are really hard to maintain because we don't see superpositions in the world around us. In quantum computing, you try really hard to isolate everything so that you can maintain this quantum property and the fact that it's actually going to lose its quantum properties as it interacts with the world also makes it a great sensor because now you're actually, you're using that fact that it's interacting with the world to say, wait, it's sensing something.","413":"So rather than trying to build a lot of complex algorithms and gates with it, what you do is, you take these quantum bits and you take them out into the world and say, what do you see? What are you sensitive to? So you can use an idea called entanglement to make an even more sensitive quantum sensor, but it's even more fragile. So there's always this trade-off between being super fragile and being super sensitive at the same time.","414":"So entanglement is the idea that two particles are correlated. They're essentially in the same quantum state, so that you can't disturb one particle without disturbing the second particle. And so, if I have a large number of quantum sensors that are entangled, then they're all going to interact much more strongly than if I just had one of them interact at a time.","415":"In some ways, it is and you know, atomic clocks are remarkable devices and being able to measure time that precisely has really important consequences. In fact, our old GPS system is based on the accuracy of atomic clocks. They're a set of satellites, each of which has an atomic clock on board and they send out a timestamp and so, once it gets a signal from three different satellites, it can triangulate and figure out exactly where you are. Now, if you could make those clocks even more precise, you could actually accurately position where you are even more accurately.","416":"So some ways, you know, when atomic clocks were designed and built, we didn't necessarily think of GPS, but technology often works that way is that, there are new discoveries and then someone else comes along and says, hey, this is a great tool for some other application.","417":"Well, we're gonna be talking about computers here today, and we're gonna be talking about the internet. I always like to think of the internet by analogy to say road systems for example, where you have roads in your neighborhood. You have state roads, you have the Interstate Highway System. And so the internet is a lot like that. It's an interconnection of local roads, local networks like the network in your house for example.","418":"Wow. Great question. Often, it's a little blue wire called an ethernet cable. So that cable is able to bring bits of information up into your apartment at say, a billion bits per second. That's pretty fast, right? Literally a wire that goes between a box in your apartment, sometimes called a router or a modem in your apartment that comes from an internet service provider come into this first network and then that network connects to another network connects to another network connects to another network.","419":"We could talk about that by analogy to a road system. It's not just one big, super highway. It's a lot of smaller super highways that are all interconnected. And those interchanges are what are called routers. That's where the links come together. You're talking about talking to a friend in Australia. So oh, it's coming in from the East Coast of the United States to this router, and it's going out say, that routers in San Francisco, it's going out on an underseas cable over to Australia rather than in this direction up to Japan.","420":"The underseas cables are so cool! They're these big cables that are laid down by switches. They cross both the Atlantic, the Pacific, the Indian Ocean. So the undersea cables are how the networks in Europe, United States, Asia are all connected together.","421":"That's really what we call the first hop. It's like from your phone, from your tablet, from the computer that you're on, there's no cables coming in. You go over a wireless connection. Wi-Fi is the protocol that allows your computer to talk to that first hop router over a wireless communication link.","422":"Ah, you said they're all in one spot. In fact, they're in lots of spots in Netflix. And so most applications would like to connect you with a server that's close to you. Server is really just a big computer with a lot of memory, a lot of discs that store all the Netflix movies, and also so that you don't have to cross over too many internet links to get from where the server is to the TV or the device in your home.","423":"Ah, another great question. There's a couple of things that could happen inside the internet. Information is sent in these little packets of information from the Netflix server to your display device. And literally, each packet that arrives says, This is the first packet for Jenna. This is the second. This is the third. This is the fifth. This is the fourth. And they're reordered for you. Matter of fact, your computer will say, using the TCP protocol to the server, Hey, I didn't get packet four, can you resend it again? And again, the Netflix server is very happy to send you packet four again. The other is the internet protocol. If you think about sending letters through the US Postal Service, how you've got an address on it. So every packet that flows from the Netflix server to you has an address on it. It says, This is going to Jenna. It's going to the what's called the Internet Protocol address of your device. Think of all the range of devices that are hooked up to the internet. It's totally amazing, right? Every single one of them has one thing in common, and that is they speak the IP protocol, the Internet Protocol. That was a great question.","424":"That's the computer science brain thinking right there. So we wanna think of a function as procedure or mapping between sets. So a function defines a one-to-one correspondence if it defines a perfect matching between the elements of its domain set and the elements of its output set. We call such functions bijections or isomorphisms. So the reason I'm so interested in this idea of a bijective function or a one-to-one correspondence that guarantees that every element of one set gets matched with an element of the other set, no matter how many elements there are, these bijections or these one-to-one correspondences as they help mathematicians reason about infinity.","425":"Maybe two. Why not? Because now we're starting to make progress on matching all the negatives. We can match the natural number three with the integer two, the natural number four with the integer minus two. And do you see a pattern?","426":"Great. So now I have a much harder question. So we have the same challenge, again, evidently there are way, way, way more rational numbers than there are integers. Does that mean this is a larger infinite set than the integers? What do you think?","427":"So I'm going to use this picture to count the rational numbers by actually counting the elements of this larger set because it'll be clearer geometrically. What I've drawn in this picture is the integer lattice. So Z cross Z refers to the set of all of these dots. So I'll start by counting the number at the origin, and you can see I'm just labeling the dots around the origin, moving in a counterclockwise fashion and getting progressively further away. And this process could continue, but maybe by now you see the pattern, though it'd be a little bit difficult to describe as a function.","428":"Yeah, that's exactly right. And now for each pair of integers, I'm gonna represent it by a corresponding natural number. That's what's going on with this counting. And when I compose those operations, what I've done is I've encoded rational numbers as natural numbers in a way that reveals that they can be no larger, there are no more rational numbers than natural numbers.","429":"Exactly. That's exactly right. So we were hoping to compare the size of infinity of the rational numbers with the size of infinity of the natural numbers. What we've done is introduced an intermediate set, these pair of integer points, and this proves that this size of infinity is smaller than this size of infinity. Since we also have an injective function the other way, this size of infinity is smaller than this size of infinity so therefore they must be the same size.","430":"Now there's one final collection of numbers that we haven't yet discussed, which are the real numbers, all of the points on the number line. Do you think that's the same size infinity?","431":"Georg Cantor proved that it is impossible to count all real numbers like we've just counted the rational numbers or just counted the integers. This is called the cardinality of the continuum, it is uncountable. What I'm going to do now is form a new real number that I guarantee is not on this list. Okay, so here's how we do this. What I'm gonna do is I'm gonna look at the diagonal elements. So I'll highlight them. This continues forever, and now I'm going to form a new real number by changing all of these.","432":"Great. That's exactly right. So what we've proven is that this number is missing, and therefore it is impossible to define a bijection between the natural numbers and the real numbers.","433":"So we've started to explore some of the counterintuitive properties of infinity. On the one hand there are infinite sets that feel very different like the natural numbers, the integers, the rational numbers that nevertheless have the same size or the same infinite cardinality. While there are other infinities that are larger. So there's more than one size of infinity, not all infinities are created equal.","434":"Really glad you asked me that. There's a practical implication for computer science. Alan Turing, he came up with a mathematical model of a computer, something called a Turing machine. So Turing was wondering is it possible to compute every real number, an arbitrary real number to within arbitrary precision in finite time? He defined a real number to be computable< if you could calculate its value, maybe not exactly, but as accurately as you'd like in a finite amount of time. And because there are uncountably infinitely many real numbers, but only a countably infinitely many Turing machines, what that means is that the vast majority of real numbers are uncomputable. So we'll never be able to access them with a computer program.","435":"yeah this whole infrastructure is all about creating levels that get progressively colder as you go from top to bottom down to the quantum chip which is how we actually control the state of the cupids","436":"so you can have constructive interference and you can have destructive interference we have constructive interference you have amplitudes wave amplitudes that add until the signal gets larger and if you have destructive interference the amplitudes cancel by using a property like interference we can control quantum states and amplify the kinds of signals that are towards the right answer and then cancel the types of signals that are leading to the wrong answer so given that you know that we're trying to use superposition entanglement and interference for computation how do you think we build these computers","437":"so step one is you need to be able to have an object or physical device we call it a qubit or quantum bit that can actually handle those things can actually be put into superpositions of states you know two cubit states that you can physically entangle with each other that's not really trivial right and things in our classical world you can't really entangle things in our classical world so easily we need to use devices where they can they can support a quantum state and we can manipulate that quantum state atoms ions and in our case superconducting qubits we make qubits out of superconducting materials","438":"it's a perfect question i mean it's very early for quantum computing but we're building assembly languages we're building layers of abstraction that are going to get you to a point as a programmer where you can interchangeably be programming something the way that you already do and then make calls to a quantum computer so that you can bring it in when it makes sense we're not envisioning quantum computers completely replacing classical computers anytime soon we think that quantum computing is going to be used to accelerate the kinds of things that are really hard for for classical machines","439":"simulating nature is something that's really hard because if you take something like you know modeling atomic bonding and electronic orbital overlap instead of now writing out a giant summation over many terms you try and actually mimic the system you're trying to simulate directly on a quantum computer which we can do for chemistry and uh we're looking at ways of doing that for other types of things there's a lot of exciting research right now on machine learning trying to use quantum systems to accelerate machine learning problems","440":"I can also ask how big it is, which is a question about its volume. If I make it smaller, then what's happening is it's becoming more dense. So imagine I crushed this really, really small. It would weigh the same, it would have the same mass, but it would be much more dense.","441":"If a star is heavy enough to explode into supernova what's left begins to collapse under its own weight. And if that's heavy enough, the core will not be able to stop collapsing, 'cause it no longer has the thermonuclear fuel, it's run outta fuel. And if it's run outta fuel, it's no longer shining and pushing outward. And without that it itself begins to go dark and there's nothing fighting the collapse anymore. And that's when you form a black hole.","442":"Well, that's a really good question. So interestingly, the sun itself isn't heavy enough. So it has to be heavy enough that when it begins to collapse, it just overcomes all attempts to fight it. If you made something really dense, you would have to travel faster than the speed of light to actually escape. That's 300,000 kilometers per second.","443":"It is taking other stuff, but the funny question was like, if I wanted to move your chair, you'd think it was really strange if I didn't have to come near you and actually grab the chair and move it. One of the things Einstein thought about is he imagined that what the black hole is doing is it's changing the shape of space around it. What do you think of that idea?","444":"Isn't it crazy? And then Einstein goes a step further and thinks, well, what black holes must be doing is curving the space so strongly that even light gets caught. Sometimes you can get light caught into a whole orbit, literally the light going round and round in an orbit.","445":"So one of my main research areas is something called category theory, it's been described as the mathematics of mathematics. It's a language that can be used to prove very general theorems. And an interesting aspect of being a researcher in category theory that doesn't come up as much in other areas is that we have to really pay attention to the axioms of set theory in our work. When you're proving theorems, have you ever used the axiom of choice?","446":"So there are three well-known famous equivalent forms of the axiom of choice. The well ordering principle is the assumption, the axiom that any set can be well ordered, but there are lots of subsets of real numbers that do not have a minimal element. So that ordering is not a well ordering. So here's the key question. Do you believe the axiom of choice?","447":"You do believe the axiom of choice, though it leads us to some strange conclusions. So if the axiom choice is true, then it's necessarily the case that there exists a well ordering of the reals. And what that means is that we can perform induction over real numbers like we perform induction over the natural numbers. This is trans-finite induction. It would work for any ordinal. So there must be some uncountably infinite ordinal that represents the order type of the real numbers. And this allows us to prove some crazy things. Imagine three-dimensional Euclidean space. So the space that we live in, extending infinitely in all directions. So it is possible to completely cover three-dimensional Euclidean space by disjoint circles, so infinitesimal circles, disjoint circles of radius one. So what that means is you can put a circle somewhere in space and then put a second circle somewhere in space that can't intersect with the first one because these are solid circles and then another circle can somehow cover every single point in space with no gaps in between.","448":"So Cantor's diagonal argument can be abstracted and then generalized to prove that for an arbitrary set A, its power set has a strictly larger cardinality. And since that's true for any set, we can just iterate this process. When set theory was being discovered or invented or created in the late 19th century, one of the natural question to ask is can there be a universe of all sets? This comes up in my research in category theory because even though there is no set of all sets, we would really like for there to be a category of sets. So what category theorists need to do to make their work rigorous is to add additional axioms to set theory. One of my favorites was introduced by an algebraic geometer Alexander Grothendieck. This is something that we sometimes call a Grothendieck universe, or also an inaccessible cardinal. It's an infinite number that is so big that it cannot be accessed by any of the other constructions within set theory. It's so big that we'll never get to it and this allows us to contemplate the collection of all sets whose cardinality is bounded by this size that will never reach.","449":"We're used to ethernet cables that can handle many hundreds of gigabits per second over a wired device. What are the typical data rates for IoT devices? I mean, not hundreds of gigabits.","450":"My sense is you're spot on, that they'll produce over time, a lot of data. And that a lot of IoT is about computing on that data. That computation happened mostly at the edge, or somehow a combination between the edge and something happening in a far away data center.","451":"If you can already predict the answer, then you must not be gaining any knowledge by that interaction. This insight of being able to predict the future accurately, and that being an evidence of a lack of new knowledge,","452":"Right. Sometimes. I mean, for example, in medical research, how amazing would it be, right, to be able to have a drug, and be able to prove that my drug works in this model.","453":"in a zero-knowledge way, without any interaction, right. I can just take the program, convert it to a zero-knowledge program, or an obfuscated program, and then just send it to you.","454":"We're definitely at this moment now, where zero-knowledge is gonna be used more and more. There are so many conferences and meetings that occur in the zero-knowledge space, where you and I are not invited. Because it's for the people who are developing. You know, the people who are programming, not us mathematicians.","455":"It's a great question. I wish I could see the future. I can't actually, but let me try. The part of that that I'm the most comfortable answering is of course the mathematical side.","456":"Yeah, and probably nobody is. Have you heard a lot in your studies about these super massive black holes that we think lurk in the centers of very nearly every galaxy?","457":"Yeah, I think it's a really good question. The only mechanism that we know for sure can form black holes is to collapse of very massive stars. So it's sensible to think, well maybe some very massive stars in a young universe collapsed under their own weight and then they merged and after some time they got big enough, but the black holes from stars can be tens of times the mass of the sun, maybe hundreds of times to the mass of the sun if they merge. To get to millions and billions, and if you just do the simple arithmetic of how many years that would take, there aren't enough years in the 14 billion years of the universe's lifetime. So they must have come from somewhere else.","458":"Yeah, I think that's right. I think people are really perplexed about how you make something so big in such a short period of time. It's kind of funny, the bigger you make a black hole, it seems maybe counterintuitive, but the less dense the material has to be out of which you make it. So you can, out of something the density almost of air, you can make a supermassive black hole. You can't make a star out of that, but weirdly, if you skip the star phase altogether, it's conceivable that they directly collapse. And so there's suddenly a new way to make black holes that nature has figured out.","459":"There might be many alternate routes. It might be in the very early universe that bubbles in unusual phase transitions from very high energy universe to a low energy universe can make black holes. Like, we haven't really thought of the range of possibilities.And so there could also be primordial black holes that are still around that also skipped the star stage altogether that were formed really in the very earliest phases. And I think the interesting thing is, with your looking at like the Large Magellanic Cloud, is to wonder if we're gonna merge.","460":"We work a lot right now on thinking of black holes as batteries. So a black hole that can take, like a giant magnet, astronomical magnet in the form of another collapsed star, like a neutron star, and flip it around so fast, near the speed of light, that it actually creates an electronic circuit out of this moving magnet. And so that the power that can come out of these electronic circuits created by these batteries can be tremendous.","461":"It's a great question. I once did a calculation of using a black hole made out of the moon and the strongest magnet we could find on Earth to see if I could make an electronic battery. And honestly, you only get about enough energy to power New York City. But we have to find one in our neighborhood first.","462":"So Claire, we've had this pretty fascinating conversation about supermassive black holes in particular. And after our discussion, what is it that has changed for you in your perspective or what is it that excites you?","463":"and actually machine learning is one research direction where we're really hoping that we're going to find um key parts of the machine learning computation that can be sped up using quantum computing","464":"you can change the magnetization to be pointing up or pointing down right quantum systems we're still manipulating a device and changing the quantum state of that of that device you can imagine if it's a spin that you could have spin up and spin down but you can also if you isolate it enough you can have a superposition of up and down","465":"so what we do when we try to solve problems with a quantum computer is we encode parts of the problem we're trying to solve into a complex quantum state and then we manipulate that state to drive it towards what will eventually represent the solution","466":"so you need a chip with qubits each qubit is a carrier of quantum information and the way we control the state of that qubit is using microwave pulses you send them all the way down these cables and we've calibrated these microwave pulses so that we know exactly this kind of pulse what this frequency and this duration will put the cupid into superposition or we'll flip the state of the qubit from zero to one or if we apply a microwave pulse between two qubits we can entangle them","467":"there's sort of two main classes of quantum algorithms there's algorithms which were developed for decades right things like shore's algorithm which is for factoring grover's algorithm for unstructured search and these algorithms were designed assuming that you had a perfect fault tolerant quantum computer which is many decades away so we're currently in a phase where we're exploring what can we do with these near-term quantum computers and the answer is going to be well we need different kinds of algorithms to really even explore that question","468":"yeah they also unfortunately require fault tolerance right now the algorithms that we know of today to do those things um on a quantum computer require you to have millions of error-corrected qubits today we're at like 50. it's actually amazing that we're at 50. there's things that we know or we have strong reason to believe um are going to be faster to do on a quantum computer and then there's things that we'll discover just by virtue of having one","469":"i'm glad you're interested i think the place where lots of people can get involved right now is by going and trying it out and thinking about what they could do with it there's a lot of opportunity to find these near-term applications that are only going to be found by trying things out","470":"One thing I find really fascinating about robotics is that the things that are so simple for us, like feeding yourself broccoli, so second nature to us, are really hard for robotics. When you try to take a robot and train it to do a task and simulation, and the simulation isn't perfectly accurate, it's really hard to actually model the physics of how tofu crumbles.","471":"I think I have a somewhat similar perspective to you in that, if we provide more structure and support, and sort of forms of prior knowledge or experience in the algorithm, that should make it more efficient. And so if we can acquire those kinds of priors about the world and about interaction from previous data, maybe offline data, then I think we should be able to make learning of new tasks more efficient.","472":"It's a really, really hard problem. A lot of simulators, they don't simulate the world as a fine enough time granularity to really accurately capture things like skewing an object, for example. One thing that I think is promising is to try to not build simulators entirely from first principles, from our knowledge of physics. But instead to look at real data and see how real data might inform our simulations and try to build, allow robots to build models of the world, build simulators of the world, based on data and based on experiences. There's a little bit of a chicken and egg problem, because if we wanna use simulators to get lots of data, and we also need data to get good simulators, then there's no way to get around this.","473":"So a fractal is something that we see every day, but it's a little bit hard to describe. It's it's a shape that if you look at it really far away, or you look at it really up close, it has kind of a similar appearance. And actually that word fractal sounds a little bit like fraction.","474":"And that's kind of what we're gonna try out today. In fact, we're gonna have you build a fractal. A tree is a really good example of a fractal because if you look at the whole tree and then you break off a big branch of the tree.","475":"We're in level five now. So you're the expert-expert. I'm a huge fan of the work that you did in RCP, the Routing Control Platform being a precursor to software-defined networking and the notion that rather than having protocols actually always compute things, that we could compute things in data centers. I'd be interested if you could sort of just reflect back on that time and sort of the beginnings of SDN and where it's come since then.","476":"Right, so some people have called that the flattening of the internet, right? I think it used to be on average, you would go through 10 different networks to get from a source to a destination.","477":"I mean, even you could just tell that two people are communicating even though the traffic itself is encrypted. So you don't know what they're saying, just even knowing two devices are communicating.","478":"You know, we've had cellular networks now for 20, 30 years. So when we hear about 5G, what's trumpeted the most is the fact that oh, super high bandwidth, right? But I sense that the exciting things are more than just the network being faster.","479":"So that's a great definition and I wanna pick that apart a little bit. So what you described is just right. Stars, when they run out of thermonuclear fuel are gonna collapse under their own weight. It'll explode in a supernova, it'll leave a core, and if the core itself is heavy enough, it will keep collapsing. It does, as you say, reach this point where not even light can escape. But the amazing thing is it leaves that point, you called it rightly the event horizon, it leaves it behind kind of like an archeological record because the start itself can no more sit at the event horizon than it can race outward at the speed of light. So the core of the star keeps collapsing and where it goes nobody knows. So in a weird way, the black hole isn't anymore a crush of matter. It left it behind in its wake, but the stuff of the star is gone.","480":"It turns out that there are only three quantities that define a black hole, its electric charge, its mass, and its spin. So the most general black hole can also spin and it can also be electrically charged. Whether or not they are has to do with how they formed. If a star collapses, it will likely be spinning when it collapses and the remnant black hole that formsbwill likely be spinning. A black hole of a certain mass, charge, and spin is indistinguishable from any other black hole with those same properties. So in some sense, they're like fundamental particles, which makes them absolutely exceptional for any other astrophysical object. Have you heard the stories about what happens inside a black hole?","481":"So from the outside, if you're an astronaut, you're watching your friend, another astronaut going into the black hole, it's as though your times become rotated relative to each other. So the profound thing is as an astronaut on the outside, looking at this round event horizon, you think of the center of black hole as a point in space, but to the person who's fallen in, it's not a point in space at all, it's a point in time. The singularity, or the end of it all, the crush in the center of a black hole is in their future. So they can no more avoid the singularity than you can avoid the next instant of time coming. So the death in the singularity is inevitable. Although we don't really think the singularity necessarily exists.","482":"So the singularity is definitely predicted in Einstein's general theory of relativity and that's purely a theory of spacetime. And in the theory of spacetime, there is no question that a singularity would form when the star collapses catastrophically inside the black hole. Now, even when people talked about singularities back in the '60s, they thought, you know, quantum mechanics is part of the story of the whole of physics. It's not just gravity. And if we understand quantum gravity we'll realize that singularity probably doesn't ever actually form.","483":"I would say to some extent we don't know for sure. What we have found is that the mathematics is so unbelievably powerful that we're able to disprove wrong ideas just in pen and paper. Just very recently, within the past couple of years, the first ever human-procured image of a black hole showed us what we expected to see of the event horizon. So Jayda, after our conversation today, what would you say a black hole is?","484":"There's this domain of black holes in astrophysics where we see stars collapse, and we know that they exist and there's whole observational astronomy around them. And then there's this domain that we're talking about, where, as you said, black holes are so special because they're kind of guiding us in the right direction to understand the very nature of reality. And that makes them really unusually special. And one of the things I wanted to draw out is that we talk about the fundamental forces of nature. So there's the matter forces, and then the outlier is gravity. We've quantized all the matter forces in a way that we're rather comfortable with. Gravity keeps resisting quantization of gravity itself. And now we're thinking in a way that you're describing that, well, maybe it's only the quantum forces altogether.","485":"It is amazing in the numerical simulations of two black holes merging, you really see the event horizons bobble around. And we were talking earlier about how really black holes are flawless, they don't tolerate those kinds of imperfections. And so you can so quickly watch the system wring away that misshapen merger. And it comes out in the gravitational waves, which is literally the ripples in the shape of spacetime until it settles down, and then it's utterly flawless again. It really happens fast. It's quite amazing.","486":"Right, and it allows you to prove that you've been behaving honestly, without revealing any of the secrets involved that you use to actually behave honestly. So we of course know that zero-knowledge proofs for NP-complete languages plays such a huge role in cryptography. I'm curious. What was your first experience with Np-completeness like?","487":"Exactly. Right. Because random is unpredictable and that's what we want. Right. We want that unpredictability around us to be utilized, to actually hide the information that we wanna hide. How have you used your knowledge in the projects that you've worked on? What are the challenges that you find?","488":"And also in the blockchain space, for example, if you wanna speed up the generation of proofs, if that could be done in a distributed way, then that would be great. One of the hopes that I have is that the power of multi-party computation is about bringing people together who are mutually distrustful.","489":"Sometimes, you know, memory is doing something much simpler but no less important for us, which is it's helping us figure out what's good and what's bad. And if we can remember what's good and what's bad from what we did in the past, that can help us make decisions about what to do next time. So Dylan, you may be surprised to learn this, but we asked your mom what some of your favorite candies are. So you have to make a decision between these two candies and whichever one you pick, you actually get to take with you.","490":"There you go, there is your decision. Okay, you can take those. It took you some time there. You looked like you were really working hard at that problem. And that's interesting because actually we know that from research that when people have to make a decision between two things they like equally, some people like economists think oh those are the easiest decisions because they're both good options. But as psychologists and neuroscientists we know it's the opposite. One of the reasons is because there's no simple answer of like I know that one's better I'm just gonna go with it. And so we think that that's the kind of decision where memory is especially important because you have to kind of come up with more information.","491":"Everything you just said is exactly what we know from research. All the thoughts running through your mind, were really at kind of about a prediction into the future, right? You're like, how, how will this taste if, when it's in my mouth or how will I feel about my decision down the road? You know we think of memory as something in the past, but it's an example of how you use your memories of these two candies to predict what's gonna happen in the future so that you can make a decision in the present. But you did it, you made your way through that torture. And now you've got to keep the candy.","492":"We fluctuate a lot because we use different kinds of memory to kind of resolve the uncertainty basically every time. But also the way we make decisions will change because our memories change. What's interesting about your brain as a teenager is that we know it's actually a phase of life where the brain is especially sensitive to rewards, to things that are exciting and positive. It's a phase of life where those rewards, whether it's candy or your friends or whatever it is that's exciting can have an especially powerful control over the decisions you make and the memories you create.","493":"The internet is, physically, these computers that all talk to each other. Billions of computers, in the case of the internet. The internet allows us to do a lot of really, really interesting, what we call applications. You ever think about how that video gets to you over the internet?","494":"Matilda. All right. We're gonna actually build an internet. I've got a couple of things here that I wanna show you, or a couple of toys, actually. Okay, let's pretend that these round balls are computers. And the internet is something that connects them. And right now, the internet is just one communication link. And Matilda is sent over the internet from this computer to your computer. So the internet is a network for carrying information from one computer to another. Now this network here looks pretty simple, doesn't it? Right? It's just one thing. Should we add some more friends in?","495":"That's right. So that's pretty cool. There are actually lots of different ways to actually go through the internet to get from what we call a source, the place that's sending the information, to the receiver, the place that's actually gathering the information together. And that's something we actually call routing.","496":"Exactly. So, Skylar, that was a great discussion about what we just built. And I wanted to talk to you about, or ask you about maybe one other really important part about networks. And it's not so much the thing itself, the physical thing, but more about the rules about communication. That's governed by something that are called protocols. Are you up for one?","497":"Lettuce go on. [Skylar and Jim laughing] A knock, knock joke is an example of a protocol, right? The computer that you are using say, makes a request, you ask for something, you get something in return. In the internet, there are protocols everywhere. So that two computers that have never talked to each other before know the rules for talking to each other. This global internet with billions of people using it are just lots of smaller networks that are all hooked together to each other. But also, what the internet allows are all of these what we call applications, Zoom, video playing services, can all run on top of the same internet.","498":"It's a great analogy. You know I remember when I first learned of your work, for me as somebody who studies learning and memory, which are processes that are all about rapid updating that to me was really mind blowing that we can now start asking questions about dynamics of circuits on a timescale that's much closer to the timescale of human thought than anything we had before.","499":"We now think of the hippocampus so much in terms of memory but really some of the earliest work in neuroscience on the hippocampus talked about the role of the hippocampus in spatial navigation. And it really exposed I think one of the deepest questions in memory research, or at least from the neuroscience perspective is like, well what is the connection? What is the connection between spatial processing and memory? And why is it that neurons in the hippocampus when an animal is navigating a maze, why is it that there's spatial specialization there? I really do think that this notion of a mental model, a generative model is where those, where memory and space meet.","500":"Memories as models or models first and memory as part of what helps build the model starts generating new predictions. Exactly the kind you just brought up or other ways of thinking about things because an efficient model needs to let go of information, right? I just heard a colleague of mine joking about the fact that the principles of neuroscience textbook keeps growing and growing. And that if we had enough strength in theoretical neuroscience, if our models of neuroscience were good enough, that book should shrink back. We know that memory retrieval is essentially construction. And so you don't need to store all those separate memories. You need to construct them. But if you have a good model, let go of all those details and just construct them to feel as if it's a memory. But really all you're doing is using the model to fill the details. It's kind of like the matrix, you know.","501":"Getting way out there, but, but it is a way in which if you have the right model, it should be an efficient one. I'm wondering what you, what you think about what all this means for kind of a redefinition of what memory is, in many ways a revision or expansion of that notion. Would you be willing to try to help me think about how to define it?","502":"I agree. I think, you know, as you were speaking I was thinking maybe the most important word to replace there is record. Record implies an etching of something as it was. And maybe what we need instead is that it's a model, it's an approximation, it's an abstraction that can help us create the illusion of constructing your record. But that it's the model that's the important thing that drives the whole thing.","503":"So a lot of times stars are born together in two star systems and when they die, if they're heavy enough, they will collapse under their own weight and form a black hole. So here you have a black hole and a big fluffy star. And what will happen is it'll start to tear apart its neighboring star. Literally parts of the star will begin to spill onto the black hole and splatter on the black hole. But let's say both those stars formed black holes. And what these black holes do is they are like mallets on a drum. They create literally waves in the shape of spacetime as they're moving. So imagine mallets on a drum, how the drum ripples. Depending on how the mallets are moving you hear different sounds. So effectively these black holes, as they get very close together in the final stages of their life together, they're orbiting each other at hundreds of times a second. It's this really crazy event, but it's happening in complete darkness. Eventually they bobble together and they merge and then they wring out, the spacetime's going crazy around them, it's this storm in spacetime, and they settle down to a quiet black hole. Then those waves that they created travel through the universe, basically undisturbed. For a long time people thought, well, even if black holes are out there, they're impossible to observe. And then they got very clever. You might wonder how we could possibly hear black holes, that sounds crazy. So I'm gonna show you, but I'm gonna need your help. This demo involves an electric guitar. Do you play at all?","504":"Okay, you wanna do the demo for me? So the LIGO instrument electronically records the ringing of the shape of space with its very complicated instrument. It stands for Laser Interferometric Gravitational-Waves Observatory and the design was incredibly difficult and they didn't know if they would succeed. I think of the instrument as like the body of the electric guitar. And then they take the readout of the motions of the waves that they're recording, just like that guitar is recording the motions of the waves on the string. Now just play it like a little bit. And you can't hear anything, right? You're not meant to hear an electric guitar when it's not plugged in. What's happening is the guitar strings are ringing, but so quietly that we can't actually hear the sound. And this is like the gravitational waves, which are ringing the drum of spacetime, but so quietly that they're not move the air and we're not hearing them. So now play and I'm gonna turn the volume up a little bit. While I can't actually hear the ringing of the strings themselves, I can hear the data of the shape of the string recorded and played through this amplifier. And that's kind of the idea behind the LIGO instrument.","505":"It's a great question. If I didn't see you playing the guitar, I would recognize the sound of a guitar. And even if I had never heard of a guitar before I could figure out the frequencies that the string was playing, I could tell how strongly it had been plucked, and I could tell the length of it and where it was pinned down from the harmonics of the string. And I can tell the different lengths of the strings from the notes that they play. So I can actually reconstruct the instrument that's playing it. And it's very similar to LIGO, we can listen to the notes, the amplitude, the harmonics, and we can deduce the size and shape of the objects doing that. And they're very massive and they're very small and they have all the markings of a black hole.","506":"It's a really good question. Only this instrument, and that's why it was so hard to build. And by the time it gets here, it's so weak that it's only squeezing and stretching space at like the fraction of a nucleus over very large distances. Has your understanding of black holes changed over the course of our conversation?","507":"So over the past four levels, we've been talking about Moravec's paradox. I'm curious to get your perspective. There are still a lot of open questions for how to leverage previous experience and learn cumulatively over time.","508":"I think it's interesting. And also a huge challenge. I think that it's interesting that if a person sees a robot doing something that seems very capable, they assume that the robot can do all sorts of other capable things. It's a huge challenge, because that's actually not the case.","509":"That notion of hierarchy is really interesting, because it is these higher level things, like playing chess, for example, that are easier for AI systems. And the reason why they're easier is that we're providing the abstraction for the system already, then when we give the game of chess to an AI system, we abstract away all the challenges of like picking up pieces and moving them, and we say, 'Okay, there's this board of however many boxes on it.' And you just need to figure out within that very narrow, small world, what to do. But handling and learning what those abstractions should be and handling everything from low level sensory inputs to that higher level processing is really, really hard.","510":"I suspect that we'll start by doing whatever is most convenient, 'cause that's whatever we can get. But I think that for robots to be capable alongside humans, in a world with humans, I think that we may need to actually use human experience, human learning, to inform how robots learn, if we want them to follow the same kind of mistake pattern as humans, so that humans can interpret robots, and humans can understand what robots will and will not do.","511":"What I love about what you were describing is like you didn't use the word memory, were how you were talking about kind of perceptions and social judgments but I think probably we'd both agree that memory is a big part of that.","512":"Some of those examples really remind me also some of the questions about kind of abnormalities in, in memory or trauma or disruptions in memory and how they also play out in terms of not just what people remember but what they do with those memories right?","513":"I think what we're still kind of trying to understand as a field is the more kind of detailed and bigger picture of where does this model live? How does it get updated based on experiences? Why does that sometimes happen and sometimes not? There are actually people who are born without a hippocampus. They have disruptions to episodic memories. They have trouble after this conversation remembering what the conversation was about, but they do have pretty good semantic information. They have a good sense of knowledge about the world. And that's interesting for two reasons. One, it shows this association between the role of the hippocampus and these two forms of memory, episodic memories and semantic memory. The other reason it's interesting is that people often assume that we get to semantic memory through episodic memory, that we encounter one dog and then another dog, and then another dog and then we learned the concept, the semantic notion of a dog. And these people, their profile suggests that you can learn semantic information. You can learn general knowledge about the world, even without ever having the capacity to build those individual memories.","514":"You know when I look back at, some of the work for my own lab and in the field in general, I really feel like some of the most exciting discoveries were not an answer to a question that was around before, but they were discoveries that made us realize we weren't asking the right question. I think one example of that even has to do with the connection between memory and decision-making. There was a discovery about how the striatum responds to rewards and to learning that just all of a sudden flipped the way we thought about the role of reward and learning and memory, and may force us to realize there was something fundamentally connected between these processes. And that discovery just raised a whole new set of questions that didn't exist before.","515":"And things that are hard for humans should also be hard for robots and humans to do. But it turns out that it's actually the opposite. I wanna try a little demo.","516":"We're gonna make this a little bit harder now. So, can you put these on? And we'll try to do the same thing again with your eyes closed. There you go. Let's try that one more time, and see if you can do any better. So close your eyes.","517":"Yeah. So that you're able, with a bit more practice, you're able to figure it out. When it fell on the ground, how did you know to pick it up off the ground?","518":"So when a robot tries to do something, like pick up an object, not only do you need to program exactly like what the motors should do, the robot also needs to be able to see where the object is. Then this is what's called a perception action loop in robotics. So if the object moves, the robot can then adapt what it's doing and change what it's doing to successfully pick up the object. It's really important for robots to be able to leverage, not just like the past hour of experience, but also ideally many years of experience, in order to do the kinds of things that you did.","519":"Yeah. It's really unintuitive. In order to survive, we need to pick up objects and everything. Basically many, many, like billions of years of evolution actually created humans and the ability to manipulate objects like that. So, it actually turns out that things that are really basic for us are actually just really complex tasks in general.","520":"That's a great question. So in reinforcement learning, the robot tries the task, and then it gets some sort of reinforcement, some sort of feedback. It's similar to how you might train a dog.","521":"So you could give it feedback like that. So it won't necessarily know itself, especially on the first few tries, but it's trying to figure out what the task is even.","522":"We give robots a camera and the camera produces this array of numbers. Basically, each pixel has three different numbers, one for R, for G and for B. And so the robot sees this really massive set of numbers. And it has to be able to figure out, from that massive set of numbers, what is in the world. There is a number of different ways to have the robot see, but we use a technique called neural networks, that tries to take out in those big numbers and form representations of the objects in the world, and where those objects are.","523":"It depends on how you program the robot. If you program the robot to follow exact motions and follow a very specific program, then it won't go off that program. It will always do those actions. But if something unexpected happens, that the program wasn't designed to handle, then the robot might go off court.","524":"Or you don't even need computers. Like I remember when I was a kid, I played electric guitar and I had all these guitar pedals with different effects and oh, what happens if you put the output back in the input and just run it through itself, you're gonna start hearing this kind of fractal sound, right? So today we've been telling people, fractals are things that are somehow self-similar, they have detail at all scales. Are there other ways you might introduce fractals to somebody or are there other things you might say, this is what a fractal is?","525":"I think that's also, what's so beautiful about fractals is that, you know, if you think about sort of the history of geometry as well, Felix Klein was looking at geometry by saying, well, geometry is all about in variance. I have some group of transformations and I look at objects that are sort of in variant with respect to these transformations. So if you just look at translations, okay, what kinds of shapes remain the same under translations? Will you get tiling? You get wallpaper. And if you start asking that same question, what if I allow scaling in my transformations then boom, you have fractal.","526":"Yeah. And I think this is what what's so beautiful also about Mandelbrot's work is him saying, you know, it's not really about these exotic examples. Like even the Mandelbrot set or Julia sets or whatever. Yeah they're like really interesting mathematical curiosities, but they get at this idea that fractals are kind of inevitable. And Bob Ross probably never, as far as I know, never sat down and you know, thought about recursive descriptions of trees or anything like that. But it's just something that naturally comes to you as an artist.","527":"That's a great way to think about it. Infinity is something that never ends, where finite, the opposite of infinity, refers to a process or a quantity that we could actually count all the way through, at least in theory if given enough time. So if you had to guess, how many Skittles are in this jar?","528":"217. And if we wanted to figure out the exact number, how would we find out? We could put them all out and divide them into pieces of five and then we could use that. Yeah, absolutely. In fact, I did that before you got here, and it's 649 Skittles. Here's a much harder question. How many pieces of glitter do you think are in that jar?","529":"Yeah, you can see them all. And in fact, if we were really, really, really patient, we could do the same thing as with the Skittles. But here's another question. You said that there's a finite amount of glitter in that jar, and I agree. So how many jars would we need to hold an infinite amount of glitter?","530":"Yeah, absolutely not. Because this room holds only a finite amount of space. And in fact, infinitely many jars would not even fit in something called the observable universe, which is the portion of the universe that astronomers can see. Really how does that make you feel?","531":"You have very good intuition. So there are ways that mathematicians can build infinite collections of things. And if you repeat those processes, it's in fact possible to build even bigger and bigger sizes of infinity. So what have you learned today about infinity?","532":"so did you know that there's certain kinds of problems that computers sort of run out of space almost like you're trying to solve the problem and just like how you run out of space on your iphone when you're trying to take a picture if you're trying to solve the problem you just run out of space and even if you have the world's biggest supercomputer did you know that can still happen","533":"i don't know what it's worth but uh i can put it face up right in that heads i can put it face down right so at any given time point in time if i ask you is my penny heads or tails probably you could answer it right","534":"it's sort of it's sort of a combination of heads and tails right would you say so superposition is this idea that my penny is not just either heads or tails it's in this state which is a combination of heads and tails this quantum property is something that we can have in real real physical objects in the world so that's super position and the second thing that we'll talk about is called entanglement so now i'm going to give you a penny","535":"the way that we are able to actually see these quantum properties is by making our quantum chips really really cold so that's what this is all about actually this is called a dilution refrigerator and it's a refrigerator it doesn't look like a normal refrigerator right but it's something that we use actually there's usually a case around it to cool our quantum chips down cold enough that we can create superpositions and we can entangle qubits and the information isn't lost to the environment","536":"And at some level, there's different set of rules that seem to come into play 'cause you can have particles at very microscopic scales seem to do really strange things. But one of the quests of quantum sensing is to harvest some of these unique properties at the micro scale. We are really interested in quantum sensors because we think they can give us the ultimate limit of sensitivity. So they're really, really sensitive to small changes, but they're also gonna be really reliable. Every time I make that measurement, I'll always get the same results.","537":"And what the MRI scanner is doing is, it's measuring the signal from all the water molecules that are present and specifically the hydrogen atom. In our bodies, we have these hydrogen atoms that are essentially spinning around magnetic fields all the time and we just don't know them. So in some sense, you've already used a quantum sensor.","538":"And then the different chemicals in the cells. If you look at the MRI images, you can see that they give you the broad features of what the tissue looks like. But if you wanna zoom in a little bit more and see what's actually happening inside a tissue or inside a cell and you need a different type of sensor that's gonna be more sensitive and for something like that, you're gonna need a quantum sensor.","539":"We can do it on tissues right now or on the surface, but we can't actually do it inside the body. So right now, we're struggling to figure out which scenarios can we use this to get better information and when can we not do it."},"dialogue":{"0":"Explainer: So that's good, because that's why you're here, and so we're talking about sleep today, and really about kind of what is the brain machinery through which we go through consciousness to unconsciousness and that transition.\nExplainee: Great.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: In terms of the dopamine, if you're taking amphetamines, that's usually to promote, as you said, wakefulness, but does that actually improve the quality of your sleep? How reliable are those kinds of interventions?\nExplainer: For the role that they play with respect to the sleep-wake system is really kind of amping up the wake system, right? And so certainly that has like down stream consequences for the sleep system, because now the flip flop switch is kind of pushed in a much stronger direction, and we have to kind of rely on what regulates sleep to get it pushed back to sleep.\n","1":"Explainer: Okay. The best way to think about this transition is really called, it's a flip flop switch, okay? So this term comes from engineering, and the idea is that in sleep, you basically have kind of this all of nothing experience. Certainly people kind of drift off to sleep, but then all of a sudden you're unconscious, right? So it seems like it's this flip flop between the arousal system and the sleep promoting system, and it's certainly regulated, and we'll get a little bit into that, but they're certainly kind of made up of two reciprocally inhibitory processes. Okay, so we have the ascending reticular activating system. It originates in the brain stem, and there's a dorsal and a ventral arm to this, and so the dorsal arm has neurons, cholinergic neurons, that go up to the thalamus and then it projections into the fore brain, and then there's the ventral arm, and this is comprised of a whole bunch of different types of neurons, so there are monominergic, so there's kind of dopaminergic neurons that come from the periaqueductal gray, serotonergic ones from the dorsal raphae nuclei, histaminergic neurons that come from the tuberomammillary nucleus of the hippothalamus, and then noradrenergic neurons from the locus coeruleus, and so all of those are kind of working in tandem to kind of drive wake within the brain. So if we just think about drugs that are available inducing wakefulness, we can certainly, kind of the dopaminergic ones jump out, right? So we have amphetamines that kind of drive those signaling, and then modafinil, which is a wake promoting drug for people that have kind of excessive day-time sleepiness that maintains alertness throughout the day.\nExplainee: In terms of the dopamine, if you're taking amphetamines, that's usually to promote, as you said, wakefulness, but does that actually improve the quality of your sleep? How reliable are those kinds of interventions?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainer: And do we know much about why, or which stages of the sleep cycle are affected? You know, if you take amphetamines, is it then when you go to sleep, that you're not able to transition through each of the sleep periods, or is that less clear?\nExplainer: You know, so I think that's less clear. In some ways, you know, getting back to this idea of this wake-sleep system, we have this sleep system that is kind of the counterpoint to this wake arousal system, and so the primary nucleus region is the ventral lateral pre-optic nucleus, also called VLPO, and that has particular neuron outputs that release GABA and galanin, which work in an inhibitory way on kind of the wake promoting ones. And so, it's kind of this delicate balance of these two systems that are ongoing. In your cognitive neuro-science training, right, it sounds like it's pretty specific and focused in a particular part of the brain, the cerebellum, and one thing that I'm interested in is you bring a participant into the study, have you ensured that they got a good night's sleep?

When we teach machines to learn from data, to build a model from that data or a representation of that, and then to make a prediction.

If it's really low or if it's super high, it could know that. What can the machine understand?\nExplainer: It's a great question. The machine can understand whatever we tell it to understand. So there might be a person thinking about things, like the pitch or the pacing or the tone, or sometimes machines can figure out things about music or images or videos that we don't tell it to discover, but that it can learn from looking at a lot of different examples. Why do you think companies might use machine learning?\n","21":"Explainer: And that's actually a really interesting thing to think about because that creepy vibe is something that you can perceive and I can perceive, but it's actually really hard to describe to a machine.

What can the machine understand?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Well, I think things like Facebook or Instagram, they probably use it to target ads.\nExplainer: Sometimes, the ads you see are really uncanny. And I think that's because they're based on so much data. They know where you live. They know where your device is. It's also important to realize that people in aggregate are actually pretty predictable. Like when we talk to each other, we like to talk about the novel things, like here, we're having this conversation. We don't do this every day. But we probably still eat breakfast. We're gonna eat lunch. We're gonna eat dinner. You probably are going to the same home you go to most of the time. And so, they're able to take that data that we already give them and make predictions based on that as to what ads they should show us.\n","22":"Explainer: It's a great question.

So you're imagining something more than the mass of the Sun.\nExplainee: [Will] Yeah, or about the mass of the Sun, condensed to the size of a city. It's dense enough that one teaspoon-full would weigh about a billion tons here on Earth.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: We would immediately be crushed into the ground, I think our bodies would be shred into their subatomic particles.\nExplainer: So what's the connection between neutron stars and black holes?\n","25":"Explainer: Black holes are so amazing that when the neutron star stops and there's something actually there. There's material there. If it's so heavy it becomes a black hole, so it keeps falling, once the event horizon of the black hole forms, which is the shadow, the curve that's so strong that not even light can escape, the material keeps falling. And like you said, maybe space-time breaks down right at the center there, but whatever happens, the star's gone, that black hole is empty. So in a weird way black holes are a place and not a thing.\nExplainee: So is there a sensible way to talk about what's inside a black hole, or is that, should you think of it as there is no space-time inside?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Those waves are very exciting for me too because neutron stars orbiting each other also give off gravitational waves and we might be able to get some data about neutron star material from that kind of signal.\nExplainer: [Janna] Yes, they ring space-time also like a drum, and you can record the sound of that ringing after a billion years, when it's traveled through the universe. But then the next thing that happens is those neutron stars collide, and because of this incredibly high energy state of matter, which you study, it becomes this firework of different explosions. It's really quite spectacular.\n","26":"Explainer: There isn't a sensible way to talk about it yet, and that probably means that's where Einstein's theory of gravity as a curved space-time is beginning to break down, and we need to take the extra step of going to some kind of quantum theory of gravity. And we don't have that yet. So even though the black hole isn't completely understood, we do know that they form astronomically, that in the universe things like neutron stars form and things like black holes form. The consequences are very much speaking to this curved space-time. So, for instance, if two black holes orbit each other, they're like mallets on a drum, and they actually cause space-time to ring, and it's very much part of gravitation. The ringing of space-time itself, we call gravitational waves. And this was something Einstein thought about right away in 1950-1960, he was thinking about that.\nExplainee: Those waves are very exciting for me too because neutron stars orbiting each other also give off gravitational waves and we might be able to get some data about neutron star material from that kind of signal.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: That's right, in fact, when we recorded that for the first time with gravitational waves, we then pointed telescopes at it and were able to see it optically as well, and that gave scientists a lot of data.\nExplainer: Yeah, it was, to my knowledge, the most widely studied astronomical event in the history of humanity.\n","27":"Explainer: Yeah, it was, to my knowledge, the most widely studied astronomical event in the history of humanity.\nExplainee: Wow, that's amazing.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Absolutely. I've heard statistics like many Earth masses worth of gold were created, forged in the neutron star collision that caused that. We used to think that most elements in the universe were created in supernova, which is when stars explode, because there's so much violent activity at the center that you need that kind of energy to create new elements.\nExplainer: [Janna] The way you do in a bomb. It's basically nuclear fusion.\n","28":"Explainer: Usually if it's math and physics, you end up as a theoretical physicist, right?\nExplainee: Yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Hopefully, yeah.\nExplainer: So how would you explain to your friends who are not math and physics majors, like what is a dimension, yourself?\n","29":"Explainer: [Sean] Being four dimensional, right?\nExplainee: Mm-hmm.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Okay.\nExplainer: Let's bring one in. All right. The thing about relativity is that they really want you to think of spacetime as one four dimensional thing, right? It's kind of like space. It's not just three dimensions of space and one dimension of time.\n","30":"Explainer: Now, in some sense that's kind of trivial to you and me, because of course you have space, which is three dimensional, you have time which is one dimensional, so spacetime is four dimensional. But it didn't turn out, it didn't occur to anyone that that was a sensible way to talk until really relativity. This is the crucial thing, right? Is that what Einstein realized is that sure there's both time and space, but how we divide spacetime into time and space can be different for different people, and really there's a real sense in which four dimensional spacetime is kind of a generalization of three dimensional space. And I think to really explain this we're gonna need a blackboard.\nExplainee: Okay.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Why though?\nExplainer: Why? This is a very good question. So, let's just start with space, right? We know a little bit about space. So here's my simple minded way of drawing space two dimensions, because that's how many I can draw on the blackboard. Let's say X and Y. And what is special about space, there's many things, but one is that if I have a curve or a path between two points, there's a distance that you can calculate, right? And the distance between those two points doesn't depend on your coordinates. It doesn't depend on whether you're in radial coordinates or Cartesian coordinates, or whatever. I'm allowed to imagine a curve that does something like this between those two points, and if I were a person walking on that curve, I would have an odometer with me maybe, and I would know, you would know, even without having done that, this path is always gonna be longer than that path. There's a formula, Pythagoras' Theorem that tells you what the shortest distance path is. That's the point. The physical-ness of what is real is the distance along a certain curve. So spacetime is like that. That's why it is useful to think about spacetime.\n","31":"Explainer: Let's bring one in. All right. The thing about relativity is that they really want you to think of spacetime as one four dimensional thing, right? It's kind of like space. It's not just three dimensions of space and one dimension of time.\nExplainee: Why though?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Okay.\nExplainer: So let me draw spacetime. Here's how we usually draw it. I'll just say X, but all of space is condensed in this one direction, and this is time, okay? So if you're a little person and you started some event, so you start, you're located somewhere in space, somewhere in the three coordinates of space, and whether you like it or not, you're moving through spacetime just by getting older.\n","32":"Explainer: When people ask me can you travel through time? I say yes, yesterday I traveled 24 hours into the future and here I am, a day later. So that's just this. Okay, you're moving through time, like it or not. So what Einstein says is look, I can travel through spacetime in different ways, like I could hop in a rocket ship and fly out and then fly back, and then I could meet you there. So this is a different trajectory through spacetime, right?\nExplainee: Yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: So it's kind of like our fundamental time? Or our base time?\nExplainer: Well kind of. What Einstein wants to get across is there's no such thing as fundamental, like there's the universe's time, this big letter T that might tell you how old the universe is, but then every individual has a clock with them, and they measure their own time depending on how they're moving through the universe.\n","33":"Explainer: And it's almost exactly like the space story. The space story says there's a distance, distance is different along different curves. Einstein says there's something that measures the length of these curves, and we call it the proper time. It is literally the time that you would read on your wristwatch.\nExplainee: So it's kind of like our fundamental time? Or our base time?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: I see.\nExplainer: And the crucial difference is that time is not the same for this person who stayed behind and sat in their chair, and this person who zoomed out there.\n","34":"Explainer: Well kind of. What Einstein wants to get across is there's no such thing as fundamental, like there's the universe's time, this big letter T that might tell you how old the universe is, but then every individual has a clock with them, and they measure their own time depending on how they're moving through the universe.\nExplainee: I see.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Why is that, that this one's shorter then?\nExplainer: There is what we call a metric on spacetime, and when we talk about Euclidean space versus a curved space, versus a sphere or something, that's a different metric. And spacetime has its own metric which says the following thing, that the path between two events in spacetime that is a straight line, will always be the longest time.\n","35":"Explainer: And the crucial difference is that time is not the same for this person who stayed behind and sat in their chair, and this person who zoomed out there.\nExplainee: Why is that, that this one's shorter then?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: I see. Oh, okay.\nExplainer: [Sean] That's the difference.\n","36":"Explainer: [Sean] That's the difference.\nExplainee: All right.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Would it be if I had like a spring or not a spring, but like a sheet, and I dropped a book in the sheet, curves down?\nExplainer: Yeah, exactly. If you had a sheet that was originally flat, and you set a marble on it, it would go in a straight line, but then if you put something on it so it warps it, that marble is now gonna be deflected.\n","37":"Explainer: So when Einstein had this idea, oh gravity could be related to the curvature of spacetime, he did some equations, so he got it, that's a long story, we'll put that aside. What he figured out was that rather than gravity living on top of spacetime, it's a manifestation of the curvature of spacetime so when you have like the earth, the sun, the moon, they cause a gravitational field, they're actually warping the spacetime around them. They're giving it a different geometry.\nExplainee: Would it be if I had like a spring or not a spring, but like a sheet, and I dropped a book in the sheet, curves down?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: I see.\nExplainer: Einstein says that gravity is just like that.\n","38":"Explainer: Harmony is about injecting melody with emotion so that ultimately, you leave home and you return home and you've learned something along the way.\nExplainee: Yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Okay.\nExplainer: So have you ever heard of this idea of like, major chords and minor chords?\n","39":"Explainer: Yeah, I like that, yeah.\nExplainee: Yeah, yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Yeah.\nExplainer: So I might go (hums Amazing Grace)\n","40":"Explainer: And so when you think about extra dimensions, you put them together with brains and different fields wrapping around the extra dimensions and so forth, right?\nExplainee: Yes.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Yes, well ultimately we'd like to understand the observable universe. If string theory turns out to be the thing that the universe cares about, we'd like to know, with all of these possibilities that are in string theory, how do we get the one that looks like the world we live in?\nExplainer: The thing I want to talk about is this paper I wrote with Matt Johnson and Lisa Randall where we realize there's another way to compactify extra dimensions spontaneously, dynamically. If you imagine starting with this big piece of paper you couldn't wrap up everything, but within some region of space you could make a tube.\n","41":"Explainer: You know, a lot of people, a lot of string theorists, they care a lot about all the different ways in which we could hide the extra dimensions. As someone who cares about cosmology, I wanna start asking why are the extra dimensions small at all? How did that happen? Is this something you think about yourself?\nExplainee: Yes, well ultimately we'd like to understand the observable universe.

And down there in the tube it looks like your long thing that is compactified in one direction and infinitely extending in the other direction, so there's one less macroscopic dimension of space.\n","42":"Explainer: [Sean] You think that sounds plausible to you?\nExplainee: It sounds like fun. What I would immediately ask is where do the large dimensions come from in the first place? Is that something you address, or you just assume that all the dimension are large as a starting point?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: But where do they come from?\nExplainer: It was always there.\n","43":"Explainer: Why don't you explain to us what a black brane is?\nExplainee: Well in some ways, it's very much like a black hole in that you have far away from it you have these large just flat dimensions. As you move in, there's something in the interior. It has, itself, higher dimensions, and so because physicists love to joke they thought, well it's like a membrane but it can have many different dimensions. Let's use P to stand in for those number of dimensions, and so they called them P-branes.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Yeah. Yeah. So, a lot of the branes that are relevant for studying things to do with anti-de Sitter spacetimes in various dimensions actually start out as these non-singular type brains, and then you find in the core, there's actually an anti-de Sitter spacetime.\nExplainer: Right. Imagine that rather than going down to a point, it just asymptotes to some fixed radius that continues infinitely far down there. But then you can ask, okay what about the rest of the universe? You have some sphere, some two dimensions compactified, and the balance between the cosmological constant and the electromagnetic field keeps it at a fixed distance.\n","44":"Explainer: Yeah, I've been trying to explain this to lower levels, and they always look at me like, are you pulling my leg here a little bit? Or is this the real thing that they use? Yes, it is the real thing they use. We study these branes in de Sitter space, and so what we found is that there are black brane solutions which instead of having a singularity inside are non-singular, and stable, and compactified. Is this a familiar thing? I know things like this have been discussed, right?\nExplainee: Yeah. Yeah. So, a lot of the branes that are relevant for studying things to do with anti-de Sitter spacetimes in various dimensions actually start out as these non-singular type brains, and then you find in the core, there's actually an anti-de Sitter spacetime.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Right. Good, good.\nExplainer: But then the other dimensions, the transverse dimensions, don't need to be anti-de Sitter. They can have either positive, zero, or negative cosmological constant.

I wrote and drew a graphic novel called The Dialogues: Conversations About the Nature of Universe.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Excellent.\n","48":"Explainer: It's what keeps us on the earth.\nExplainee: What?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Nice.\nExplainer: The main thing about black hole to remember is that it's just, like I said, how the earth holds you down, the black hole pulls you in, as well. Now, try and take the ball from me, black hole--\n","49":"Explainer: The reason we're not just flying off the earth is because earth has gravity, so if we throw something up, it comes back down, so that's why when we're walking on the earth, we don't fly off the earth because the earth has gravity, and it keeps us down.\nExplainee: Nice.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Why do you hold it so tight?\nExplainer: I'm holding it tight to show you then when you're trying to pull it, a black hole will really hold onto it with its gravity.\n","50":"Explainer: Try look over there and concentrate on his face over there. Can you see me waving my hand without turning your eyes?\nExplainee: No.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Uh, three?\nExplainer: You can just barely tell. And you can see that even, like if you hold out your hand and you focus on your hand, then your foot would be blurry because there's that difference there. And you can change between that, like you can then focus on your foot and your hand gets blurry. Because your eyes can see different amounts of detail in different places. So we're hoping in the future, that hardware can be like that. Where we can make a display that puts lots of detail right where you're looking. And every time you look someplace else, it moves the detail over to there. So we don't need to render a hundred times as much as we've got right now. Figuring out where you're looking is a pretty hard problem. What we try to go about this, is by taking a camera and looking at people's eyes and then try to figure out is the eye looking over here or up here. We're working hard on stuff like this right now so we hopefully can have a virtual reality that's as detailed and realistic feeling as the reality that we've actually got around us. But its going to be a long time before we get to where we can really fool people.\n","51":"Explainer: Alright, so, at some point, you can probably see it right now? So without moving your eyes, this is kind of hard, tell me how many fingers I'm holding up?\nExplainee: Uh, three?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","52":"Explainer: Do you know a lot about lasers? Or just about the laser that you use.\nExplainee: Not a lot, just a little bit.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: I feel like the continuous laser delivers power at a continuous rate, whereas you want all that power to be delivered in a really, really short time with your amplification.\nExplainer: And so we get the power with a lot less energy 'cause its power is energy per unit time. So we aren't depositing much energy in comparison. Can I just ask, 'cause you are using the thermal process of it heating up, but have you ever had the opportunity to use laser tweezers?\n","53":"Explainer: Okay. So this is about high intensity lasers. Not only how do you make them, but what was really stopping them being made in both cases is non linear optics. We wanna do something that requires a huge photon density application, and so that's how come we came up with chirped pulse amplification, so that we could stretch the pulse, safely amplify it, then compress it at the end, and then we're ready to do whatever we want at the end. So what do you think the main difference is between the continuous wave laser that you have that runs at 10 watts and a chirped pulse amplifier?\nExplainee: I feel like the continuous laser delivers power at a continuous rate, whereas you want all that power to be delivered in a really, really short time with your amplification.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: I have, yeah. We use optical tweezers to trap particles in solution.\nExplainer: And twirl the motors or not twirl the motors?\n","54":"Explainer: Yes. And maybe what, do pump-probe spectroscopy and watch the cell? Or to ionize it?\nExplainee: I mean I was thinking more on the lines of if we want to, let's say destroy one cell, like a tumor cell or something like that. So that the neighboring areas are not affected but just the cell burns.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: I think short pulses might help in my experiment in the sense that if I drive my swimmers with a continuous wave as opposed to a pulsed wave, maybe a continuous wave would heat up the sample too much and a pulse laser would deliver power exactly where I need it so that I could run my experiment longer.\nExplainer: That's true. Thank you very much.\n","55":"Explainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: That's one of the things we're trying to figure out, from an artist and storytelling perspective, what are the things that will make this meaningfully different from what we're used to, like a television on our wall. And we've been finding a lot of things, aspects of virtual reality that very much do that in my opinion. Things that allow you to feel presence, first and foremost, where you get lost, and you have to remind yourself, this isn't actually happening. And things that ultimately allow you to embody other characters. Things where you can actually change your own self-perception and play with neuro-plasticity and teach yourself things that are bizarre and unique.\nExplainer: As an engineer of course, I love quantifiable things. I like saying here's my 18 millisecond motion to photon, here's my angular resolution that I'm improving. I'm doing the color-space right. But you can look not too far back where you say we have blu-ray DVDs at this amazing resolution, but more people want to watch Youtube videos at really bad early internet video speeds. Where there are things that if you deliver a value to people then these objective quantities may not be the most important thing. And while we're certainly pushing as hard as we can on lots of these things that make the experience better in potentially every way or maybe just for videos or for different things. I don't think that its necessary. I've commented that I think usually my favorite titles on mobile that are fully synthetic are ones that don't even try, they just go and do light-mapped, black-shaded. And I think its a lovely aesthetic. I think that you don't wind up fighting all of the aliasing. While you get some other titles that, oh we're gonna be high-tech with our specular bump maps with roughness. And you've got aliasing everywhere, and you can't hold frame rate and its all problematic. While some of these that are clearly very synthetic worlds where its nothing but these cartoony flat-shaded things with lighting, but they look and they feel good. And you can buy that you're in that place. And you want to know what's around that monolith over there.\n","56":"Explainer: Mostly today, I've been talking a lot about what can we do, what's possible. We think might be possible in the next couple of years. But really at the professional level its more the question of wisdom of what should we be doing.\nExplainee: That's one of the things we're trying to figure out, from an artist and storytelling perspective, what are the things that will make this meaningfully different from what we're used to, like a television on our wall.

And basically, we've achieved it. Photo-realism, if you're willing to throw enough discreet path traced rays at things, you can generate photo-realistic views. And we understand the light really well. Of course it still takes a half hour per frame like it always has, or more, to render the different things. So its an understood problem and given infinite computing power we could be doing that in virtual reality.

We will run into atomic limits on our fabrication. So given that, I'm trying to tell people that, start buying back into optimization, start buying back into thinking a bit more creatively. Because you can't just wait, its not going to get to that point where it really is fixed to those highest degrees just by waiting for computing to be advanced.

Like Google Earth, where the kind of elimination of your periphery as you zoom in and move. And also, giving you the user action to decide where you're going and looking. I'm constantly seeing people coming up with ways to break from the paradigms of actual reality and then introduce mechanisms that work very well.\nExplainer: You know there's tons of opportunities for the synthetic case where you want to be able to have your synthetic fantasy world where everybody is a creature that's created by the computer and simulated reasonably.

I do think we're making progress and I wouldn't bet on that being solved in 10 years, but maybe 20 years. Because it is going to take a lot of AI. Its going to take a lot of machine-learning, where its not going to be a matter of us dissecting all the micro-expressions that people do.

We're in macro-gestureland, where I can wave and say thumbs-up.

So let's do a little experiment here. So there's one dimension. I'll give that to you. Now, here's your task. I'm going to give you another dimension, and I'm gonna ask hold those two things at right angles to each other. It's easy to do. Yeah, so there's no trick here.\n","61":"Explainer: All right, you're in the wrong place. [laughs] We're not gonna be talking about biology or computer science. So we wanna talk about the idea of dimensions. Do you know what dimension is? How we would define dimensions?\nExplainee: I guess, I don't know how to exactly define it, but I know, like the first four.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: [laughing] Yeah.\nExplainer: I'm not trying to fool you here. Okay. Now this is going to be slightly trickier. I'm going to give you this. I want you to hold all three of them at right angles to all the others at the same time.\n","62":"Explainer: That's right. So that's exactly what these would be. Have you heard that there are other coordinate systems other than XYX?\nExplainee: No.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Yeah.\nExplainer: So that's a different way of giving you two numbers and locating yourself, and we call those polar coordinates.

Yes, Einstein said that we can think of time as a fourth dimension, and that's a very fascinating thing that we could talk about all by itself. But what about space? What about the solar system?

[laughs]\nExplainer: [Sean] We really don't know.\n","69":"Explainer: So far, what do you know about black holes?\nExplainee: I never knew beforehand how hard it was to get actual data of the black holes itself, first of all, they're dark, and, like, they're so far away, it's almost impossible just to get a good image of them. They were discussing a project in which multiple radio telescopes of some sort, like, are, like, pinpointed all across, from Greenland to South America, and, like, and they're trying to get an image of the black hole in the center of our galaxy because, as opposed to just recording its impact on the surrounding stars and planets.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: What sort of technology and, like, I guess tools have you been using in your studies, or, like, just in general, in the study of black holes?\nExplainer: For my studies, I actually, when I started at UCLA in graduate school, I worked with a professor named Matt Malkin who was, gotten a lot of data observations from the Hubble Space Telescope, so that was one of my very first projects to work on, so any, space-based observatories have been a really big advantage, and then I've moved on now to the Spitzer Space Telescope. In addition to that, then there's other people who've used a lot of X-ray telescopes, NuSTAR, Chandra have used data from that. It's been a combination of both ground-based observatories, as well as space-based ones, and going everywhere from X-ray observations, not done by me, but certainly ultraviolet, and then optical, and infrared, particularly, those are the ones that I've been most involved with.\n","70":"Explainer: So we've been, we've had, now, effectively two different ways of getting more direct measurements, one is the LIGO, which is the Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory, which is where, getting the ripples in space time, coming off of the merging of black holes. The other one that you're mentioning is actually called the Event Horizon Telescope, where they're using radio waves to actually image the event horizon, that region where light cannot escape from the black hole at the center of our galaxy, which I know they're working on it right now. It's an amazing thing, but that'll be the most direct imaging of a black hole. LIGO is a direct detection of the consequence of the merging of black holes. The critical part has been, like, for the super massive black hole at the center of our galaxy, we've seen the stars orbiting it, and we've measured the mass, so that way, so if you look at a spinning black hole, it actually fundamentally alters the emission that's coming off the stuff that's falling into it. These are discovered as what are called X-ray binaries, that is, you know, there's an X-ray member of the binary that is emitting in the X-rays, and it's really not very bright in the optical (mumbles) at all, so there's always, people are looking at these X-ray binaries.\nExplainee: What sort of technology and, like, I guess tools have you been using in your studies, or, like, just in general, in the study of black holes?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","71":"Explainer: Do you know what gravity is?\nExplainee: It's something that, so, right now, we would be floating if there was no gravity, but since there's gravity we're sitting right down on these chairs.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Mm-hmm, just like the ocean tides.\nExplainer: [Janna] Exactly, the Moon is such a big body compared to anything else very nearby that it has the larger effect, pulling the water of the Earth.

After a while here on Earth though he'll readjust, he'll go back to the same size. Have you ever heard of how gravity was discovered?\n","76":"Explainer: They say that astronauts in space, definitely their spine elongates. There were two twin astronauts, one who stayed here on Earth and the other who went to the International Space Station. He was there for a long time, and when he came back, he was actually taller than his twin brother.\nExplainee: Wow.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Mm-hmm.\nExplainer: Isaac Newton would ponder, how does the Earth cause things to fall? There's a famous story that Isaac Newton was sitting under a tree and the apple fell from the tree and hit him on the head and he had an epiphany and understood this law, this mathematical law for how that works.

So Isaac Newton realized that even if you're heavier, you will fall at the same rate as something much lighter, that that's the same. Once you hit the ground, if you're heavier, you'll hit the ground with much greater force, but you will hit the ground at the same time.\n","78":"Explainer: Isaac Newton would ponder, how does the Earth cause things to fall?

You can do part of this level, and you can do the other part, clearly. Got some expertise under your belt, and that's awesome, because I think that everyone should know more about sleep. And so the way that we think about what drives sleep are two independent but related processes and so they have kind of lame names. Process S and process C, and what you've kind of described is process C, and that's the master clock, right? And it helps regulate kind of the rhythms like all over your body, all your cells, and all those kind of things. It drives the release of melatonin from the pineal gland, and melatonin comes online under darkness, so when the sun goes down, your brain knows okay it's time to start getting ready for sleep, and so you start releasing melatonin, which really kind of sets the table for sleeping.\n","81":"Explainer: It turns out, for people that are between the ages of 18 and 65, the agreed upon amount of sleep that people should get is between seven and nine hours, and it's really at least seven hours per night, to maintain optimal health as an adult. So at least seven hours. When we look at across all of the data that is available on like sleep and health, and sleep and psychiatric illness and those types of things, the largest risk is when people get five hours or less. What do you think is responsible for driving how much sleep you need, and things like that?\nExplainee: I mean, I know sleep is kind of regulated by the thalamus and the suprachiasmatic nucleus sending signals to the pineal gland to which kind of secretes melatonin, which tells us when it's time to go to sleep.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: I'm from Hoi, so we have very long days. We have early sunrises, late sunsets. Does that signify less sleep, because we have a shorter amount of time for melatonin to be released?\nExplainer: Yeah, no, that's a really great question, and the same is true in places where the sun never goes down during the summer, and when it's dark all the time during the winter, and it turns out light isn't the only thing that kind of gates your circadian rhythm. But I think the thing that's really important, again there are two processes, that the other one is the S process, and that one's just kind of a really important driver of sleep. One name we call it is the homeostatic sleep drive. Kind of the longer you're awake, the sleepier you get. You stay up, you get sleepy. Time goes by, you get sleepier. Time goes by, you get sleepier. But it's actually kind of a fundamental principle for how sleep is regulated, and it's really kind of akin to like a balloon, okay? So you wake up in the morning and your balloon is flat. You've kind of like drained out all of the sleepiness. But then as you kind of go throughout the day, it kind of fills up, so you use your energy, it gets filled up. And then it gets filled up more as you get towards nighttime, right? And then when it's at this optimal amount is when you kind of go to sleep and let out all of the sleepiness again. And this is really what underlies why napping can also be bad for you. So napping's not inherently bad, but if you actually let out some of this air during the day, it's going to take longer for the balloon to get bigger, right, I see to where you feel sleepy, right?\n","82":"Explainer: What is a laser made out of? Well really it's sort of the same thing as a light bulb. Right?\nExplainee: So it's a beam?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Because it needs to be centered so it can more easily just go in.\nExplainer: That's right. All the force that we apply here, goes all the way through but then it can only basically come out when it contacts the wood in that one tiny spot. And so sometimes it's the force that you push something with but sometimes it is that force per unit area. But sometimes it's not even the force per unit area 'cos, you know, push down as hard as you can on that and see if we can get it pushed in. See it doesn't really work does it?\n","83":"Explainer: Well it depends. So if you're cutting steel, you need to have the nail. You need to have it concentrated all of the light, not going in all directions but you need it into as small a point as possible. And for that we use a lens. For a lens, the light's coming down as a column, you put in a lens, it all focuses it down in the same way as the nail and then it starts cutting that steel. Okay so that force per unit area--\nExplainee: So it's kind of like a magnifying glass? Like it magnifies the light down to a point?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Exactly.\nExplainer: But if you send a one second long light pulse out into the skies there, the beginning of the pulse is actually two thirds of the way to the moon. It's 300,000 kilometers long. So now, if you talk about light being concentrated, that doesn't seem very concentrated. The type of lasers I play with in my lab will be no thicker than this piece of paper. So we take that energy that might be in three hundred thousand kilometers and we squeeze it all the way down into just this piece of paper and actually the beams are more the size of this piece of paper and so, in my lab, pieces of paper like this would be flying through the sky but we can't see them. 'Cos they don't come in our eyes, they fly by us and they're infra red.\n","84":"Explainer: Exactly. You know sometimes you want to have all of your energy not just in a small area but in the small volume and so one of the other dimensions is time or length. But with light, time and length are the same thing because light always travels at the speed of light.\nExplainee: Exactly.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: There'd be like little concentrated beams of light just flying everywhere?\nExplainer: Exactly. And so now, if we have light like that that we wanna machine with. I bring this funnel and so, if we had a lens here and the light was coming down--\n","85":"Explainer: But if you send a one second long light pulse out into the skies there, the beginning of the pulse is actually two thirds of the way to the moon.

So here would be my light coming from my laser and it would just be coming down, down, down, down, down. Hit a lens and it would have to focus down. But now, all the light started out with this big of a spread so concentrated this much. Eventually it would be here, more concentrated. But by the end, right at the focal spot, that's when I get all of my light, all of the energy has been squeezed down into fitting inside this piece of paper and that's why I say that I built a laser hammer. Because when this hits a piece of glass, it just smacks hose electrons right off the atoms and there's nothing else for them to do, they have to fly away. So can you tell me what you learned and maybe about the focusing of the light?\n","86":"Explainer: Exactly. And so now, if we have light like that that we wanna machine with. I bring this funnel and so, if we had a lens here and the light was coming down--\nExplainee: It funnels into--\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Well what I learned, lasers they aren't like particles. They're more like a super concentrated beam of light that can be any color. They get really concentrated and that's what makes them lasers and that's why they cut things and break things because they just move the electrons out of the way.\nExplainer: So do you think that lasers are fun enough to talk with your friends about or?\n","87":"Explainer: Which is, by the way, what, when I was just starting out in graduate school, that was the hot new thing, so.\nExplainee: Exactly.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: It isn't.\nExplainer: You know, everybody's been just coming at it from different wavelengths at the optical infrared, and, but definitely the X-rays has been one of those things where it's like, oh, finally.\n","88":"Explainer: That was, it was like, oh, wow, this might be it, and then, but very early on, it was, as I just started my, it was basically my second year of graduate school, it was like, uh, this is not that simple.\nExplainee: It isn't.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: And we've come a long way by seeing a wider range of the spectrum, we can elucidate more about the circumnuclear geometry, and there's just been so much progress made with all these new spectral models that we use to fit AGN spectra, and the different types of classes of AGN, like type one and type two are believed to be just a viewing angle effect of seeing this torus at different angles.\nExplainer: It does seem to be that it may not even, in parts, it may not be even connected to this tiny, little torus at all because part of the work that I did, and others have done, is that type twos preferentially live in different kinds of galaxies than type ones, which should not in any way have to do with something such a small scale. They tend to be in smaller bulged, SB and SC type spiral galaxies. So there's something also having to do with environment that gets you to be a type two, and you can still maybe, timing wise, but there's something else that's going on on a larger scale because the type of the AGN should not really correspond to the host galaxy, but it seems to. And that was one of the things that we were finding out, and that was one of the early little ideas that the, individually, just as the torus model, the unified model, can't explain everything that we were observing at the time. But it is one of those things that it's, they're super luminous, they're all over the place, and we don't have a really good picture of it, which makes it exciting to study.\n","89":"Explainer: You know, everybody's been just coming at it from different wavelengths at the optical infrared, and, but definitely the X-rays has been one of those things where it's like, oh, finally.\nExplainee: And we've come a long way by seeing a wider range of the spectrum, we can elucidate more about the circumnuclear geometry, and there's just been so much progress made with all these new spectral models that we use to fit AGN spectra, and the different types of classes of AGN, like type one and type two are believed to be just a viewing angle effect of seeing this torus at different angles.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Yeah, and I think, you know, pushing towards the future, that, like, this whole multi-messenger era, and like, you know, utilizing all the different wavelength telescopes that we can is really the way to go. We cannot just build up a picture purely from X-rays alone, or purely from infrared, and, you know, I think there should be increased effort to try and have more coordinated observations with the different telescopes, like NuSTAR--\nExplainer: Oh, that makes sense, but it's always so difficult to get that.\n","90":"Explainer: And sleep science. Do you sleep?\nExplainee: I do, I try. [laughs]\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Resting, relaxing, really shutting down your brain, taking some time off of a busy schedule and work day.\nExplainer: But being off is not just being off. There's lots of things that are happening. We're gonna kind of talk about those different pieces of sleep.\n","91":"Explainer: But being off is not just being off. There's lots of things that are happening. We're gonna kind of talk about those different pieces of sleep.\nExplainee: Okay.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Okay. Are you like able to tell how much sleep someone's getting or what their sleep schedule is by REM?\nExplainer: When we measure all of that, we're able to see how much time someone's asleep, and how many times they wake up and stuff during the night. You know, we're also really interested in kind of, the amount of non-REM sleep someone gets and the amount of REM sleep that someone gets, because each part of those types of sleep do different things for the body. And so it's important to get both of those. And so within non-REM sleep, there are three stages ranging from N-1 to N-2 to N-3. So not particularly clever in our naming, but that's how we know what stages they are. And what they do is it moves from lightest to deepest sleep, okay? N-1, it's more kind of light, wakefulness sleep, kind of in and out of sleeping. Then you go into N-2, which is where we spend 45 to 55 percent of our sleep. And it's more this kind of light sleep, but then we get into kind of the really restorative sleep, and that's N-3. And in N-3, when we look at someone's EEG wave, we see these big slow waves, and it's called slow wave sleep. And so we spend about 20% of our sleep in slow wave sleep, though it can vary on a day to day.\n","92":"Explainer: So our sleep is made up of different types, okay? The first one is called non-rapid eye movement sleep, or non-REM, okay? Or NREM. And then the other one, which might not be a surprise, is called REM. Rapid eye movement sleep. And those are the two main types of sleep that happen. The way that we measure that as a sleep scientist is that we'll actually bring people into the lab where they can do this at home, where we put electrodes on their scalp while they're sleeping, and that allows us to measure the brain activity that's going on during the night.\nExplainee: Okay. Are you like able to tell how much sleep someone's getting or what their sleep schedule is by REM?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Oh wow.\nExplainer: Okay? When do you think you experience the most REM?\n","93":"Explainer: Okay? When do you think you experience the most REM?\nExplainee: Well I've heard that you don't really go into like a deeper sleep, so I'm guessing like N-3, or really any of the N's at all, really, if you are on technology right before you sleep. And also if there's too much light, or if you're listening to music while you're asleep or anything like that, you're not experiencing deep sleep, right?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Oh.\nExplainer: Okay? So we wake up a lot during the night, and we just don't remember it. And you'll go back down into deep sleep, and then up again into REM, you know, in kinda these cycles.\n","94":"Explainer: You know, some of that is totally accurate, that like when your brain's more engaged by being on your phone or doing things that you really enjoy or things that stress you out or any of those types of things, it's harder to get to sleep and to kind of fall into that deeper levels of sleep. Most of the REM sleep, this dreaming sleep, happens in the second half of the night.\nExplainee: Oh.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Oh wow.\nExplainer: Do you ever take naps?\n","95":"Explainer: One to six hours? That's a long nap.\nExplainee: It is a long nap.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: So N-1 being like light sleep, still a lot of brain activity going on. I can imagine that happens right after you fall asleep. Asleep. And then N-2 being light, moderate activity in your brain, still sleep, but still kind of consciously aware, and N-3 being the deepest form of sleep.\nExplainer: I want to know if you agree, sleep is the coolest thing you've ever heard of.\n","96":"Explainer: So have you taken a quantum mechanics course?\nExplainee: I have. I took that last year.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Yes.\nExplainer: So these are typically semiconductors. They can be cadmium selenide cadmium sulfide, zinc selenide and they're small clusters of atoms. They can be from 2 to 10 nanometers. What's interesting about these materials?\n","97":"Explainer: I think to really get deep into nanomaterials and nanoscale devices, you really have to understand to some level, quantum mechanics. What it teaches us as we make these devices smaller and smaller, their properties begin to now depend on the size and the orientation of these devices. There are materials, and you're taking a 2D materials class, you know about this, that are intrinsically thin. As they're grown, as they're fabricated, they're already at the nanoscale and they possess these quantum confinement properties that as a nanotechnologist, you try to exploit. And so the first ones I wanted to talk to you about are quantum dots, have you heard of quantum dots before?\nExplainee: Yes.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Well, the other day we were talking about the different dimensions you can have of nanotechnology. So all the way from like 0D to 3D. If I remember correctly, my professor labeled it as 0D?\nExplainer: That's correct. Yeah. Because of quantum confinement, once you get below this 15 nanometer range, the band gap of the material depends completely on the size of the material. So in bulk materials, if you want to change the band gap, you have to change the material, right? But in these quantum dots specifically, just by changing the size, you can change their band gap. And because their band gap is changing, their optical properties are different. And you can precisely tune the wavelength of light that they emit just by changing their size.\n","98":"Explainer: So these are typically semiconductors.

There are companies that are building displays from these materials. And there're even people thinking about if I take these quantum dots, and I change the chemistry on the outside so they stick to specific types of cells or tissue, that I could really do some interesting imaging and therapeutic work to track disease, even maybe to treat disease, if you can very precisely control the chemistry.\n","99":"Explainer: That's correct.

The science has really been worked out. The health stuff, because of all of the things you have to consider when you're putting something in someone's body is definitely further out there. For example, some of them are made from cadmium. Cadmium's toxic. You would never put that in someone's body. But there are other materials like gold and silver and titanium dioxide, which are less toxic and people are exploring using those. So have you learned about graphene?\n","100":"Explainer: There are people that are exploring using these materials for diode lasers.

So how do you go about building and controlling these nanotubes in terms of their diameter?\nExplainer: You're speaking my language. This is what I spent many years of my life working on. You don't physically roll up graphene. You grow nanotubes by basically taking nanocrystals and you deposit them on a surface. And then you do a CVD process, chemical vapor deposition. So you basically flow in a carbon source, the carbon dissolves in a nanocrystal and then once nanocrystal is saturated, the nanotubes precipitate out of them in tubes. Then you have to develop ways to go into this pile of nanotubes and pull out exactly the ones that you want. So I have to find ways to program them to go exactly in the places that I want. I modify the surface of the nanotube with specific molecules that recognize one type of surface over another. And then I just pattern the surface and the tubes just land exactly where we want them to. And it's still very much in the research stage. The ultimate goal is to build functional high-speed electronics using these new materials.\n","102":"Explainer: Carbon nanotube, right. So if you roll up graphene, depending on how you roll it and the angle, you roll it with, it has different properties. So if I roll it one way, it'll act like a metal. If I roll it a different way, it'll act like a semiconductor. The one that gets everyone most excited is that the electrons and holes move very fast through graphene. And so there's a lot of interest in using these for certain types of high-speed electronics. The other interesting application is because it's one atom thin, it's very sensitive to changes in the environment. And so there's a lot of interest in using them as diagnostics. It's on us researchers to find ways to A, control that process and then B, to actually build some sort of interesting technology from them.\nExplainee: So you've been talking about the different ways you can say, roll these nanotubes. So how do you go about building and controlling these nanotubes in terms of their diameter?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: In my nanomaterials class, actually just a couple of days ago, we were talking about different applications of nanotechnology and things we know. And we touched on the topic that right now, silicon is down to the smallest level that it can get. And so we have scientists out there researching other materials, to replace silicon.\nExplainer: Yeah. 100%. That's right. And that's the motivation for looking at these emerging materials. But I would never bet against the innovation and the creativity in this nano electronic space. Tens of thousands of scientists, every time they hit a barrier, at least historically, as a guide, they have found a way to overcome it. It's a real marvel in ingenuity.\n","103":"Explainer: You're speaking my language. This is what I spent many years of my life working on. You don't physically roll up graphene.

[laughing] But now that you suggested it, these were inspired by the array of quantum dots that we showed earlier. So that's the story I'm going to stick with. [laughing] I like it.\n","104":"Explainer: Do you know what machine learning means?

And yeah, what are you working on?\nExplainee: Lately I've been doing, you know, always a little bit of side channel analysis. So what I really do, you know, is all hardware layer. So I've been looking, you know, at some various devices lately, at how susceptible they are to fault attacks, what that sort of means in real life. You know, not just purely the research side, but also how much should you care about it.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: One of them was looking at, like, a little hardware Bitcoin wallet, and you could use fault injection to actually recover secrets from it, and a lot of devices. I mean, the whole idea is pretty cool, right? Because you tell the device, Hey, I want to authenticate, and it's supposed to run some really crazy math that authenticates it, but instead of doing that crazy math and attacking the math, you just attack the check at the end.\nExplainer: We're also scratching the surface of, like, what is possible? It's not necessarily just the system itself and not necessarily that algorithm itself. Like you said, you don't necessarily need to attack the math in some cases. You can just attack that check. And I think something that's been pretty cool is looking at higher energy particles. It's going to be maybe hard to entirely confirm, but I think it'd be really, really cool to actually see. Like, I want to see one of these faults because I haven't seen it myself. And also, how do you know that you've seen it? I've started playing with, like, setting up a cloud chamber. A cloud chamber lets you actually view high energy particles going through sort of like in a small jar with some evaporated alcohol. And I thought it'd be really cool if we put some memory chip in there, like a basic memory chip and we just fill it with some data, but then you put a camera on that area and you just watch. Assuming that there is a high energy particle that actually hits that memory, that should potentially flip the energy state of that bit. The outside microcontrollers should be able to read that and actually say, Oh wait, the data, even though I'm not changing data, I'm only reading data, and we should be able to visibly or optically see it. What I'm wondering is could that be a next area of research? Because I don't think anyone's actually looking at intentionally injecting high energy particles to take over a computer, when really, you know, that's another technique for fault injection, technically speaking.\n","114":"Explainer: Maybe a mutual acquaintance of ours, Jasper gave a example of fault injection, and I like to use that as, when I'm trying to explain fault injection, he shows a pinball machine and the pinball machine, obviously the two inputs are the two plungers when you're playing a pinball machine, but fault injection, you can tilt the entire pinball machine, right? You're just introducing some external variable that's outside of the traditional inputs that you're used to and you've now controlled the environment in a advantageous way to the user or the player. Can you give an example of some type of fault injection that you're doing or working on?\nExplainee: One of them was looking at, like, a little hardware Bitcoin wallet, and you could use fault injection to actually recover secrets from it, and a lot of devices.

So flipping it in this sort of flash memory. And so someone's done it with x-rays. There's actually, I forget who now. There's a paper, at least one, and it's just like a little plate they make with like a hole in it to concentrate the x-ray source and it works, so yeah, it's super interesting. Like, one bit in memory means a lot, especially in the flash memory side. Yeah, visualizing it would be cool though.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Yeah, so actually, so it's funny you mentioned, like, making it more obvious. I mean, staying on fault injection right now, this is lately what I've been up to. A lot of making a little kind of, you know, like electronics kits of old, right? And you can assemble it all yourself and see how it works. So making something like that for fault injection. So all kind of older logic and stuff like that. So, I mean, it's sort of based on, like, you're presented the little MUX chip. You know, voltage switcher. That sort of idea, using just discreet logic to generate the actual glitch itself. So, but you know, it's part of, I think, this stuff, right? It's like people don't know about it sometimes. Like, even engineers designing systems. It's new to a lot of people.\nExplainer: The thing is, even if you know about that, then there's so many others that someone won't necessarily know about, because there's so many, I guess, potential areas for a fault to occur.

Like, there's been a lot of people poking at that, and I think a lot more products of interest. Side channel still might have a bit of a comeback. Basically, what I kind of see is a lot of the really cool stuff has been in academia because product security hasn't kept up, right? For the longest time, doing these attacks on hardware was pretty straightforward. You didn't need these crazy attacks. It looks like a lot of devices are coming out now that actually have real claims to security, right? More than just a data sheet mentioned. There's actually something behind it.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: I'm curious of the backstory to how they found that. Because if you told me that, right? So you said like, Hey, Colin, you should test this out. I probably would be like, It probably won't even work. Which is like a lot of side channels. When I first heard about it, you know, working, doing firmware stuff, it was like, Oh, that sounds like it's not gonna work. Like, that sounds impossible. You know, the whole area of hardware hacking, it feels kinda like cheating because, you know, as you said, someone designing the system needs to know about so many different ways, right? So there's so many ways to break the system, and if you're designing them, you need to know all of them, but when you're attacking it, you really need to know one, right? So I can know nothing about, like, how does ECC actually work? You know, I have some vague hand-waving I can tell you about, but if you gave me a pen and told me, like, Okay, write it down, specifically the equations and what they mean and how the point model works and stuff. Right, no idea, but designers are like the other side. It's almost like, I don't wanna say the lazy side of it.\nExplainer: It's the easier side. I would say my side is the easier side, right? I'm on the offensive side. I want to break into things. Someone on the defense side, they might have, you know, a system was developed and they now need to patch a hundred holes. They patch 99 of them. I only need to find that one.\n","117":"Explainer: For me, I think the things that have been recent and super interesting are typically down to physics-level effects that maybe we haven't seen before. I think my mind was blown with the, there was the light commands research, and they were able to modulate sound, although it's purely over light using a laser, they would hit the MEMS microphone, and it was picking that up and was able to then interpret it and essentially take control over light.\nExplainee: I'm curious of the backstory to how they found that.

There's no downsides is what you're saying.\nExplainer: Yeah, only when you get caught.\n","118":"Explainer: So tell me, what do you know about black holes?\nExplainee: Well, I know they're created when stars, once they start growing, it doesn't, it can't expand anymore, so they collapse inward.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: But no, the wind, the pull isn't, if you're not close enough, it doesn't work.\nExplainer: Right, you will feel the gravitational pull, and it'll redirect you in some way, and if you're far enough way, it's just like you're very far away from the sun, or something else. If you're close enough, it will divert your path more, if you're close enough still, then you will get what are called tidal forces, where the difference between, for example, if you're standing next to a black hole, the difference in gravity between your feet and your head actually becomes significant. Next time you see a science fiction movie, if somebody says, Oh, my god, we've been caught in the gravitation field of a black hole, and we're gonna fall in, it's like, no, no, just, if you're far enough away, just thrust a little bit this way, and then you'll slingshot around the black hole.\n","119":"Explainer: You got, pretty much, you got a very good idea about it. Basically you have a star, at the core its generating energy, which is countering the pressure of all that mass trying, being pulled in by gravity. Once it can't generate that energy anymore, the core collapses, once the core is collapsing, it keeps collapsing, and collapsing, and collapsing, and that's the critical thing that makes a black hole. You have enough mass in the volume, such that the escaped velocity becomes the speed of light, once light can't escape, hence the black part. (laughs) But that's the thing, is that just because there's an intense amount of gravity very close to a black hole, things don't start behaving differently. And my favorite analogy is a vacuum, everybody thinks, like, if you point a vacuum cleaner at something, it's just gonna suck everything in--\nExplainee: But no, the wind, the pull isn't, if you're not close enough, it doesn't work.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: So are there any movies that actually do, like, get space right?\nExplainer: I wouldn't call them educational, but the movie Interstellar actually had, as one of the people involved in both writing it, and as a science advisor, Dr. Kip Thorne, who's a Professor at Caltech, who was part of the team that detected gravitational waves, and just won a Nobel Prize for it. So he made sure to try and get it as accurate as possible, so Interstellar, I think, is one of the best examples of getting black holes right.\n","120":"Explainer: Right, you will feel the gravitational pull, and it'll redirect you in some way, and if you're far enough way, it's just like you're very far away from the sun, or something else.

But the infrared can penetrate the dust, the X-rays can penetrate the dust, the radio can penetrate all of that dust, so by combining all of these different wavelengths, people are really coming to a point of okay, how is this happening, by looking at different wavelengths of light, we can get a better sense, but they're still working on the theory, it's not all done.\n","121":"Explainer: You know, we first met 10, 11 years ago and machine learning has changed a lot since then.\nExplainee: Tooling that we now have, the capacity, and also, an elevation of the problem sets that we're dealing with and how to frame the problem. And I'm almost struggling to figure out whether it's a blessing or curse that it has become as accessible and as democratized and as easy to execute and you just build another new company from scratch.

The accessibility of the tooling, like, we can now do in, like, five lines of code something that would have taken 500 lines of very mathematical, messy, gnarly code even, you know, five years ago. And that's not an exaggeration. And there are tools that mean that pretty much anyone can pick this up and start playing with it and start to build with it.

And so, to say that another way, when you're collecting data from the real world and then building machine learning systems that automate decisions based on that data, all of the biases and problems that are already in the real world then can be magnified through that machine learning system.

And the motivation was really because it was such an amazingly exciting playground to push that technology that used to largely live in academia, really, out in the world and see, kind of, what it can achieve. It has created such a hunger for data that now everything is being collected. I'm curious, when are we going to make a foray into things like agriculture about smart production of the things we eat? You see and hear these interesting stories, but I feel like we're not ready yet to put that into a economically viable situation.\nExplainer: So when we think about the next five to 10 years, the things that are really still holding us back are these uneven applications of resources to problems because the problems that get attention are the high value ones in terms of how much money you can make or the things that are fashionable enough that you can publish a paper on it.

So what do you think is holding us back?\nExplainee: I fully agree on the steps you pointed out and the processes. I think there is a chicken and egg problem, like your former example, that these areas that need to wait for data, the value of the data collection is then also slightly less apparent. And so, it gets delayed further and you'll see that happening. But what my experience has been, there's unfortunately, I feel a drifting apart between academia and the uses of AI, but I am somewhat frustrated with a generation of students who have standard data sets that they never think about what the model needs to be used for, that they never have to think about how the data was collected. So with all of these challenges ahead of us, how optimistic are you about this world that I deeply believe we can create and the steps towards it?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Despite that the rightfully raised concerns about the challenges ahead, but I think they also make us as a society better. They challenge us to be a lot clearer of what fairness means to all of us. So with all of the setbacks, I think we have exciting years to come. And I am looking forward to a world where a lot more of that is used for the right purposes.\n","127":"Explainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Wow.\nExplainer: The thing that makes them cool is they're sort of like tilings, it looks like you could put this together by cutting little pieces of paper and sliding them together, but they're still one sheet.\n","128":"Explainer: A lot of origami is animals, birds and things. There's also a branch of origami that is, it's more abstract or geometric, called tessellations. Tessellations, like most origami, are folded from a single sheet of paper but they make patterns, whether it's woven patterns like that, or woven patterns like this. If you hold them up to the light you can see patterns.\nExplainee: Wow.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: They weren't cut?\nExplainer: There's no cuts in these just folding. We can build these up from smaller building blocks of folds, learn how to fold little pieces and put them together in the same way that a tiling like this looks like it's built up of little pieces.

And if I had another one up here, I could make all three. And if I had a square array and all the folds lined up I could make bigger and bigger arrays, like these, because these are just very large twists. In this case it's an octagon rather than a square, but they're arranged in rows and columns. And let's just try going along. All right, there is our tessellation with squares and hexagons. So you have now designed and folded your first origami tessellation and perhaps you can see how just using this idea of building up tiles and small building blocks you could make tessellations as big and complex as you want.\n","132":"Explainer: That's a rule of all flat origami no matter how many folds come together at a point and I'm going to show you a building block of tessellations, it's called a twist because that center square, as I unfold it, it twists, it rotates.\nExplainee: Twists?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: That was cool.\nExplainer: Yeah, so what do you think now of origami and tessellations?\n","133":"Explainer: Yeah.\nExplainee: No, I don't think so.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Is this like a map where, that's like an actual visual representation, like using microscopy?\nExplainer: Yes.\n","134":"Explainer: Yeah.\nExplainee: I'm understanding more so that it's these, a mapping of the circuitry, the pathways between neurons that can lead to evidence of patterns in your brain that are common between different people.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Well, the computer only communicates with itself in binary so it only has two options, it can only ask itself yes or no questions, but a human brain has an infinity of directions that it can go.\nExplainer: Neurons are also digital.

And so fundamentally, that's one of the key things that I'm trying to use, is trying to see how long, once you've got this sort of pulse that's generated close to the black hole, it propagates out, and so you can use optical wavelengths to see that the accretion disk lights up in the optical a little bit as it gets heated up from the X-ray, and then later on, the infrared dust, the dust absorbs it, and emits it in the infrared. And so that, I love that, the ability to exchange time for resolution, because these structures are so far away that we're never gonna get a telescope big enough where that has the resolution to see the accretion disk, or the dust distribution around--\nExplainee: So do you get dimensions of the disk out of that?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: So you can map out the dust, where do you see it?\nExplainer: So you do see it, basically the dust sublimation radius, and you see it at, and it tells you, depending on what kind of dust it is, and it's actually one of the problems for me studying, whenever we try and do X-ray studies of low luminosity active galactic nuclei in your, by galaxies, because there're all these X-ray binaries that are also emitting X-rays, which make our lives difficult. But they're also in black holes, when it's this really interesting sort of both, it's great, but ugh, it's also a source of noise for those of us who are trying to do X-ray observations of nearby galaxies.\n","137":"Explainer: Yeah, again, we don't know exactly where X, Y, Z, zero is, we're assuming that it's something, you know, the X-rays that are coming out are very close to the event horizon of the black hole, but this is still, you know, your realm of X-rays, to really figure out those kinds of things. But once the X-rays, once the photons hit the corona, and are re-scattered, and up, energized, and then they start illuminating the accretion disk, it heats it up, and so just by the light travel time, when the optical, if it gets, you know, brighter and fainter, and then the infrared gets brighter and fainter, two weeks later, then the dust is two light weeks away from that. So it's a one dimensional one, so we're averaging, so we don't get the two dimensional, or even three dimensional one. And then we've done it now, of course, we have better telescopes, there was a project where you could do it with the Hubble Space Telescope and the ultraviolet, you used the Swift Observatory, which had optical and ultraviolet, and then from ground base, we did optical, and then from space we did it with Spitzer and the infrared. So you could actually see this bright flash go off in a nearby AGN called NGC5548, and then you see it propagate as it warms up the disk, as all that light is falling onto it, and then eventually you hit the, the, further away, where the dust is, and the dust tends to radiate in an infrared. So we got basically a structure, and you just, you see this flashbulb go off, and then it illuminates, effectively, the structure.\nExplainee: So you can map out the dust, where do you see it?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: We have the same problem, we can't see the actual black hole underneath all these very bright X-ray binaries.\nExplainer: It's a weird thing to be sitting in your own galaxy, but not be able to separate all these, four million solar mass black hole creating, next to, how massive, it's like two to three solar masses for the X-ray binaries?\n","138":"Explainer: So you do see it, basically the dust sublimation radius, and you see it at, and it tells you, depending on what kind of dust it is, and it's actually one of the problems for me studying, whenever we try and do X-ray studies of low luminosity active galactic nuclei in your, by galaxies, because there're all these X-ray binaries that are also emitting X-rays, which make our lives difficult.

So that's where we have LIGO, and LIGO has now directly, I mean, this was all theory before, that we knew that this was gonna happen, and never seen it before, so LIGO is now the first time that we have been able to completely verify this theory, that you can have black holes and neutron stars merging together. And so what happens in the case of two neutron stars, when they merge together, now suddenly they become heavier, they become heavy enough to turn into a black hole. And so the first of these events happened in August, and what happened here is you had these two neutron stars that spun around each other, and then they merged, and then for a very short time, we are talking about 100 milliseconds, or tens of 100 milliseconds, it actually remained a neutron star, probably, it was a hyper massive neutron star because it was spinning so fast, it didn't collapse under its own weight. But then, you know, the angular momentum gets dissipated away from the object, and then, at that point, it can't maintain its own weight, and then it collapses, and turn into a black hole. All this theory that we knew about is now finally being, being validated.\nExplainer: Which is great, although it still doesn't help us in the AGN community, because we don't know how the millions to billions solar mass black holes came to be. But it's, at least we're building up, or hopefully that at some point, and by understanding these lower mass, how these lower mass black holes came to be, then we can see where there are a large scale number of mergers can potentially give us this, or you really need something, other, another corridor to fundamentally get us something that's a million solar masses, you know, on the minimum side, but definitely, you know, we've gotten those which are billion. So we know we can merge the million solar mass black holes to get the bigger ones, but how do you get to those in the beginning, particularly so early in the universe, when you get quasars at really high red shifts, so they're really early on.\n","139":"Explainer: It's a weird thing to be sitting in your own galaxy, but not be able to separate all these, four million solar mass black hole creating, next to, how massive, it's like two to three solar masses for the X-ray binaries?\nExplainee: The X-ray binaries, yeah, so they're, no, they're typically like 10 solar masses, so from three, you know, that's the smallest one you can have is from three solar masses, and then all the way up.

I mean, the other thing that's a little odd, now we're going back to stellar mass black holes is, so we look at a lot of supernova remnants, and we, so we see them, we can only really see them in our own galaxy, and so we have a lot of supernova remnants, and so how we see them is, you see the expelled mass from the star as it died, so that creates an extended source, and then you look for the compact object that was left behind. And what's interesting is that you see, you quite often see the neutron stars because they pulse, so they're easy to see, but so far, we've not found a single black hole at the center of a supernova remnant. And so, which is interesting, so you say, you should see them, you know, you ought to see some fallback, you know, you need some matter, you need something, but no, never, not yet been detected.\nExplainer: And this goes to the idea that you don't have a core balance, that a supernova with a black hole as its final result, actually never has any kind of expulsion, that it all just goes. (imitates sucking)\n","140":"Explainer: And this goes to the idea that you don't have a core balance, that a supernova with a black hole as its final result, actually never has any kind of expulsion, that it all just goes. (imitates sucking)\nExplainee: Yeah, that might be, yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","141":"Explainer: So what are some of the techniques you're applying to look at that debate data?\nExplainee: Something I'm interested in exploring is how well it works to use deep learning and sort of automatically extracted features from this text versus using some of the more traditional techniques that we have, things like lexicons or some sort of template matching techniques for extracting features from texts. That's a question I'm just interested in, in general. When do we really need deep learning versus when can we use something that's a little bit more interpretable, something that's been around for a while?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: I definitely think there is, but I also, sort of, see it varying a lot based on the use case, something that, kind of, works out of the box and maybe works a little bit more automatically might be better. And in other cases, you do, sort of, kind of, you want a lot of fine grain control.\nExplainer: So is that where some of that frustration around the lack of controllability and interpretability comes from?\n","142":"Explainer: So is that where some of that frustration around the lack of controllability and interpretability comes from?\nExplainee: Yeah, if you're building a model that just predicts the next thing based off of everything it's seen from texts online, then yeah, you're really gonna be replicating whatever that distribution online is.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Yeah, it's a really tricky question. As you said, these models are trained to, sort of, predict the next sequence of words, given a certain sequence of words. So we could start with just, sort of, prompts like the woman was versus the man was, and, kind of, pull out common words that are, sort of, more used with one phrase versus the other. So that's, sort of, a qualitative way of looking at it. It's not ever kind of a guarantee of how the model is gonna behave in one particular instance. And I think that's what's really tricky and that's why I, sort of, think it's really good for creators of systems to just be honest about, This is, sort of, what we have seen. And so then, someone can make their own judgment about, Is this gonna be too high risk for, sort of, my particular use case?\nExplainer: I imagine in the last few years, we've seen a lot of changes and improvements in the capabilities of NLP systems. So is there anything in that that you're particularly excited about exploring further?\n","143":"Explainer: If you train a model off of language off the internet, it sometimes says uncomfortable things or inappropriate things and sometimes really biased things. Have you ever run into this yourself? And then how do you think about that problem of potentially even measuring the bias in a model that we've trained?\nExplainee: Yeah, it's a really tricky question. As you said, these models are trained to, sort of, predict the next sequence of words, given a certain sequence of words. So we could start with just, sort of, prompts like the woman was versus the man was, and, kind of, pull out common words that are, sort of, more used with one phrase versus the other.

It's really easy to write long grammatical passages thinking about the way that we can then harness, like, the human ability to actually give meaning to those words and, sort of, provide structure and how we can combine those things with the, kind of like, generative capabilities of these models now is really interesting.\nExplainer: Yeah, I agree.\n","144":"Explainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Well, one thing is quantum mechanics. Quantum mechanics is the most successful theory in the history of science, it explains the most different phenomena the most precisely. Yet many people would still say we don't understand even the basics of it.\nExplainer: So when we think about quantum mechanics, we think about particles and their quantum charges in the Feynman way, the way that Feynman taught us. They come in and they exchange a force carrier and then they come out again, so that's how we think of an electron and light scattering, for instance, or something like that. And the language that Einstein gave us is so different. It's completely geometric, it's all this space-time. And it's also unnecessary.\n","145":"Explainer: So we've been talking about gravity from Newton and celestial bodies, the Earth, the Moon, pulling on each other in the conventional sense of gravity being an attractive force, to the Earth creating curves in space-time, then we moved on to just diffused seas of energy and space-time as the real universe and gravitation is really just talking about space-time in general, and here we are, and you're really hardcore in theoretical physics. Where would you take the exposition of gravity from that point?\nExplainee: Well, one thing is quantum mechanics. Quantum mechanics is the most successful theory in the history of science, it explains the most different phenomena the most precisely. Yet many people would still say we don't understand even the basics of it.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Yeah, for me, the beauty of the theory of gravity is the way Einstein formulated it, as a theory of geometry, of curved space and time. I think, like you, that's one of the things that really pulled me into it.\nExplainer: Is there really space-time or are we just using unnecessary language because it's elegant and we like it and it's beautiful?\n","146":"Explainer: So do you think there's some sense in which we shouldn't be thinking about individual universes, individual space-time, so we should be thinking about superpositions of space-times?\nExplainee: Yeah, I think so. I think if you were to go far enough back in the history of the universe, back to when it was very, very dense, very small, and when quantum mechanics was certainly important, then it must have been like that. I mean, if we believe that the dominant standard model of cosmology, something had to produce the density perturbations, the things that seeded all the galaxies and stars and everything else in the world. So there's a galaxy over there, let's say, and not over there, so how did that happen? Why is there a galaxy there and not there? In the standard theory, as you know, that was a quantum event, a random event. And it doesn't mean that if happened there and not there 'cause you flipped a coin, it actually happened in both places. There's gotta be a wave function where in one branch of the wave function there's a galaxy there and not there, and on the other branch it's the opposite.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Sure, yeah, it is a beautiful, beautiful idea. So, first of all, to be totally clear, though, we've never observed Hawking radiation, which is what he predicted, directly. I don't think very many people doubt that it's there, but yeah, Hawking discovered mathematically that when you have a black hole, it's got an event horizon, it's got a surface which is a point of no return. If you fall through that surface, no matter what you have, no matter how powerful the rocket you've got, even if you beam a flashlight back behind you in the direction you fall from, nothing escapes, not even light. It all gets sucked in and spaghettified and destroyed at the singularity, or something, something happens, but it doesn't get out. But in quantum mechanics, you can't really pin down the location of something precisely. If you try to pin down an electron in a tiny circuit in a microchip, sometimes you discover it's not actually there and then your computer crashes.\nExplainer: This is the Heisenberg's uncertainty principle in reality. You can't precisely say where the electron is, and you can't precisely say how quickly it's moving.\n","147":"Explainer: So when we're talking about the multiverse or the Big Bang, we are really talking about gravity ultimately, and we're talking about how a theory of gravitation which we know think of as a theory of space-time has a quantum explanation, has a quantum paradigm imposed on it that will help us understand these things, and we don't have that yet. One of the things that I think is so amazing is that the terrains in which we're going to understand quantum gravity are very few. It's the Big Bang, because that's where we know that quantum and gravity both were called into action. And there's black holes. One of the most interesting discoveries is of course Hawking's discovery, kick-started a kind of crisis, right? In thinking about why quantum mechanics and gravity were so knocking heads. It was one of the most beautiful examples.\nExplainee: Sure, yeah, it is a beautiful, beautiful idea.

If you try to pin down an electron in a tiny circuit in a microchip, sometimes you discover it's not actually there and then your computer crashes.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Exactly, yeah, so when you get the blue screen of death, that might be because of quantum mechanics.\nExplainer: Right.\n","148":"Explainer: Right.\nExplainee: You know, you try to pin something down near a black hole, well, it's a surface, it's got a particular radius for a round black hole, and wanna say something is inside or outside, well, you can't absolutely say that in quantum mechanics. And this kind of uncertainty produces a radiation, which you can think of as pulling some of the energy out of the black hole. The black hole is formed out of some mass and there's an energy in that. If you think of pulling some energy out of that and sending it off to infinity in the form of particles being admitted. And what Hawking found is that it's a thermal spectrum, it looks like a hot, or not so hot for a large black hole, but like an oven, the kind of radiation that comes out of a cast iron.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: It's a crisis because of some of the details of it, but I would say the way you just described, I mean, if I build a big bonfire or an incinerator and I throw an encyclopedia into it, good luck reconstructing what was in that encyclopedia. The information is lost for all practical purpose.\nExplainer: Practical purposes.\n","149":"Explainer: Practical purposes.\nExplainee: Yes.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: One thing about quantum mechanics is that any time you have a state of the world and another state of the world, you can literally add them together and get a third possible state, as crazy as that sounds. And so if you're gonna have a quantum theory of gravity, then we can't really talk about there being a black hole or not a black hole, or an event horizon or not an event horizon, because we could always a state that had an event horizon and a state that doesn't, or has the event horizon in a slightly different position, maybe, and add them together. So the existence or position of an event horizon can't possibly be determined as a fact any more than the position of an electron is determined. So I think that's the loophole.\nExplainer: That's a nice way of looking at it. So that you're not actually violating classical relativity once you're in a regime where the wave function has really peaked around a very well-defined stage.\n","150":"Explainer: So this is a huge crisis 'cause either quantum mechanics is wrong, and as you described it, it's the most accurately-tested paradigm in the history of physics, how could it be wrong, right? Or the event horizon is letting information out and violating one of the most sacred principles of relativity.\nExplainee: One thing about quantum mechanics is that any time you have a state of the world and another state of the world, you can literally add them together and get a third possible state, as crazy as that sounds.

So I think that's the loophole.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: That's right, and one of the most exciting developments in the last 10 or 20 years is called holography, and it's called holography because a hologram is a two-dimensional surface that creates a three-dimensional image. It's got sort of 3D information built into it. And this, in a fundamental way, really has that 3D or higher dimensional information built into it. It's exactly the same as this theory of gravity and more dimensions.\nExplainer: Yes, so one of the things I like to think of with holography is that I can pack a certain amount of information in a black hole. I mean, you can literally think of it as throwing things into it. So let's say I have information in some volume and I'm under the illusion that I can just keep packing information in that volume, as much as the volume will contain. Eventually I'll make a black hole and I'll find out that the maximum amount of information I can pack into anything in the entire universe is what I can pack on the area. And since area is projecting the illusion, maybe, of volume, maybe the whole world is just a hologram. It's not a principle that only applies to black holes. It's saying that, if this theory of quantum gravity is correct, then this while three-dimensionality is an utter illusion and really the universe is two-dimensional. That's crazy.\n","151":"Explainer: That's a nice way of looking at it.

And the most knowledge you could ever have would only be on a two-dimensional surface.\nExplainee: Right, and as big as the universe, and then you're done. So, you know, not likely that we're ever gonna hit that limit any time soon.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: If we buy the idea of holography, then absolutely, that's for sure, that's what it's telling us. Although which side is the illusion and which side is the reality? They're the same.\nExplainer: I mean, temperature is still great to talk about. It doesn't mean we shouldn't talk about temperature. I mean, we should absolutely adjust our thermostats and talk about temperature. But if we look at it closer and closer and closer, we realize there's not a thing in the world that has as a quantum value temperature, isolated. And so maybe there is no such thing as gravity isolated from quantum mechanics.\n","153":"Explainer: [Robert] Would you like to give it a try?\nExplainee: Sure.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: That's awesome.\nExplainer: So you ready?\n","154":"Explainer: So you ready?\nExplainee: Yep.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Wow.\nExplainer: Let's fold it in half from corner to corner, unfold it and then we'll fold it in half the other direction, also corner to corner but we're going to lift it up and we're going to hold the fold with both hands.

We're gonna see artificial intelligence continue to evolve. We're gonna see connective devices and this sort of growing internet of things and machinery that can do a lot more and have a wallet and transact on their own.

The width of these fins is only six nanometers. Okay? So 6 nanometers is 25 to 30 atoms across. And they repeat this over the entire wafer just about perfectly. It's just a huge feat in engineering.

Can you think of any inputs the computer might have?\n","177":"Explainer: So on code.org, one of the things you've been doing is actually building a game or that they have a game and then you can actually rewire some of the inputs and outputs of that. Is that right?\nExplainee: Yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: [Linda] Space bar.\nExplainer: Yep, there's also things like your mouse and there's even things like the microphone itself is actually an input device. It's taking something from you, which is the sound and it's then transmitting that, ad it's actually sending it to me. Are there any other things that you can talk to a computer? You can give it information.\n","178":"Explainer: Okay. With computer hacking, it's actually the same thing.

Do you ever wonder how we do that?\nExplainee: Isn't it like a slingshot, like if you pull something back enough it'll go in the opposite direction?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: And does the gravity pull it or is it just floating?\nExplainer: In a weird way, that is gravity pulling it. So have you ever had a yo-yo where you swing it around like this? The string is pulling it in at all times, but you've also given it this angular momentum. And as long as you give it the angular momentum, pulling it in actually keeps it in orbit. And so the Earth is pulling it in at all times, so that's why it doesn't just travel off in a straight line. It keeps coming back around. So it's funny, people think that the International Space Station is so far away that they're not feeling gravity, and that's not the case at all. They're absolutely feeling gravity. They're just cruising so fast that, even though they're being pulled in, they never get pulled to the surface.\n","183":"Explainer: Well, that's true, we do use slingshot technology once things are out in the solar system. So, for instance, we use Jupiter and other planets so that when some of the spacecraft gets close, it'll slingshot around and it'll cause it to speed up. But mostly, around the Earth, gravity pulls things down, so when we want to send a rocket into space, when we wanna go to the Moon, when we wanna send supplies to the International Space Station, the trick is to get something moving fast enough that it escapes the gravitational pull of the Earth. Have you heard the expression what goes up must come down? It's actually not true. If you throw it fast enough, you can actually get something that doesn't come back down again, and that's basically how rocket launches work. You have to get the rocket for the Earth to go more than 11 kilometers a second. Think of how fast it is. Just one breath and it's gone 11 kilometers. If you get it to go that fast, it's not gonna come back down again. So you know the International Space Station which is orbiting the Earth? That's going around the Earth at 17,000 miles an hour. It has no engines anymore, the engines are turned off. So it's just there falling forever. So once it's out there, it's not coming back down as long as it's cruising like that.\nExplainee: And does the gravity pull it or is it just floating?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: It's like that ride at the rollercoasters where you go in and it's spins super fast and you can't feel it spinning fast but--\nExplainer: Yeah, you feel pinned to that. It's exactly like that. There's something called the equivalence principle where people realized, especially Einstein, that if you were in outer space in a rocket ship and it was dark and painted and it was accelerating at exactly the right rate, you actually wouldn't know if you were sitting on the floor of a building around the Earth or if you were on a rocket ship that was accelerating.\n","184":"Explainer: In a weird way, that is gravity pulling it.

You ever had that experience where you're sitting in a train and the other one moves and for a second you're not sure if you're the one moving?\n","185":"Explainer: Yeah. You ever had that experience where you're sitting in a train and the other one moves and for a second you're not sure if you're the one moving?\nExplainee: Yeah, 'cause I go on the train every day to go to school, but I never feel like I'm moving when I'm in the train, and then I'm like, wait, what?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Isn't that kinda crazy? Amazing.\nExplainer: So imagine you were an astronaut and you were floating in empty space. You can't see anything. There's no stars, there's no Earth. You can ask yourself, am I moving? There's really no way for you to tell. So you would probably conclude, well, I'm not moving. So then your friend Marina comes cruising past you, and maybe she's going thousands of kilometers a second, and you say, Marina, you're cruising at thousands of kilometers a second, you're going so fast. But she had just done the same experiment. She was just floating in space thinking, Am I moving? There's no way to know which one of you is moving and there's no meaning to the absolute motion. The only thing that's true is that you're in relative motion, that's true. You both agree you're in relative motion, and that's clear. But neither of you can say it's actually you who's moving and I'm stationary.\n","186":"Explainer: That's because in some sense, you're really not. Imagine you're in this train and it's going near the speed of light relative to the platform, but it's so smooth, then you should be in a situation in which there's no meaning to your absolute motion, there's no absolute motion. So that if you throw a ball up, you might think from the outside of the platform, be confused that when gravity pulls that back down, it's gonna hit you or something, but it'll land in your palm as surely as if you were in your living room.\nExplainee: Isn't that kinda crazy? Amazing.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: [laughs] I don't even know what to say to that.\nExplainer: So let me tell you where it gets really crazy.\n","187":"Explainer: So let me tell you where it gets really crazy.\nExplainee: [Maria laughs]\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Yeah.\nExplainer: So you would say, oh Marina is gonna measure a different speed of light. But she comes back and she says, No. 300,000 kilometers per second. Because from her perspective, she's standing still, and the laws of physics have better be the same for her. The speed of light is a fact of nature that's as true as the strength of gravity. And the two of you are in this quandary because if one of you is the preferred person who correctly measures the speed of light, that ruins everything about the idea of the relativity of motion. Which one of you should it be? So Einstein decides they must both measure the same speed of life. How could that possibly, possibly be the case? And he thinks, well, if speed is how far you travel, your spatial distance, in a certain amount of time, then there must be something wrong with space and time. And he goes from the constancy of the speed of light and a respect for this idea of relativity to the idea that space and time must not be the same for you and for Marina. And that's how he gets the idea of the relativity of space and time. [laughs] You have the best expression on your face. [laughs] It's pretty wild, but that is a starting point, actually, of the whole theory of relativity. That starting point leads to this complete revolution in physics where we suddenly have a Big Bang and black holes and space-time. Just from that one simple starting point. So, is your impression of gravity different than when we started the conversation?\n","188":"Explainer: Mine too, because I get to spend all day studying it. Because you know what sleep does for you?\nExplainee: It rests your body, like an electric car.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Whoa.\nExplainer: So today, we're going to talk about some animals and how they sleep. So here's the first one. What's that?\n","189":"Explainer: They're pretty cool, right?\nExplainee: Mhm.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: And how does it like recharge, like humans?\nExplainer: So we think it works the same way, but maybe just like more efficiently. And so we're still really learning about how this works. Sleep science itself is kind of a new field.\n","190":"Explainer: And so what's really cool about this is that giraffes need to sleep like everybody else, and so the way that it does is it kind of slumps over and it gets down on its legs and it kind of becomes this ball, but what's crazy about the whole thing is they only sleep for like 30 minutes a day. 30 minutes! Because it can't waste any more time, because it can't be vulnerable for any longer. It can get eaten by lions and that kind of thing. It has kind of evolved in a way that it can still survive and still get all the restoration it needs under such a short period of time.\nExplainee: And how does it like recharge, like humans?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: I had a sleepover on Saturday, and I didn't sleep at all.\nExplainer: And how did you feel?\n","191":"Explainer: And how did you feel?\nExplainee: Really tired.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: It affects what you can do in your daily life.\nExplainer: Excellent. So now I want to tell you about another animal and how they sleep, okay? So we have this one. What's that?\n","192":"Explainer: Would it be cool to have that power?\nExplainee: Uh yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Aww a dolphin.\nExplainer: A dolphin! Yes. So dolphins, kind of like hippos, have to sleep in the water, okay? But because they're mammals, right, they need to breathe. Dolphins breathe air. They have to go up to the surface and breathe, right? And for an animal like that, it needs to figure out a way that it can sleep but also still survive, right? You know how dolphins sleep?\n","193":"Explainer: So now I want to talk about our last animal, and I think this one is probably the most amazing of all. Okay, so what's this?\nExplainee: Aww a dolphin.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: How?\nExplainer: One half of their brain at a time. So half of their brain goes to sleep, and the other half stays awake, so that they can continue to breathe and swim, and they do it in this four hours a time, so like their right part of their brain sleeps, they're able to go up to the surface and breathe. Then their left part of their brain sleeps for four hours, and it goes back and forth, back and forth, so they can kind of maintain alertness, still breathe, and survive. Is that amazing or what?\n","194":"Explainer: I wanted to talk to you about a specific type of science called nanotechnology. Have you ever heard of this word before?\nExplainee: Nhn nhn.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: A baby ant?\nExplainer: A baby ant? Very good. So I have over here a meter stick, let me show it to you. And so that's a meter and if I divide it by 1000, I get a millimeter. So milli just means 1000. There's all these little lines on the ruler. And each of those little lines is one millimeter. So a baby ant is probably a couple of millimeters. So even the thing, that's the smallest thing you can think of, it's a million times bigger than a nanometer. Tiny, tiny, tiny.\n","195":"Explainer: A baby ant? Very good.

They're just little things that make up everything on Earth, even earth.\nExplainer: That was a perfect explanation. But what if I told you that scientists invented a special type of microscope that not only lets you see atoms, but also lets you move them around and build things with them. Would you think that would be pretty cool?\n","196":"Explainer: If I took this stick and I was to draw 1 billion lines, the distance between those two lines would be one nanometer. So that's really all it is. It's just a measure of size. But it's really, really, really tiny, smaller than anything that we can see with our eyes. The reason why, in nanotechnology, scientists, we care about things that are that small, is because there are objects called atoms. Have you ever heard of atoms before?\nExplainee: Yes. I first heard of them on a show I watched called StoryBots. They're just little things that make up everything on Earth, even earth.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Yeah!\nExplainer: So it's called a scanning tunneling microscope. And not only can you see the atoms, but you can move them around. Atoms are kind of sticky. You can actually build things using this instrument with actual individual atoms. So if I gave you that machine, would you want to make something? Would you want to look at something very carefully?\n","197":"Explainer: That was a perfect explanation.

And Realism was meant to capture the mundane, everyday lives of individuals and not idealize any of their activities in any way. And I think that that's really important for virtual reality. I think its kind of rite-of-passage for any kind of our technology to go through.\nExplainer: Mostly in VR we talk about the display and optics, the visual side of things, but we should at least tick off the other senses. And haptics is an interesting thing about virtual reality really doesn't have that aspect of touching things. You can move your hands around, you can do everything but its a disconnected experience because you know you don't have an actual solidity there. And I am pessimistic about progress in haptics technology. Almost all other areas I'm an optimist and I'm excited about what's coming up, but I don't have any brilliant vision about how we're going to revolutionize haptics and make it feel like we're touching the things in the virtual world.\n","200":"Explainer: You know an interesting topic is: what are the limits to what we can do with virtual reality? Where I'm pretty pleased with what we have today. What we can show people and say virtual reality, its cool. People get an amazing response from it. But we're still clearly a very, very long ways from reality.\nExplainee: That kinds of notes back to Realism in our history and how Realism was a response to Romanticism.

I think its kind of rite-of-passage for any kind of our technology to go through.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: So I've tried the demos, at VRLA there's one that has waves, like audio waves I believe, that come up and then you can put your hands through that and feel the waves whenever you're supposed to be feeling bubbles or any kind of force field or something. And those are pretty interesting. I've seen some pretty interesting things that you can do with audios, you can cut down a lot of the storage I guess and the power that you would need in order to power a huge scene, you can just mimic the sounds of those scenes actually being there and they're not actually. For example, a professor at USC would have the sound of a train drive by without actually rendering the sound. And you would feel like you're deeply immersed in this world without having to have such an expensive scene built around you. So I think those are pretty significant.\nExplainer: Yeah, that is one potential quality improvement that is still on the horizon is when we do spatialization, we use HRTF, the Head Relative Transfer Function, to make it sound like its in different places. But usually we just use this one kind of generic, here's your average human, HRTF function. Its possible, that of course, if you are right in the average then its perfect for you. But there's always people off to the extremes, that it doesn't do a very good job at. And there may be better ways to allow people to sample their own perfect HRTF which can improve the audio experience a lot. It all comes down to all these trade-offs.\n","201":"Explainer: Mostly in VR we talk about the display and optics, the visual side of things, but we should at least tick off the other senses.

Its really difficult to build trust again with people who haven't done VR before but its easy to break off that trust when they have a bad experience.\nExplainer: There was a huge concern about that at Oculus. And the term internally that went around was poisoning the well. They were very, very concerned. I mean for a long time there was a fight about whether gear VR should even be done, because the worry was if we let a product go out, like gear VR that didn't have those things. That if somebody saw it and it was bad, made them sick, made their eyes hurt, then they would be like I'm never going to try VR again. I tried it that time and it was terrible. And there was legitimate arguments about whether it was even a good idea to do that. And it turned out that yes, its obviously better to have all those things, but you can still do something that's valuable for the user without it. Its weird being at the beginning of a medium like this.\n","202":"Explainer: Yeah, that is one potential quality improvement that is still on the horizon is when we do spatialization, we use HRTF, the Head Relative Transfer Function, to make it sound like its in different places.

Especially if they're experienced with traditional medium.\n","203":"Explainer: So, from your perspective, how would you describe gravity?\nExplainee: I'm taught that it's a force. It's described by inverse law. But I also know that it's a field. And there's a recent discovery with gravitational waves, although I don't know the specific details about that.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Yeah.\nExplainer: So you can also think of a gravitational field, something that permeates all of space. Even though the earth is three stories below us, it's not as though it's pulling at us from a distance. We're actually interacting with the field at this point and there's a real interaction right here at this point. And that's nice, because people were worried that if things acted at a distance, that the way that old-fashioned inverse-square force law describes it, that it was as spooky as mind-bending a spoon, that it was like telekinesis. If you don't touch something, how do you affect it? And so the first step was to start to think of gravity as a field that permeates all of a space. And it's weaker very far from the Earth and it's closer very close to the Earth. So one way to think of this field as a field that's really describing a curved space-time that is everywhere. Forget the difficulty of the math, just the intuition comes from two kind of simple observations. One was what Einstein described as the happiest thought of his life. So, right now, you might feel heavy in your chair, and we might feel heavy on the floor and our feet, or standing in an elevator cab. And Einstein said, what does the chair have to do with it, or the floor, or the elevator? Those aren't gravitational objects. So he wanted to eliminate them, and one way to do the thought experiment is to imagine standing in an elevator that you can see out of, a black box. And imagine the cable is cut and you and the elevator begin to fall.\n","204":"Explainer: So, when you say it's an inverse-square law, that means that the closer you are, the more strongly you feel the gravitational pull. And that makes sense. There's very few things that are stronger when you're further apart.\nExplainee: Yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: So, in free fall?\nExplainer: You're in total free fall. Now, because things fall at the same rate, including the elevator and you, you can actually float in the elevator. If you just floated in the elevator, the two of you would drop, and you might not even know you're falling. You could take an apple and drop it in front of you, and it would float in front of you. You would actually experience weightlessness. It's called the equivalence principle. It was Einstein's happiest thought that what you're really doing when you're experiencing gravity isn't being heavy in your chair, it's falling weightlessly in the gravitational field. And that was the first step, to think of gravity as weightlessness and falling.\n","205":"Explainer: So you can also think of a gravitational field, something that permeates all of space.

Does that fit into that, or is that something?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: And are each of those dimensions, are they governed by the same laws of physics, or is there like a separate Lagrangian for each universe--\nExplainer: It's a, yeah.\n","212":"Explainer: It's a, yeah.\nExplainee: [Bela] Or how does that work?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Okay.\nExplainer: Why in the world would you think that there are extra dimensions, right? So you've heard of string theory?\n","213":"Explainer: Why in the world would you think that there are extra dimensions, right? So you've heard of string theory?\nExplainee: I have. So string theory is basically a theory of quantum gravity.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Right.\nExplainer: That's the good news. The bad news is that it only seems to work if spacetime is ten dimensional. [chuckles] So you would say well then it's wrong. It can't be right. Spacetime is not ten-dimensional. Spacetime is four dimensional. We've observed that. But instead, we say if spacetime looks four dimensional to us, but string theory, which might be the best theory we have of quantum gravity says it must be ten dimensional, maybe we can hide those extra six dimensions somehow. So here's how we could get lucky. We could imagine that there are extra dimensions of space that are curled up somehow that are so small that we can't see them. This is actually an old idea. It goes back to Kaluza and Klein right after general relativity was invented in 1915. But there's a more recent idea that says there could actually be relatively large extra dimensions. There could be extra dimensions that are actually that big, like a millimeter across that you would not have noticed. But here's the new, exciting idea. So let's imagine, okay. This is a piece of paper. But let's imagine this is our entire world. So, in other words, our real world is three dimensional, but let's imagine that we're just idealizing it down to two dimensions, so we all live here. You and I live here. But let's imagine that we're embedded in this bigger space. So there are extra dimensions that are actually big, okay? And let's imagine that. When I say we live on this three dimensional world what I mean is imagine that the particles that you and I are made of, right, the quarks, the leptons, the electrons and everything, all the forces we know about, electromagnetism, the weak nuclear force, the strong nuclear force, imagine they can't leave this surface. This is what we call a brane. B-R-A-N-E. Have you heard this word before?\n","214":"Explainer: Mm-hmm. So we have quantum mechanics, right? The theory of atoms and so forth and how those work, and then we have gravity, and gravity doesn't seem to fit in. It's the one force of nature that we can't really easily fit into this quantum mechanical framework, so string theory is one of the best ideas.\nExplainee: Right.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: I've heard it, yeah.\nExplainer: [Sean] Do you know where it comes from?\n","215":"Explainer: [Sean] Do you know where it comes from?\nExplainee: No.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Right.\nExplainer: If you have a two dimensional surface that vibrates and is a physical thing, we call that a membrane. Membrane theory goes back, it never was as popular as string theory, but it's been around for a while. But if you had extra dimensions of space, then you can three dimensional vibrating things, and four dimensional vibrating things.\n","216":"Explainer: From membranes, you know. We have lines, one dimension. We have two dimensional surfaces. So if you have a line that is a vibrating physical thing, you call it a string, right?\nExplainee: Right.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: So how do these strings give rise to things like mass and charge, and basically give us the properties of the particles that we see?\nExplainer: Well basically the strings are the particles that we see. It's exactly the same thing as we said for the straw, if you look at it far away it looks one dimensional. A little loop of string, so a little one dimensional circle that is vibrating. If you look at it from very, very far away, it just looks like a particle. So in string theory, an electron is a little string. A photon is a little string.\n","217":"Explainer: If you have a two dimensional surface that vibrates and is a physical thing, we call that a membrane.

Is it supposed to be the last thing that sort of unifies all the forces together?\nExplainer: Yes, string theory's even better. So the phrase Grand Unified Theory was coined in the 1970s for theories that joined electricity and magnetism. So a good string theory is gravity plus the Grand Unified Theory.\n","218":"Explainer: Yes, string theory's even better. So the phrase Grand Unified Theory was coined in the 1970s for theories that joined electricity and magnetism. So a good string theory is gravity plus the Grand Unified Theory.\nExplainee: Okay.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: So we have three spatial dimensions. A brane is sort of the next level. So a brane is a higher dimensional object that vibrates through space.\nExplainer: That's right. And we could live there. The world we see around us, the three dimensions of space around us could reflect the fact that we are somehow stuck on a three dimensional brane trying to escape.\n","219":"Explainer: It's even better. It's the theory of everything. What would you tell a friend of yours if they asked you what dimensions are, what extra dimensions are, what a brane is?\nExplainee: So we have three spatial dimensions. A brane is sort of the next level. So a brane is a higher dimensional object that vibrates through space.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: It was really cool to learn about strings and branes and how looking at gravity on small scales is actually connected to what I do in looking at gravity on these cosmological scales, and it's definitely something I'm gonna think about in my research.\n","220":"Explainer: [Bettina] Have you ever heard of blockchain?\nExplainee: I have. Whenever we have a transaction, and let's say I buy something from you, this information gets logged. And it gets verified by a third person or third party. And then if like all this information verified and it all matches, right, the transaction goes through without any intermediary basically, right? It gets stored, and when you make further transactions, this information is ready, embedded. It's in the ledger.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Absolutely. The way the technology's changing, nothing's gonna be like it used to be. And there's no like firm, and then the buyer and the seller, it basically, we'll have to rewrite a lot of rules in economics as well.\nExplainer: For sure. A lot of the assumptions won't hold true.\n","221":"Explainer: Same with, who are the actors? It's not just people anymore. It's machines.\nExplainee: [Valentinas] Absolutely.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: So at least when we talk about Bitcoin, there are some trust issues and some hacks. So there's obviously a need to work on trust and feeling that it's a safe technology.\nExplainer: Yeah. One of the problems that Bitcoin has faced is Bitcoins getting stolen or lost. But a lot of that actually comes from people trying to recentralize Bitcoin in different ways making themselves actually a pretty easy target.\n","222":"Explainer: We're gonna have to create entire new concepts of how they do trade and how they work with us, too. What kind of barriers or road blocks would you imagine are gonna happen in the blockchain space?\nExplainee: So at least when we talk about Bitcoin, there are some trust issues and some hacks. So there's obviously a need to work on trust and feeling that it's a safe technology.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Absolutely, so education will be a big part before we actually can use the technology in a wide sense. Right?\nExplainer: Yeah. To actually transition into the mainstream and make it useful for average people to use, we're going to need to make sure we have a lot more education, a lot more standards and probably work with a lot of enterprises to create sort of a user experience around this being a technology that is safe and usable and understandable. What is the current state of blockchain in your understanding? What's gonna have to happen next?\n","223":"Explainer: Yeah.

Right?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: The current state is in the research state, and it's being developed to be applied in many, many areas. It must be used almost everywhere to where we won't even imagine how we lived without it. But I'm not sure where it's going to go. I mean, no one really knows, right.\nExplainer: Well, we have a lot of public blockchains. Like we have Bitcoin. We have the Ethereum network and XT, but a lot of companies and consortiums are getting together to build private blockchains, so ones that are more closed off at first and then may evolve into a public network where people feel comfortable using it. And some are also proof of concept out in the real world, projects in energy and in pharmaceuticals and in retail and lots of different fields are starting experiments. And we'll see in the next few years how all of those interact and what we learn about the best use cases for blockchain and what it means for trade.\n","224":"Explainer: Yeah.

I mean, no one really knows, right.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","225":"Explainer: Because the materials are so small, they're at the nanoscale, their properties are dominated by quantum mechanics, which means that even slight changes in their size, in their orientation give profound changes in their properties. And while that's very scientifically interesting, and it allows you to tune their properties by making subtle changes, from a technology point of view, it's a bit of a headache in the sense that in technology want to optimize for a property and then repeat that over and over again. So what are some of the challenges that you face in the lab related to working with these materials and then trying to incorporate them into the batteries?\nExplainee: I think every step of a process in a battery is something where you have to think about how would this translate to making a battery in terms of the production? One thing that I think is very interesting about the field of nanoscale materials in general, is that how you make the material changes the properties a lot. And so we claim that this 2D material has this property, then tying that to the battery performance is something that's pretty difficult to do. It takes a few steps in between. So we have to think kind of creatively with how we can do that.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","226":"Explainee: I'm Tom Hull, I'm a math professor, a mathematician. I've been doing origami since I was eight years old and studying the mathematics of origami ever since grad school, at least.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Why does origami lend itself to, say, this type of application?\nExplainer: Origami applications have in common, is that at some stage the thing is flat and so whenever you need to either start from a flat state and then take it to a 3D state, or conversely, for deployables like space, you want to have it in a fully folded flat state but then take it to a 3D state, or possibly an unfolded flat state. Whenever a flat state is involved, origami is a really effective way of making the transition between those states.\n","227":"Explainer: The first thing I want to show you is origami in the real world. This is the origami lamp. It comes shipped flat but it folds, clip holds it together. The lamp has LEDs on the inside so when we power it up we get light, we have a lampshade and we get the base.\nExplainee: Why does origami lend itself to, say, this type of application?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Another aspect of origami and origami mechanisms that has leant itself to many different uses is the fact that it's scalable. When you have an origami crease pattern like the Miura-Ori used in solar panel deployment, the type of motion that you see happening here will happen whether this is on a piece of paper that's small like this, or on a larger scale, or even on a smaller, smaller, smaller, smaller scale. Engineers, in particular robotics engineers, are turning to origami toward designing mechanisms that will either be really big or really, really small. This looks like the most promising way of getting nano robotics to work.\nExplainer: This is another real-world application but this particular implementation is used to make a wheel for a Rover.\n","228":"Explainer: This is another real-world application but this particular implementation is used to make a wheel for a Rover.\nExplainee: Cool, so this is something that can actually get really, really tiny but then get big and fat and roll.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Yeah!\nExplainer: Another origami challenge that comes up with these patterns is if we're going to make an aircraft out of this thing we're going to need hundreds of yards of folded origami. We're not going to do it by hand and this might be the new frontier in origami engineering, which is the design of machines that can fold patterns that have applications.\n","229":"Explainer: New problems arise when we try to make origami out of things other than paper, but also new opportunities. An example here which is a kind of a variant of the Miura-Ori. It's got a three-dimensional structure. If I stretch it one way, it expands the other but because it has these S-bends in the pattern, if you squeeze it, it doesn't go all the way flat. This is a epoxy impregnated aramid fiber and so if I put this fold pattern into it and then compress it and then put a skin on the top and bottom, this becomes incredibly lightweight but incredibly strong.\nExplainee: Yeah!\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: So you're talking about a machine that is actually folding it into this, not just making the creases but actually folding it.\nExplainer: Yeah, so what goes in as sheet and what comes out is this, or something this wide.\n","230":"Explainer: We're gonna talk about blockchain technology. Have you heard of blockchain?\nExplainee: I've heard of the words blockchain, but I'm not sure I know what it is.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Okay.\nExplainer: And so it's being run by all of these different computers that have like a node. So they're all running the same software and guaranteeing your transactions as they happen.\n","231":"Explainer: And so it's being run by all of these different computers that have like a node. So they're all running the same software and guaranteeing your transactions as they happen.\nExplainee: I mean, I would assume this technology is taking away business or activity from these middlemen.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Is there a mechanism for verifying that person A is a legitimate seller or producer of the item?\nExplainer: So today, a lot of people are working on how to create identity structures that leverage blockchains. And one of the tools for doing that is being able to cryptographically sign for a given attribute. So your government could sign that you have a US passport or a university could sign that you are a currently enrolled student. And you could then dole out that information and control it yourself and be able to show people those certifications on an as needed basis.\n","232":"Explainer: In some cases, yeah, it is. And a lot of people in the financial industry, in particular, are looking at it from the banking side of how do we use this technology to trade things like Bitcoin or other tokens that are easier to use instead of today's currency. A lot of people think about blockchain as Bitcoin because it's sort of in the news a lot, and it's this new cryptocurrency. And it's kind of exciting. But we're actually seeing a lot more use cases for blockchain that aren't around the currency side. They're more around, how do you take any asset and be able to trade that using this same technology.\nExplainee: Is there a mechanism for verifying that person A is a legitimate seller or producer of the item?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","233":"Explainer: Good to see you again, Yue.\nExplainee: Yes, good to see you.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: So I'm a epidemiologist, so we do a lot of work on the epidemiology of sleep and development of neurodegenerative diseases including both Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease, so ADMPD. We mainly work on population studies. We work on thousands and even millions of population, and we use statistical modeling to find out the association between different sleep disturbances and also genetics related to sleep disturbances and link that to their risk of developing ADMPD.\nExplainer: So how strong is the link?\n","234":"Explainer: So it's interesting, so I also saw that there was also a recent meta-analysis around sleep disturbances and dementia risk, and in that study, they looked about 250,000 people in this meta-analysis, and they followed them around for 10 years, and you know, when they pulled all the samples together, they found there was a 1.2 fold increased risk for developing all caused dementia, so it sounds like both sleep apnea and then maybe sleep disturbances more generally are associated with increased risk for dementia. When I think about that, I think about how sleep lives in the brain, these neurodegenerative diseases live in the brain, and so what do we know about the causality of this? Could it be that individuals who have early onset of say, Alzheimer's, have then poor sleep kind of as a consequence of that?\nExplainee: Yeah, so I think what's really fascinating is all these bio-directional relationships that's being identified in animal studies especially, showing that sleep changes actually occur very early on in the disease process, so it could be a prodromal stage of Parkinson's, and also in transgenic model of AD, they're already showing a lot of circadian abnormalities in this mouse.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Yes, in the transgenic mouse models of AD, including those expressing human mutant amyloid precursor protein, APP type or both, so that's kind of showing the sleep changes in both of these pathologies.\nExplainer: Okay, so there is this bio-directional piece, but I think perhaps the most exciting thing that happened in the sleep field, at least in my view, has been understanding the role of sleep and its clearance of beta-amyloid in the brain. This idea that sleep is kind of the dishwasher of the brain, it seems like, that you know A betta accumulates as we kind of use energy, and you know it's kind of a waste product, and the idea that if you don't clear it out, that it's going to build up and accumulate.\n","235":"Explainer: Okay, so there is this bio-directional piece, but I think perhaps the most exciting thing that happened in the sleep field, at least in my view, has been understanding the role of sleep and its clearance of beta-amyloid in the brain.

How would you make one point out of this sheet of paper?\n","237":"Explainer: That's a corner, four corners of the square, four points. How would you make one point out of this sheet of paper?\nExplainee: I'm thinking of, like, a paper airplane.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Okay.\nExplainer: The crane has four circles but, actually, there's a little bit of a surprise because what about this? There's a fifth circle, which is like that, but does the crane have a fifth flap in it? Let's refold it and put the wings up. Well, yes, there is, there's another point and that point is the fifth circle of our crane.\n","238":"Explainer: Yeah, exactly. Actually you've discovered something pretty neat because you made your point not from a corner so you've already discovered one of the key insights. Any flap, any point, leg of the ant, takes up a circular region of paper. Here's our boundary. To make your point from an edge you use that much paper and the shape, it's almost a circle. If we take the crane we'll see if the circles are visible in the crane pattern. Here's the crane pattern, and here's a boundary of the wing, and here's the other wing.\nExplainee: Okay.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Okay.\nExplainer: And to do that we use a new technique called circle packing in which all of the long features of the design are represented by circles. So, each leg becomes a circle, each wing becomes a circle and things that can be big and thick, like the head or the abdomen, can be points in the middle. Now we have the basic idea of how to design the pattern, we just count the number of legs we want. We want a spider, if it's got let's say eight legs, it's also got an abdomen, that's another point, and it's got a head, so maybe that's 10 points. If we find an arrangement of 10 circles we should be able to fold that into the spider. So in this book, Origami Insects II, it's one of my books and has some patterns, and this is one of them for a flying ladybug and, in fact, it is exactly this flying ladybug. We've got the crease pattern here in the circles and you might now be able to see which circles end up as which parts, knowing that the largest features like the wings are going to be the largest circles, smaller points will be smaller circles. So any thoughts which might be?\n","239":"Explainer: The crane has four circles but, actually, there's a little bit of a surprise because what about this?

Well, yes, there is, there's another point and that point is the fifth circle of our crane.\nExplainee: Okay.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Well, the legs and the antenna would probably have to be these smaller ones, in the middle.\nExplainer: Yeah, that's right.\n","240":"Explainer: You've got it, so you are ready to design origami.\nExplainee: Awesome.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Wow, that's so impressive. I think I learned how to make one of these paper cranes when I was in third grade but I guess I never unfolded it to actually see where it was coming from. And so now that it's all broken up into circles it makes these super complicated insects and animals and everything seem so much simpler, so that's so cool. I'm pretty excited about it.\nExplainer: That's so cool.\n","241":"Explainer: I remember reading your papers when I was a student and we're all trying to create these materials and finding ways to exploit their properties. What I love, and I'm delighted that you're here to talk to us about is how you took inspiration from nature and sort of recognize that nature's figured out a way to both synthesize incredibly complex nanostructures with high functionality and how you sort of were inspired by that to do the research that you're doing now.\nExplainee: Life gave us this toolkit that is already on the nanoscale. So we think that that's a great place to think about making materials on the nano scale and manipulating materials on the nano scale, and wiring them together as well. This abalone shell, you can see the exquisite beautiful colors and structures of it. This is a nano composite material. If you take this and fracture it, and you look at it in a scanning electron microscope, what you'll see is that it's made out of these beautiful tablets. And I studied that as a graduate student. I looked at that and I said, that is completely amazing. You have an organism in the ocean, that takes what's in its environment, which is calcium and carbonate. That's dissolved in the water and templates it into this really exquisite structure. And so you think that's great. Calcium carbonate is great, but what if we wanted to make a solar cell or a another electronic device or a battery, how would you get an organism to do that? And you say, okay, that's a really crazy idea. But is it really that crazy if this abalone, already figured out how to do it, 500 million years ago? So we're saying, okay, abalones build shells. Can viruses build solar cells, can viruses build catalysts? Can they build batteries using the same kind of idea?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: We work on something called bacteriophages, it's a virus with DNA. This particular bacteriophage called M13 bacteriophage is made up of single stranded DNA and proteins. It's long and thin. So it's 880 nanometers in length, and it's about 9 nanometers in diameter. And so one of the reasons I love it is it spans the nanoscale and almost the micron scale at the same time. Take the single strand DNAs, obviously a model, and you can cut it with molecular scissors. And you can put a new piece of DNA in between. And so you put a small piece of DNA in there that doesn't belong there. And that piece of DNA is going to randomly code for a protein. Now, the next time that that virus is replicated within a bacterial host, it'll be able to put a new protein sequence on the coat, just a short protein sequence on the coat, maybe like 8 or 12 amino acids in length. And just like that abalone is going to grab calcium and build calcium carbonate. We're going to have our viruses build iron phosphate for a battery electrode material or Gallium arsenide or cad sulfide for a semiconductor material.\nExplainer: So you've evolved, and I suppose, trained these viruses to build the materials that you want them to build by exposing them to the raw materials and then evolving their function. We're talking about the electronics from nanomaterials. That critical issue that we're facing is how do you go from those single experiments with a single material, understanding its properties, how do you scale that to the billions of devices that you need in a technology? It is a chemistry driven approach. We're not going to grow them exactly where we want them, but to take that one step, and to tie into what you're doing, tt sounds like there could be an area of collaboration where instead of using conventional chemistry, that we can train some of these biological elements to do that work work for us.\n","242":"Explainer: It's really fascinating work, especially now we're all familiar with the viruses and how they act. And I'm not aware of any viruses that build nanostructures. So how did you come to that? And then how do you actually program a virus to do your bidding?\nExplainee: We work on something called bacteriophages, it's a virus with DNA.

We're going to have our viruses build iron phosphate for a battery electrode material or Gallium arsenide or cad sulfide for a semiconductor material.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Biology is chemistry. Molecules, proteins, and DNA work with all the same kinds of bonding and things that the chemicals that you're gonna be looking for in these processes. It's put together in a way that when a protein or enzyme folds, it almost always folds correctly. That's kind of the beauty of it, the predictable aspect of it encoded in its DNA. If we need to make it the same over and over again, then as long as you have the right DNA sequence, DNA is a beautiful structure on the nanoscale. And there's really, really cool, incredible work on DNA origami, when DNA can fold into just the right structure. And so I can see that as an interface, that would be really cool and interesting in your work. And you can have the virus make the DNA for the DNA origami, and then you use DNA to assemble your beautiful structures.\nExplainer: It's really fascinating. You have all these little worker viruses building the materials for you. How are you then applying these materials that you're building?\n","243":"Explainer: Looking ahead, 5 years, 10 years, where do you see your own work, and maybe the field more broadly?\nExplainee: The future I'd like to see is environmentally friendly chemistry and materials synthesis. And I think that we're really going that way. If we think about batteries of the future, solar cells of the future, thinking about earth abundant materials and processes that are compatible with the earth and environment.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: I agree completely. We like to solve problems. Nano bio is the toolkit that we bring a lot. It happens to be a very strong and evolving toolkit. That's another thing that I love about biology is if you can come up with a solution that's not perfect at all to begin with when you're making a battery electrode material or any kind of material you're making, you have evolution on your side to try to make it better and better as a function of time. That can be quite rapid.\nExplainer: So Angela, thank you so much for joining us. And I look forward to seeing more work coming out of your lab in the future.\n","244":"Explainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Right.\nExplainer: Telescopes, solar arrays, they need to be packed into a rocket, go up, but then expand in a very controlled, deterministic way when they get up into space.\n","245":"Explainer: Whenever there's a part of a spacecraft that is shaped somewhat like paper, meaning it's big and flat, we can use folding mechanisms from origami to make it smaller.\nExplainee: Right.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Okay.\nExplainer: These are the building blocks of many, many origami deployable shapes, it's called a degree-4 vertex. It's the number of lines. So in this case, we use solid lines for mountain, we use dash lines for valley. We're going to fold it and use these two to illustrate some important properties of origami mechanisms. It's important in the study of mechanisms to take into account the rigidity. So what we're going to do to help simulate rigidity is to take these rectangles and we're going to fold them over and over so that they just become stiff and rigid.\n","246":"Explainer: Telescopes, solar arrays, they need to be packed into a rocket, go up, but then expand in a very controlled, deterministic way when they get up into space.\nExplainee: Okay.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: [Grad Student] Okay.\nExplainer: So this is what's called a single degree of freedom mechanism. You have one degree of freedom, I can choose this fold, and then if these are perfectly rigid every other fold angle is fully determined. One of the key behaviors here is that with the smaller angles up here, the two folds that are the same parity and the folds that are of opposite parity move at about the same rate but with this, as we're getting closer to 90 degrees, we find they move at very different rates and then at the end of the motion, the opposite happens. This one is almost folded but this one goes through a much larger motion so the relative speeds differ.\n","247":"Explainer: These are the building blocks of many, many origami deployable shapes, it's called a degree-4 vertex.

So, these are examples of a pattern called the Miura-Ori. When you stretch them out they're pretty big.\n","248":"Explainer: So this is what's called a single degree of freedom mechanism.

What sort of angle would you want so that they open up the same rate?\nExplainer: Infinitesimally small.\n","250":"Explainer: So, sadly, the only way to get them at exactly the same rate is when these are microscopic slivers and then that's not useful.\nExplainee: For sure, right, right.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: So, it's kind of a trade-off?\nExplainer: There's an engineering trade-off to get them both to work. And there's another place that shows up in deployable structures in a very cool structure. This is a folded tube, it sort of pops out like this but it has this neat property that if you twist it quickly, it changes color. There's a Mars Rover application where they need a sleeve that protects a drill and as the drill goes down, the sleeve is going to collapse and they're using a pattern very much like this.\n","251":"Explainer: And it's exactly the difference between the motions of these two vertices. So these angles are closer to right angles and the closer you get to a right angle the more asymmetry there is between the two directions of motion. And then the other difference is how efficiently they pack, so these started at about the same size but when they're flat notice that yours is much more compact. So if I were you making a solar array, I'd say, oh, I want that one. But if I say, well, I want them to open at the same rate, then I want this one.\nExplainee: So, it's kind of a trade-off?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Interesting.\nExplainer: There are many open mathematical questions and so room for mathematicians, like yourself, to have a big impact on the world of origami and mechanisms. And even though those studies are mathematically interesting, they're going to also have real-world applications in space, solar arrays, drills, telescopes, and more. Any questions or thoughts about this?\n","252":"Explainer: There's an engineering trade-off to get them both to work.

The idea is that if you've got a system here that can make you see whatever we want you to see, then we can make you believe that you're anywhere else, like on top of a mountain, or in a dungeon or under the ocean.\nExplainee: Or in Minecraft.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Yeah.\nExplainer: So what they do, the trick for that is, if you ever at a theater and you take up the glasses and you look at it, you'll see its blurry where there's actually two pictures that they're showing at the same time. And what those little glasses do, is they let one eye see one picture, and the other eye see a different picture. So then your eyes can say, oh it looks like I'm seeing through the screen or something is floating out in front of it. In the VR headsets, what we do is, there's actually either two screens or one screen split in half, so that it draws a different picture, completely different picture, for each eye. And we make sure that each eye can only see the picture it intended to. And that's what can make things feel like they got this real depth to them, that its something that you could reach out and touch and it doesn't feel like a flat TV screen.\n","254":"Explainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Mm-hmm.\nExplainer: Okay, that's great. On one side, we have a lot of the notes which make us feel brighter, you know, like these kinds of, (keyboard music) these really bright sounds. And the other side is a lot more to do with the darkness of a key center. So we're home in F, but imagine we're taking a quick visit to B-flat, but then the sun comes out.\n","255":"Explainer: Essentially what harmony is, is like a language, right? And so as with any language, the more words you're capable of speaking in a language, the more you can say.

Let's play it in its simplest form.\nExplainee: Yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Yeah.\nExplainer: Nice, okay cool. Lets try one more version where we add some colors.

It's not really one dimensional, right?\nExplainee: So everything has to be one or two dimensional before it's three dimensional.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: I think I would be maybe there, since I'm facing it.\nExplainer: But here's what I want you to think about. If I say I'm at this point on the line, I could translate that into saying I'm at the three centimeter point, if I were here I'd be at the four centimeter point, the five centimeter point, right?\n","262":"Explainer: And how would you find yourself, like if someone said where are you, could you use some words or ideas to say where you are on that line?\nExplainee: I think I would be maybe there, since I'm facing it.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Yeah.\nExplainer: So every point, every location on our little line--\n","263":"Explainer: Has its own unit, has one number.\nExplainee: Yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Unlike three dimensional, you have to tell a lot 'cause if it's like a sphere, you kind of have to start using points.\nExplainer: There you go. Exactly. We're gonna build a little two dimensional space. You wanna do it? You wanna do the honors here? Why don't you put those two lines together?\n","264":"Explainer: We need one number to tell you where we are. That's one dimension. That's what it means to be one dimensional. I only need to tell you one number to figure out where we are.\nExplainee: Unlike three dimensional, you have to tell a lot 'cause if it's like a sphere, you kind of have to start using points.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: If you make it two dimensional is this, a corner.\nExplainer: Exactly, there you go.\n","265":"Explainer: I think you should be in this chair and you should be explaining this to me.

The news would be spreaded around the world rapidly.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Yeah.\n","268":"Explainer: So in your studies, have you learned about machine learning?\nExplainee: Yeah, I have. So to me, machine learning is essentially exactly what it sounds like. It's trying to teach a machine specifics about something by inputting a lot of data points and slowly, the machine will build up knowledge about it over time. For example, my Gmail program, I assume that there would be a lot of, like, machine learning models happening at once, right?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: I'd probably look at certain keywords. Maybe if the recipient and the sender had exchanged emails before and generally, those fell into in the past.\nExplainer: So these are things we would call features. And we go through a process where we do feature engineering, where somebody looks at the example and says, Okay, these are the things that I think might allow us to statistically tell the difference from something in one category versus another. So for example, perhaps you don't speak Russian, you start getting a lot of email in Russian.\n","269":"Explainer: Absolutely. And that's a great example because you have models that are operating to do things like figure out if a new email is spam or not. So what would you think about if you were looking at an email and trying to decide if it went in one category or another?\nExplainee: I'd probably look at certain keywords. Maybe if the recipient and the sender had exchanged emails before and generally, those fell into in the past.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Obviously, like the features that you just described are features which a person would have had to think about. Are there features which, like, the machine itself could learn?\nExplainer: This is a great question because it really gets to the difference between some of our different tools in our machine learning tool belt in addressing problems like this. So if we were to use a supervised learning classic classification approach, a person would need to think about those features and creatively come up with them in approach we call the kitchen sink approach, which is just try everything you can possibly think of and see what works. Unsupervised learning, where we don't have labeled data and we're trying to infer some structure out of the data is you're projecting that data into a space and looking for things like clusters. And there's a bunch of really fun math about how you do that, how you think about distance and by distance, I mean that if we have two data points in space, how do we decide if they're similar or not?\n","270":"Explainer: So these are things we would call features.

Unsupervised learning, we don't necessarily have those labels. That's the thing we're trying to discover. So reinforcement learning is another technique that we use sometimes. You can think about it like a turn in a game and you can play, you know, millions and millions of trials so that you're able to develop a system that by experimenting with reinforcement learning can eventually learn to play these games pretty successfully.

And it actually comes historically from trying to train a robot to navigate a room. If it bonks into this chair, it can't go forward anymore. And if it falls into that pit, you know, it's not going to succeed.

So years ago, I had a client that was a big telecom company and they had a data scientist who built a deep learning system to predict customer churn. It actually was very accurate, but it wasn't useful because nobody knew why the prediction was what it was. So they could say, you know, Sunny, you're likely to quit next month.

If you really are happy not to necessarily understand or be able to interpret what your system is doing or you're willing to invest in another set of work afterwards to understand what the system is doing once you've already trained it.

'Cos it's not like our beams are as perfect as we like to think they are.\nExplainee: So that's right so you have to have the aperture size, you have to have them phase locked across the entire aperture. Which will be a great challenge and people have done it, again, with small lasers. The lasers we'll be trying to do is about a 40cm aperture. So we'll begin to start looking at this. And actually wavelength control and then be able to adaptive optics other ways which you can control the uniformity of the phase is something that's been developed in lots of ways now. For defense applications, for science applications. So we will do our best to make use of all these technologies. Lasers I think have progressed so much. Just like the semi conductor did, 'cos there's such a market for it, there were so many different applications for that.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: I remember when laser was first demonstrated 1960, what could we do with this? We already got light. Now we can't live without lasers. My cell phone, that is in my pocket, has billions of transistors. How is that made? With lasers. All of the greatest circuitry is done with lasers. Actually now it's using x-rays, made from laser heated matter. That came out of the laser fusion program.\nExplainer: So it is amazing, the parallels. And optics is used everywhere. We're gonna possibly take over from CERN, we'll just do high energy physics with lasers, we're looking at gravity waves with lasers, we wanna do black holes with lasers, we wanna machine with lasers, we wanna do medicine with lasers.

We discussed it in class as how hackers look at some of the weakest links in these large networks and use those to tap into networks.\nExplainer: Yeah, that's another interesting concept. It's really just different layers that we have for protection, because often when you're talking about something like a corporate network, or even your home network, you typically have sort of one level of defense, right? If someone can break that or it can get in through some other system that is connected or exposes some other protocol, like Bluetooth, right? You can connect to a Bluetooth device without being on the wireless network, without being on the LAN. That potentially gives you another place that you can pivot on and then access other devices, because if something has both Bluetooth and also Wi-Fi, well, if you can get in through Bluetooth, then you can then access the Wi-Fi and get to other devices on the network.

More and more, we're actually using smaller and smaller computers with smaller amounts of compute power. If you take a car, you have hundreds of microcontrollers that are all running there. So they don't really have a sophisticated operating system that can try to prevent attacks like buffer overflows. So how do we keep these low cost computers in here while adding layers of protection to prevent malice and these types of attacks? Sometimes it actually is, how can we write software or how can we build a system that prevents these types of attacks from entering? But oftentimes, it's really looking for how can we find new attacks that we haven't even necessarily thought of? What got you interested in computer science and information security?\n","288":"Explainer: But what's really cool about that is, when you're going into memory, you're starting to cross over that boundary of that hundred byte allocation, and now you're starting to write over additional memory. That other memory is really important stuff. So you have your name, the hundred bytes there, and then right next to your name is the return address, and that's the address that the code is gonna execute and it's going to return to after that function is done, and it's going to jump to that address, but after you type your hundred bytes, the next few bites that you type, you're actually going to overwrite that return address. So that return address could essentially be another address in memory. So what you end up doing is you type a name and it's not really a name, it's really just code. And that code, you keep typing until you get to the return address, and you start typing an address, which is really the beginning of your name and your computer or your processor is actually going to read that address and it will jump back to the beginning and then execute that payload. So that was sort of the very first thing that I think was super exciting to me when I started learning about really reverse engineering.\nExplainee: So how does the buffer overloading relate to what you are doing in terms of network security or designing software for penetration testing?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: I got interested in cybersecurity because I'm really into global affairs, global politics, and you often hear in the news about the rising power of China, the rising power of Iran. I enjoy how interdisciplinary computer science is. Like, nowadays there's so much going on in the world of computers and that's what fascinated me.\nExplainer: You brought up China and Iran, and something that's interesting about those areas is really censorship, right? They have essentially censored internet. In the US, we have a really interesting internal struggle here where we actually have government agencies like the state department that are funding software to evade censorship, like Tor and other mechanisms. While then we also have an internal struggle where we have other organizations like the NSA who are specifically looking to break that exact same system that the US government is also funding.\n","289":"Explainer: Ever since buffer overflow started many years ago, there been a lot of protection mechanisms built to make it difficult to exploit. More and more, we're actually using smaller and smaller computers with smaller amounts of compute power. If you take a car, you have hundreds of microcontrollers that are all running there. So they don't really have a sophisticated operating system that can try to prevent attacks like buffer overflows. So how do we keep these low cost computers in here while adding layers of protection to prevent malice and these types of attacks? Sometimes it actually is, how can we write software or how can we build a system that prevents these types of attacks from entering? But oftentimes, it's really looking for how can we find new attacks that we haven't even necessarily thought of?

I can actually understand that because if we are creating a technology that we are going to deploy somewhere else, we should know its limitations. We should know how to control it.\nExplainer: It's good for us to understand how these systems can really break down. Although, I think one thing that I see is that some of, let's say, the organizations that are looking to break this are not necessarily going to share once they actually learn that information. They might actually sort of hold that in their back pocket and use it when it's advantageous to them.\n","290":"Explainer: You brought up China and Iran, and something that's interesting about those areas is really censorship, right?

Isn't that amazing?\nExplainee: Yes.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Yes.\nExplainer: And that's because the light will go through this glass and, when it hits that corner, it has to bend. And we actually send laser beams down glass fibers, the size of your hair.\n","295":"Explainer: One of the things that lasers are great for is that because it's a directed beam, we can actually put that light where we want the light to go and sometimes you maybe just want to see something around the corner and you can't see it.

I like the one where you did the green one.\nExplainer: The green one. And the next time you go to a grocery store, take a peek at the red.\n","299":"Explainer: Have you done any work in side channel analysis?\nExplainee: Like, a little bit. I read the Rowhammer paper. I found it really interesting, but it's nothing that I've actually worked with.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: So all memory devices are just, it's just a bunch of gates and they're in rows. They basically all hold different pieces of memory. That's all the gates are. Either they're turned on or they're turned off. So what Rowhammer found was they tested a bunch of different memory devices and found that by doing a certain order of storing things, and then pulling that information back in a certain way in one place would actually flip gates in a different place. So you could actually do a bunch of things to a piece of memory that had nothing to do with something that may be critical in a different place and actually change its contents, and that obviously exposes all sorts of security issues, because that's very hard to predict.\nExplainer: Yeah, I suppose the physical adjacency of the underlying transistors and capacitors that are holding that storage. That's crazy. I think the first time I heard of an interesting attack like that was learning about the cold boot attack. Being able to, you know, someone enters their password on their computer and that decrypts their hard drive and then they walk away. Being able to extract that password is really difficult. If I can pull that memory chip out and extract that memory, put it in my own device, except the problem is memory is volatile, so it'll erase as soon as I pull it out. You can take something like canned air, turn it upside down, cool that computer, make it real nice and cool. Then you have a minute or two to pull out the memory, put into your own device, extract the memory, and then you're good. It's such a simple method to really extract something kind of critical. Like Rowhammer, it's such a low level of vulnerability and you could argue that it's not necessarily a vulnerability in the architecture itself, but rather exploitation of physics at that point.\n","300":"Explainer: So the side channel analysis is really looking not at a vulnerability within a system, but really unintended consequences of what the system is built on. A very simple example of a side channel is putting your ear to the ground to hear if there are horses coming towards you, and the same thing applies to technology. So you can have something like a CPU, it's executing instructions, certain instructions that use a little bit more power, and power is reserved in these capacitors, which are like tiny batteries next to your CPU. And as they're pulling power, there's something in physics called the electrostrictive effect where the capacitor will move in a very, very tiny amount. And then although we can't hear it, the microphone on a mobile device can actually listen to that. If you then listen to that and you say, oh, I see a pattern here, and you can go all the way down and then extract and reveal the full password, the full key, even though it could be argued that the algorithm itself, there's no problem with it.\nExplainee: So all memory devices are just, it's just a bunch of gates and they're in rows.

Over the last year while I was doing some other stuff, I actually designed some microcontroller boards for a company that was doing stuff with, like, a smart watering project. The problems with updating is just, like, that scares me the most. Like, people don't update their own stuff, let alone these, like, devices.\nExplainer: I keep forgetting to update my fridge.\n","301":"Explainer: That's pretty challenging if you want to use wireless, right? If you wanna use a wireless router.\nExplainee: Yeah, I mean, there's obviously essentials, but yeah, no matter what, you can't really avoid any of this.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Oh yeah, for sure. When people find vulnerabilities, I think it's their duty to release those to the public.\nExplainer: Especially now that we're seeing more and more companies who are trying to make it illegal for you to inspect the vehicle that you've purchased, right? Something that you actually own.\n","302":"Explainer: The risk right now, just during this quarantine, is actually massive now that we think about it, because you might have these legacy systems. You know, they were built 20, 30 years ago, and it's too costly to upgrade, but now you can't actually have a lot of people in a single location, so potentially, they actually do have to now add some sort of remote capabilities to these systems that were never meant to be on the internet.

As opposed to the experimental side and seeing things? Okay so I'm much more, I like to see the things happening. So then the question is, what's so special about making a light that's intense enough to actually possibly blow things up? Certainly we can blow atoms up with the laser hammer and when the laser light comes in and just smacks the electrons right off the atom. And so the question really is how do you make that? Back in the 70s and into the 80s, I know that was a long time ago for you, we had big energy lasers and we had short pulse lasers, we couldn't have big energy, short pulse lasers and actually it was my supervisor and I that figured the way around that and we got something called chirped pulse amplification. Have you heard of chirped pulse amplification by any chance?\n","311":"Explainer: Excellent. I got an engineering physics degree. There you go, something in common. We're here today talking about lasers. So have you have had much exposure to lasers yet at school?\nExplainee: Not yet. I'm really hoping that we will. I think it's super interesting just the field in general because I really do enjoy examining all the calculations and being able to do a little bit more of the math side of physics.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Vaguely.\nExplainer: Well I brought a little bit of a prop to explain how chirped pulse amplification works. Our short pulses are made of different colors. So I've got a colored slinky here. We probably could've called it stretched pulse amplification but that's kind of boring so we used the word chirped. The word chirped comes around because birds chirp. When the birds are singing, the notes are actually changing audio frequency with time and that's a chirp. The point is is that when all the light is squeezed together like this, it's a short pulse. And that's when it's a hammer because all of the light is now concentrated and you can imagine if this was coming along and also using a lens to focus it small, then all of that light at the focal spot, concentrate. And so that was the laser hammer. So we can't have that in the laser. So the question is what could we do? The fact that it's different colors and different colors because of dispersion, travel different speeds inside material. So we used a long fiber, 1.4 kilometers of fiber but, in fiber, the red colors really haven't got that much in common with the glass atoms and so they spend very little time interacting and they travel fast. The red is going to start traveling faster than the green, faster than the blue and, as you travel down the fiber, next thing you know, you have a long pulse and it's chirped from red at the beginning to blue at the back. And so the frequencies go hoo! Like this okay? So this is a chirped pulse and now it's a long pulse. And so, first this is what we did, we chirped it, we stretched it, then we can safely amplify it because it's not all concentrated and, after we amplify it, then we use something called a compressor and we put all of the colors back together and it was back being a short pulse but a high energy pulse. And then we really had what I like to call a laser hammer. When this laser pulse goes inside, it smacks those electrons right off the atom.\n","312":"Explainer: Okay.

Your cat toy, would only be a single color, probably a red one and so that's just one color. And one color means that it has to really be there for the whole time. One color is one wave length of light and so it's just one wave that goes on and on and on. If you want a short pulse, you actually have to have all the colors. And if you can imagine that one point in time, and I like to say it's like a conductor of an orchestra. When you're listening to an orchestra warm up, they sound terrible, they're all playing their own notes. But when the conductor conducts them, they all play different notes but, together, it's beautiful music. So we have something in the laser called a mode locker and it's like the conductor and it says go now. And all the colors will start together but some colors are long wave length and others are shorter. So next thing you know, you have peaks meeting valleys and they cancel each other.

You have the ups on the fifth and the fourth and then the, (hums) That seemed a little bit sharp, but that's fine. And then tones get increasingly small. Beneath that note, you have the undertone series, which essentially is like a reflection of something. In the same way that when a tree grows in nature, you have the branches which grow upwards and the roots which go downwards. So it's quite a nice thing to thing about, this being the key center, the floor, the ground, and then these two different directions of ways in which it can express itself, and the differences in the sensations with that.

What, how, what should we, what should we, how, what am I supposed to do? What to do, right.

And we're trying to understand how different kinds of memory are organized in different structures of the brain. And then to understand how those different structures work together to orchestrate complex cognitive behaviors like decision-making or reasoning and thinking.\n","333":"Explainer: I've got one too.

And I would love to hear more about your side of memory and the mechanisms that you're studying.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: So in your research or you focus more on implicit or explicit memory?\nExplainer: My work has actually kind of pushed against that distinction between memories that kind of are consciously accessible versus unconscious.\n","334":"Explainer: The best way to kind of think about that distinction really goes back historically to one of the most important discoveries in memory research. The patient was referred to famously as patient HM. The neurosurgeon went in and removed the tissue that happened to be right around the hippocampus on both the left side and the right side of HM's brain. But then they started noticing something odd in his behavior. He was not able to create new memories of the experiences he had after the surgery. And that led Brenda Milner and her colleagues to report that the hippocampus was very important for memory, but a one particular kind, these sort of explicit, or as now referred to them episodic memories. But the hippocampus was not necessary for learning skills like mirror tracing, things that you can't necessarily articulate but you just get better at over time. And it really led to a couple of decades or more even of an enormous amount of very important work that kind of kept on breaking memory down further and further into different types. Episodic and semantic as both forms of explicit memory where episodic refers to memory for an event that happened like what you did yesterday morning and semantic refers to general knowledge about the world. Implicit memory is being broken down into a bunch of different kinds like skills or habits or conditioning. And when I started graduate school, many of us felt kind of the next question was really to understand how do we now understand how they work together. This was right around when functional magnetic resonance imaging started becoming a popular tool for measuring brain activity. We could scan the entire brain and we could ask questions about multiple brain regions at once. And we discovered that what we might expect during a skill learning task that only the striatum might show activity, that we also saw the activity in the hippocampus. Or when we asked someone to form an episodic memory that we thought might depend only on the hippocampus we suddenly also saw activity in the prefrontal cortex. And so the confluence of these new ideas and questions about how different forms of memory interact together with the development of new tools for studying the human mind and brain allowed us to kind of adjust our view of memory systems, to think of them less as multiple completely separate independent systems and instead to try to understand how they really work in concert with each other and give rise to all kinds of behaviors that might not fit neatly into one category or another.\nExplainee: Are the connectivities that you're seeing using the FMRI in your studies, are they different when you look at the implicit and explicit memories? Are you seeing more activity in the striatum in comparison to the hippocampus or the prefrontal cortex?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: It's very interesting to see the imperfections of the human brain and being able to rewrite something that happened to you and fully believe it yourself. I think that that's one of the coolest errors and faults in the human brain that could exist.\nExplainer: You know I think these imperfections, I interpret them as an indication that the role of memory is much less about being accurate representation of the past and much more about being kind of a flexible compass into the future.\n","335":"Explainer: Yeah, you know things are kind of breaking down in unexpected ways I'd say. I think there's been a lot of really great work out of multiple labs showing hippocampal activity related to behaviors that don't look anything like episodic memories, but which might depend on episodic memories right? So for example also when you're making a decision about how to choose between two good options that suddenly you might see activity in the hippocampus related to the choice itself, others have found that you find activity in the hippocampus not only when people are forming memories, but also when they're imagining events that are gonna happen in the future. So it kind of forced us to rethink the way we define what the hippocampus might be doing in a way that can account for creating memories, thinking about the future, making decisions and other kinds of behaviors that involve what we would refer to you in the field as relational processing. And that raises all kinds of new questions about what memory really is. Reminiscing about our early influences that made us want to be scientists is that, you know, of course we know, we know better than to think that those are necessarily accurate memories. You know this reminds me of sort of the classic example from literature when people talk about memory of course is Marcel Proust's Madeleine in Remembrance of Things Past. Where in the book it's this taste for the, for the protagonist this taste of the crumbs of the Madeleine cookie and the tea that bring him back to his childhood. You know, seven volumes then emerge of memories of, of that childhood. Digging further into earlier drafts of Proust's novel that initially it didn't describe a Madeleine at all.\nExplainee: It's very interesting to see the imperfections of the human brain and being able to rewrite something that happened to you and fully believe it yourself. I think that that's one of the coolest errors and faults in the human brain that could exist.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","336":"Explainer: What's your favorite subject?\nExplainee: I'd say math.

Multiplying infinities. And there's a sense in which it's very similar to the arithmetic that you learned about already. But it's also totally different. It has some very weird properties. Welcome to Hilbert's Hotel. Unlike an ordinary hotel, has accountably infinitely many rooms. Suppose a new guest shows up, you might think that the new guest could take the room that's all the way down at the end of the hall, all the way at infinity, except there isn't a room like that. The rooms each have a number, and even though there's infinitely many rooms, each room is only a finite distance away. So here's how we're gonna make room for the new guest. I'm gonna ask the guest in room one to move into room two, and then we're gonna ask the guest in room two to move into room three, and we'll continue this all the way along. It looks to me like there's space for the new guest. Where is it? \n","343":"Explainer: Room number one. Exactly. I'm gonna use this symbol for infinity, but what we've just shown is that one, the one new guest plus infinity is equal to the same infinity. What happens if we had a second guest?\nExplainee: Would it be two plus infinity equals infinity?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: They can't live together?\nExplainer: They can't live together. That would be a great solution. I don't know. I think these people don't really get along. So I need to somehow create infinitely many new rooms, but I can only ask each person in the hotel to move a finite distance away. So let's take the guest who is originally in room one and move them into room two. So that's creating one new space for us. And I'm gonna take the guest who was originally in room two and move them into room four. Are you starting to see a pattern here?\n","344":"Explainer: Absolutely. So now I'm gonna make this story a little more complex. That there's another Hilbert's Hotel down the street and they're having plumbing issues and we need to find room for them.\nExplainee: They can't live together?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Yes. You're going up one each time?\nExplainer: Yeah, I'm increasing by one more each time. So I'm doubling the room number in fact. So this is some of the strange arithmetic of infinity.

That's what it's called.\nExplainee: Yeah. yeah, I haven't heard of it before.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Yeah, I did work with robots, but they weren't doing like artificial intelligence type of stuff. We were just sending like instructions and the robot would do, like, perform like a simple task. I wasn't so used to the aspect of, like, teaching computer how to do stuff. So I'm always on that other end of like giving instructions, more focused on the data analysis and machine learning aspect of it.\nExplainer: And how would you just describe machine learning, like in one sentence?\n","348":"Explainer: Do you have any thoughts on like what the data might look like in a robotic setting, if you were to apply machine learning to robots?\nExplainee: I think of like coordinates.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: I don't think so. I feel like that might be a problem.\nExplainer: Yeah, so there's this generalization gap, this gap between what it was trained to do and the new thing.\n","349":"Explainer: Yeah, so there's this generalization gap, this gap between what it was trained to do and the new thing.\nExplainee: So what's like the most complicated thing for a robot to learn, is it motion?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Do you think that we'd be able to kind of accelerate that process of collecting data? Or do you think, is it the way that we've been collecting those types of data sets, Is that what's keeping us behind?\nExplainer: That's a great question. I think we should be able to accelerate the data collection process by having robots collect more data autonomously on their own. And by doing that, we might be able to overcome some of the challenges of Moravec's paradox.\n","350":"Explainer: So you can think of robotics as having two core components. One is perception, being able to see and feel and so forth, and action, where the robot actually figures out how to move its arm. And both components are really essential, and both components are quite difficult. If you train a perception system independently of how to choose actions, then it might make errors in a way that mess up the system that selects actions And so if you instead try to train these two systems together, to have it learn perception action for the goal of solving these different tasks, then the robot can be more successful. One thing that's really difficult about robotics is, there actually isn't that much data of robots in the world. On the internet, there's all sorts of text data, all sorts of image data that people upload and write. But there isn't a lot of data of doing a simple thing, like tying your shoe, for example, because it's so basic. One challenge is even just getting data sets that allow us to teach robots to do these simple kinds of tasks.\nExplainee: Do you think that we'd be able to kind of accelerate that process of collecting data? Or do you think, is it the way that we've been collecting those types of data sets, Is that what's keeping us behind?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: What are some common algorithms that are used in these types of techniques as the robot is learning?\nExplainer: Deep learning is a common toolbox for addressing some of these challenges, because it allows us to leverage large data sets. And so, deep learning is basically, corresponds to methods for training these artificial neural networks. Another common method that comes up is reinforcement learning. A third kind of algorithm is meta learning algorithms. And these algorithms learn not just from the most recent experience on the current task, but leverage experience from other task in the past. And they're not just completely separate. We can combine the aspects of these algorithms into a single method that gets the benefits of each of them.\n","351":"Explainer: Do you have any sense of how you would give a really precise mathematical definition to, you know, what is a fractal?\nExplainee: It would probably have to be some kind of recursive definition, like imaginary numbers. I know the Mandelbrot set we'll use those.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: No, I have not actually.\nExplainer: Yeah, great. So, so the real physical paper has some amount of thickness, but when we model this mathematically, we might ignore the thickness and say, yeah, this is really just kind of a two dimensional sheet of paper. And then you have your apple, how many dimensions is the apple?\n","352":"Explainer: The Mandelbrot set or the Julia set, you know, the idea is always, oh, I'm gonna apply some polynomial over and over again. Z squared plus C or something like that. When I think about fractals, I try to get away from these very specific examples and ask, what is it fundamentally that makes a fractal, a fractal. And one thing that I think you can be precise about, even if you can't really say exactly what a fractal is, is you can talk about this idea of fractal dimension. Have you ever heard of that?\nExplainee: No, I have not actually.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Well on the, on the paper itself, I would say it's two dimensional, but the actual paper would be three dimensions because it has a very small thickness.\nExplainer: And why three?\n","353":"Explainer: Totally, now, as a little experiment, take your piece of paper and just crumple it into a ball.

So if, if you can instead describe at least some aspect of what you're looking at in a procedural or recursive way, then you can add as much detail as you need when you get close to objects.\n","356":"Explainer: And so what this box counting is getting at is saying, well, I still can never decide what the length of the coastline is, but what I can do is I can see how quick does the number of boxes grow relative to how it would grow just for an ordinary one dimensional curve, like a line or a circle.\nExplainee: Yeah, I've, I've heard about that.

And what we're gonna do is we're gonna use an NP-complete problem to actually prove an incredible variety of statements through a zero-knowledge proof. And the specific Np-complete problem that we're gonna be looking at is called map three-coloring. Okay, so here we have a map. Okay. And these are a bunch of countries. And we've arranged them so that no countries that have the same color share a border. That's what makes a map like this validly colored. And now you might think, well, why should we care? It turns out that whether or not a map can be three-colored in this way is an example of an NP-complete problem. And it turns out that, you know, maybe what you really wanna do, is you wanna give a zero-knowledge proof that you have at least 0.3 Bitcoins, right? That would be cool.\nExplainee: Yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: How would we turn something like this into a zero-knowledge proof?\nExplainer: Of course, the first step is we have to erase all the colors. What I've done is I've put a color inside each of these envelopes. Now, how do you know that it's a valid coloring? You don't. Right? You have to pick any two neighboring countries. You can pick them however you like. At random.\n","364":"Explainer: Without revealing what the address is of your account. It turns out I can take that statement that I have at least 0.2 Bitcoins, and convert it into a map of countries. And that map of countries will be three-colorable like this only if you have at least 0.2 Bitcoins.\nExplainee: How would we turn something like this into a zero-knowledge proof?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Can I get these two?\nExplainer: These two?\n","365":"Explainer: All right. Sounds good. Right? Here we have green, right? And over here, we have blue. Okay. And as you can see, they're two different colors.\nExplainee: Mm-hmm.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Yeah.\nExplainer: Right? So now, of course, one way to get more confidence is to open up more of them for you, but that would be revealing information to you. I don't wanna do that. So instead, I'm gonna ask you to please turn around. And now, let's change up these colors. Can you pick two countries at random and we'll reveal two of the colors again.\n","366":"Explainer: Nice. And that's smart of you to check with the same one of the ones you already had. Right?\nExplainee: Mm-hmm.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Yeah, because of this one, right?\nExplainer: Exactly. Right. But it works for this coloring that I'm showing you right now. So what we've done is we've made it impossible for you to put the pieces together. And if you do this, let's say, a thousand times. And if I correctly showed you different colors, each thousand times, you'd be really convinced. And that's it. That's the entire zero-knowledge proof.\n","367":"Explainer: But as you'll see, now it's not green, it's blue. And this one on the other hand, is green. Okay. The colors I showed you last time, don't work with these new colors, right? This wouldn't have worked before.\nExplainee: Yeah, because of this one, right?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Oh, okay.\nExplainer: Okay?\n","368":"Explainer: You would use encryption. Right. But it's really, this is the protocol.\nExplainee: So what are the broader implications of like, zero-knowledge proofs. Are they supposed to be like, more practical for like, implementation, and or, are they supposed to like, structurally prove something?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Where do you think we could build like, more trust using like, zero-knowledge proofs?\nExplainer: Right.\n","369":"Explainer: Right.\nExplainee: And it's implementations?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","370":"Explainer: It can be generative for sure.\nExplainee: It's definitely a really interesting thing to try to talk to students about.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: It's this idea that are things that you can think of, do they exist? You're getting into philosophy of math now. It's just exciting.\nExplainer: I mean I think that's another common misconception about mathematics is that it's so far removed from the humanities, for instance. I mean it's hard to ignore some of these philosophical questions, particularly when we're talking about certain things like infinity. And I think one of the most difficult things to really be precise about and to explain to students is the continuum hypothesis. What do you say to students about the continuum hypothesis?\n","371":"Explainer: I'll grant you that Hilbert's Hotel does not exist. For me, infinite objects absolutely exist. And I can't read the thoughts in your head, but I have a high degree of confidence that we have a lot of the same ideas about infinity.\nExplainee: It's this idea that are things that you can think of, do they exist? You're getting into philosophy of math now. It's just exciting.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: The most fun thing to teach when you teach about infinity, when students realize that you are talking about different sizes of infinity, but then a natural thing is for them to think about what is the next size of infinity that I can think about? And sort of the continuum hypothesis is sort of one of these really hard things to grasp.\nExplainer: So what's so fascinating about the continuum hypothesis, if you take a subset of the real line that's infinite, does it necessarily have either the cardinality of the naturals or the cardinality of continuum, or is there some sort of third possibility? What's very surprising is the continuum hypothesis has been completely resolved in the sense that we now know for absolute certain that we will never know whether it's true or false. So this is a little bit confusing. The standard foundational axioms of mathematics that we take for granted are completely insufficient to prove the continuum hypothesis one way or the other. Mathematicians among other things have been very clear about exactly what they're taking as an assumption and exactly what they're concluding from it. So mathematical practice is to be exact transparent about the hypotheses you need to prove your theorem. So now I think of a proof of a theorem more like constructing a function where the domain of that function is all of the hypotheses that I'm assuming and then the target of that function is maybe a particular element in some universe that is the modularized space of the statement that I'm trying to prove or something like this. If the foundations were to change, if set theory were replaced by something else, maybe dependent type theory, do you think the theorem you've proven would still be true?\n","372":"Explainer: So on your trip what was the funnest day ever?\nExplainee: There was this pool, I love pools. And then there's a slide you go down and there's pool noodles in there too. And then there's a little tiny sandbox.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: I don't really remember.\nExplainer: Do you remember from that day what color towel you used when you got out of the pool?\n","373":"Explainer: When you were telling me about the sandbox, it felt like you didn't have to make that guess, that you could just see the sandbox in your eyes. I asked you about the towel. It doesn't come to mind immediately, but you can stop and think about it and kind of make a good guess because there are things you know about the world. And for those of us who study memory that's a really strong hint as to how memory works. And so for you your memory kept all the fun stuff and all the stuff that was important to you, but the details like did you have to have a ticket to get in or how you got there, all these other less interesting, less exciting aspects, your brain kind of decided letting go of all that information.\nExplainee: I think as you get older you start forgetting things more because you have to make space for new things, which is why you forget stuff.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: I do know that there's different parts of the brain. So there's probably a part of your brain that remembers a bunch of stuff.\nExplainer: The hippocampus is a part of your brain that if you kind of took it out and looked at it, it looks a lot like a seahorse and it plays a really important role in creating those kinds of memories that help you two years after your vacation share with me what happened that day, all these details of that day. There's another part of the brain. It's actually also important for memory and it's called the amygdala and it is important for keeping all the kind of emotional processing going for memory. So memory for things that are really scary, it's gonna talk to the hippocampus now and get that memory to be really strong. Why do you think it might be important to remember scary things?\n","374":"Explainer: Yeah, that's a great insight. Basically we can't remember everything. So when you tell us this memory of that vacation and your brain is able to kind of play almost this movie of a memory, a moment, a day that you had in your life a while ago, where do those memories come from?\nExplainee: I do know that there's different parts of the brain. So there's probably a part of your brain that remembers a bunch of stuff.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Let's say you, you accidentally cut yourself. Then your brain makes a note and says don't get too close to sharp things, or you're going to cut yourself again.\nExplainer: You got it. And so we don't just remember everything and we don't remember random things. We remember the things that matter to us the most. So Abigail based on our conversation today, can you tell me what is a memory?\n","375":"Explainer: The hippocampus is a part of your brain that if you kind of took it out and looked at it, it looks a lot like a seahorse and it plays a really important role in creating those kinds of memories that help you two years after your vacation share with me what happened that day, all these details of that day.

It's just a big record. And sometimes you can forget parts of the record that's not that important to you.\nExplainer: You got it.\n","376":"Explainer: And so you can't actually measure the length.\nExplainee: Yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Would a planet or an asteroid be a fractal?\nExplainer: Yeah, so if you look at kind of the wrinkly surface of an asteroid, each one of those little wrinkles adds a little bit to the surface area. And so it's really hard to say, what is the area of an asteroid? Let's take a look at a little example of where fractals actually show up in nature. What we're gonna try to do is we're gonna try to say what the length of the coastline of great Britain is. So we're gonna start out with the blue ones, which are spaced further apart. We're gonna ask you to connect the blue pins with a piece of string so we can get a measurement of the coastline. So we have our first measurement of the length of the coastline, and we're gonna do it over again. But this time we're gonna use the white pins, which are spaced closer together. So we measured the coastline again. And what do you think happens?\n","377":"Explainer: Right? Yeah. So that's already a really good idea of what a fractal is. It has some really, really interesting detail at all, scales that makes it hard to talk about standard quantities like lengths and areas and volumes.\nExplainee: Would a planet or an asteroid be a fractal?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: There's more in and out. Therefore probably takes more string for this one.\nExplainer: I think I agree with you, but I think to really validate our scientific experiment, we should probably compare the length of the string. A lot of extra slack in that pig of string. So what we noticed with great Britain is we were never able to measure it's length. It just kept getting longer and longer. This is called the coastline paradox where there's not really one definite number you can assign to the length of the coastline, but it depends on how you measure it. Like if we kept going to really get this to be accurate, we might have to like actually go down the beach and start measuring these tiny little details along the coastline. But really there's so much detail. We would probably never get a definite answer for how long the coastline is. Fractals also give us a really nice language. We're talking about how smooth or rough some kind of shape is. And actually a lot of people, engineers and scientists use this idea of fractals and this language of fractals to compare different shapes, not in terms of their size, but in terms of their roughness.

Then, that drew me into new types of technology that used semiconductors with the one that's very popular now is quantum computings. And what about you? What got you interested in quantum sensing?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: So what do you think is a big difference between imaging large biological objects versus sensing very small quantum objects, I guess?\nExplainer: In a way, it's part of the same continuum. What you're doing is changing the technological platform and you're actually able to probe it more sensitively. The resolution you're able to get is much higher, so you can see smaller signals in a much smaller volume.\n","385":"Explainer: Yeah, I started out doing magnetic resonance, studying things like bone and biomedical magnetic resonance.

Yeah. I guess any fluctuations can kick your quantum system either out of the state that it's in to another state.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Oh, yeah.\nExplainer: And that was a source of noise, like, it's completely random, but it is still there. And then the other form is very much what is intrinsically within your experiment itself because some of the materials that you have have defects that are coupling into your sensor, into your quantum system and are also producing noise.\n","389":"Explainer: I think as you said, you know, anything that interferes with my signal is noise, but it can come from different sources. In some ways, the operation of the quantum system itself, as it's sensitive to different physical phenomena, the ones that I don't like, I call noise. The ones I do like, I call signal and that's an artificial definition that I'm making when I choose to build a sensor. One of the challenges we have is, we're trying to figure out if I wanna control it, where is it coming from? I remember we had experiments running in our lab one day and we were running these experiments about 100 megahertz. All of a sudden, we saw these big spikes coming in and we realized we're picking up the local FM stations.\nExplainee: Oh, yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: But yeah, the interesting stuff really is where you're picking up the quantum noise intrinsically from whatever.\nExplainer: Right, it could give you information if you read it out, about what's happening or you have to find smart ways to suppress it so that you can focus on what you really do care about.\n","390":"Explainer: And that was a source of noise, like, it's completely random, but it is still there.

You don't just see the external spins, you see the fluctuations of all the other spins in your system. So what you wanna do is make sure that they don't interact with each other, but they still stay sensitive to everything else. And there, you could think about the local interactions, the magnetic interactions between the spins as a form of noise. In some ways, it's interfering with what you wanna measure, which is the magnetic field outside the sample.\n","391":"Explainer: Right, it could give you information if you read it out, about what's happening or you have to find smart ways to suppress it so that you can focus on what you really do care about.\nExplainee: So what are the kind of noise and fluctuations that you're worried about?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","392":"Explainer: Right.\nExplainee: Maybe they should be using elements of quantum computation. So I don't have a strong view on it, but I do think it's an interesting question.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: That's where the excitement lies, is when we really start to leverage having, you know, access to individual quantum degrees of freedom, whether that's a single photon or a single spin and in principle then, you could also imagine entangling it and you know, doing some quantum computations on it in order to make it an even better sensor.\nExplainer: So do you think there's a maximum number of spins you can have if I think about a single NV as a register?\n","393":"Explainer: Yeah.\nExplainee: And that I think is gonna make real breakthroughs in the next 10 years, is the fact that we're just having this much larger group of scientists.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","394":"Explainer: so steve tell me about your research and the work you've been doing in quantum computing\nExplainee: I'm a theoretical physicist.

He said oh they don't teach that in computer science classes anymore because the hardware has become so reliable. In a quantum system, when you look at it or make measurements, it can change in a way that's beyond your control. We have the following task, build a nearly perfect computer out of a whole bunch of imperfect parts.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: The great power of a quantum computer is also it's Achilles's heel. That it's very very sensitive to perturbations and noise and environmental effects.

That it's very very sensitive to perturbations and noise and environmental effects.

We're trying to invent the integrated circuit and scale up. It's still very very very early in the development of the field.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: There does exist an algorithm, Shor's algorithm, which has been proven mathematically that if you had a large enough quantum computer you could find the prime factors of large numbers. The basis of the RSA encryption is the most commonly used thing on the internet. First we're far away from being able to have a quantum computer big enough to execute Shor's algorithm on that scale. Second, there are plenty of other encryption schemes that don't use factoring and I don't think anybody has to be concerned at the moment. And in the end, quantum mechanics goes to the side of privacy enhancement. If you have a quantum communication channel you can encode information and send it through there and it's provably secure based on the laws of physics.\nExplainee: I have no idea what people are going to end up using them for I mean if you had gone back 30 years and handed somebody an iPhone they would have called you a wizard, so.

And basically with that, you can figure out minute details such as searching for a value in a binary tree. It's kind of like iterating through itself, but it's often more sophisticated in that it's easier to write.\nExplainer: They're easy for a computer to execute, right? It just has to run this recursive procedure over and over and over again. We can kind of get as much detail as we want or need. When I think about fractals and kind of what they've done for computer graphics. The example I think is subdivision surfaces. Did you, did you encounter subdivision surfaces in your graphics class at all?\n","399":"Explainer: Yeah it looks really blocky. And it's the same thing not only with shapes and games, but also colors and textures. And this is an especially a big problem in virtual reality because you have no control over where people are gonna go. What they're gonna look at, how close they're gonna get to various objects. So fractals on the other hand are these things that have infinitely, you know, nice details you get closer and closer and closer. And so this is something that can help us solve this problem in computer graphics of generating more detail. One of the reasons why fractals are really nice for computer graphics is because the algorithms that we use to draw images also have this kind of recursive flavor. What's recursion?\nExplainee: Recursion is a function that uses itself or calls itself in it's definition.

So that's really nice, right? It's saving you a lot of work, but the downside is you lose a lot of control. So because the only thing you're describing is this short little program, you don't have complete control over how this is gonna end up. And so adding more controllability to procedural graphics is something people have been thinking about for many years. So how has our conversation changed your understanding of what fractals are all about?\n","403":"Explainer: Well, because people who really need to use these subdivision services for everything, people who worked hard over the years to make this super, super fast. In fact, subdivision services were invented basically at Pixar. There's this guy, Ed Capel, and he was harshly responsible for one of the most famous kinds of subdivision surfaces called Capel Clark subdivision surfaces. And in fact recently won the touring award for these subdivision services.\nExplainee: What do you think are the current shortcomings in, I guess applying fractals to computer science right now, what are, what is the cutting edge?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: I think it's really interesting to see the different ways, fractals will be not only useful, but necessary in being able to render these games and these different programs that are interesting in the metaverse or different media to be really beautiful.\n","404":"Explainer: I wanted to ask you a little bit about what you know about the history of the internet. Have you heard of ARPANET, for example?\nExplainee: I have not heard of ARPANET.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: So what would packet switching enable? I'm sure there's something big here, for sure.\nExplainer: There's a lot big, right? And so remember, this was a Department of Defense, was they wanted to have forms of of communication that were very robust, that were survivable. Packets could all find their own ways, be routed differently through the network. So if parts of the network failed, you could route around failures.\n","405":"Explainer: Okay, back into the 1960s, there was a research agency in the United States called DARPA, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency. Actually, it was called ARPA at the time. They wanted to build this notion of a packet-switching network. Not a circuit switch network like a phone network where you get a dedicated path and a dedicated set of bandwidth and links from source to destination.\nExplainee: So what would packet switching enable? I'm sure there's something big here, for sure.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Sounds like the reason for like a request response type of structure.\nExplainer: So you can sort of see how the network architecture that wasn't designed to be 100% reliable inside the core of the network, and had that complexity built into the edges of the network. And to me, the really cool thing is you put this infrastructure in place, and then all these super creative people think about amazing things to build on top of it. And you see this proliferation of amazing applications.\n","406":"Explainer: There's a lot big, right?

Spoken like a real computer scientist, right? You're a computer scientist. I'm a computer scientist. We talk about APIs, application programming interfaces. The API for the internet is something called a socket. And a socket simply says, I can communicate if I know your internet address, you know, 128.119.40.186, that number is the IP address of my server, the University of Massachusetts. If you know that, you can write a program anywhere in the world and send a message, and it'll pop out at my end.\n","407":"Explainer: So you can sort of see how the network architecture that wasn't designed to be 100% reliable inside the core of the network, and had that complexity built into the edges of the network. And to me, the really cool thing is you put this infrastructure in place, and then all these super creative people think about amazing things to build on top of it. And you see this proliferation of amazing applications.\nExplainee: Abstraction, I think it's the reason why everything.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: I will be remembering that. [Jim laughs] I've heard that there are like seven keys to the internet, something like that.\nExplainer: Okay, well I don't know about the number seven, but there's something in the internet that's sort of similar to that. It's called the Domain Name System. The DNS's role is to translate names like gaia.cs.umass.edu, or ibm.com, or facebook.com to an IP address so that your application can actually send a message to that name, to that named service.\n","408":"Explainer: That's 98% true. And if you own a network, like you're att.com, or your verizon.com, you can do, within that network, you can do what you want, right? So in that sense, the internet is very decentralized, that the control of the network is up to whoever owns the network. The 2% where you said there's nobody in control, there's a little bit of centralized control. There's an organization called the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers. Its responsibility is to handle, as the name ICANN suggests, names and numbers. It's that little bit of centralization, central authority that you need.\nExplainee: When can we see the next tenfold increase in in Wi-Fi speed?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Packets dropping?\nExplainer: Where do they get dropped, do you think?\n","409":"Explainer: Where do they get dropped, do you think?\nExplainee: Somewhere in their travel process.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: I see.\nExplainer: I'm curious, has our conversation sort of changed your view or sort of taught you new things about the internet?\n","410":"Explainer: It would be the top tier.\nExplainee: What are you doing? Like, what are you studying?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Okay.\nExplainer: Which is a really nice platform because the spins show their quantum properties, even at room temperature.\n","411":"Explainer: Which is a really nice platform because the spins show their quantum properties, even at room temperature.\nExplainee: So, are you studying the spins of the electrons?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: So you mentioned the diamonds that are used to create the sensors.\nExplainer: Right.\n","412":"Explainer: So you can implant nitrogen into a diamond and then you bombard it with electrons to create the vacancies and then you heat it up and anneal it, and then you get these nitrogen-vacancy centers in your system. So you mentioned quantum computing earlier. So have you heard of the idea of superposition?\nExplainee: Mm-hmm, yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Okay, so it's like using like, the quantum computer would be kind of like the base level and then like you take it out into the world and see how like it differs?\nExplainer: So rather than trying to build a lot of complex algorithms and gates with it, what you do is, you take these quantum bits and you take them out into the world and say, what do you see? What are you sensitive to? So you can use an idea called entanglement to make an even more sensitive quantum sensor, but it's even more fragile. So there's always this trade-off between being super fragile and being super sensitive at the same time.\n","413":"Explainer: So that's in some ways the key to both quantum sensing, as well as quantum computing. It's the idea that you can take a system and put it in a superposition of two states. Normally we think of classically a bit can be a zero or a one. So switch is either on or off. Whereas in a quantum system, it can be in what's called a superposition. So it can be partially on and partially off. But one of the challenges with quantum systems is that these superpositions are really hard to maintain because we don't see superpositions in the world around us. In quantum computing, you try really hard to isolate everything so that you can maintain this quantum property and the fact that it's actually going to lose its quantum properties as it interacts with the world also makes it a great sensor because now you're actually, you're using that fact that it's interacting with the world to say, wait, it's sensing something.\nExplainee: Okay, so it's like using like, the quantum computer would be kind of like the base level and then like you take it out into the world and see how like it differs?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: How does entanglement work into it?\nExplainer: So entanglement is the idea that two particles are correlated. They're essentially in the same quantum state, so that you can't disturb one particle without disturbing the second particle. And so, if I have a large number of quantum sensors that are entangled, then they're all going to interact much more strongly than if I just had one of them interact at a time.\n","414":"Explainer: So rather than trying to build a lot of complex algorithms and gates with it, what you do is, you take these quantum bits and you take them out into the world and say, what do you see? What are you sensitive to? So you can use an idea called entanglement to make an even more sensitive quantum sensor, but it's even more fragile. So there's always this trade-off between being super fragile and being super sensitive at the same time.\nExplainee: How does entanglement work into it?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Okay.\nExplainer: And so that gives you a boost in sensitivity when you have an entangled\n","415":"Explainer: It's more precise, Absolutely.\nExplainee: Okay. Is an atomic clock a quantum sensor?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Okay, that's really cool.\nExplainer: So some ways, you know, when atomic clocks were designed and built, we didn't necessarily think of GPS, but technology often works that way is that, there are new discoveries and then someone else comes along and says, hey, this is a great tool for some other application.\n","416":"Explainer: In some ways, it is and you know, atomic clocks are remarkable devices and being able to measure time that precisely has really important consequences. In fact, our old GPS system is based on the accuracy of atomic clocks. They're a set of satellites, each of which has an atomic clock on board and they send out a timestamp and so, once it gets a signal from three different satellites, it can triangulate and figure out exactly where you are. Now, if you could make those clocks even more precise, you could actually accurately position where you are even more accurately.\nExplainee: Okay, that's really cool.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","417":"Explainer: So you're a student in high school, is that right?\nExplainee: Yes, I'm a sophomore.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: How does like all of the networks in my house connect to all the city networks?\nExplainer: Wow. Great question. Often, it's a little blue wire called an ethernet cable. So that cable is able to bring bits of information up into your apartment at say, a billion bits per second. That's pretty fast, right? Literally a wire that goes between a box in your apartment, sometimes called a router or a modem in your apartment that comes from an internet service provider come into this first network and then that network connects to another network connects to another network connects to another network.\n","418":"Explainer: Well, we're gonna be talking about computers here today, and we're gonna be talking about the internet. I always like to think of the internet by analogy to say road systems for example, where you have roads in your neighborhood. You have state roads, you have the Interstate Highway System. And so the internet is a lot like that. It's an interconnection of local roads, local networks like the network in your house for example.\nExplainee: How does like all of the networks in my house connect to all the city networks?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: You could FaceTime somebody who's like in Australia. You can talk to them at the same time, and like you're reaching the same signals. So how is it that it gets there so fast?\nExplainer: We could talk about that by analogy to a road system. It's not just one big, super highway. It's a lot of smaller super highways that are all interconnected. And those interchanges are what are called routers. That's where the links come together. You're talking about talking to a friend in Australia. So oh, it's coming in from the East Coast of the United States to this router, and it's going out say, that routers in San Francisco, it's going out on an underseas cable over to Australia rather than in this direction up to Japan.\n","419":"Explainer: Wow.

They're these big cables that are laid down by switches. They cross both the Atlantic, the Pacific, the Indian Ocean.

And if you just play it, it just knows what to play. Like they're all in one spot.\nExplainer: Ah, you said they're all in one spot. In fact, they're in lots of spots in Netflix. And so most applications would like to connect you with a server that's close to you. Server is really just a big computer with a lot of memory, a lot of discs that store all the Netflix movies, and also so that you don't have to cross over too many internet links to get from where the server is to the TV or the device in your home.\n","422":"Explainer: That's really what we call the first hop.

There's a couple of things that could happen inside the internet. Information is sent in these little packets of information from the Netflix server to your display device. And literally, each packet that arrives says, This is the first packet for Jenna. This is the second. This is the third. This is the fifth. This is the fourth. And they're reordered for you. Matter of fact, your computer will say, using the TCP protocol to the server, Hey, I didn't get packet four, can you resend it again? And again, the Netflix server is very happy to send you packet four again. The other is the internet protocol. If you think about sending letters through the US Postal Service, how you've got an address on it. So every packet that flows from the Netflix server to you has an address on it. It says, This is going to Jenna. It's going to the what's called the Internet Protocol address of your device. Think of all the range of devices that are hooked up to the internet. It's totally amazing, right? Every single one of them has one thing in common, and that is they speak the IP protocol, the Internet Protocol.

Functions are one of the most fundamental concepts in mathematics, but they aren't always so clearly defined. What would you say a function is?\nExplainee: I would say a function is a procedure that takes an input and does some operation and returns an output.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: How can you compare something that is endless?\nExplainer: Today we're gonna think about infinity as a cardinality, which is a technical term for a number that could be a size of a set. And we're gonna use this idea of one-to-one correspondence to try and investigate the question of whether all infinite sets have the same size. So what I've drawn here are some pictures of some of the infinite sets that appear in mathematics. So the natural numbers are the prototypical example of an infinite set. So the natural numbers are clearly a subset of the integers. Both of these are infinite sets. Are they the same size infinity or different size infinities?\n","425":"Explainer: I'm gonna now try and convince you that they are in fact the same size infinity. And this is using this idea of a one-to-one correspondence which was applied in this context by Georg Cantor. What he says is if we can match up the elements of the integers with the elements of the natural numbers so that there's nothing left over, so that there's a bijective function between them, then that's a proof that there's exactly as many natural numbers as there are integers. Start by matching zero with zero and one with one. But then we wanna include the negatives in the list. So which natural number would we match with negative one?\nExplainee: Maybe two.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: All of the positive integers would be odd numbers and all of the negative integers would be even numbers?\nExplainer: Great. So now I have a much harder question. So we have the same challenge, again, evidently there are way, way, way more rational numbers than there are integers. Does that mean this is a larger infinite set than the integers? What do you think?\n","426":"Explainer: Maybe two. Why not? Because now we're starting to make progress on matching all the negatives. We can match the natural number three with the integer two, the natural number four with the integer minus two. And do you see a pattern?\nExplainee: All of the positive integers would be odd numbers and all of the negative integers would be even numbers?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: By intuition I would say yes, but that was the same case with the integers. I would imagine there might be some bijective function for mapping natural numbers to rational numbers.\nExplainer: So I'm going to use this picture to count the rational numbers by actually counting the elements of this larger set because it'll be clearer geometrically. What I've drawn in this picture is the integer lattice. So Z cross Z refers to the set of all of these dots. So I'll start by counting the number at the origin, and you can see I'm just labeling the dots around the origin, moving in a counterclockwise fashion and getting progressively further away. And this process could continue, but maybe by now you see the pattern, though it'd be a little bit difficult to describe as a function.\n","427":"Explainer: Great.

There's a practical implication for computer science. Alan Turing, he came up with a mathematical model of a computer, something called a Turing machine. So Turing was wondering is it possible to compute every real number, an arbitrary real number to within arbitrary precision in finite time? He defined a real number to be computable< if you could calculate its value, maybe not exactly, but as accurately as you'd like in a finite amount of time. And because there are uncountably infinitely many real numbers, but only a countably infinitely many Turing machines, what that means is that the vast majority of real numbers are uncomputable.

I can ask how heavy it is.\nExplainee: It's not weight, but it's how much of it is in it.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Yeah.\nExplainer: If a star is heavy enough to explode into supernova what's left begins to collapse under its own weight. And if that's heavy enough, the core will not be able to stop collapsing, 'cause it no longer has the thermonuclear fuel, it's run outta fuel. And if it's run outta fuel, it's no longer shining and pushing outward. And without that it itself begins to go dark and there's nothing fighting the collapse anymore. And that's when you form a black hole.\n","441":"Explainer: I can also ask how big it is, which is a question about its volume. If I make it smaller, then what's happening is it's becoming more dense. So imagine I crushed this really, really small. It would weigh the same, it would have the same mass, but it would be much more dense.\nExplainee: Yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: How does it go that small?\nExplainer: Well, that's a really good question. So interestingly, the sun itself isn't heavy enough. So it has to be heavy enough that when it begins to collapse, it just overcomes all attempts to fight it. If you made something really dense, you would have to travel faster than the speed of light to actually escape. That's 300,000 kilometers per second.\n","442":"Explainer: If a star is heavy enough to explode into supernova what's left begins to collapse under its own weight.

Any light that veers too close will fall in, will not be able to make it back out again. If a light is shining from the sun near a black hole, the black hole's not touching it. Why does the light get pulled in? Why does that happen?\n","443":"Explainer: So it goes so fast that it goes completely dark.

Why does the light get pulled in? Why does that happen?\nExplainee: So it goes so fast that there's it's all dark?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Because the black hole is taking other stuff?\nExplainer: Isn't it crazy? And then Einstein goes a step further and thinks, well, what black holes must be doing is curving the space so strongly that even light gets caught. Sometimes you can get light caught into a whole orbit, literally the light going round and round in an orbit.\n","444":"Explainer: It is taking other stuff, but the funny question was like, if I wanted to move your chair, you'd think it was really strange if I didn't have to come near you and actually grab the chair and move it. One of the things Einstein thought about is he imagined that what the black hole is doing is it's changing the shape of space around it. What do you think of that idea?\nExplainee: Because the black hole is taking other stuff?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: It's crazy.\nExplainer: That's right. We've been talking for a little while about black holes. What are you gonna walk away with in your impression of what a black hole is?\n","445":"Explainer: Does infinity come up in your mathematics that you're studying?\nExplainee: One place infinity comes up is in algebraic geometry. Normally we think okay, well if you have two lines like this, you'd keep drawing them, they intersect right here. But in projective space, two parallel lines will also intersect at the point at infinity. Infinity is like this perfect concept for what we can add to a space that allows lines to have this more uniform property. What's your research in?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Yeah, it's basically this idea that you can put a choice function on any set.\nExplainer: And a choice function does what exactly?\n","446":"Explainer: So the way I think about it is if you have an infinite or an arbitrary family of sets and you know for sure that none of these sets are empty, then a choice function would allow you to select an element from each set sort of all at once. When you've used the axiom of choice in proofs, do you know which incarnation of this you've used?\nExplainee: Yeah, I've used it like that. I've also used it in Zorn's lemma and in the well ordering principle.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: I do believe the axiom of choice.\nExplainer: You do believe the axiom of choice, though it leads us to some strange conclusions. So if the axiom choice is true, then it's necessarily the case that there exists a well ordering of the reals. And what that means is that we can perform induction over real numbers like we perform induction over the natural numbers. This is trans-finite induction. It would work for any ordinal. So there must be some uncountably infinite ordinal that represents the order type of the real numbers. And this allows us to prove some crazy things. Imagine three-dimensional Euclidean space. So the space that we live in, extending infinitely in all directions. So it is possible to completely cover three-dimensional Euclidean space by disjoint circles, so infinitesimal circles, disjoint circles of radius one. So what that means is you can put a circle somewhere in space and then put a second circle somewhere in space that can't intersect with the first one because these are solid circles and then another circle can somehow cover every single point in space with no gaps in between.\n","447":"Explainer: So there are three well-known famous equivalent forms of the axiom of choice. The well ordering principle is the assumption, the axiom that any set can be well ordered, but there are lots of subsets of real numbers that do not have a minimal element. So that ordering is not a well ordering. So here's the key question. Do you believe the axiom of choice?\nExplainee: I do believe the axiom of choice.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: It's crazy.\nExplainer: It's not the only crazy thing. Do you have a favorite consequence of the axiom of choice?\n","448":"Explainer: So there's certainly no stop to this procedure. But could you give a precise cardinality to that?\nExplainee: would be a set of all sets, right?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: So you're just making a cutoff point. You're saying we're never gonna get sets bigger than this anyway, so we might as well make our category only include things smaller than that.\nExplainer: That's right. So a rigorous way to work with a category of sets is to demand that it's a category of sets whose size is bounded by this cardinality, Alpha say. That is then an example of a category that fits into another even still larger Grothendieck universe Beta. So implicitly in a lot of my research, I have to add an additional assumption that there exists maybe countably many inaccessible cardinals.\n","449":"Explainer: That you don't want the complexity of managing them to go up linearly with that. You'd like it to still stay pretty flat as you start adding.\nExplainee: Right, exactly. I mean, the good thing about IoT devices is that they tend to transmit very, very small amounts of data.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: No, I mean I would imagine upper bound, KB per second, lower bound, you could see bytes per second just on average. But I mean, say that you have a temperature sensor running off of your Arduino that's reporting the temperature in your house every minute. That's going to be far less than kilobytes per second on average.\nExplainer: My sense is you're spot on, that they'll produce over time, a lot of data. And that a lot of IoT is about computing on that data. That computation happened mostly at the edge, or somehow a combination between the edge and something happening in a far away data center.\n","450":"Explainer: We're used to ethernet cables that can handle many hundreds of gigabits per second over a wired device.

That's going to be far less than kilobytes per second on average.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Well, my sense is right now that all that data tends to be centralized because IoT devices are usually the commercial products of companies.\nExplainer: Do you think they'll share it?\n","451":"Explainer: being something that you can already predict.

So I'm measuring star formation histories in the Small and Large Magellanic Clouds.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: So, I think the prevailing wisdom for a while was no, but my answer honestly is I'm not sure.\nExplainer: Yeah, I think it's a really good question. The only mechanism that we know for sure can form black holes is to collapse of very massive stars. So it's sensible to think, well maybe some very massive stars in a young universe collapsed under their own weight and then they merged and after some time they got big enough, but the black holes from stars can be tens of times the mass of the sun, maybe hundreds of times to the mass of the sun if they merge. To get to millions and billions, and if you just do the simple arithmetic of how many years that would take, there aren't enough years in the 14 billion years of the universe's lifetime. So they must have come from somewhere else.\n","457":"Explainer: Yeah, and probably nobody is. Have you heard a lot in your studies about these super massive black holes that we think lurk in the centers of very nearly every galaxy?\nExplainee: So, I think the prevailing wisdom for a while was no, but my answer honestly is I'm not sure.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: So I don't study AGN a lot, but I do have a long term interest in black holes, it's one of the reasons I entered the field. I always was curious about how a black hole of that size was able to form. Was it the result of mergers between smaller black holes, ultimately creating gravitational well deep enough to contract a protogenic disc for a whole galaxy? Or, man, what happened?\nExplainer: Yeah, I think that's right. I think people are really perplexed about how you make something so big in such a short period of time. It's kind of funny, the bigger you make a black hole, it seems maybe counterintuitive, but the less dense the material has to be out of which you make it. So you can, out of something the density almost of air, you can make a supermassive black hole. You can't make a star out of that, but weirdly, if you skip the star phase altogether, it's conceivable that they directly collapse. And so there's suddenly a new way to make black holes that nature has figured out.\n","458":"Explainer: Yeah, I think it's a really good question.

So our entire solar system could stay intact and here we would go with the sun and all the other planets in orbit around a new black hole.\nExplainee: Supermassive black hole.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: They're kind of misunderstood giants in a way. So I was curious, have you heard anything new or interesting in the field of black holes that will shape future discussions?\nExplainer: It's a great question. I once did a calculation of using a black hole made out of the moon and the strongest magnet we could find on Earth to see if I could make an electronic battery. And honestly, you only get about enough energy to power New York City. But we have to find one in our neighborhood first.\n","461":"Explainer: We work a lot right now on thinking of black holes as batteries. So a black hole that can take, like a giant magnet, astronomical magnet in the form of another collapsed star, like a neutron star, and flip it around so fast, near the speed of light, that it actually creates an electronic circuit out of this moving magnet. And so that the power that can come out of these electronic circuits created by these batteries can be tremendous.\nExplainee: They're kind of misunderstood giants in a way.

It's often possible, still, to know a fair amount about what people are doing, even if you can't look inside the envelope at the letter that's written.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Exactly, and in fact, if you look at say, the sizes of the transfers that they're doing, you may know, hey, I'm talking to Netflix.

This is the size- \nExplainer: So you can infer or guess a lot of things.\n","478":"Explainer: So you want the computation close to where the endpoint is.\nExplainee: Exactly, and I think that what's now exciting about that is all three of these technologies, wireless, networking and cloud, which are normally three different communities, three different sets of technologies, three different sets of standards or practices, now have to work together in close harmony to be able to service applications that are really critical and that that might be interacting with the physical world in ways where safety is a potential concern.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: I agree. It's both the high bandwidth, it's the low delay so that you can have these applications that interact with the physical world and need answers in real-time. It's about having the compute really close so that you can integrate computation and communication. It's about having more coverage.\nExplainer: Coming back again to the softwarization. SDN and softwarization is a maybe a little bit behind the covers, that you wouldn't normally see it as a user going from 3G to 4G to 5G. You just see an increase in speed. But yet, the way the network is now being managed again, I think is bringing the cellular networking world sort of into the internet world in terms of the softwarization-\n","479":"Explainer: What is your impression of what a black hole is?\nExplainee: I'm a senior at NYU. I'm studying physics and environmental studies.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: So it's a star that has collapsed. It has so much concentrated mass and gravity that there's a point outside of the black hole called the event horizon. So once you get past the event horizon, nothing, not even light can escape from that.\nExplainer: It turns out that there are only three quantities that define a black hole, its electric charge, its mass, and its spin. So the most general black hole can also spin and it can also be electrically charged. Whether or not they are has to do with how they formed. If a star collapses, it will likely be spinning when it collapses and the remnant black hole that formsbwill likely be spinning. A black hole of a certain mass, charge, and spin is indistinguishable from any other black hole with those same properties. So in some sense, they're like fundamental particles, which makes them absolutely exceptional for any other astrophysical object. Have you heard the stories about what happens inside a black hole?\n","480":"Explainer: So that's a great definition and I wanna pick that apart a little bit. So what you described is just right. Stars, when they run out of thermonuclear fuel are gonna collapse under their own weight. It'll explode in a supernova, it'll leave a core, and if the core itself is heavy enough, it will keep collapsing. It does, as you say, reach this point where not even light can escape. But the amazing thing is it leaves that point, you called it rightly the event horizon, it leaves it behind kind of like an archeological record because the start itself can no more sit at the event horizon than it can race outward at the speed of light. So the core of the star keeps collapsing and where it goes nobody knows. So in a weird way, the black hole isn't anymore a crush of matter. It left it behind in its wake, but the stuff of the star is gone.\nExplainee: So it's a star that has collapsed.

So the profound thing is as an astronaut on the outside, looking at this round event horizon, you think of the center of black hole as a point in space, but to the person who's fallen in, it's not a point in space at all, it's a point in time. The singularity, or the end of it all, the crush in the center of a black hole is in their future. So they can no more avoid the singularity than you can avoid the next instant of time coming.

So in a year, I'll tell you what I learned that's new.\n","484":"Explainer: Now, to be clear, nobody disputes that black holes will quantum radiate, that Hawking radiation is a solid prediction. The black holes should in fact evaporate, that's not disputed, right?\nExplainee: That's right. It would be wonderful if we could have some experimental of evidence for this, if we could really build a black hole in the lab and test to see whether it behaves this way. But I think there is hope that we'll be able to detect some of these effects either indirectly, by looking at black holes out in the universe, or also maybe indirectly in the laboratory by looking at systems which aren't black holes, but which radiate in kind of similar ways.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: The pursuit of quantum gravity has taken us to places we never expected to be. I think what's exciting about physics, about theoretical physics, that you start following a thread, you start developing a chain of logic, and you never know where it's gonna end up.\nExplainer: Do you think there's ever a hope that the kind of information that you think about, the quantum gravity aspects of the universe that you think about, whether it will pan out or not, will ever be viably observed in these astronomical pursuits of the event horizon?\n","485":"Explainer: Do you think there's ever a hope that the kind of information that you think about, the quantum gravity aspects of the universe that you think about, whether it will pan out or not, will ever be viably observed in these astronomical pursuits of the event horizon?\nExplainee: It's a real challenge, but astronomical observations have gotten so fantastically precise. And there is some hope that if you looked at things like two black holes merging, each black hole comes in with its own event horizon, but then when the black holes merge, there's a very complicated process where these two event horizons merge and oscillate and vibrate, and then settle down into a single event horizon for the final black hole. There is some hope that if we can make sufficiently detailed observations of this process, if we could really see the way the event horizon is behaving as it settles down to this final state, that maybe that could reveal some of these quantum effects that we've been talking about.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Yeah, it's a spectacular process.\n","486":"Explainer: That's near and dear to my heart. Multi-party computations.\nExplainee: Obviously, zero-knowledge proofs are about proving things to another person without revealing the details of what it is that you're proving.

To my mind your work has really revolutionized the field of cognitive neuroscience more broadly.\nExplainee: I've been really interested in how past understandings of the brain have really focused on, on pinpointing exactly what each piece of the brain does. But I think that there's also a broader conversation happening in the brain, which is between one region and another. So it's actually the pattern of connections between these regions that would allow for the flow of information. But I think the tools that have become widely available now from the physics community and mathematics and computer science are under the umbrella of, of network science. So that is a science of networks, a science of understanding how bits of a system are interconnected with one another. Not just comparing two groups of people or two kinds of two species, but we can ask even within a single person, how does the pattern of connectivity in my brain change as we talk with one another? How does the information flow change? I think a lot about traffic on roadway networks as a good example of this. Which is, you know, we can understand where the roads are and perhaps the roads are relatively fixed. They change over long timescales and it's similar to the brain. We really only create large scale connections over long timescales. But we can alter the traffic on the roadways really easily. And that's similar to what we do in the brain is that we change the way that information is flowing to allow us to respond to our environment.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: The field is definitely opening up in the kinds of questions that can be asked now with these approaches. And I think what you're pointing out is that conceptually it's where we wanted to go anyway. So if there's so much orchestration that happens and a symphony is not a single piece, it's not a single pattern of, of harmony between instruments and, and similar to the brain, symphony of your brain is not a single pattern. It's a very dynamically changing pattern.\nExplainer: In the field we often talk of have having a mental model that we use to make predictions about what's about to happen and really use that to mean kind of a general understanding of what's going on. What does that look like in terms that come from your world of like the configuration of, of a circuit?\n","499":"Explainer: In the field we often talk of have having a mental model that we use to make predictions about what's about to happen and really use that to mean kind of a general understanding of what's going on. What does that look like in terms that come from your world of like the configuration of, of a circuit?\nExplainee: I think this is the most exciting area of memory research right now I think, which is how people build and remember, you know, and keep with them models of the world over long periods of time. When I think about a mental model, I think about ideas, potential outcomes, potential events, potential actions, and how they all depend on one another. So when we predict what will happen next it would be, I am currently sitting at this piece of the network and I know that there are, there are these possible outcomes. And so I have to get ready for those, you know, four possible outcomes. But that brings this interesting question to the fore, I think which is how does a network system in our mind and our brain create a network model of the world outside? It's almost like there's a reflection in the structure of what's inside in the hardware and what we're building in a very abstract way. And I think that relates to some interesting work that's coming out about the hippocampus too.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: That makes a lot of sense. And I think that it makes me wonder how we think about places in the abstract, what is a cognitive place, right? And what is, how do we map out the cognitive spaces that we, that our mind moves within in the same way or in a similar way to the spaces that we physically walk in. But I think it opens a lot up, a lot of questions about how individuals make their own maps, right? And then how the way that they choose to make that map will then affect the way that they may respond in the future to a new context or environment.\nExplainer: It's really interesting. And I think it also really speaks to the kind of pervasive and circular role of memory, right? Because the maps are dependent on memories, they're built from memories and experiences. So there's this kind of dialogue with memory creating maps, maps creating experiences, experiences creating memories, affecting the maps, and really makes me think even of a question a friend asked me recently about moods and mental health and this feeling of like how do some people get kind of trapped in a state of mind where all they can see is a particular way forward. But then something happens in the world that shifts them to another model.\n","500":"Explainer: It's really interesting.

As you walk into a new room you make a new map of that room. So what are the doorways basically for mental models? And I think that often we sort of fall into this pattern of, of thinking about memory as, as always additive, that we always just keep gathering more information and update what we currently have. We don't as often speak about deleting pieces of information or, or perceptions or something that we thought was a, was a useful fact but actually it's not a fact.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Right.\nExplainer: Getting way out there, but, but it is a way in which if you have the right model, it should be an efficient one. I'm wondering what you, what you think about what all this means for kind of a redefinition of what memory is, in many ways a revision or expansion of that notion. Would you be willing to try to help me think about how to define it?\n","501":"Explainer: Memories as models or models first and memory as part of what helps build the model starts generating new predictions. Exactly the kind you just brought up or other ways of thinking about things because an efficient model needs to let go of information, right? I just heard a colleague of mine joking about the fact that the principles of neuroscience textbook keeps growing and growing. And that if we had enough strength in theoretical neuroscience, if our models of neuroscience were good enough, that book should shrink back. We know that memory retrieval is essentially construction. And so you don't need to store all those separate memories. You need to construct them. But if you have a good model, let go of all those details and just construct them to feel as if it's a memory. But really all you're doing is using the model to fill the details. It's kind of like the matrix, you know.\nExplainee: Right.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: I think it's information certainly that, that is stored in the brain and that can then affect our behavior. I think getting your behavior in there somewhere seems, seems important. But also is it just a record of the past or is it, you know, our perceptions of, of what happened in the past, or how we've changed how we think about that past event or have we deleted that event completely and then gathered this higher level structure or mental model that then allows us to behave differently in the future? So it's more alive, it's more changing. It's more, I think it's bubbling out and gathering, gathering and growing and becoming more flexible, but it's also sort of bubbling in, in the sense of deleting and removing and forgetting. So yes, I think that what we need to add perhaps is that changeability and perhaps the behavioral relevance of that changeability. I don't know, what do you think?\nExplainer: I agree. I think, you know, as you were speaking I was thinking maybe the most important word to replace there is record. Record implies an etching of something as it was. And maybe what we need instead is that it's a model, it's an approximation, it's an abstraction that can help us create the illusion of constructing your record. But that it's the model that's the important thing that drives the whole thing.\n","502":"Explainer: Getting way out there, but, but it is a way in which if you have the right model, it should be an efficient one.

So the LIGO instrument electronically records the ringing of the shape of space with its very complicated instrument. It stands for Laser Interferometric Gravitational-Waves Observatory and the design was incredibly difficult and they didn't know if they would succeed. I think of the instrument as like the body of the electric guitar. And then they take the readout of the motions of the waves that they're recording, just like that guitar is recording the motions of the waves on the string. Now just play it like a little bit. And you can't hear anything, right? You're not meant to hear an electric guitar when it's not plugged in. What's happening is the guitar strings are ringing, but so quietly that we can't actually hear the sound. And this is like the gravitational waves, which are ringing the drum of spacetime, but so quietly that they're not move the air and we're not hearing them. So now play and I'm gonna turn the volume up a little bit. While I can't actually hear the ringing of the strings themselves, I can hear the data of the shape of the string recorded and played through this amplifier. And that's kind of the idea behind the LIGO instrument.\n","504":"Explainer: So a lot of times stars are born together in two star systems and when they die, if they're heavy enough, they will collapse under their own weight and form a black hole. So here you have a black hole and a big fluffy star. And what will happen is it'll start to tear apart its neighboring star. Literally parts of the star will begin to spill onto the black hole and splatter on the black hole. But let's say both those stars formed black holes. And what these black holes do is they are like mallets on a drum. They create literally waves in the shape of spacetime as they're moving. So imagine mallets on a drum, how the drum ripples. Depending on how the mallets are moving you hear different sounds. So effectively these black holes, as they get very close together in the final stages of their life together, they're orbiting each other at hundreds of times a second. It's this really crazy event, but it's happening in complete darkness. Eventually they bobble together and they merge and then they wring out, the spacetime's going crazy around them, it's this storm in spacetime, and they settle down to a quiet black hole. Then those waves that they created travel through the universe, basically undisturbed. For a long time people thought, well, even if black holes are out there, they're impossible to observe. And then they got very clever. You might wonder how we could possibly hear black holes, that sounds crazy. So I'm gonna show you, but I'm gonna need your help. This demo involves an electric guitar. Do you play at all?\nExplainee: A little bit?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: How do you know that it's like the black hole that's making this sound and nothing else?\nExplainer: It's a great question. If I didn't see you playing the guitar, I would recognize the sound of a guitar. And even if I had never heard of a guitar before I could figure out the frequencies that the string was playing, I could tell how strongly it had been plucked, and I could tell the length of it and where it was pinned down from the harmonics of the string. And I can tell the different lengths of the strings from the notes that they play. So I can actually reconstruct the instrument that's playing it. And it's very similar to LIGO, we can listen to the notes, the amplitude, the harmonics, and we can deduce the size and shape of the objects doing that. And they're very massive and they're very small and they have all the markings of a black hole.\n","505":"Explainer: Okay, you wanna do the demo for me? So the LIGO instrument electronically records the ringing of the shape of space with its very complicated instrument. It stands for Laser Interferometric Gravitational-Waves Observatory and the design was incredibly difficult and they didn't know if they would succeed. I think of the instrument as like the body of the electric guitar. And then they take the readout of the motions of the waves that they're recording, just like that guitar is recording the motions of the waves on the string. Now just play it like a little bit. And you can't hear anything, right? You're not meant to hear an electric guitar when it's not plugged in. What's happening is the guitar strings are ringing, but so quietly that we can't actually hear the sound. And this is like the gravitational waves, which are ringing the drum of spacetime, but so quietly that they're not move the air and we're not hearing them. So now play and I'm gonna turn the volume up a little bit. While I can't actually hear the ringing of the strings themselves, I can hear the data of the shape of the string recorded and played through this amplifier. And that's kind of the idea behind the LIGO instrument.\nExplainee: How do you know that it's like the black hole that's making this sound and nothing else?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Is there anything that like gets affected on Earth because of those waves?\nExplainer: It's a really good question. Only this instrument, and that's why it was so hard to build. And by the time it gets here, it's so weak that it's only squeezing and stretching space at like the fraction of a nucleus over very large distances. Has your understanding of black holes changed over the course of our conversation?\n","506":"Explainer: It's a great question.

I know more and less.\nExplainer: I know what you mean.\n","507":"Explainer: So great to see you, Michael. Thanks for coming.\nExplainee: It's my pleasure.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: It's funny because I'm kind of at the heart, a developmental psychologist. And so when we talk about babies, a lot of what we're talking about is how they become human. I started to try to build computer models of little tiny bits of babies cognition. And I would ask people, and they'd say, You have to assume that you can recognize objects, because actually recognizing objects is impossible. And I was like, 'Wait, it's impossible? What about AI?' And they're like, 'That's, that's really hard.'\nExplainer: Why do you think it's so hard to build these things into AI systems and robots?\n","508":"Explainer: Why do you think it's so hard to build these things into AI systems and robots?\nExplainee: I guess if you think about a quintessentially human task, like playing chess or solving arithmetic problem, things that other creatures just don't do, when you're a human being, you have to learn that in cultural time. And so there's a limited amount of data you have. But if you're talking about seeing the world interacting with the world, using your effectors properly, that's the combination of this massive amount of evolutionary time. When you look at that, it's like the 56 games of chess I played in chess club that doesn't look like a lot of training data. You work so hard to make a robot, do one particular thing or one class of task, and then seems like people must always come up to you and say, 'So, okay, but what about my other task? Okay. You can fold the sock or stack a cup. How about my dishes?' Is that frustrating? Is that a challenge? Is it interesting?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: When we think about babies on their social cognition, we actually start from the idea that they have a notion of what an agent is. An agent is something that's self-propelled, that has its own internal states, like goals and beliefs. And so, it's very natural to imagine that when you see a seemingly, they call it propulsive, action by a robot, you're thinking, 'Hey, this thing has a desire. It has a goal. It's accomplishing it with its. So what if I give it a different goal? Why couldn't it do that?' They call it promiscuous generalization about agents, right? I think that the electrical outlet looks like a face. I think that my computer's mad at me. And so I think it, the challenge actually is to stop people from doing that, and to recognize limitations where there are some. Or we bring to bear our knowledge, sometimes incredibly quickly, to parse an uncertain image. So our experiences go all the way down to our very first impressions of the sensory signal.\nExplainer: I like that description, because it conveys how much complexity there is to these really basic tasks that we're doing. Is there a definition for the simple tasks that we do versus things that are more complex, like playing chess?\n","509":"Explainer: I like that description, because it conveys how much complexity there is to these really basic tasks that we're doing. Is there a definition for the simple tasks that we do versus things that are more complex, like playing chess?\nExplainee: I guess I like to think about this hierarchical cascade, where, at first, vision starts with the sensory signal and parses it into gradually more complex units. I think it does make sense to talk about lower level, meaning closer to sensation and perception and action, and higher level meaning more deliberative, more mediated by memory and language and judgment.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Our impression that it's purely discrete and symbolic might be, just that might be an impression, because we talk about it in a language. And actually, the fact that it's connected up to all these perception and sensation and action systems means that it's probably grounded in a more continuous set of representations. I wonder, is there gonna be a point where what you really want to know is what are the experiences that a human has? [indistinct] human speech own project. His idea was, 'Well, I need the exact data that my son gets in order to train my robot to be like my son.' Or do you think that we're gonna end up in a world that's more like the large language models and that'll have to do?\nExplainer: I suspect that we'll start by doing whatever is most convenient, 'cause that's whatever we can get. But I think that for robots to be capable alongside humans, in a world with humans, I think that we may need to actually use human experience, human learning, to inform how robots learn, if we want them to follow the same kind of mistake pattern as humans, so that humans can interpret robots, and humans can understand what robots will and will not do.\n","510":"Explainer: That notion of hierarchy is really interesting, because it is these higher level things, like playing chess, for example, that are easier for AI systems. And the reason why they're easier is that we're providing the abstraction for the system already, then when we give the game of chess to an AI system, we abstract away all the challenges of like picking up pieces and moving them, and we say, 'Okay, there's this board of however many boxes on it.' And you just need to figure out within that very narrow, small world, what to do. But handling and learning what those abstractions should be and handling everything from low level sensory inputs to that higher level processing is really, really hard.\nExplainee: Our impression that it's purely discrete and symbolic might be, just that might be an impression, because we talk about it in a language.

The general topic is going to be how we perceive different types of social stimuli, like different people's faces and make judgements about them and how the way that we report on what we are experiencing tells us about what's actually going on inside our heads.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Oh of course.\nExplainer: Right, like it reminds me so much of, you know, what we in the field would refer to as statistical learning. On one hand we might have like a one-shot memory, a memory of something that we saw yesterday, like what we did or what we ate or where we were. But a lot of our memories and our knowledge instead are based on many, many, many experiences.\n","512":"Explainer: Right, like it reminds me so much of, you know, what we in the field would refer to as statistical learning.

But a lot of our memories and our knowledge instead are based on many, many, many experiences.\nExplainee: Oh, absolutely. I think this sort of reminds me of another project that I'm doing. It's fairly easy to get different participants to experience consistent negative emotions to the same stimuli, but with positive emotions it's so much harder to study. I might not react the same to like this like cute cat video than someone else. And I definitely believe that people's memory that they're bringing up unconsciously when they're experiencing something to make an emotional judgment informs especially our experience with positive emotion possibly more than negative emotion.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: As far as the way that my research plays into it is like the first step in making a judgment about what to do based on an experience we're calling from memory is deciding what your emotional response was.\nExplainer: I think what we're still kind of trying to understand as a field is the more kind of detailed and bigger picture of where does this model live? How does it get updated based on experiences? Why does that sometimes happen and sometimes not? There are actually people who are born without a hippocampus. They have disruptions to episodic memories. They have trouble after this conversation remembering what the conversation was about, but they do have pretty good semantic information. They have a good sense of knowledge about the world. And that's interesting for two reasons. One, it shows this association between the role of the hippocampus and these two forms of memory, episodic memories and semantic memory. The other reason it's interesting is that people often assume that we get to semantic memory through episodic memory, that we encounter one dog and then another dog, and then another dog and then we learned the concept, the semantic notion of a dog. And these people, their profile suggests that you can learn semantic information. You can learn general knowledge about the world, even without ever having the capacity to build those individual memories.\n","513":"Explainer: Some of those examples really remind me also some of the questions about kind of abnormalities in, in memory or trauma or disruptions in memory and how they also play out in terms of not just what people remember but what they do with those memories right?\nExplainee: As far as the way that my research plays into it is like the first step in making a judgment about what to do based on an experience we're calling from memory is deciding what your emotional response was.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: In people with intact brains, you might use a particular process, but if that brain region that subserves that process is damaged, that it's not that you can't do it anymore you just now do it a different way.\nExplainer: You know when I look back at, some of the work for my own lab and in the field in general, I really feel like some of the most exciting discoveries were not an answer to a question that was around before, but they were discoveries that made us realize we weren't asking the right question. I think one example of that even has to do with the connection between memory and decision-making. There was a discovery about how the striatum responds to rewards and to learning that just all of a sudden flipped the way we thought about the role of reward and learning and memory, and may force us to realize there was something fundamentally connected between these processes. And that discovery just raised a whole new set of questions that didn't exist before.\n","514":"Explainer: I think what we're still kind of trying to understand as a field is the more kind of detailed and bigger picture of where does this model live?

And we just sort of have to infer and guess at what strategies that they're doing. Is there's a particular research question that the answer you think is gonna inform the research in your lab and perhaps in the rest of your field?\nExplainer: Each project should be very focused and rigorous and know what a study is designed for. But at the same time we have to keep our minds open, our eyes open for what else is happening. Some of the most interesting discoveries didn't make sense at first.\n","515":"Explainer: Typically you would think that things that are easy for humans, are also easy for robots and computers to do.\nExplainee: Right.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Okay.\nExplainer: So I have a penny in my hand and I'd like you to pick it up with your right hand and put it into your left hand.

So close your eyes.\nExplainee: Oh, there we go.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: From the sound.\nExplainer: So when a robot tries to do something, like pick up an object, not only do you need to program exactly like what the motors should do, the robot also needs to be able to see where the object is. Then this is what's called a perception action loop in robotics. So if the object moves, the robot can then adapt what it's doing and change what it's doing to successfully pick up the object. It's really important for robots to be able to leverage, not just like the past hour of experience, but also ideally many years of experience, in order to do the kinds of things that you did.\n","518":"Explainer: Yeah.

It's really unintuitive. In order to survive, we need to pick up objects and everything.

And it has to be able to figure out, from that massive set of numbers, what is in the world.

so, I think one of the key questions is, what happens when we're going from wakefulness to sleep, and how does that relate to the brain's reward system, because that's where dopamine comes in.","1":"And to be honest, the answer is, it's not really clear. Some studies suggest that it can improve sleep quality, but other studies have found that it doesn't really have a significant impact on sleep quality. It's a bit of a mixed bag, and more research is needed to fully understand how amphetamines and other wake-promoting drugs affect sleep quality.","2":"And so, the amphetamine really is pushing the wake-promoting system, and that makes it harder for the sleep system to kick in, because it's being pushed in the opposite direction.","3":"Explainer: And I think that's a good point, because we do see that some people are more sensitive to the effects of amphetamines, and that's probably because of individual differences in their sleep homeostasis, right? So some people might be more prone to sleep deprivation, or have a harder time recovering from sleep deprivation, and that could make them more susceptible to the effects of amphetamines.","4":"and also, how would you ensure that they actually got a good night's sleep before coming in to the study?","5":"It comes from just your life experience. And that moves you in a certain direction. How it gets expressed, many times, is sudden. Complete surprise. (laughs)","6":"I think what you're saying is that it's not about the theoretical knowledge, but about the emotional connection you have with the music, and that's what guides your choices.","7":"You told me that the chord progression of Don't Follow the Crowd is actually in D flat major, but with a twist. You said it's a mix of D flat major and B minor, creating a sense of tension and release.","8":"But what I don't get is how the seventh is functioning in relation to the chord's overall sound.","9":"I asked him, 'What do you think about my analysis of the harmony in this song?' He said, 'Let me tell you something. The key to harmony is not the notes you play, but the notes you don't play.'","10":"So, you see what I mean when I say that harmony is not just about chords, but about the relationship between different sounds and how they interact with each other?","11":"You feel like you're coming home or something.","12":"You're using a lot of seventh chords, aren't you?","13":"I think the first one sounds more like a sad song, but the second one is happy.","14":"Because the notes sound nice together.","15":"and how it affects the user's experience in VR.","16":"And with the advancements in VR, we'll be able to create even more realistic and immersive experiences, which is really exciting.","17":"I mean, the technology is advancing so fast, it's almost like we're seeing the beginning of a new art form.","18":"That's actually what machine learning is. It's a type of artificial intelligence that involves algorithms that can learn from data without being explicitly programmed.","19":"Do you think a recommendation system would recommend Melanie Martinez to you based on your listening history?","20":"I was thinking maybe it's because the song had a similar tone to her other songs, like it was a little bit dark and moody, and maybe the machine learned that that's a common theme in her music.","21":"What can the machine understand about the music itself, like is it fast or slow, is it happy or sad?","22":"They use it to learn more about me and my interests so they can show me ads that are more relevant to me.","23":"I think that's a very interesting question. I believe that we've made tremendous progress in teaching machines to do things that we can do, but I also think that there are still some things that are uniquely human. For example, creativity and empathy are things that we have a hard time teaching machines to do. But I also think that there are things that machines can do that we can't, like processing vast amounts of data quickly and accurately.","24":"If a neutron star is massive enough, its gravity can be so strong that not even light can escape, which is what defines a black hole.","25":"The explainee asks a question about the space-time inside a black hole, and the professor explains that the concept of space-time breaks down at the center of a black hole, and it's not possible to talk about what's inside in a classical sense.","26":"And that's why I'm really excited about the prospects for this kind of work, because we can get information about the universe in ways that we never could before.","27":"But the supernova origin theory was challenged by the observation of the 3K cosmic microwave background radiation, which suggested that the universe was much hotter in the past and that many elements were created in the first few minutes after the Big Bang.","28":"And you've got to start with the basics, right?","29":"So, it's not like we're moving in three dimensions of space and then suddenly we're moving in a fourth dimension of time.","30":"I was gonna draw a diagram, but now I'm glad I didn't. Let me just tell you what I had in mind. I was gonna draw a 2D space, and then I was gonna draw a 3D space as a kind of... well, it's hard to explain without a diagram, but I was gonna draw a 3D space as a kind of... a 2D space with an extra dimension that's not directly visible. Does that make sense?","31":"Well, one reason is that it helps us to understand how time dilation and length contraction work. If you're moving really fast, time will pass more slowly for you relative to someone who is standing still, and if you're moving really fast in one direction, objects will appear shorter to you than they would if you were standing still.","32":"So you can travel through spacetime in different ways, like you could walk around a park and then you could drive around it, and then you could fly over it.","33":"You could think of it as a kind of fundamental time, a base time, but it's more like a parameter that describes the geometry of spacetime, rather than a kind of absolute time that's the same everywhere.","34":"There is a way to visualize this, if you imagine a map of the Earth, and you draw a line between two points on the map, that line will always be the shortest distance between those two points, but if you were to draw a straight line between those two points on the Earth's surface, it would be a great circle, and it would be the longest distance between those two points.","35":"Because the one who zoomed out was moving through the 4th dimension, and so their experience of time was different.","36":"If you had a sheet that was originally flat, and you set a marble on it, it would go in a straight line, but then if you put something on it so it warps it, that marble is now gonna be deflected.","37":"So, imagine you have a big sheet of paper, or a big rubber sheet, and you put a heavy object, like a bowling ball, on it. The sheet will warp and curve under the weight of the bowling ball, right? And if you roll a marble nearby, it will follow the curve of the sheet and move towards the bowling ball. That's kind of like what's happening with spacetime and gravity. The heavy objects, like planets and stars, warp the fabric of spacetime, and other objects, like you and me, follow that curvature and move along geodesic paths, which are the shortest paths possible in curved spacetime.","38":"I mean, isn't harmony just like, making the melody sound pretty?","39":"So the chord progression is basically what gives the song its harmonic structure.","40":"We'd like to understand how the universe ends up with a particular compactification, a particular way of wrapping up the extra dimensions, that results in the world we see.","41":"I think the compactification is one of the key things that makes string theory hard to test, because if you were to go back in time and try to measure the size of the extra dimension, you'd have to be at a scale where gravity is strong, and you can't do that with any of our current technology.","42":"We assume that the universe is infinite in all directions, including the dimensions we can't perceive, so the large dimensions are just part of the inherent structure of the universe.","43":"What happens to the higher dimensions as you move closer to the brane?","44":"You're saying that these black branes can be compactified, and that's what we've seen in our work, right?","45":"Is it that these have the lowest action of all the things that could possibly, all the possible solutions?","46":"That the action is lowest, right, is a consequence of the fact that the sphere is the roundest possible solution, so it's the one that minimizes the action.","47":"So, what's the main idea behind the graphic novel?","48":"Gravity is the force that keeps us on the earth.","49":"And just like how you're having trouble pulling your hand away from the force I'm applying with my hand, a black hole's gravity is so strong that not even light can escape once it gets too close.","50":"Can you see me waving my hand over there?","51":"I'm not sure, it looks like you're holding up four, but I'm not really sure.","52":"So I'm guessing that the continuous laser is just not suitable for your application?","53":"So, what's your experience with laser applications?","54":"So, if we want to target a tumor cell, we could use a high-powered laser to create a very small, intense beam that can be focused on the cell, and then use a pulse laser to deliver that power in a very short time, to minimize the damage to the surrounding tissue.","55":"That's a great point, and I think that's one of the things we're trying to figure out, from an engineer's perspective, what are the minimum requirements for a compelling VR experience?","56":"And that's where the question of wisdom comes in, because we have the capability to create something that's photo-realistic, but is it worth it? And what are the trade-offs? Is it worth the computing power, is it worth the complexity, is it worth the cost?","57":"But if we just wind up following the path that we're on, we're gonna get double and quadruple, but we're not gonna get 50 times more powerful than we are right now. We will run into atomic limits on our fabrication. So given that, I'm trying to tell people that, start buying back into optimization, start buying back into thinking a bit more creatively. Because you can't just wait, its not going to get to that point where it really is fixed to those highest degrees just by waiting for computing to be advanced. If we want this to be something used by a billion people then we need it to be lighter, cheaper, more comfortable.","58":"But I think we're still far from being able to do it in real-time, and that's where the biggest challenge lies.","59":"I think, you know, we're going to have to figure out the social implications of all this, like what happens when people start spending more time in virtual reality than in the real world, and how that affects their relationships and their sense of self.","60":"So how many dimensions do you think are in our universe?","61":"So, we can think of it like this. A line is one dimension, a plane is two dimensions, and three dimensions is like a cube.","62":"like, for example, if we had a third dimension, we could use three numbers to locate ourselves?","63":"And that's how we can locate points in three dimensions, right? We can use a combination of distance and angle to figure out exactly where something is.","64":"You're thinking of the fourth dimension, which is time, right?","65":"It's like taking the same idea of mapping a 2D space, like a piece of paper, and applying it to a 3D space, like the sky. Just as latitude and longitude help us pinpoint a location on Earth, we can use similar coordinates to locate objects in the sky.","66":"You're talking about the idea of the dimensions being like the layers of an onion, right? Each layer is like a different dimension, but they're all kind of connected and nested inside each other.","67":"We have 3D space, and then we have time, so that's four, and then there are other dimensions that are more theoretical, like the string theory dimensions.","68":"You're saying that there's no way to definitively prove that we're not living in a four-dimensional space?","69":"text","70":"We've been using a lot of computational tools, like computational fluid dynamics, and also machine learning algorithms to analyze the data from LIGO and other observations, and also, of course, we've been using a lot of telescopes and space-based observatories to observe the X-ray binaries and other objects that are related to black holes.","71":"And that's why we don't float off into space.","72":"Why is the Earth's gravity stronger than the Moon's?","73":"If gravity was too strong, we wouldn't be able to stand up or walk around, we'd be squished down.","74":"How tall is the fourth grade?","75":null,"76":"But how does that affect us on Earth, though?","77":"Isaac Newton was a scientist who was sitting under an apple tree when an apple fell on his head and that's how he discovered gravity.","78":"But why do we think that the Earth is pulling on the apple?","79":"What's going on when something heavy falls down? Like, when you drop a ball, it falls down to the ground. That's because of gravity.","80":"But, I think I've also read that the actual amount of sleep we need can vary, and that some people need more than others, and it's not just about the quantity, but also the quality of sleep.","81":"What do you think is the relationship between sleep and memory, and how do you think that impacts your ability to learn new things?","82":"a beam of concentrated light","83":"Right, exactly like a magnifying glass. That's a good analogy. But what if I told you that this is actually much more powerful than a magnifying glass? The sun's energy that we're focusing with a magnifying glass is actually spread out over the entire surface of the sun. But with a laser, we're taking all of that energy and concentrating it into a single point. That's what makes it so powerful.","84":"But with light, time and length are the same thing because light always travels at the speed of light.","85":"So it's like, concentrated, but not really concentrated, it's more like...","86":"it really narrows down into this tiny little beam","87":"you were working on it and I was just starting to get into the field","88":"I was really excited about the unified model at the time, but it was also clear that it couldn't explain everything we were seeing, and that was one of the things that really got me interested in AGN research in the first place.","89":"I mean, think about it, we're trying to observe a black hole that's billions of light years away, and we're trying to do it with a bunch of different telescopes that are all trying to look at it at the same time, it's like trying to solve a puzzle blindfolded.","90":"Do you sleep well?","91":"We're gonna be looking at all these different parts of sleep, like REM and non-REM, and how they affect our bodies.","92":"We can actually tell how much sleep someone's getting by looking at how much REM they're getting, and we can also tell what their sleep schedule is by looking at the timing of the REM and NREM sleep. We can see if they're getting the right amount of sleep for their age, and if they're going to bed and waking up at the right time.","93":"So, if you're on your phone, or your tablet, or your computer right before you go to bed, and you're scrolling through social media, or playing a game, or watching a video, it's going to interfere with your sleep, and you're probably not going to get into deep sleep, and you're not going to get into REM sleep.","94":"I never thought about it that way, so that means if I'm really stressed or engaged before bed, I might not get as much REM sleep as I could?","95":"So, how do you think sleep stages are measured?","96":"What's the significance of their size?","97":"I'm curious, what kind of applications do you see for quantum dots?","98":"You're absolutely right. The 0D refers to the quantum dots because they're essentially a single cluster of atoms. That's what makes them so fascinating.","99":"Quantum dots have a number of applications, including their use in quantum computing and in the field of biomedicine.","100":"Well, we're not there yet, but it's not far away. In the last few years, there's been a huge increase in investment in this area. I think you'll see it start to happen in the next 10 to 20 years.","101":"So you're interested in carbon nanotubes?","102":"You can use a variety of techniques, such as chemical vapor deposition, to control the diameter of the nanotubes. But the challenge is that it's a very delicate process and it's hard to control the conditions perfectly. We're still learning about how to do it consistently.","103":"You're absolutely right. Silicon has reached its limits. And so, researchers are looking for other materials to replace it. And that's where nanomaterials come in. Graphene, nanotubes, these are the kinds of materials that have the potential to replace silicon and take us to the next level of technology.","104":"I don't think so, but I've heard it mentioned in some videos I watched about robots.","105":"So, what makes a dog a dog and a cat a cat, do you think?","106":"That's a great job using the features you learned to make a prediction! But how do you think we could make this program better at guessing what the animal is?","107":"Have you had any experience with machine learning before, like reviewing or testing what you've learned?","108":"And that's kind of like what we're doing with these examples - giving the machine practice so it can learn.","109":"So what if the machine is looking at something it's never seen before, like a picture of a cat it's never seen before?","110":"And if you had 10 million examples, would you still be able to answer quickly?","111":"We're gonna talk about the brain.","112":"Did you know that your brain is made up of billions of tiny cells called neurons that are connected to each other in a special way called a connectome?","113":"You've been doing some pretty interesting stuff lately. I saw that you published a paper on fault attacks against a particular type of encryption algorithm. What inspired that research?","114":"You mean flipping bits within flash?","115":"I was thinking about that, and it seems like the new area that's coming out is more about the side-channel attacks. Like, people are really starting to get into that, and that's really interesting, because it's not just about the code itself, it's about how the system is actually operating, and that's where a lot of the fun is, I think.","116":"You're seeing a lot of interest in formal verification, because it's a way to actually prove that the system is secure, right? And, like, it's been around for a while, but I think it's finally starting to gain some traction in the industry.","117":"I think that's a big part of why hardware hacking is so hard, because it's like a, you know, a multi-armed bandit problem. You have to try a lot of different things to figure out what's going on, and it's not just like, Oh, I know this one thing, and I can do this. It's like, you have to understand all these different things, and how they interact with each other.","118":"You're saying that a star collapses in on itself because it runs out of fuel and can't support its own weight anymore?","119":"I think, though, what people often don't realize is that the gravity of a black hole isn't just a point of no return, it's actually a gradient, so the gravity is very strong right next to it, but as you get further away, it starts to behave more like a normal object, like a star or a planet.","120":"Well, actually, there are some movies that do a pretty good job of getting space right, like Interstellar, for example, it's a bit of a stretch, but they did a pretty good job of getting the physics right, especially when it comes to wormholes and black holes.","121":"I think we've had a similar experience, where the problems that we were working on 10, 11 years ago were very different from the ones we're working on now. And it's not just that the problems have changed, but the way we approach them has changed as well. We're dealing with much more complex, much more nuanced problems now, and the tools that we have are much more powerful, but they're also much more nuanced, and that's creating a lot of challenges for us.","122":"I think one of the biggest challenges is that, as the tooling has become more accessible, the complexity of the problems that we're trying to solve with machine learning has increased, but the complexity of the data and the complexity of the societal issues that we're trying to address hasn't decreased. So, we're still struggling with the same issues of bias and fairness and transparency, but now we have to deal with them in a much more complex system.","123":"And so, it's not just the provenance of that data, but it's, sort of, deeply understanding, Why does it look the way it looks? Why was it collected this way? What are the limitations of it?","124":"I think that's a really good point about the bigger picture, and it's not just about being a programmer anymore. It's about understanding the context, the impact, and the potential consequences of what you're building.","125":"Well, I think we're seeing a lot of adoption in healthcare, for instance. The pharma industry is really taking a strong interest in this, but I think we're also seeing a lot of hype in industries that maybe aren't as ready. Finance is a great example. They're really struggling to figure out how to integrate machine learning in a way that makes sense, and I think they're still in the early days of really understanding how to do that.","126":"I think we can make a lot of progress in the next 5-10 years, but it will require a lot more effort from the research community to make sure that our results are applicable to real-world problems, and from the industry to make sure that the results are being used responsibly. It will also require a lot more effort from the education system to teach students how to think about the implications of their work, not just how to train a model.","127":"Origami is a Japanese art form of folding paper to create decorative objects. It involves folding and shaping a flat piece of paper to create a three-dimensional shape. The paper is folded multiple times, and the folds are carefully arranged to create the desired shape. Origami can be used to create a wide range of objects, from simple designs like cranes and boats to complex models like animals and buildings. It requires patience, skill, and attention to detail. Origami is often used as a form of meditation and relaxation, as it requires focus and concentration.","128":"They're not cut, they're folded, which is really cool.","129":"Can you make a fold that starts at the dot that doesn't run all the way across the paper, like that?","130":"Yes, all the folds are reversible.","131":"If I had another twist in the same sheet of paper I could make these folds connect with that, and these folds connect with that. And if I had another one up here, I could make all three.","132":"A twist is a fundamental building block of tessellations, and you can see how it works by unfolding this square. When you do that, you'll see that the center square twists, it rotates. As you can see, the edges of the square are aligned in a particular way, and that's what allows the twist to happen. The twist is a result of the way the edges are folded and aligned.","133":"A connectome is a map of how different brain regions are connected to each other, which can be used to understand how the brain processes information.","134":"The connectome is a way to visualize this, a way to map the neural connections in the brain, which is a complex task, but it's being done with the help of advanced imaging techniques.","135":"But the point is, even though the computer can only communicate with itself in binary, it can still process an infinite number of yes or no questions, and if we can map the brain's connections and how neurons fire, we can essentially teach the computer to process those questions in a way that mimics the brain's behavior, even if it's not thinking in the same way.","136":"Yes, the Spitzer Space Telescope is able to give us some sense of the overall scale of the accretion disk, and how it's changing over time, but the resolution is not high enough to give us a detailed picture of the disk's structure.","137":"So what about the structure of the black hole itself, how do you map that out?","138":"But I've been trying to get some of my colleagues to work on this problem, and we've been trying to use some of the archival data from Chandra, to see if we can do a better job of disentangling the X-ray binaries from the AGN, because that would really help us understand the properties of the black holes in these low luminosity AGN.","139":"And this goes to the idea that you don't have a core balance, that a supernova with a black hole as its final result, actually never has any kind of expulsion, that it all just goes. (imitates sucking)","140":"I was going to say that the matter is compressed so tightly that it doesn't have a chance to be expelled outward, it just gets pulled into the singularity.","141":"And I think, kind of, one of the things that's really interesting about this is that deep learning can be really powerful, but it's not always the right tool for the job, right? I mean, if you're trying to do something that's really straightforward, like just classifying text into categories, then maybe deep learning is overkill. But if you're trying to do something that's really complex, like understanding the nuances of a particular piece of text, then maybe deep learning is the way to go.","142":"And I think that's part of why, sort of, people get frustrated with the lack of control, is that they're trying to build models that do more than just predict the next thing, but they're still using the same kind of data and the same kind of training methods.","143":"I think that's a great point. But, for example, we could also use some sort of, like, metrics to measure the bias in the model, such as, like, word embeddings, or, like, the output of the model on a certain set of test data, to get a sense of whether the model is, like, perpetuating certain biases.","144":"We were discussing gravity and you mentioned that gravity is a curvature of space-time, which is a fundamental concept in general relativity. However, I was thinking about the fact that we can also explain gravity in terms of particles, like the graviton, which is a hypothetical particle that mediates the force of gravity. How do you think these two approaches to gravity fit together, or do they even fit together at all?","145":"And I think that's one of the things that makes it so difficult to reconcile quantum mechanics with gravity, because quantum mechanics is fundamentally about discrete particles and wave functions, and it's hard to see how that fits with a continuous, smooth space-time.","146":"I see what you're getting at, but isn't that a bit like saying that there's a galaxy in every possible universe, and we just happen to be in the one where it's there?","147":"I think what Hawking's work showed is that if you take the principles of quantum mechanics, like the uncertainty principle, and apply them to a black hole, you get this kind of paradox where it seems like information is lost, but that's not actually the case. It's just that the information is encoded in the radiation that's coming out of the black hole, which is Hawking radiation. So, in a way, it's like when your computer crashes and you lose all your work, it's not that the information is actually lost, it's just that it's encoded in the radiation that's coming out of the computer, which is just a bunch of random electrons and photons.","148":"You're saying that the radiation that comes out of a black hole is a kind of entropy, a measure of disorder, and that the information about the matter that fell into the black hole is lost in that radiation.","149":"for instance, we're only really concerned with the large-scale properties of spacetime that we can measure in everyday life.","150":"You're saying that the event horizon is not a hard boundary, it's more of a fuzzy boundary, and that's a consequence of the theory, is that right?","151":"I see what you mean about the hologram analogy. The idea that a two-dimensional surface can encode information about a three-dimensional space is quite fascinating and it sounds like it has some parallels with the holographic principle in the context of gravity.","152":"If we buy the idea of holography, then absolutely, that's for sure, that's what it's telling us.","153":"You can draw whatever you like on the origami paper, like a house or a car.","154":"Let's start with a square piece of paper, can you show me how to make a square?","155":"So, people have been folding paper for a very long time.","156":"Now, watch how the edges come together and how it starts to form the little pocket.","157":"Can I try?","158":"because it suddenly changes shape.","159":"They are called origami, which means folding paper in Japanese.","160":"I think it's really cool!","161":"I don't think it's because it's not working, it's just because it's not yet mainstream and people are still learning about it.","162":"the science of blockchain is not just about creating a new kind of money, but also about understanding the underlying technology that enables it, and that's where the real innovation is happening.","163":"It's just that the system we have today is so deeply entrenched, and it's so expensive to change it, that it's almost impossible to change.","164":"I think people forget that even in the world of autonomous vehicles, we're still talking about a reduction in accidents, not a complete elimination. And that's what's happening with blockchain too.","165":"They usually try to trick the person into giving them the information or they use some kind of virus to get the information.","166":"They'll have a special password or something that they give to you so you can change the password on the lock, or they'll have a way for you to reset the password yourself.","167":"They might get arrested because they might get mistaken for the bad hackers.","168":"And I didn't know what I was doing, I just found out that I could do it.","169":"Do you think you could make a difference in the world with it?","170":"Does your phone have a tiny camera, a touchscreen, or a processor that's incredibly small?","171":"I found this tiny Lego brick that's roughly the same size as a transistor. I'm going to show you how the size of the transistors has decreased over the years.","172":"to understand how we're able to make these transistors so small","173":"So, we use these huge factories with very precise machinery to make the transistors and then assemble them on a wafer.","174":"It's when you give something to someone else, and they give you something else in return.","175":"for something I like.","176":"Can you think of any inputs the computer might have?","177":"You're taking the game and you're changing the way it works, like, so if you press the space bar, it's not jumping. It's actually doing something else.","178":"Mouse","179":null,"180":"I'm not really sure what you're talking about, but I've seen some YouTube videos about hacking. I don't really know what's true and what's not.","181":"Well, it can be as little as a few seconds, or it can be as long as several hours, or even days. It really depends on the complexity of the system, and the level of security that's been implemented.","182":"And doesn't it make sense that the Earth is pulling the rocket down, and then we fire the engines to pull it up?","183":"So, the gravity is still pulling on it, but it's also moving fast enough that it never actually falls down towards the Earth. It's just constantly falling, but it's also constantly moving forward, so it never actually gets closer to the Earth.","184":"It's like when you're on a train and it starts moving, you feel like you're the one who's moving, right? It's a weird feeling. And that's what's going on with the International Space Station, it's just moving so fast that it feels like it's not moving at all.","185":"So, it's kind of like when you're on the train and you feel like you're not moving, even though the train is actually moving really fast. It's all about perspective and how we perceive motion.","186":"I mean, it's not like you're feeling like you're floating around or anything, it's just that the laws of physics are different when you're moving at high speeds. You still throw the ball up, and it still comes back down, but the reason it does is not because of gravity pulling on you, it's because of the train's inertia trying to keep you and the ball together.","187":"You're saying that if she's moving at high speed, she's gonna measure a different speed of light. And that's a problem because it would mean that the laws of physics aren't the same for both of you.","188":"it helps you feel happy and strong and ready to play and learn.","189":"How does it recharge, like humans?","190":"Well, the giraffe recharges by entering a state called unihemispheric slow-wave sleep, where one half of the brain is asleep and the other half is awake, so it can still be aware of its surroundings and get up quickly if it needs to.","191":"How did you know you were tired?","192":"Do you think you could sleep with your eyes open like a dolphin?","193":"What does it do when it's sleeping?","194":"So what do you think 'nano' means?","195":"And what if I told you that's even smaller than a millimeter, and that's what nanometers are, a nanometer is one billionth of a meter.","196":"So, atoms are really small, like, really, really small. They're the building blocks of everything, and if we could see them, we could make things that are really, really strong, or really, really light.","197":"Oh wow, that's amazing!","198":"So, do you think it's cool that we can make things that are smaller than a grain of rice?","199":"You're saying that virtual reality has its roots in Realism, which is an art movement that focused on everyday life, and that's something we should keep in mind when thinking about the future of VR.","200":"I think that's one of the biggest challenges for us, to find that balance between the amount of detail and the amount of fidelity we can achieve with the current hardware and the amount of money we can spend on it.","201":"I think one of the most interesting things about VR is that it's not just a technology, it's a medium, and a medium has its own set of rules and its own set of constraints and its own set of possibilities. And one of the things that I think is really interesting is that VR is not just a display technology, it's not just a rendering technology, it's a way of interacting with the world, and that changes everything. And I think that's what's so exciting about it, is that it's not just a new way of displaying images, it's a new way of interacting with the world, and that's what's going to lead to all the interesting things that are going to happen in the future.","202":"sentence.","203":"That's a very good question. I think we've already touched on it. But just to summarize, the inverse-square law does imply that gravity acts at a distance, which can seem a bit strange.","204":"But how does that apply to objects that are not in free fall, like us standing on the surface of the Earth?","205":"You're falling along with the elevator, and the question is, what's the difference between this and standing on the surface of the Earth?","206":"I think you're missing the point of this conversation, though. We're discussing the effects of gravity on projectiles.","207":"and land on the ground, right?","208":"when you finally understood that gravity isn't a force, it's just a curvature of spacetime.","209":"that gravity could warp space-time in such a dramatic way.","210":"What are they, exactly? How do they work?","211":"It's a pretty common idea in theories of extra dimensions that they're compactified, so they're not directly observable at our scale, but they can affect the behavior of particles and forces in our universe.","212":"You've heard of string theory?","213":"So what's the idea behind string theory?","214":"So, string theory proposes that the fundamental building blocks of the universe are not particles, but tiny, vibrating strings.","215":"You're saying that the idea of extra dimensions comes from string theory?","216":"A little loop of string, so a little one dimensional circle that is vibrating.","217":"It's through the vibration of the strings that you get the different types of particles, and it's the way that the strings vibrate that gives you the different properties of those particles.","218":"And string theory is an attempt to unify all of these forces into one single equation.","219":"A brane is like a higher dimensional object that vibrates through space, and that vibration is connected to the strings, which are like the fundamental units of matter that vibrate at different frequencies to give rise to different particles.","220":"Exactly. Like, it's not just the transaction itself, but the verification process that's really key to the blockchain technology, right? And that's what makes it so secure, because it's not just one person verifying it, it's a whole network of people verifying it, so it's really hard to cheat or manipulate the information.","221":"And the reason for that is because in a blockchain system, the actors are not just people, they're also machines that are executing smart contracts and other automated processes.","222":null,"223":"And I think that's one of the things that's really exciting about blockchain is that it's not just a technology, it's a new paradigm for how we think about trust and how we think about value and how we think about the way that information is shared and stored.","224":"I think it's interesting that you bring up the idea that it's going to be used everywhere. A lot of people think that's the case, but I think there are going to be some challenges to that. One of the challenges is going to be the scalability issue. Right now, the technology is not very scalable, and that's going to be a major hurdle for it to be used in a lot of different areas.","225":"You have to think about how the material properties will change as you scale up from the lab to large scale production, because the properties of the material may change as you go from a few nanometers to a few micrometers in size.","226":"Origami, in general, is a very precise art form, and it's very easy to track the motion of a piece of paper as you fold it. It's very easy to understand the kinematics of the motion of the paper as you fold it. And that makes it very useful for applications where you need to understand the motion of a piece of paper or a thin sheet of material as it folds or unfolds.","227":"One of the key properties of origami is its ability to transform from a flat sheet to a complex three-dimensional shape. This property makes it an ideal material for applications that require compact storage and deployment, such as the origami lamp we're looking at. The precision and control that origami allows also make it suitable for applications that require precise movements and actions, such as robotics and medical devices.","228":"So, it's not just about making it small, it's also about making it big, right?","229":"so it's not just a matter of making the creases, but actually using a machine that can fold the material in a way that creates the three-dimensional structure and the S-bends that give it its unique properties.","230":"So basically, it's like a digital ledger that records all of the transactions that happen on the network.","231":"Yes, one of the main goals of blockchain technology is to reduce the need for intermediaries like banks and financial institutions. For example, with cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, people can send and receive money directly without needing a bank. This can save time and money for both the sender and the receiver. And it can also increase security because there's no single point of failure, like a bank's database.","232":"One of the ways that blockchain does this is through a process called smart contracts. Smart contracts are essentially self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement written directly into lines of code. They can be used to verify the authenticity of an item, or the legitimacy of a seller, and they can also be used to automate the payment process once the terms of the contract have been met.","233":"So what kind of sleep disturbances do you focus on?","234":"So, I think what's really fascinating is that you're talking about the clearance of beta-amyloid, and I think that's one of the most exciting areas of research right now, because it's really starting to show that sleep plays a critical role in the clearance of beta-amyloid, and that if you don't get good sleep, you're not clearing out that beta-amyloid, and that's really starting to show a link between sleep disturbances and Alzheimer's disease.","235":"The relationship between sleep and neurodegeneration is fascinating. Research has shown that sleep disturbances are a common early symptom of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's. Furthermore, studies have found that sleep deprivation can actually accelerate the progression of these diseases, likely due to the buildup of beta-amyloid and other toxic proteins in the brain. This has significant implications for our understanding of the role of sleep in maintaining brain health and for the development of new treatments for neurodegenerative diseases.","236":"You would fold the paper in half, diagonally, and then fold it in half again, diagonally, and then fold it in half once more, diagonally, to create a point.","237":"What's wrong with a paper airplane?","238":"Now let's see if we can find a way to fold the paper into the shape of a spider.","239":"So, what this suggests is that the crane has five circles and the fifth one is actually the head of the crane.","240":"You can start by making a square sheet of paper, which is the foundation of origami. This square will be folded into smaller and smaller shapes until you reach the final design. Origami is all about folding and manipulating the paper to create the desired shape. The key is to be patient and follow the instructions carefully.","241":"Can you tell me more about how you're actually manipulating these viruses to get them to build these materials?","242":"And you're using these materials in applications like what, for instance, a battery or a solar cell or a display screen?","243":"I think one of the challenges is that we need to be able to scale up our processes and materials in a way that's not just environmentally friendly, but also economically viable. If we can't make a material that's not only good for the planet, but also affordable for people to use, then it's not going to have the impact that we want it to have.","244":"origami, the art of folding paper, is used to design the compact, deployable structures.","245":"So this is a very simple example of an origami deployable shape. We can see that it has a degree-4 vertex, which is a fundamental building block of many origami deployable shapes.","246":"Origani is a type of origami-inspired mechanism that's used in the deployment of space telescopes and solar arrays.","247":"We'll be able to see how that's done by the way we fold the paper and how we stick the vertices together.","248":"This is actually a really great example of how origami can be used to solve problems in engineering and I think that's one of the reasons why it's been so popular in the last few years.","249":"And you'd want it to be something that's very slow, so that it's not like it's unfolding at the same time as the solar panel is deploying, so that you have some sort of control over the sequence of events.","250":"You can't get them at exactly the same rate, and that's a limitation. This is a common problem in origami-inspired structures.","251":"It's a trade-off between the compactness and the rate of opening. If you want it to be compact, you want the first one. If you want it to open at the same rate, you want the second one.","252":"What's the trade-off between this origami structure and the other structure you mentioned?","253":"And that's why you can explore all those places in Minecraft in VR.","254":"You mean the major and minor chords?","255":"It's like a big diagram with all the chords and keys and their relationships to each other. You can see how they all fit together.","256":"So you're saying that if we start with a G, we can move to an A and then to a B?","257":"Let's play it with the chord progression, so it's a bit more interesting.","258":"I can see a major seventh chord there, right? B flat major seventh, which is B flat, D, F, A.","259":"What's physics about?","260":"We have physics in our daily life, like when you drop something, it falls down. We want to understand why it falls down.","261":"I think that's kind of how I see it, like a line with numbers on it.","262":"If our line had some numbers or letters on it, how would you say where you are?","263":"One number is not enough to describe it.","264":"You can think of it like a big piece of paper, right? If you're on a piece of paper, you only need to tell me two numbers to figure out where you are.","265":"Okay, so let's say we have a piece of paper with a grid drawn on it, like a graph. And let's say we have a dot on the paper. If we move the dot up or down, we're moving it along the Y axis.","266":"So we have one dimension that we can move left and right, and another dimension that we can move up and down, and then we have the third dimension that we can move forward and backward.","267":"I would be really curious to know how they figured out that there are extra dimensions.","268":"So, you're saying that the Gmail program uses machine learning to classify emails into different categories, like spam and non-spam, based on the features it's been trained on?","269":"You could also look at things like the sender's email address, the sender's IP address, the subject line, and even the structure of the email, like whether it's got a lot of images or not.","270":"Yes, there are. We can use dimensionality reduction to automatically identify features that are most relevant to the problem. We can also use techniques like PCA, which can help us identify the most important features that are most relevant to the problem. And we can use clustering algorithms, which can help us group similar data points together.","271":"In terms of the algorithms themselves, supervised learning typically uses algorithms based on distance metrics, like k-nearest neighbors, while unsupervised learning typically uses algorithms based on density, like k-means, which works by trying to minimize the sum of squared distances between each data point and the centroid of its cluster.","272":"Reinforcement learning can be thought of as a trial and error approach, where you're trying a lot of different things, but it's not necessarily a kitchen sink approach. It's more like, you're trying a lot of different things and then you're getting feedback on whether or not those things are good or bad, and then you can refine your approach over time.","273":"In situations where you have a well-defined problem with abundant, well-structured data, a deep learning algorithm can provide accurate predictions or classifications without the need for iterative learning and decision-making, making it a preferred choice over a reinforcement learning algorithm.","274":"text to fill in the missing part","275":"I think so. Like, linear regression can be very accurate, but if you don't know what the variables are that are causing the regression, then it's hard to make decisions based on that.","276":"Well, we can use techniques such as feature engineering, ensemble methods, and regularization to improve the accuracy and robustness of machine learning algorithms. We can also use techniques such as dimensionality reduction and data preprocessing to improve the quality of the data used to train the models. Additionally, we can use techniques such as active learning and transfer learning to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the training process.","277":"You're absolutely right, a wiring diagram is just the first step, and we need to consider the properties of the connections, like the strength of the connections, the speed of the connections, the directionality of the connections, and so on, to get a more complete picture of the brain's function.","278":"I'm still thinking about the analogy between the brain and the music sheet, but I think the brain is so much more complex that it's almost impossible to map out.","279":"No, I've actually transitioned to doing more fMRI and diffusion tensor imaging to study the brain's white matter connections.","280":"Hi, it's been a while since we last spoke. I see you're still interested in lasers, how can I help?","281":"I'm sure you'll get back to it, but for now, let's talk about the laser research you did at Rochester.","282":"you will have to find a way to amplify the electron beam's energy to beat the Schwinger limit without violating causality.","283":"You can't cheat with laser accelerating for a long time, the gain is very small.","284":"I remember when laser was first demonstrated 1960, what could we do with this? We already got light. Now we can't live without lasers. My cell phone, that is in my pocket, has billions of transistors. How is that made? With lasers. All of the greatest circuitry is done with lasers. Actually now it's using x-rays, made from laser heated matter. That came out of the laser fusion program.","285":"You're saying that the hackers were able to get in through the meat scale, which was connected to the network, and then use that as a pivot point to get into the rest of the network, right?","286":"Okay, so a buffer overflow is when you have a program that is designed to take a certain amount of input, but then you give it more input than it is designed to handle, and that can cause the program to write data outside of the area of memory that it is supposed to use, and that can cause the program to crash, or it can allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code, which is a way of saying that they can basically do whatever they want with the system.","287":"You're trying to get the program to execute arbitrary code, right?","288":"It's a fundamental concept in computer security, and it's really the foundation of a lot of the work that I do, especially in terms of network security and designing software for penetration testing.","289":"I'm really interested in the intersection of international relations and cybersecurity, and how countries use technology as a tool for power and influence. I've been reading a lot about the history of cyber warfare and how it's evolved over time, and I think it's really fascinating.","290":"But that's a really interesting dynamic, because on the one hand, you have the state department, which is trying to help people in other countries get around censorship, and on the other hand, you have the NSA, which is trying to break that same system. It's a very interesting example of how the US government is actually funding and supporting both sides of this struggle.","291":"What's a laser?","292":"Why do you think that is?","293":"Is the laser's tiny dot stronger than the flashlight's big shine?","294":"And that's why we can use them to send messages over long distances, like the internet.","295":"You can actually see it go around the corner and hit the wall behind the corner.","296":"seen a laser before, but never like this.","297":"And that's because the laser is producing a red light too, which is why you see the red light when you shine the laser.","298":"Have you ever seen a laser light show?","299":"I was reading it in the context of a class on computer security, and the professor was saying that it's a good example of how a seemingly innocuous piece of hardware can be exploited in a really clever way. I was thinking about how it relates to side channel analysis, and I'm not sure if it's directly relevant, but I thought it was an interesting example of how physical properties of a system can be used to attack it.","300":"This is the missing part of the dialogue.","301":"I think that's a really important distinction to make, and it's something that we should be talking about more in this class.","302":"I think a lot of people in the security community would actually be very upset if that were to happen, because they feel like their work is already being stymied by the fact that we can't share our knowledge and our findings with the public, so if they were to pass a law that actually criminalized it, I think you'd see a lot of people either stop doing this kind of work or find ways to get around it, which would be really bad.","303":"I think that's a good point, but what about the potential for people to misuse this information? Maybe it's not about hurting anyone directly, but about creating a vulnerability that could be exploited by malicious actors?","304":"I mean, it's not like I'm going to do it for malicious purposes, but if I wanted to, I could, and that's the point.","305":"And what about with blockchain, do you think that's something that could replace some of those middlemen?","306":"You're saying that instead of banks and other middlemen, we could use this network of computers to make and verify transactions?","307":"It uses a kind of decentralized ledger, which is a record of all the trades that have happened, and it's not controlled by any one company. It's controlled by a network of computers that are all connected to each other.","308":"Each transaction is encrypted, and each computer on the network has a unique key to decrypt it, so only the computers that are supposed to see the transaction can see it. And if one computer tries to cheat, the other computers will notice and they'll reject the transaction.","309":"The way it works is that each block contains a list of transactions that have taken place, and once a block is added to the chain, it can't be altered or deleted.","310":"You're an engineering physics major with a minor in math. I'm in the three, two program for biomedical engineering.","311":"So what made you interested in lasers? Do you have any particular application in mind that you're interested in, or is it more just the physics behind them?","312":"Chirped pulse amplification is a way of making a laser that can be both high power and short pulse. It works by taking a very long pulse and then stretching it out in time, so that it's very low power, and then amplifying it. And then you take that amplified low power pulse and compress it back down to a short pulse. So, you're taking a long, low power pulse and compressing it down to a short, high power pulse. That way, you can make a laser that's both high power and short pulse.","313":"Yes, it's the same premise. We're just using a different method to get there. Instead of focusing all the light at once, we're spreading it out over time with the chirp, and then compressing it back down to a short pulse. The idea is the same, but the approach is different.","314":"The pendant is actually a diagram of a mode locker, and it shows how the different colors of light interact with each other. If you look closely, you'll see how the red and blue lines intersect and cancel each other out, creating a shorter pulse. It's a really cool visual representation of the concept we were just discussing.","315":"when I was a violinist as well--","316":"you would hear the same chord but the melody would be different","317":"I think a lot of people get stuck in this mindset because they're not thinking about the relationships between the notes and the chord, they're just trying to add more notes to make it sound more interesting.","318":"If I invert the third of the triad, I get this.","319":"and the chord is F major 7, flat 5, sharp 11","320":"I know, I know, it's a lot to take in. I've been practicing my chord progressions for weeks and I'm starting to lose my mind.","321":"You're talking about negative harmony, the dark side.","322":"Because the dominant chord in A major is D major, which is very bright and cheerful, but the dominant chord in F major is C major, which is more subdued and melancholic.","323":"You're saying that when the harmony changes from major to minor, the mood changes, like a sudden change in weather.","324":"So, the connectome is like a map of all the connections between neurons in your brain, and it's unique to each person.","325":"That's true, but what if we could create a computer that was just like a human brain, with feelings and everything? Would that be you too?","326":"I think that's what the connectome is trying to get at, a map of the neural connections, but also the temporal dynamics of the connections.","327":"You can't even tell if I'm telling the truth or not, can you?","328":"Suppose you wanted to exchange messages with someone that you knew, and you wanted to prove to them that you know the combination to a safe without actually telling them what the combination is. You could do this with a zero-knowledge proof, where you give them a proof that you know the combination without giving them any information about what the combination is. This way, you can convince them that you know the combination without putting the combination at risk of being stolen.","329":"You wanted to exchange messages with someone that you knew, but you also wanted to keep the content of the messages secret from everyone else.","330":"You're saying that someone can prove a fact without revealing how they know it?","331":"That's the power of memory, it's not just about recalling the past but also how it shapes our present and future decisions. It's like our brain is constantly updating and refining our understanding of the world through these memories. ","332":"That's really interesting, because I think that's something that I've experienced in my own life, is that certain memories have been kind of stuck with me and have influenced my decisions in ways that I wasn't even aware of. And I think that's one of the things that's really fascinating about memory is how it can shape our identities and our choices in ways that are both conscious and unconscious.","333":"That's actually a big part of my research, trying to understand how these boundaries are blurred. I think there's a lot of evidence that suggests that even what we consider to be conscious memories have components that are not accessible to us. And I'm interested in how those components influence our behavior and decisions.","334":"Yes, we are seeing some differences in connectivity, for example, when you're learning a skill, you're seeing more activity in the striatum and the prefrontal cortex, and less activity in the hippocampus. But when you're forming an episodic memory, you're seeing the opposite pattern. So, it's not a simple on\/off switch, it's more like a complex interplay between different brain regions.","335":"And I think that's what's so fascinating about Proust's work - it's not just about the accuracy of memories, but how they can be influenced by our experiences and perceptions.","336":"What do you like about math, do you like solving puzzles?","337":"That's exactly what a zero-knowledge proof is - you don't know how I know where the puffin is, but you know I do, and that's a pretty cool thing.","338":"Now you know where the puffin is, right?","339":"I want to study zero-knowledge proof so that we can make sure our online accounts are really secure and our information stays private.","340":"But if the computer had a zero-knowledge proof system, you could prove to the computer that you know your password without telling the computer what your password is.","341":"So you could just be like, 'Hey, I'm Chelsea, I'm 10 years old, and I'm in 5th grade,' and they would know it's true, but they wouldn't know how you knew it was true.","342":"You seem to be suggesting that infinity is a quantity that can be treated as if it were a number, with the usual rules of arithmetic applying to it, but that's not the case, is it?","343":"What if we had a second guest?","344":"They can't live together because there's not enough space, right?","345":"Then you're moving the person from room two to room four, so the number of the room is increasing by two each time.","346":"Infinity is often thought of as a huge number, but in mathematics, it's more about the concept of something having no end. Hilbert's Hotel helps to illustrate this by showing how you can add an infinite number of new guests to a hotel that's already fully booked, without having to move any of the existing guests. It's a mind-bending concept that challenges our intuitive understanding of numbers and space.","347":"So, I was wondering if you've ever thought about the idea that maybe, like, artificial intelligence could surpass human intelligence in some way?","348":"coordinates would be like, a very narrow and specific thing, like the x and y coordinates of a specific spot on a table, whereas the robot needs to be able to generalize to any point in space.","349":"I think that's the most complicated thing for a robot to learn, is motion, because it's one of the most complex and nuanced things that humans can do, and it's something that we take for granted.","350":"I think it's a combination of both. We don't have enough data, and the way we've been collecting it hasn't been very effective for robotics.","351":"The Mandelbrot set is actually defined recursively as well. But I think what you might be getting at is the way that we define a fractal in terms of its Hausdorff dimension. Do you know what the Hausdorff dimension is? ","352":"I mean, it's a good example of how the fractal dimension can be different from the topological dimension, right? So, the topological dimension is two, but the fractal dimension is something else entirely.","353":null,"354":"This is the missing part","355":"That's right, the coastline of Great Britain is a classic example of a fractal, and it has a fractal dimension that's greater than 1, which means that it has more complexity and detail than a straight line.","356":"And how does this relate to the idea that fractals have a self-similar structure? Is it because the coastline is made up of smaller versions of itself?","357":"Right, and I think it was Perlin's work that helped to popularize the concept of fractals in computer graphics, but the actual math behind fractals was developed a long time ago by people like Mandelbrot.","358":"You were just telling it to move to a certain location, right?","359":"a binary number like 0110 or 1011","360":"So, with quantum computers, we can have these special quarters that can be spinning at the same time, and it's like, how many heads or tails can you have at the same time? That's kind of like how quantum computers can do lots of calculations at the same time, which makes them super powerful.","361":"I've been trying to figure out a good example for you, something that's simple enough to understand, but still illustrates the core concept.","362":"So let's say you have a bank account, and I want to prove to you that I have at least 0.2 Bitcoins in my bank account, without revealing what the bank account is.","363":"And then you have to ask me, do these two countries share the same color? And if I say yes, you have to pick another pair of neighboring countries. And you have to ask me, do these two countries share the same color? And if I say no, then you can be pretty confident that it's a valid coloring. But here's the thing: I'm not actually going to tell you what the color is. I'm just going to tell you whether the two countries share the same color or not.","364":"To turn this into a zero-knowledge proof, we would use a cryptographic protocol that allows you to prove the statement is true without revealing any information about the statement itself. This could involve using a commitment scheme, where you commit to the statement without revealing its value, and then prove that the statement is true without revealing the statement.","365":"And just like how you can't see the color of the country I'm thinking of, I want to prove to you that I know the color without revealing what it is.","366":"What's the connection between the two, though?","367":"because the new colors are different.","368":"I think they're supposed to be like, more practical for like, implementation, because they're really, they're like, a protocol, and they're supposed to be like, a tool that you can use to like, prove something, without actually having to like, prove it. So, you know, it's like, if you're trying to like, prove that you have a certain piece of information, without actually having to like, give that information away, then zero-knowledge proofs are like, a way to do that. But, like, structurally, they're not supposed to be like, a proof of something, they're just a way to like, prove that you have the information, without actually having to like, give it away.","369":"are really interesting. For example, you can use zero-knowledge proofs to show that you know a secret number without revealing the number itself. It's like proving that you know a password without actually telling anyone what the password is.","370":"And I think that's part of why I was excited to talk to you about this, because I think it's an area where the math and the philosophy really intersect in a really interesting way.","371":"The most fun thing to teach when you teach about infinity, when students realize that you are talking about different sizes of infinity, but then a natural thing is for them to think about what is the next size of infinity that I can think about? And sort of the continuum hypothesis is sort of one of these really hard things to grasp.","372":"You used to play with the pool noodles and then you went to the sandbox and built a sandcastle, and after that you took a nap and then your mom brought you a towel that was blue with white ducks on it.","373":"You're saying that as we get older, our brains get rid of some of the old memories to make space for new ones. Is that how it works?","374":"That's right! And when we experience something new, like cutting ourselves, our brain creates new connections between neurons, which helps us remember what happened. It's like our brain is making a little movie of the event, so we can recall it later.","375":"...","376":"And that's why we can't really measure the length of a fractal because it's always going to be different depending on how closely you look.","377":"I think a planet or an asteroid might be a fractal because it has a surface with a lot of detail at all scales, like mountains and craters.","378":"You see, the more measurements you take, the longer the coastline gets. So if we keep taking more and more measurements, the length of the coastline just keeps getting bigger and bigger.","379":"Exactly! A fractal is a shape that has some repeating pattern, like the way the coastline of Great Britain has bays and inlets that repeat in a similar way. And because of that, it's hard to describe it in a simple way, because it's got so many different parts that are similar to each other.","380":"Hi Namina, how are you today?","381":"So, when we talk about quantum sensing, we're talking about using tiny particles, like atoms or photons, to measure things like temperature, magnetic fields, or even tiny movements. It's like having a super-sensitive ruler that can measure really tiny things, and it's based on some really weird and cool physics that happens at the quantum level.","382":"because the surface is hiding a lot of the interesting stuff","383":"So we're trying to measure what's inside the ball without touching it, without breaking it, and that's what quantum sensing does.","384":"I was working on a project with superconducting qubits and it led me to realize the importance of sensing in quantum systems.","385":"I think it's because you can actually see a single electron in quantum sensing, whereas in imaging large biological objects, you're averaging over a lot of spins. So the resolution is higher in quantum sensing because you can actually see the individual spins.","386":"Yeah, the nitrogen-vacancy center is very close to the surface of the diamond, so you can actually get very close to it.","387":"One of the challenges we face is the impact of noise on our measurements, such as thermal noise, and how we can mitigate it to achieve more accurate results.","388":"such as dephasing, where the phase of the quantum state is affected by the fluctuations.","389":"And that's a good example of how sometimes the signal and the noise can be very similar, and it's hard to tell them apart.","390":"But what I'm trying to get at is that the quantum noise that's inherent to your system is very much tied to the underlying physics of the system itself.","391":"This is a sentence.","392":"I think that's a good question, and I think that's something that we've been looking at, because the more spins you have, the more complicated the dynamics becomes, but it's also potentially more powerful.","393":"because of the quantum sensing community that's been building over the last 10 years, I think we're gonna see a lot of new applications come out of this.","394":"Explainer: I see. And what are some of the most significant challenges in quantum computing that you think are not well understood by the general public?","395":"The thing that's really interesting about quantum computing is that we're not just trying to build a machine that's faster than a classical machine, we're trying to build a machine that can do things that a classical machine can't do at all.","396":"And it's not just the number of qubits, it's also the complexity of the algorithms and the control over the quantum states that's a huge challenge. We're still in the early days of understanding how to scale up our systems without losing coherence.","397":"But isn't Shor's algorithm a bit of a showstopper? I mean, if someone were to build a large enough quantum computer, wouldn't that be a problem for encryption?","398":"And the reason we can get that level of detail is because of recursion, because we can just keep breaking it down into smaller and smaller pieces, and that's what allows us to get that kind of level of detail in the first place.","399":"You're saying that recursion is a way of describing things that repeat themselves, right? So, like, a tree with branches and leaves. If I draw the tree, I can also draw the branches, and if I draw the branches, I can also draw the leaves. And then I can also draw the smaller branches and leaves. And so on. Is that kind of what you're getting at?","400":"Subdivision surfaces are a way to approximate a smooth surface with a bunch of triangles. So if you take a triangle and then subdivide it into four smaller triangles, you can get a pretty smooth curve. It's kind of like how we're subdividing the square to get a Koch curve.","401":"This is to show how subdivision surfaces are used to create smooth shapes in computer graphics, rather than fractals.","402":"It depends on the complexity of the fractal. For example, the Mandelbrot set is very simple, but the Julia set can be very complex. It can take hours or even days to render a high-resolution image of a complex fractal. Additionally, the process of subdividing the surface into smaller triangles can also be time-consuming, especially if the surface is very detailed or has many curved sections.","403":"One of the things that's really interesting to me is that, fractals have a lot of applications, but they're not very well understood, and they're not very well taught. So, one of the things that I think is really interesting is that, fractals are not just used for computer graphics, they're used in all sorts of other fields, like physics, and engineering, and mathematics, and even in finance. But, I think one of the biggest challenges right now is that, fractals are not very well understood, and they're not very well taught. So, one of the things that I think is really interesting is that, fractals are not just used for computer graphics, they're used in all sorts of other fields, like physics, and engineering, and mathematics, and even in finance.","404":"So ARPANET was a project that started in the 1960s, and it was a network of computers that was designed to be able to communicate with each other.","405":"Packet switching would enable the data to be broken into small packets and routed through the network independently, allowing for more efficient use of bandwidth and greater network reliability.","406":"And that's the idea behind the TCP\/IP protocol, which is the protocol that governs how data is transmitted over the internet, right? It's the reason why packets can be routed around failures, and it's the reason why you can have a request response type of structure.","407":"You're right, abstraction is a huge part of it. I mean, if you think about it, the people who built the internet were really clever to create a system that's so flexible and adaptable, but also so hard to understand. And that's because they were thinking about the applications that would be built on top of it, rather than just the infrastructure itself.","408":"Wi-Fi 6 is the latest standard, and it's already available, but the next one, Wi-Fi 7, is in the works, and it's expected to have a much faster speed, but I'm not sure when it will be widely adopted.","409":"How do they get routed, and what determines their path?","410":"I'm studying quantum sensing, which is a field that uses quantum systems to measure properties of the environment, like magnetic fields or temperatures.","411":"Yes, we are studying the electron spins in diamond, which have some unique properties that make them suitable for quantum sensing applications. Specifically, the nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond have a spin that can be manipulated and measured at room temperature, which is a big advantage over other quantum systems that typically require cryogenic temperatures.","412":"Is that what you're talking about with the quantum sensing, like using the nitrogen-vacancy centers to create a superposition?","413":"Exactly. You're taking this quantum system that's in a superposition, and you're putting it out into the world where it's interacting with all these different things. And that interaction is what's going to cause it to lose its quantum properties, but it's also what's going to tell you something about the world.","414":"You can entangle two or more qubits so that the state of one qubit is correlated with the state of the other qubits, and that allows you to make a more sensitive measurement of the environment.","415":"Actually, yes, an atomic clock can be considered a quantum sensor because it relies on the principles of quantum mechanics to achieve its high precision. Specifically, it uses the transition between two energy levels of an atom to measure time, which is a quantum phenomenon. This precision is what makes it so useful for applications like GPS.","416":"And that's exactly what researchers in quantum sensing are working on. They're trying to develop new technologies that can make atomic clocks even more precise, potentially by using quantum effects like entanglement or superposition to reduce errors and improve accuracy.","417":"Where does the internet actually start and end?","418":"You have your local network in your house, which is like a neighborhood road, and that connects to your internet service provider's network, which is like the state road, and that connects to the city network, which is like the Interstate Highway System.","419":"There are lots of undersea cables that crisscross the ocean, but there are also satellites that can bounce signals from one place to another. So it's not just the cables that make it work, it's a combination of both.","420":"Yes, there are underseas cables. They're like really big, thick cables that go across the ocean floor, and they're used to carry internet traffic between continents. They're made up of thousands of individual fibers, and each fiber can carry a huge amount of data. They're really important for connecting the world's networks together.","421":"You connect wirelessly using Wi-Fi or cellular networks, like 3G or 4G. And these wireless connections are actually connected to the undersea cables through routers and switches. These routers and switches are like big traffic lights that direct the data packets to the right places.","422":"The answer to your question is that all the movies and TV shows are stored on a lot of different servers, which are computers that store lots of data. When you request a movie or a TV show from Netflix, it sends a request to the server that has that particular movie or TV show. The server then sends the movie or TV show back to your device over the internet. This is why it seems like all the movies and TV shows are in one spot, even though they're actually stored on many different servers all over the world.","423":"Well, when you open Netflix on your device, it sends a request to a Domain Name System (DNS) server, which translates the Netflix domain name into the IP address of a server that's close to you. This process is usually handled by your internet service provider (ISP) or a specialized service like OpenDNS. The device then connects to this server, and the server streams the content to your device.","424":"What do you mean by'same size' when you're talking about infinite sets?","425":"And then you'd match negative two with three, negative three with five, and so on, right? And you'd see that all the negative integers are being matched with odd numbers, while all the positive integers are being matched with even numbers.","426":"I'm not sure I follow the pattern yet. Can you explain why you're labeling the dots in that particular order?","427":"I think that's the trick, that's what you're getting at. You're saying that we can map the rational numbers to the natural numbers in such a way that each rational number is represented by a unique natural number, right?","428":"And the reason we're doing this is that the set of pairs of integers is countably infinite, and if we can show that the rational numbers are also countably infinite, then we'll have shown that they have the same size of infinity.","429":"It's just that we're counting in a way that's not immediately obvious. We're counting all of the pairs of integers, and for each pair of integers, we're counting all of the pairs of pairs of integers, and so on. And that's why 3\/2 shows up as 25. It's not that 3\/2 is a particularly large or small rational number, it's just that the way we're counting them is what's making it show up at that particular spot.","430":"You're saying that the size of infinity of the natural numbers is the same as the size of infinity of the rational numbers, but then you're also saying that the size of infinity of the rational numbers is smaller than the size of infinity of the real numbers. How does that work?","431":"You can just add one to any real number, and that will be a number that's not on the list.","432":"And you've already convinced yourself that if we keep going, we'll never run out of possible numbers that are different from the ones on the list.","433":"So, I guess my question is, does this mean that some real numbers are inherently unknowable?","434":"This is a good question, and the answer is that it has a lot of interesting consequences in various areas of mathematics and computer science. For example, in computer science, we can use these ideas to study the complexity of algorithms and the limits of computation. In mathematics, we can use these ideas to study the properties of mathematical structures, like groups and rings. But one of the most interesting areas where these ideas have practical implications is in the study of randomness and pseudorandomness.","435":"So, let me explain how it works. Quantum computers use qubits, which are the quantum equivalent of bits. Qubits can exist in multiple states at the same time, which allows them to process a vast number of possibilities simultaneously. This is known as superposition. Additionally, qubits can be entangled, meaning their properties are connected even when separated by large distances. This allows for quantum computers to perform certain calculations much faster than classical computers.","436":"They work by using noise-cancelling microphones that detect ambient noise and then produce a 'negative' sound wave to cancel it out.","437":"it's a perfect question i mean it's very early for quantum computing but we're building assembly languages we're building layers of abstraction that are going to get you to a point as a programmer where you can interchangeably be programming something the way that you already do and then make calls to a quantum computer so that you can bring it in when it makes sense we're not envisioning quantum computers completely replacing classical computers anytime soon we think that quantum computing is going to be used to accelerate the kinds of things that are really hard for for classical machines","438":"You could think of it like a different programming language, one that's more based on the principles of quantum mechanics, where you're not just writing a series of steps for a computer to follow, but rather you're trying to capture the essence of the problem you're trying to solve in a way that's more intuitive and more connected to the underlying physics of the system.","439":"Would you need to rewrite your entire program, or would there be some way to integrate quantum computing into existing code?","440":"and that's what we're talking about.","441":"How does a star get heavy enough to become a black hole?","442":"And it gets smaller and smaller and smaller, until it's almost like a tiny dot, and that's when it forms a black hole.","443":"because it gets sucked in by the gravity, even though it's really far away","444":"because the chair would be moving on its own, and that's not how things work in our everyday experience.","445":"I'm doing research on set theory. I'm looking at this concept called the axiom of choice, which allows you to choose one element from each set in a collection of sets.","446":"I'm not sure, but I think it's also used in the proof of the Banach-Tarski paradox, right?","447":"It's kind of a mind blower when you first hear about it, because you realize that every subset of real numbers has a choice function.","448":"Your answer goes here","449":"So, it makes sense that you'd want to manage the complexity of managing them to be pretty flat, even as you're adding more devices, because the amount of data they're transmitting is relatively small.","450":null,"451":"that zero-knowledge proofs were a way of proving something was true without revealing the proof itself, which was a fundamental insight that was later built upon by others.","452":"So, in essence, they're proving a statement is true without revealing the underlying data, which is a fundamental aspect of zero-knowledge proofs.","453":"Zero-knowledge programs ensure the privacy of computations by using cryptographic techniques to verify that the computation was done correctly without revealing any information about the inputs or the result.","454":"you have a good understanding of how zero-knowledge proofs work in the context of a blockchain ledger.","455":"And I think the real challenge is to make it more accessible and to make it more usable in real-world applications, because right now it's still a bit of a niche area.","456":"What do you think about the prevailing idea that the Large Magellanic Cloud doesn't have a big black hole?","457":"I've been trying to wrap my head around the idea of supermassive black holes in the centers of galaxies, and it seems like the prevailing theory is that they form through the merger of smaller black holes, but I'm not sure if that's still widely accepted.","458":"Well, the merger scenario is actually a very popular one in the field. We have simulations that show how mergers can lead to the growth of supermassive black holes, but the problem is that even with these mergers, it's hard to get to the masses we're talking about in a timescale that's consistent with the universe's age. So, it's not a straightforward answer, but it's definitely an area of active research and debate.","459":"I mean, we do learn about it, but it's always in the context of a massive star collapsing, and that's the only way we're taught that black holes are made.","460":"I think that's a fascinating topic, but I'm more curious about the supermassive black hole in the center of our galaxy, Sagittarius A*.","461":"We've been working on a new project to use the accretion disk of a black hole to generate power, and it's been surprisingly promising. The idea is to use the heat generated by the disk to create a kind of thermoelectric effect, which could potentially be used to generate electricity. It's still in its early stages, but if it pans out, it could be a game-changer for our understanding of black holes and their potential applications.","462":"But the thing is, even if we could harness the energy of a black hole, it would be completely impractical and not worth it, because the energy would be coming in a form that would be extremely difficult to control and convert into a usable form, not to mention the enormous engineering challenges of even approaching a black hole.","463":"and that's a physical process that's limited by the laws of physics, so it's not like you can just make the hard drive faster by adding more bits","464":"we do that by applying a sequence of quantum gates that are the quantum analogues of the classical logical gates","465":"in a superposition of up and down, which is kind of a fundamental feature of quantum mechanics that we're trying to exploit in our quantum computer.","466":"we use a process called quantum encoding which involves preparing the qubits in a specific quantum state","467":"I was going to say that the algorithms are actually quite simple, but they require an enormous number of operations to be performed on a quantum computer.","468":"For example, would we use a quantum computer to speed up simulations of complex chemical reactions or would we use it to do some kind of machine learning?","469":"Yeah, that's right. One of the main challenges is actually understanding how to implement these algorithms in a way that's fault-tolerant. We're working on developing new techniques for error correction, but it's a really hard problem. We could definitely use some help from people with a strong background in quantum information theory or computer science. If you're interested, I'd be happy to chat more about it and see if there's a project that you could work on.","470":"I think one of the biggest challenges is dealing with non-rigid deformable objects like tofu, which can crumble. What are your thoughts on which algorithms are most promising for handling these kinds of objects?","471":"How about the role of feedback in learning, do you think that's a key factor in improving the efficiency of robot learning?","472":"I think one promising direction is to actually use data from real-world experiments, and then try to match that data in our simulators, rather than relying on first principles, which is a more traditional approach.","473":"So a fractal is a shape that repeats itself over and over again, like a never-ending pattern.","474":"The computer can then use this rule to draw the tree by starting with a main branch and splitting it into two smaller branches, which can then be split into even smaller branches, and so on.","475":null,"476":"But one of the reasons why it's not happening more is that it's very difficult to coordinate between different providers, right? You have to agree on standards, you have to agree on how to manage the network, you have to agree on how to handle failures, and so on.","477":"You're saying that the internet is sort of like a post office where letters are sent and received, but in this case, the letters are encrypted, right?","478":"I think that's a very good point, and it's also what's enabling this whole notion of edge computing, where you can have the compute resources really close to the endpoint, rather than in some central location.","479":"You're studying physics, so I'm guessing you've had some exposure to general relativity. I'm curious to know, have you had any courses that deal with the theory of black holes?","480":"So the core of the star is collapsing and where it goes nobody knows. It leaves behind the event horizon, kind of like an archeological record.","481":"What's the relationship between black holes and singularities, and how does that relate to quantum mechanics?","482":"I was going to say that as you approach the event horizon, space and time become so distorted that it's hard to even talk about them in a meaningful way. It's like the fabric of spacetime is getting severely stretched and curved. I think that's what you were getting at with the rotation of time, right? The way that time becomes a direction in space as you approach the event horizon.","483":"So, the reason we think the singularity might not form is because of quantum mechanics. When you try to apply quantum mechanics to the very small distances and high energies near a singularity, it suggests that the laws of physics as we know them start to break down, and it's possible that the singularity is actually avoided or smoothed out in some way.","484":"This is a possible continuation of the conversation.","485":"that's what the Event Horizon Telescope has been trying to do, and it's actually been able to image the event horizon of a black hole, which is a pretty remarkable achievement, but it's still a very different thing from watching the merger of two black holes, which would be an even more spectacular observation.","486":"I think that's a great way to put it. I think that's what I like about the field. It's like, you can see all these different threads of research coming together in this one big tapestry. And I think that's what makes it so exciting.","487":"Exactly. And I think that's because, when you're trying to prove that you know something, you're not trying to prove that you know it in a way that's going to be useful to anyone else. You're just trying to prove it to yourself, so you don't need to do a lot of work to do that. But when you flip that around and you're trying to prove that you don't know something, you have to do a lot of work to make sure that you're not accidentally revealing something that you do know.","488":"and help bridge the gap between users and the companies that are storing their data, because right now that's a huge issue.","489":"So, let's think about how memory might play a role in that decision. Maybe you had a certain expectation about what pixie sticks would be like, and then you tried them and they were different from what you expected. How do you think that might have influenced your decision?","490":"So, when you thought about pixie sticks, what were some of the things that came to mind about them?","491":"So what's going through your mind when you're deciding between those two options?","492":"Well, research says that preferences are not fixed, and they can change over time, and they can change based on your experiences and your environment.","493":"So, do you think it's just a tool or is it something more than that?","494":"Do you know how the internet works?","495":"Maybe the internet is like a bunch of roads, and each one of these lines is a road, and there are lots of roads that go between places, so if one road is blocked, the internet can just use a different road instead.","496":"And if you have multiple paths, you can keep going even if one of them stops working.","497":"because all of them connect to the same network","498":"What does that look like in terms of the configuration of a circuit, or how does that circuit change over time?","499":"I think the way that you're framing this is really helpful. When you talk about the network system in our mind and brain creating a network model of the world outside, I'm reminded of the idea of a schema. Do you think that's a useful way to think about it, or is there something that you'd like to add to that idea?","500":"I think that's really interesting because it speaks to the idea that memory is not just a repository of information, but it's also a way of navigating the world. And that navigation is not just about moving through physical space, but also about navigating through mental and emotional space. And I think that's where the idea of deleting pieces of information or updating our mental models becomes really important, because it's a way of saying that memory is not just about accumulation, but it's also about pruning and editing and refining our understanding of the world.","501":"And I think this is where the theoretical neuroscience needs to meet the computational neuroscience, because if we can get a good model, we can start to see how memory retrieval actually works, and how it's not just about storing information, but about constructing it on the fly, and that's where the magic happens, and that's where the brain starts to feel alive.","502":"I think that's a great point, and it's a way of getting at the idea that memory isn't just a static repository of information, but it's a dynamic system that's constantly being updated and modified.","503":"You said there are several theories about the universe due to black holes, can you tell me more about that?","504":"Do you want to see how it works?","505":"We know that it's like the black hole that's making this sound because of the way that the waves are behaving, and because we've seen these waves before in simulations of black holes. The shape of the waves is consistent with what we would expect to see if a black hole was merging with another black hole.","506":"That's the really cool thing, and that's why we can tell that they're black holes, because they're so massive and so small that they're affecting the fabric of spacetime in such a way that we can actually see the effects on Earth.","507":"I've been working on building AI systems that can recognize objects, and I have to say, it's a really tough problem. I've been reading a lot about the work of Frank Rosenblatt and his perceptron, and it seems like it's a fundamental challenge in the field of AI.","508":"I think that's one of the things that's most frustrating about this field. You have to be very careful about what you claim your robot can do, because people will immediately start testing the boundaries of what it can do, and if you haven't thought about those boundaries, you're in trouble. It's like, if you say your robot can do one task, people will immediately start asking it to do 10 other tasks that are very similar, but slightly different, and you have to be prepared to say, 'No, it can't do that.'","509":"I think that's a great point, and it's also related to the idea of moravec's paradox, where it's the simple tasks that are actually the hardest for AI to replicate, because they require a level of common sense and world knowledge that is difficult to program into a machine.","510":"I think that's a great point, and it's something that we're starting to explore in our own research. The idea of trying to replicate human experiences, rather than just relying on language models, is a really challenging but potentially rewarding area of study. I think it's going to require a much deeper understanding of how humans perceive and interact with the world, and how we can capture that in a way that's useful for AI systems.","511":"I've been looking into that area of research myself, and it's fascinating to see how our brains can pick up on patterns in social stimuli and use them to make predictions about the world around us.","512":"Speaking of updating the model, I was thinking about how your research on emotional responses might fit into this. It seems like the emotional component could be a key factor in determining which memories get updated and how. Does that resonate with you?","513":"I was going to say something similar to that, that the way we think about memory is often tied to the way we think about decision-making and emotion and how those all interact with each other.","514":"In people with intact brains, you might use a particular process, but if that brain region that subserves that process is damaged, that it's not that you can't do it anymore you just now do it a different way. This is what makes it so hard to study, because it's not that you can just tell people with amnesia not to use their memory, it's that you have to figure out what they're doing instead.","515":"But then there are tasks that are easy for humans but hard for computers, like recognizing objects in a picture.","516":"Now, let's consider a thought experiment: imagine a super-intelligent robot, like a Moravec's robot, that's designed to pick up pennies and put them in the other hand. But this robot is so smart that it can solve any problem in the universe. How would it pick up the penny, and what would it do when it fell on the ground?","517":"So try to pick up the object with your eyes closed and see if you can do it.","518":"For example, think about how you just learned to pick up an object. It's not just a simple action; it involves a lot of complex calculations and understanding of physics and your body's movement.","519":"I don't know, I guess I'm just having trouble understanding how robots can do all these complex calculations but struggle with simple tasks like navigating around furniture or avoiding obstacles.","520":"They don't really know when they've messed up, but they can still learn from feedback.","521":"But, to answer your question, the robot doesn't really see like we do. It doesn't have a sense of vision like we do. It just has a computer program that takes in the numbers from the camera and tries to make sense of them.","522":"Does a robot see in the same way that humans do, or is it more like a computer program processing information?","523":null,"524":"I think it's because the equations that describe these fractals are very simple, but they're also very robust.","525":"You're trying to tell me that it's a fractal because it's got some smaller copies of itself in it?","526":"I think Ken's work, especially his noise functions, really tapped into the fractal nature of natural phenomena, which is why his tools were so effective at creating realistic environments.","527":"I think it means that it's really just something that's infinite, that never ends.","528":"because if we were to count all of them, we'd run out of time and Skittles, right?","529":"Because we can always find more jars, no matter how many we have.","530":"If we could somehow magically put them all in the room, there would still be an infinite number of jars outside the room.","531":"You see, when we talk about infinity, we're not just talking about something that has no end, we're also talking about something that has no beginning. And that can be a little tricky to wrap your head around.","532":"like my camera's autofocus, it's like the computer is guessing where the focus should be, and it's not always right, is that what you mean?","533":"Heads","534":"Think about it like this: when the top is spinning, its quantum state is also spinning, and if we were to entangle two tops, their states would be connected in such a way that if one top's state changes, the other's state changes instantly, no matter the distance between them.","535":"because it's much easier to simulate the behavior of a quantum system using a quantum system than it is to simulate it using a classical system.","536":"Okay, measurements on like what kinds of things?","537":null,"538":"We are starting to look at how we can use them to sense different types of things, like magnetic fields and temperature.","539":"Yes, that's right. The diamond is used as a container for the quantum sensor.

and how does that relate to the brain's default mode network, because that's where our internal experiences, thoughts, and emotions come in.","1":"I think we do know that amphetamines can disrupt the normal progression through the sleep cycle, particularly affecting the slow-wave sleep and REM stages. Research suggests that these drugs can suppress the activity of the ventrolateral preoptic nucleus, which is responsible for promoting sleep, and instead enhance the activity of the arousal-promoting systems. This can lead to a lighter, less restorative sleep, and may even contribute to sleep fragmentation and insomnia in some individuals. However, more studies are needed to fully understand the effects of amphetamines on sleep architecture and to determine the underlying mechanisms.","2":"And so, the amphetamine really is pushing the wake-promoting system, which can make it harder for the sleep system to kick in because it's being pushed in the opposite direction. But what's interesting is that this push-pull dynamic between the wake and sleep systems is not just a simple on-off switch. It's a complex interplay of different neurotransmitters and brain regions, including the ventral lateral pre-optic nucleus, which is a key regulator of sleep and wakefulness. The VLPO, as it's called, releases GABA and galanin, which inhibit the wake-promoting neurons, creating a delicate balance between the two systems. This balance is crucial for maintaining normal sleep-wake cycles, and disruptions to this balance can have significant consequences for our sleep quality and overall health.","3":"Explainer: That's a great point, and it's also worth noting that individual differences in sleep homeostasis can be influenced by a range of factors, including genetics, lifestyle, and environmental factors. For example, people who are prone to sleep deprivation may have a harder time recovering from it due to differences in their sleep-wake homeostasis, which can make them more susceptible to the effects of amphetamines. Additionally, the stage of sleep that is most affected by amphetamines is still not entirely clear, and more research is needed to fully understand how these substances impact our sleep patterns.","4":"How do you typically verify that participants got a good night's sleep before the study, and what's the protocol for dealing with participants who don't get enough sleep?","5":"It's really interesting to explore how our life experiences can shape our creativity and guide us towards new paths, even if we don't always realize it. I mean, think about it, when we're faced with a blank canvas or a new project, our subconscious mind is drawing from all the things we've seen, heard, and experienced, and that can lead to some amazing surprises. I'm reminded of a song I learned from you, Don't Follow the Crowd, where the melody and lyrics seem to come together in a way that's both unexpected and beautiful. It's like our life experiences are the threads that weave together to create something truly unique and meaningful.","6":"I think what you're getting at is that your decisions are driven by a deep sense of intuition, one that's rooted in your life experiences and emotional connections to the music. It's almost as if you're tapping into a personal frequency that guides your choices, and that's what makes them feel so authentic and unexpected.","7":"You mentioned that the chord progression in Don't Follow the Crowd has a unique blend of D flat major and B minor, which creates a captivating sense of tension and resolution.","8":"I'm still trying to wrap my head around how the seventh is interacting with the chord's other components to create its unique timbre.","9":"I asked him, 'What do you think about my analysis of the harmony in this song?' He smiled and said, 'The beauty of harmony lies in the spaces between the notes, not just the notes themselves.'","10":"So, you see what I mean when I say that harmony is not just about chords, but about the subtle balance of frequencies and how they resonate with each other to create a sense of depth and cohesion?","11":"You feel a sense of familiarity, like you're reconnecting with a part of yourself that's been there all along, but somehow, you've forgotten.","12":"You're really making Amazing Grace swing, aren't you? I love how the seventh chords give it a bit of a bluesy feel!","13":"I think the first one has a more melancholic tone, while the second one is more upbeat and energetic.","14":"It has a harmonious quality to it, don't you think?","15":null,"16":"I think you're getting at the idea that these advancements in display technology and VR are making it easier to create more engaging and interactive experiences, which is really cool.","17":"I mean, the technology is advancing at such a rapid pace that it's not only enabling us to bring even the most ambitious ideas to life, but it's also giving creators a whole new level of control and precision in terms of storytelling, character development, and world-building, which is truly exciting.","18":"Machine learning is a type of artificial intelligence that enables machines to learn from data, make decisions, and improve their performance over time without being explicitly programmed.","19":"Would a recommendation system suggest Melanie Martinez to you based on what you've listened to before?","20":"I was thinking maybe it's because the song had a similar tone to her other songs, which often explore themes of nostalgia and vulnerability, and maybe the machine learned that those elements are a common thread in her music.","21":"I think that's a great point about the machine understanding the music. And actually, that relates to how they understand us, because they're using similar patterns and algorithms to analyze our behavior and preferences. For example, if they can identify a song that has a certain tempo or mood, they can use that to inform the types of ads they show us. So, it's not just about the music itself, but how it fits into our larger behavior and preferences.","22":"They use it to learn more about me and my interests, and then use that information to create more personalized experiences, like recommending products or videos that I might enjoy, and also to help them improve their services, like making their algorithms more accurate and efficient.","23":"I think that's a very interesting question. I believe we've made significant progress in teaching machines to perform tasks that we can do, but I also think there are some things that are uniquely human, such as creativity and empathy. Those are still challenging for machines to replicate. On the other hand, machines have the ability to process vast amounts of data quickly and accurately, which is something we can't do.","24":"Actually, a neutron star can become a black hole if it's massive enough that its gravity overcomes the neutron degeneracy pressure, which is the force that holds the neutrons together in the star. This typically happens when a neutron star has a mass greater than about 2-3 solar masses. If that happens, the neutron star collapses under its own gravity, and its gravity becomes so strong that not even light can escape, making it a black hole.","25":"When we talk about what's inside a black hole, we're essentially hitting a conceptual wall, as the laws of physics as we know them start to unravel at the event horizon. It's a bit like trying to describe the color blue to someone who's never seen it \u2013 we can use analogies and metaphors, but ultimately, the experience itself remains elusive.","26":"I'm really stoked about the potential for this research, because it lets us learn about the universe in ways that were previously unimaginable.","27":"However, the supernova origin theory was challenged by the observation of the 3K cosmic microwave background radiation, which suggested that the universe was much hotter in the past, and that many elements were created in the first few minutes after the Big Bang, a process known as Big Bang nucleosynthesis. This discovery changed our understanding of how elements were formed in the universe, and it's now believed that a combination of both supernovae and the Big Bang contributed to the creation of the elements we see today.","28":"I mean, think about it - imagine you're in a video game, and you can move your character left and right, forward and backward, and maybe even jump up and down. That's basically three dimensions, right? But what if I told you that there are more dimensions out there that we can't even imagine? It's mind-blowing stuff!","29":"That's a tricky idea to wrap your head around - can you help me understand what that means in a more concrete way, like with an analogy or an example?","30":"Let me think about this for a second. If we're trying to visualize a 3D space, we could think of it as a 2D space with an extra dimension that's not directly visible. For example, imagine a piece of paper that represents a 2D space. Now, if we were to add a third dimension to that paper, it would be like adding a depth to it, so that objects on the paper could have a height as well as a width. That's kind of what I was trying to draw, but I'm glad we can just talk about it instead.","31":"One reason is that it helps us understand how time dilation and length contraction work. When you're moving really fast, time passes more slowly for you relative to someone who is standing still, and objects appear shorter to you than they would if you were standing still. This is because your motion through spacetime affects how we measure time and space.","32":"So think of it like navigating through a city - you can walk, take the bus, or hop in a car, each one giving you a different perspective on the same place, and similarly, you can move through spacetime in different ways, like hopping on a rocket ship, flying, or even just sitting still, each one altering your experience of time.","33":"I mean, think of it this way: proper time is like a personal clock that each observer has, and it's not the same as the time that would be measured by a clock back on Earth. So, if you were to ask me what time it is on my wristwatch, I'd say it's 3 o'clock, but that wouldn't be the same as the time that would be read on a clock that's been left on Earth. Does that help clarify the difference?","34":"I mean, think of it like GPS navigation. If you want to get from point A to point B on a map, the GPS will often give you the shortest route, but that's not always the most efficient route in terms of time. Sometimes it's better to take a longer route that avoids traffic or construction, right? It's kind of like that with spacetime. The shortest distance between two points in spacetime isn't always the shortest time between them.","35":"Because the one who zoomed out was moving through the 4th dimension, and their experience of time was warped in a way that made it feel like they were experiencing it in fast forward, while the person who stayed behind was stuck in slow motion.","36":"If you imagine a flat sheet, like a tablecloth, and you place a marble on it, it'll roll in a straight line, but if you add something to warp the sheet, like a heavy object, the marble's path will change, and it'll curve or deflect.","37":"Think of spacetime as a trampoline, where the more massive objects, like planets and stars, create dimples that warp its surface. If you place a marble near one of these dimples, it will follow the curvature of the trampoline and move towards the center of the dimple, much like how objects move towards massive bodies in the universe due to gravity.","38":"I mean, isn't harmony what gives melody its soul, making it resonate with us on a deeper level?","39":null,"40":null,"41":"I think compactification is a major hurdle in testing string theory, because if you wanted to measure the size of the extra dimension, you'd need to be at a scale where gravity is super strong, and our current tech can't handle that.","42":"We assume that the universe is infinite in all directions, including the dimensions we can't perceive, and that the large dimensions are a natural consequence of that infinity, but we can't say for sure without more data.","43":"As you approach the brane, the higher dimensions are effectively 'curled up' or compactified, much like the extra dimensions in a black hole, but in a brane, this compactification is typically a result of the energy density and tension in the brane itself.","44":"You're saying that these black branes can be compactified, and that's consistent with our findings in the context of de Sitter space, where we've observed stable, non-singular black brane solutions.","45":"Are these the solutions that minimize the action, or is it just a matter of probability?","46":null,"47":"So, I wanted to make the story of spacetime more accessible and engaging for a wider audience, and I thought a graphic novel would be a great way to do that. It's a visual and narrative journey that explores the mysteries of the universe, and I'm really excited to share it with people who might not have a background in physics or cosmology.","48":"Gravity is the fundamental force that warps space-time, allowing massive objects like Earth to hold onto us and keep us grounded.","49":"And just like how gravity keeps us on the ground, a black hole's gravity is so strong that it warps the fabric of spacetime, making it difficult for anything, including light, to escape once it gets too close.","50":"Can you see me waving my hand over there, even though you're not looking directly at me?","51":"That's an interesting guess, but I'm pretty sure it's three. Am I right?","52":"So I'm guessing that the continuous laser isn't quite the right fit for your specific needs, considering the requirements of your amplification process?","53":"So, what's sparked your interest in high-powered lasers, and how do you think we can apply this technology to push the boundaries of what's possible in your field of optical tweezers?","54":"Well, if we want to target a tumor cell without harming the surrounding tissue, I think a more precise approach would be to use a laser that can be tuned to a specific frequency that would only affect the cell, kind of like a molecular key that unlocks the cell's membrane, allowing us to deliver the treatment directly to the cell without causing collateral damage to the healthy cells nearby. This way, we can be more selective in our approach and minimize the risk of harming the surrounding tissue.","55":"I think that's a great point, and I think one of the things we're trying to figure out is how to balance the technical requirements of a compelling VR experience with the creative possibilities of the medium. As an engineer, I'm always looking for ways to push the boundaries of what's possible, but I also think it's really important to remember that at the end of the day, it's not just about the specs - it's about creating an experience that feels immersive and engaging to the user. And I think that's where the artist and storytelling perspectives come in, to help us understand what makes a VR experience truly special and meaningful.","56":"I see what you mean about embracing low-poly aesthetics and simplicity in virtual reality. That's where I think the question of wisdom comes in - what are the trade-offs between photo-realism and the other benefits that VR can offer, like presence and embodiment? It's not just about achieving photo-realism, but also about what kind of experience we want to create and what kind of impact we want to have on people.","57":"I think we need to focus on making VR more accessible to a wider audience. If we just keep pushing for more powerful hardware, we'll eventually hit a wall. We need to think about how we can make VR lighter, cheaper, and more comfortable for people. That's where optimization and creative thinking come in. We need to find ways to deliver a great experience without breaking the bank or requiring super-powerful hardware.","58":"I think we're still far from being able to do it in real-time, but that's not the only challenge. Another significant hurdle is the need for more sophisticated algorithms that can handle the complexities of human behavior and interactions, which is crucial for creating realistic simulations of people.","59":"I think we need to consider the potential downsides of people spending more time in virtual reality, like how it might affect their mental health, their social skills, and their ability to form meaningful relationships in the real world. ","60":"I've always been fascinated by the concept of dimensions, especially in the context of string theory, and I've read that some theories suggest our universe could have up to 10 dimensions, but I'm not sure how to wrap my head around that idea.","61":"So, we can think of it like this. A line is one dimension, a plane is two dimensions, and three dimensions is like a cube. But, let's say we're not just stopping at three dimensions. What if we were to add another dimension, making it four? How would that change the way we think about these concepts?","62":"For instance, think of a sphere \u2013 imagine you're standing on the surface of the Earth. You could use two numbers, like latitude and longitude, to pinpoint your location, but you'd be missing the third dimension, the height above the surface. That's basically what we mean by an extra dimension \u2013 a new way of describing a location that adds more depth to our understanding of space.","63":"That's right! With distance and angle, we can pinpoint a point in 3D space. It's like having a map with latitude and longitude, but in three dimensions. We can use this to locate planets, stars, and even galaxies in our solar system. For example, if we want to find a specific star in the night sky, we can use its coordinates to figure out exactly where it is relative to our position on Earth.","64":"You\u2019re thinking of the fourth dimension, which is time, right? That\u2019s actually a really interesting idea. How did you come up with that connection?","65":null,"66":"You're thinking of the idea that dimensions are like layers of an onion, with each layer representing a different dimension, and they all fit together.","67":"Exactly, and that's why we need a more comprehensive system that accounts for both the Earth's rotation and revolution, like the geocentric and heliocentric models, which is where celestial coordinates come in \u2013 it's a way to pinpoint locations in the universe with precision, taking into account the Earth's motion and the Sun's position.","68":"You're suggesting that our current understanding of physics might be so limited that we can't rule out the possibility of living in a four-dimensional space, even if it seems counterintuitive?","69":"I think one of the biggest challenges in studying black holes is actually getting accurate data, which is why scientists have been using a network of radio telescopes to form a kind of virtual Earth-sized telescope, allowing them to capture high-resolution images of the black hole at the center of our galaxy. This is a really exciting project, and it's a great example of how scientists are working together to overcome the challenges of studying these mysterious objects.","70":"We've been employing a range of cutting-edge technologies to study black holes, including advanced computational models, such as computational fluid dynamics and machine learning algorithms, to analyze the vast amounts of data from LIGO and other observations. Additionally, we've been leveraging the capabilities of ground-based and space-based telescopes to observe X-ray binaries and other objects that are closely related to black holes. These tools have enabled us to gain a deeper understanding of the complex physics involved in black hole formation and evolution, and to make new discoveries about these enigmatic objects.","71":"That's right, gravity is what keeps us grounded, and it's a fundamental force that affects everything with mass, from the smallest particles to the largest galaxies, making it a crucial aspect of our understanding of the universe.","72":"How does the Earth's size compare to the Moon's in terms of its gravitational pull?","73":"If gravity was much stronger, it would be much harder to stand up or even move around, but it's not about being squished down in the sense that we'd be crushed, rather it's about the increased force making every action more difficult.","74":"Ha ha, I think you're getting off track! But just to answer your question, the fourth grade is around 9-10 years old. Now, let's get back to gravity - did you know that the gravity on Earth is what keeps us grounded, and it's what makes things fall towards the surface?","75":"I've studied the history of science, but I'm curious, what do you think is the most fascinating aspect of the story behind gravity's discovery?","76":null,"77":"Well, it's a famous story, but it's not entirely accurate. The actual story is a bit more complicated, and it's not just about an apple falling on his head. Isaac Newton was a scientist who was deeply interested in the natural world, and he spent a lot of time thinking about the way objects move and fall. He developed his law of universal gravitation, which states that every point mass attracts every other point mass with a force proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them. This idea revolutionized our understanding of the universe and had a huge impact on the development of modern physics.","78":null,"79":"So, what happens when something heavy falls down? Let's say you drop a ball \u2013 it's like it has a mind of its own and just goes down to the ground. That's because of something called gravity, which is like an invisible force that pulls everything towards each other. It's pretty cool, right?","80":"I think it's interesting that you mention the ideal amount of sleep. While six hours might be a commonly cited number, individual sleep needs can vary greatly. It's not just about the quantity of sleep, but also the quality. When we talk about sleep quality, we're referring to factors like how easily we fall asleep, how restful our sleep is, and how refreshed we feel in the morning.","81":"I think sleep plays a crucial role in memory consolidation, and it's well established that sleep deprivation can significantly impair memory recall and learning. During sleep, the brain processes and consolidates memories, transferring information from the hippocampus to the neocortex for long-term storage. This process is thought to occur during the slow-wave sleep stage, particularly during the SWS-1 and SWS-2 stages. Additionally, sleep also helps to eliminate unnecessary neural connections, a process known as synaptic pruning, which refines and strengthens the remaining connections. This process is thought to be mediated by the S-process, which is driven by the homeostatic sleep drive. In essence, sleep helps to refine and strengthen memories, making it easier to learn new information and recall existing ones.","82":"A laser is made up of a combination of materials, including a gain medium, such as a crystal or gas, which amplifies the light, and mirrors that help to confine and direct the beam.","83":"So, think of it like a super-powered magnifying glass. We're not just focusing sunlight, we're taking all that energy and squishing it into a tiny point. That's what makes lasers so incredibly powerful.","84":null,"85":"So it's like, concentrated, but not really concentrated, it's more like... a beam that's been narrowed down.","86":"That's a great point, but what's really interesting is that when you focus light like that, it creates a phenomenon called diffraction, which can actually bend the light around certain objects, allowing it to maintain its intensity and create a sharper beam. Do you think that's something you'd like to explore further?","87":"You were actually ahead of me, exploring the application of X-ray spectroscopy in your research, and I was just starting to grasp the basics of the technique.","88":null,"89":"I mean, think about it, the challenge of observing a black hole from billions of light years away is that we're trying to piece together a distant, obscured object with limited data from various telescopes, each providing a different, incomplete view.","90":"Do you find that you're able to truly unwind and recharge during your sleep, or is it more of a necessary downtime for you?","91":"We're going to delve into the complexities of sleep by examining its various components, including REM and non-REM stages, and explore how they impact our physical and mental well-being.","92":"We can actually tell how much sleep someone's getting by looking at the patterns of their REM and NREM sleep, and we can also tell what their sleep schedule is by analyzing the timing and duration of those sleep stages. For example, we can see if they're getting the right amount of slow-wave sleep, which is a type of NREM sleep, and if they're entering REM sleep at the right time in their sleep cycle. This helps us understand their sleep quality and identify any potential sleep disorders.","93":"So, if you're exposed to screens and stimulating content before bed, it can disrupt your sleep patterns, making it harder to enter deep sleep and REM sleep. That's why it's a good idea to wind down and create a relaxing bedtime routine to signal to your brain that it's time to sleep.","94":"So that makes sense, and it's also why I've noticed that when I'm really stressed or engaged before bed, I often wake up feeling groggy and not as refreshed as I would if I had a good night's sleep.","95":"I have to say, I'm fascinated by the different stages of sleep. I mean, who wouldn't want to explore the depths of their own subconscious mind?","96":"That's fascinating - how do their small size and unique properties impact the behavior of electrons within these materials?","97":null,"98":"You're absolutely right. The 0D refers to the quantum dots because they're essentially a single cluster of atoms, often described as 'artificial atoms' due to their unique properties. Their size and composition make them incredibly versatile, allowing researchers to tune their optical, electrical, and chemical properties for a wide range of applications.","99":"Well, one of the most exciting areas is their use in medical imaging, where they can be used to create high-resolution images of tumors and other diseases. They're also being explored for use in personalized medicine, where they can be used to create targeted therapies that are tailored to an individual's specific genetic profile. Additionally, quantum dots are being used in displays and lighting, where they can be used to create ultra-efficient and ultra-thin displays and lighting systems. And, of course, there are the more speculative applications, such as their potential use in quantum computing and cryptography, which could potentially revolutionize the way we think about data security and encryption.","100":"We're getting close, but it's still in the early stages of development. There's a lot of momentum behind it, though, with significant investments pouring in over the past few years. I'd say we're looking at a timeline of 15 to 25 years before we see widespread industrial adoption, but that's just a rough estimate. The potential applications are really exciting, and it's not hard to imagine a future where this technology is used to create new medical treatments and diagnostic tools.","101":"So you're intrigued by the world of carbon nanotubes? I've spent years exploring their potential, and I'm excited to dive deeper into the specifics of their growth and manipulation. What aspect of nanotube engineering fascinates you the most?","102":"Well, it's a bit like trying to build a Lego tower. You need to control the conditions just right, like the temperature and the chemicals you use, to get the nanotubes to grow with the right diameter. And it's not just about getting it right once, it's about being able to repeat it every time, so that you can make lots of nanotubes with the same properties. It's a tough challenge, but it's also what makes it so exciting!","103":"You're right, silicon has hit a roadblock. That's why scientists are exploring new materials like graphene and nanotubes to take its place.","104":"Yeah, I've come across it in some articles about artificial intelligence, but I'm not really sure what it entails.","105":"I think it's because of their physical characteristics, like dogs having floppy ears and tails, and cats having whiskers and retractable claws. Plus, their behavior and body language are also very different, like dogs wagging their tails to show excitement and cats arching their backs to show fear.","106":"I think we could train the program on a bigger dataset, maybe including more images and descriptions of different animals, to help it learn to recognize more features and make more accurate predictions.","107":"What made you decide to learn about machine learning, and how do you think it's been helping you in your studies?","108":"And that's why we're using these examples to help the machine learn, kind of like how you study for a test by reviewing the material beforehand.","109":"So what if the machine is looking at something it's never seen before, like a picture of a cat it's never seen before, and it's not sure what it is? ","110":"And if you had 10 million examples, would you still be able to answer quickly? Probably not, because with that many examples, you'd need to consider a lot of different factors and it would take more time to process.","111":null,"112":"That's fascinating, but I'm not sure what you mean by 'connected in a special way.' Can you explain more about the connectome and how it works?","113":"You've been doing some interesting work lately. I saw that you published a paper on fault attacks against a certain type of encryption algorithm. What sparked that research?","114":"You mean using fault injection to manipulate the memory, so that the device thinks it's authenticating, but you're actually controlling the outcome?","115":"I think that's really cool, and it's great that people are exploring side-channel attacks, because it's a whole different perspective on security. It's not just about the code, but how the system is actually behaving, and that's where a lot of the interesting stuff is happening. I'd love to hear more about your project on fault injection, though. You mentioned making it more accessible, like an electronics kit. Can you tell me more about that? What's the goal behind it?","116":"I think we're seeing a growing interest in applying formal verification to hardware security, which could help bridge the gap between academia and industry. It's an area that's been gaining traction, and I believe it has the potential to provide a more rigorous and systematic approach to security, which could lead to more robust and secure systems.","117":"I think that's a big part of why hardware hacking is so challenging, because it requires a deep understanding of multiple components and how they interact with each other. It's not just a matter of trying one thing and seeing if it works, but rather it's a process of trial and error, where you have to consider the complex relationships between different parts of the system.","118":"You're saying that a star collapses in on itself because it runs out of fuel and can't support its own weight anymore, which is partially correct, but a more accurate description would be that it's the inward pull of gravity that overcomes the outward pressure of the star's core, causing it to collapse.","119":"I think what's often misunderstood about black holes is that the intense gravity isn't just a sharp boundary, but rather a gradual decrease in gravitational pull as you move further away from the event horizon. It's a bit like the way the air pressure changes as you descend into a deep mine \u2013 it's not a sudden drop, but rather a gradual increase in pressure that becomes extreme only very close to the surface of the black hole.","120":"Actually, there are some movies that do a pretty good job of getting space right. For example, Interstellar does a decent job of getting the physics right, especially when it comes to black holes. It's not perfect, but it's a good start.","121":"I think we've had a similar experience, where the problems that we were working on 10, 11 years ago were very different from the ones we're working on now. But what's striking to me is how the same fundamental questions we were grappling with back then are still relevant today, albeit in different contexts. For instance, how do we balance the benefits of democratization and accessibility with the potential risks of oversimplification and misapplication? And how do we ensure that the tools we're developing are not just powerful, but also responsible and equitable? These are the kinds of questions that continue to keep me up at night, and I'm curious to hear your thoughts on this.","122":"I think one of the biggest challenges is that as machine learning has become more democratized, the complexity of the problems we're trying to solve has increased, but the availability of high-quality, diverse data and the willingness of stakeholders to address the underlying societal issues haven't kept pace. This means we're still grappling with the same issues of bias and fairness, but now we have to deal with them in a more nuanced and multifaceted way.","123":"And so, it's not just about where the data comes from, but also understanding why it looks like that, and what we can't see. We need to think about how we document everything, so others can make sense of it.","124":"I think that's a really astute observation about the bigger picture, and it's not just about being a programmer anymore \u2013 it's about grasping the nuances of the context, the potential consequences, and the broader social implications of what you're building, which can be a complex and multifaceted challenge.","125":"I think we're seeing a significant uptick in adoption across various sectors, but what's striking is the unevenness of it. While healthcare and pharma are making notable strides, industries like finance and retail are still struggling to integrate machine learning effectively. Finance, in particular, is facing a chicken-and-egg problem \u2013 they need high-quality data to train models, but they're not yet sure how to collect and utilize it in a way that's both compliant and impactful. Meanwhile, industries like agriculture and energy are still in the early days of exploring the potential of machine learning, and it's going to take some time for them to catch up.","126":"I think we can make significant progress in the next 5-10 years, but it will require a fundamental shift in how we approach AI research and development. We need to move beyond the current focus on flashy applications and instead prioritize solving real-world problems that have a tangible impact on people's lives. This means investing in research that addresses the complex societal challenges we're facing, such as inequality, climate change, and access to healthcare. It also means developing AI systems that are transparent, explainable, and accountable, so that we can understand how they're making decisions and ensure that they're not perpetuating biases or exacerbating existing social problems. Ultimately, I believe that with a concerted effort from the research community, industry, and education system, we can create a future where AI is a force for good, not just a tool for profit or prestige.","127":"Origami is a captivating art form that has been captivating people for centuries, and its unique blend of simplicity and complexity is what makes it truly mesmerizing. What's remarkable about origami is that it requires an incredible amount of precision and patience, yet the end result can be a breathtakingly beautiful piece of art. From delicate flowers and intricate animals to majestic birds and majestic buildings, origami can be used to create an astonishing array of objects that seem to defy the laws of physics. Not only is origami a visually stunning art form, but it also has a range of cognitive benefits, including improved spatial reasoning, fine motor skills, and even enhanced focus and concentration. As you carefully fold and shape the paper, you'll be exercising your brain and calming your mind, making origami a perfect activity for anyone looking to relax and unwind. The fact that origami can be created from a single sheet of paper is a testament to the ingenuity and creativity of the origami artists, and it's what makes this art form so captivating and addictive.","128":"That's right, no scissors needed, just the art of folding to create these intricate patterns.","129":"Can you make a fold that starts at the dot and doesn't extend all the way to the edge of the paper?","130":null,"131":"If I add another twist to the paper, I can connect the folds in different ways, creating more complex patterns. I can also use a square array of twists to make larger and more intricate tessellations, like this octagonal pattern.","132":"Explainer: A twist is a fundamental building block of tessellations. It's created when the center square of the origami is folded in a way that makes it twist and rotate as you unfold it. This happens because the edges of the square are aligned in a specific way, which allows the twist to occur. It's a really cool effect that's essential to creating tessellations.","133":"A connectome is a way to visualize how different brain regions communicate with each other. Think of it like a network diagram, similar to how you'd map out the connections between cities on a road map.","134":"The connectome is a way to visualize and understand the neural connections in the brain, which is a complex task, but it's being done with the help of advanced imaging techniques like diffusion tensor imaging and functional magnetic resonance imaging.","135":"But the point is, even though computers can only understand binary code, they can still process a huge number of yes or no questions, and if we can figure out how the brain's connections work and how neurons fire, we can teach the computer to do it in a way that's similar to how the brain works, even if it's not thinking exactly the same way.","136":"Yes, the Spitzer Space Telescope helps us understand the overall size and evolution of the accretion disk, but its resolution isn't high enough to reveal the disk's detailed structure. ","137":"So what about the structure of the accretion disk around the black hole, how do you map that out?","138":"We're trying to figure out how to separate the X-ray binaries from the AGN, so we can better understand the properties of the black holes in these low luminosity AGN.","139":"And this goes to the idea that supernovae with black holes don't really blow off any material, it's all just sucked in.","140":"That's a fascinating point. If the matter is compressed to the point where it can't be expelled, what does that say about the role of the black hole in the supernova process?","141":"I think what's really interesting here is that deep learning can be a game-changer, but it's not always the best tool for the job. If you're trying to do something straightforward, like text classification, it might be overkill. But when you're dealing with complex tasks, like understanding the subtleties of a piece of text, deep learning can really help you get to the bottom of things.","142":"And I think that's part of the challenge, because people are trying to build models that can do more than just mimic the patterns they've learned from existing data, but they're still constrained by the same limitations and biases that are present in that data.","143":"I think that's a great point. To get a better sense of the model's bias, we could also use metrics like word embeddings or analyze its performance on a specific test dataset. This would give us a more nuanced understanding of whether the model is perpetuating certain biases and help us make more informed decisions about its use.","144":"However, I was wondering if you could help me understand how these two approaches to gravity, the curvature of space-time and the concept of the graviton, relate to each other in the context of general relativity and quantum mechanics, and whether they can be reconciled or if they're fundamentally incompatible.","145":"And I think that's one of the key challenges in merging quantum mechanics with general relativity \u2013 the former describes the world in terms of discrete particles and wave functions, while the latter presents a smooth, continuous fabric of space-time, making it difficult to reconcile the two theories.","146":"I see what you're getting at, but isn't that a bit like saying that there's a wave function that encompasses all possible universes, with every possible outcome branching off from it, and we just happen to be in the one where the galaxy is there?","147":"I think Hawking's work showed that when you apply the principles of quantum mechanics to a black hole, you get a paradox where it seems like information is lost, but that's not the case. The information is actually preserved, encoded in the Hawking radiation, which is a result of the black hole's temperature and entropy. This has significant implications for our understanding of black hole physics and the interplay between quantum mechanics and gravity.","148":"You're saying that the radiation that comes out of a black hole is a result of the black hole's own thermalization, a process where the information about the matter that fell into it becomes irretrievably lost due to the fundamental laws of quantum mechanics, and that's what Hawking's discovery highlighted, the tension between general relativity and quantum mechanics.","149":"For instance, we're focusing on the macroscopic aspects of spacetime that we can observe and measure in our everyday lives, rather than the more abstract and high-energy phenomena that are relevant in extreme environments like black holes.","150":"So, you're suggesting that the event horizon's properties are not fixed, but rather emerge from the superposition of different states, which is a fundamental aspect of quantum mechanics.","151":null,"152":"If we buy the idea of holography, then that's a pretty compelling argument that our current understanding of information density and storage might be fundamentally limited.","153":"I'll let you unleash your inner artist and create something totally unique, like a futuristic city or a whimsical garden \u2013 the possibilities are endless!","154":"Let's begin with a simple shape, can you show me how to create a basic geometric form?","155":"What's fascinating is that the traditional Japanese art of origami has such a rich history and cultural significance. The fact that the crane design has been around for over 400 years is a testament to the creativity and skill of Japanese artisans who have passed down this craft through generations.","156":"And as you see the edges come together, notice how it starts to take shape \u2013 the pocket begins to form, and it's amazing how a simple fold can create such a defined space. Can you see how it's coming along?","157":"Now it's your turn! Can you give it a try? I'll guide you through it. Remember, the key is to be gentle with the paper so it doesn't tear. Just take it from where I'm holding it, and let's see how it goes.","158":"That's what's so cool about origami, it can transform from one thing into another, kind of like magic!","159":"I've been folding origami since I was a kid, and it's amazing how something so simple can be so versatile. Did you know that origami has been used in all sorts of creative ways, like in engineering and even in space exploration?","160":"I'm really impressed by how simple it can be to create something that looks like a crow!","161":"I think the reason we haven't seen a significant impact yet is that it's still in the early stages of adoption, and there's a lot of education and awareness that needs to happen before it becomes more mainstream. Plus, the complexity of the technology itself is a barrier to widespread adoption, so it's not just a matter of waiting for a certain amount of time to pass \u2013 it's a matter of overcoming some of the technical and societal hurdles that are standing in the way.","162":"I'd say it's even more than that \u2013 the science of blockchain is a multidisciplinary field that combines cryptography, distributed systems, and game theory to create a robust and secure network, and the innovation lies in how we can apply these principles to real-world problems, from supply chain management to voting systems.","163":"It's crazy how deeply ingrained the current system is, and overhauling it would be a massive undertaking, not to mention the cost. We're talking about a system that's already failing us in so many ways, with hundreds of thousands of car deaths each year due to human error. It's a similar problem we'll face with this new tech \u2013 we'll need to develop flexible standards that can adapt to the issues that arise, and we'll need a system that allows us to fix the problems we have today.","164":"I think people often lose sight of the fact that even in the world of autonomous vehicles, we're aiming for a significant reduction in accidents, not a zero-risk scenario. And I think that's a similar challenge we're facing with blockchain \u2013 it's not about eliminating all risks, but about making significant strides towards a safer and more reliable system.","165":"They often use social engineering tactics to manipulate people into divulging sensitive information, or they exploit software vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access.","166":"So they would replace the lock, and they would also give you some guidance on how to secure your new lock, right? Maybe some tips on how to prevent the broken lock from happening again in the future.","167":"That's a great point. In fact, many people who are mistakenly accused of hacking can face serious consequences, including arrest and even prosecution. But what's really interesting is that some organizations are now taking steps to differentiate between good and bad hackers, by implementing more robust security measures and providing better training for law enforcement.","168":"I stumbled upon it by accident, and it was a pretty cool feeling to realize I had that kind of power.","169":"I think it could make a real impact if it's executed well and if people are on board with the idea.","170":"Actually, I think I have a few devices at home that use nanotechnology \u2013 my smartwatch, my headphones, and even my laptop. They all have tiny sensors and processors that help them work smoothly. Does that sound right to you?","171":"I found this tiny Lego brick that's roughly the same size as a transistor, and it's part of a larger circuit board model I built using my kid's old Legos. I'm going to show you how the size of the transistors has decreased over the years by comparing it to some of the other components on this board, like capacitors and resistors.","172":"to fit more and more transistors into a smaller space, and to understand how we're able to make these transistors so small and reliable.","173":"We use specialized equipment and manufacturing processes in these huge factories to create the transistors and then carefully arrange them on a wafer, kind of like building with Legos, but instead of blocks, we're working with tiny, intricate structures that are only a few atoms wide.","174":"It's a type of exchange where people give and receive goods, services, or even ideas, and it's a key part of how economies work, but it's not just about giving up what you want \u2013 it's also about finding mutually beneficial deals that make both parties happy.","175":null,"176":"Well, I'm not sure, but what kind of inputs are you thinking of? Are they like keyboard or mouse inputs?","177":"You're essentially hacking the game to change its behavior, so if you press the space bar, it's not jumping, but instead, it's triggering a different action. It's like you're reprogramming the game to do something entirely new, and that's really cool. I'm curious, what kind of actions have you been able to create by rewiring the game's inputs and outputs?","178":"Yeah, like when you're playing a video game, you might use the mouse to control your character, but if you can use the keyboard to control the game as well, that's an example of how you're controlling an input in a way that wasn't necessarily expected. And that's kind of what happens when hackers try to break into a system - they're trying to find new ways to control the inputs that aren't supposed to be controlled.","179":"Actually, that's a great point about the camera, but I was thinking more along the lines of other senses. For example, can you think of any ways that a computer could be inputted with information through our sense of touch, like a touchscreen or a joystick? Or what about our sense of smell or hearing? Are there any other creative ways that we could interact with a computer beyond just typing on a keyboard or speaking into a microphone?","180":"Well, from what I've learned, hacking typically involves exploiting vulnerabilities in a system or finding ways to bypass security measures. It's not just about breaking into something, but also about understanding how the system works and identifying potential entry points. I've also learned that there are different types of hacking, such as white-hat hacking, which is done for security testing and improvement, and black-hat hacking, which is done for malicious purposes. It's a complex and nuanced topic, and I'm still learning about it.","181":"It can take anywhere from a few seconds to several hours or even days, depending on the system's complexity and security level. I think hacking is really interesting too, and it's amazing how many things can be accessed or manipulated in various ways.","182":"I think of it as a balance between the Earth's gravity pulling the rocket down and our engines pushing it up. ","183":"The gravity is still pulling on it, but it's not actually pulling it down towards the Earth because the object's velocity is great enough to counteract the gravitational force, so it's in a state of continuous free-fall, but its horizontal motion keeps it at a stable altitude.","184":"You know, it's like when you're on a train and it starts moving - you feel like you're just standing still, right? It's pretty wild. The Space Station is moving so fast that it feels like it's just hanging there in space.","185":"So, it's kind of like when you're on the train and you feel like you're not moving, even though the train is actually moving really fast. It's all about how our brains process visual information and create the illusion of motion. When we're on a train, our brains are used to seeing the world outside the window moving, so we feel like we're the ones who are stationary. But the truth is, we're both moving - the train and we are in motion relative to each other and to the outside world.","186":"It's mind-bending, but the key point is that the laws of physics work differently when you're moving at high speeds. The ball still follows a predictable path, but the explanation for why it does so changes. It's not about gravity pulling on you, but about the train's inertia keeping you and the ball together.","187":"You're saying that if she's moving at high speed, she'd see a different speed of light. That's a problem because it would mean the laws of physics aren't the same for both of you.","188":"it helps you feel refreshed and focused, and get ready for all the fun things we're going to do today","189":"I'm curious, do you think that's what makes it so unique, or is it something entirely different?","190":"In order to conserve energy and minimize the risk of predation, giraffes have developed an extraordinary adaptation that allows them to recharge while remaining vigilant, entering a unique state of unihemispheric slow-wave sleep where one half of the brain is in a state of deep relaxation, and the other half remains alert, enabling them to quickly respond to potential threats and resume their activities.","191":"What's that animal you're referring to, and how does its sleep pattern differ from humans?","192":"That's so cool! I've always wondered how dolphins can sleep with their brains still active, half of their brain at a time, while the other half stays awake to keep watch for predators. It's like they have a built-in sleep mode that allows them to rest while still being alert to their surroundings.","193":"I've heard that dolphins sleep in a unique way, but I'm not sure how it works. Can you tell me more about it?","194":"So what do you think the prefix 'nano-' might suggest about something that's really small?","195":"And actually, a nanometer is even smaller than a millimeter, which is a billionth of a meter, so it's a really tiny unit of measurement, but what's interesting is that it's the size of atoms and molecules that make up everything around us, including the air we breathe and the Earth itself.","196":"Yeah, that's cool! If we could manipulate atoms, we could make stuff that's super strong or super light, right? That's like, science fiction come true!","197":"I'm curious, what kind of things do you think you could build with atoms if you could move them around?","198":"I think it's amazing that we can create things that are tiny, like smaller than a grain of rice. That's like magic, right?","199":"You're saying that virtual reality has its roots in Realism, which is an art movement that focused on everyday life, and that's a fascinating connection to make. I'd like to explore this idea further - how do you think Realism's emphasis on the mundane and the ordinary can inform the design of virtual reality experiences that aim to simulate real-world environments and interactions?","200":"I think that's one of the biggest challenges for us, to find that balance between the level of detail and the level of immersion we want to achieve with the current hardware, and the cost and complexity of getting there. It's a delicate balance between pushing the boundaries of what's possible and making it accessible to a wider audience.","201":"I think one of the most interesting aspects of VR is how it challenges our traditional notions of immersion and presence. When we think of immersion, we often think of visual fidelity and resolution, but VR shows us that there's more to it than that. The way VR engages multiple senses, including touch and spatial awareness, is a game-changer. It's not just about rendering a realistic image, but about creating a sense of presence that feels real and tangible. And that's what I think is so exciting about VR - it's not just a new technology, but a new way of experiencing the world, and that's what's going to lead to all the interesting innovations and breakthroughs in the future.","202":"I'm also curious to see how VR's unique storytelling capabilities will influence the narrative structure and pacing of films, and whether it will lead to new forms of interactive storytelling.","203":"Let's revisit that concept of gravity as a force acting at a distance, and how it relates to the idea of a gravitational field that permeates all of space. ","204":"But how does that apply to objects that are not in free fall, like us standing on the surface of the Earth, where the force of gravity is still acting on us, but we don't feel like we're falling because we're not accelerating?","205":"You're falling at the same rate as the elevator, and the question is, what's the difference between this and being on the surface of the Earth, where the elevator is still being pulled towards the ground even though you're both falling together?","206":"I think you're getting sidetracked, though. Let's refocus on gravity and projectiles. What do you think would happen if you threw a projectile straight up into the air on the Earth?","207":"And, yeah, it would probably just make a big crater and create a massive dust cloud, wouldn't it?","208":"And I think that's what hit me - the realization that gravity isn't a force we're pushed around by, but more like the geometry of the universe itself.","209":null,"210":"I mean, it's a pretty mind-bending concept. Imagine you're looking at a piece of paper, and you can move your hand around on that paper. That's like our everyday 3D space, right? But what if there are other directions you could move in, like you're not just moving left and right, up and down, but also in and out of the paper? That's basically what extra dimensions are \u2013 ways of moving or existing that we can't directly experience.","211":"In theories of extra dimensions, compactification is a key concept. Essentially, it means that these extra dimensions are curled up or tiny, so we can't directly observe them. However, they can still influence the behavior of particles and forces in our universe, which is really cool!","212":"So, you're curious about how string theory could help explain the behavior of particles at the quantum level.","213":null,"214":"That's a good starting point, but let me try to clarify. String theory suggests that the fundamental nature of reality is not just particles, but tiny, vibrating strings that give rise to the various particles we observe. This idea attempts to reconcile the principles of quantum mechanics with the phenomenon of gravity, which is notoriously difficult to incorporate into the quantum framework. The concept of vibrating strings is thought to be the key to understanding how gravity behaves at the smallest scales, and it has far-reaching implications for our understanding of the universe's fundamental structure and evolution.","215":"You're suggesting that the concept of extra dimensions originates from string theory's framework, correct?","216":"Think of a tiny, vibrating loop. That's a fundamental building block in string theory.","217":"So, the idea is that the different vibrational modes of the strings correspond to different particles, and the properties of those particles - like mass and charge - are determined by the specific vibrational mode. Think of it like a violin string, where the pitch and tone are determined by how it's plucked, and in string theory, the different particles are like the different notes on the violin. It's a pretty mind-bending idea, but it's a key part of what makes string theory so powerful.","218":"And string theory aims to unify all these forces into a single, elegant equation that could potentially explain everything from the smallest particles to the vast expanse of the universe.","219":"A brane is like a higher dimensional object that vibrates through space, and that vibration is connected to the fundamental units of matter that give rise to different particles.","220":"That's right, and the decentralized nature of blockchain technology is what really sets it apart, allowing for a level of transparency and accountability that's hard to achieve with traditional systems. It's not just about the verification process, but also about the trustless environment it creates, where all parties can agree on the state of the ledger without relying on intermediaries.","221":"<model-generated> With the increasing use of decentralized systems like blockchain, the concept of actors has expanded to include not only humans but also software agents and machines that can autonomously execute transactions and manage data, <\/model-generated>","222":"I think one of the biggest challenges we'll face is scaling, making it fast and efficient for widespread adoption. Also, regulatory clarity would be a huge step forward, helping to alleviate some of the uncertainty and hesitation that's holding back investors and users. And then there's the issue of interoperability, getting different blockchain systems to work together seamlessly. If we can tackle these challenges, I think we'll see a significant shift in the industry and more people will start to see the potential of blockchain beyond just Bitcoin.","223":"I think what's really compelling about blockchain is its potential to redefine how we approach trust, value, and information sharing, moving beyond traditional notions and creating new opportunities for decentralized systems.","224":"I think it's interesting that you bring up the idea that it's going to be used everywhere. A lot of people think that's the case, but I think there are going to be some challenges to that. One of the challenges is going to be the scalability issue. Right now, the tech is still pretty early-stage, and we're going to need to figure out ways to make it faster and more efficient if we want it to be widely adopted.","225":"You have to consider the potential changes in material properties, such as increased defects or altered surface chemistry, as you scale up from the lab to large-scale production, which could impact battery performance and efficiency.","226":"Origami's precision and predictable motion make it an ideal model for understanding and replicating the folding and unfolding of thin materials, which is crucial in various applications, such as space deployment and medical devices.","227":"Origami's ability to transform from a flat sheet to a complex shape makes it suitable for applications that require compact storage and deployment, like the origami lamp. Its precision and control also make it useful for robotics and medical devices that need precise movements.","228":"So, it's about scaling up the design, making it adaptable to different sizes, while maintaining its structural integrity, so it can be used for various applications, like the Rover wheel, or even aircraft.","229":null,"230":"So, let's break it down - blockchain is essentially a decentralized digital record book that stores and verifies transactions across a network, right? I'm not sure I explained that very well, but I think that's a good starting point. Can you tell me if that makes sense to you?","231":"That's right, and one of the key advantages of blockchain technology is that it allows for decentralized and transparent transactions, which can help to reduce the risk of counterfeiting and other forms of fraud. For instance, with blockchain-based systems, a product's entire history, from production to sale, can be tracked and verified, making it much harder for counterfeiters to operate. This can be particularly important for industries like pharmaceuticals, where the authenticity of a product is critical to public health.","232":"So, how do we make sure that the person selling the item is legitimate? One way blockchain technology helps with this is by using something called smart contracts. Essentially, these are agreements that are written into code, so they can automatically verify that the item is real and that the seller is who they say they are.","233":"I'm curious, what drew you to the intersection of sleep and neurodegenerative diseases?","234":"I think what's really interesting is the evidence from both animal studies and human research suggesting that sleep disturbances can actually contribute to the development of dementia, rather than just being a consequence of the disease, so it's a two-way street, and understanding this relationship could be key to developing new treatments.","235":"I think what's really interesting about sleep and neurodegeneration is that sleep disturbances are often an early sign of diseases like Alzheimer's and Parkinson's. Research suggests that sleep deprivation can even make these conditions worse, possibly because it allows toxic proteins to build up in the brain. This has important implications for how we think about sleep and brain health.","236":"To create one point, you'd start by folding the paper in half diagonally to create a crease, then open it back up and fold it in half the other way, creating another crease that intersects with the first one. This will give you a clear point where the two creases meet.","237":"I was thinking of a paper airplane because it's a simple, well-known design, but I didn't think about how it relates to the crane's structure. The crane's symmetry and the way it's folded make it a great example of a point being created from a sheet of paper, but I'm not sure how to make a paper airplane out of it. Can you show me how you would fold the paper to create the crane's points?","238":"Now let's see if we can find a way to fold the paper into a spider shape by using the same circle packing technique we used for the crane. We can start by identifying the main features of a spider, such as its legs, abdomen, and head, and then see how we can represent those using circles and points.","239":"I think what I meant to say is that the fifth circle is actually the head of the crane, but I'm not entirely sure, can you help me clarify that?","240":"To get started, let's create a square base, which is the foundation of most origami designs. We'll then proceed to fold the paper into smaller sections, gradually building up to the final shape. The process requires attention to detail and a bit of patience, but with practice, you'll become more comfortable with the folds and be able to create a variety of origami models.","241":"I'm curious to learn more about the process of engineering these viruses to create materials with specific properties. Can you walk me through the steps you take to design and test these new materials, and how you ensure that the viruses are producing the desired outcomes?","242":"And you're using these materials in applications like batteries, solar cells, and semiconductors, where their unique properties can enhance performance or efficiency?","243":"I think one of the challenges is that we need to be able to scale up our processes and materials in a way that's not just environmentally friendly, but also economically viable. If we can't make a material that's both good for the planet and affordable for people to use, then it's not going to have the impact we want it to have. For instance, even if we develop a fantastic new solar panel that's incredibly eco-friendly, if it's too expensive for people to install, it's not going to make a difference. We need to find a balance between sustainability and accessibility.","244":"Origami is actually used to design these compact, deployable structures that can be packed into a rocket, then expand in a controlled way when they reach space, kind of like a magic trick that unfolds in orbit!","245":"For instance, this degree-4 vertex is a fundamental component in origami deployable shapes, allowing us to create complex structures with a high degree of precision and control. By leveraging the properties of this vertex, we can design mechanisms that are not only deployable but also robust and reliable.","246":"Origami-inspired mechanisms, like Origani, play a crucial role in the deployment of space telescopes and solar arrays. These mechanisms allow for the controlled expansion of delicate instruments in space, where even the slightest misalignment could be catastrophic. The precision and reliability of Origani are what make it an essential tool for space exploration.","247":"We'll see how that works as we fold the paper and stick the corners together.","248":"The motion you're describing is actually a key feature of the single degree of freedom mechanism, which is a type of kinematic chain that's often used in origami-inspired robotics and design. The fact that the two folds move at different rates as the angle approaches 90 degrees is a result of the mechanism's geometry and can be used to create complex motion and functionality. Can you tell me more about how you think this mechanism could be applied to real-world problems?","249":"And you'd want it to be something that's very slow, so that it's not like it's unfolding at the same time as the solar panel is deploying, which could cause a control issue, so you'd want to sequence the events carefully.","250":"That's why researchers have been exploring alternative approaches, such as using a combination of different materials or adjusting the folding patterns to achieve a better balance between the two rates. Can you tell me more about the specific challenges you're facing with these structures?","251":"It's a balance between how compact you want the solar array to be and how smoothly you want it to open. If compactness is your priority, the first design might be the better choice. But if you're looking for a more uniform opening motion, the second design could be the way to go.","252":"How does the origami structure compare to the other deployable structure in terms of, say, complexity or cost?","253":"And that's why VR technology can transport you to entirely new worlds, like the blocky landscapes of Minecraft, making the experience feel incredibly immersive and realistic.","254":"You're talking about the way major and minor chords affect the mood of a piece. I've always wondered, how do you think the contrast between those two types of chords influences the listener's emotional response?","255":"It's like a big diagram that helps you understand how chords and keys are connected, so you can see how different chords and keys relate to each other and how they can be used in music.","256":"So let's break this down: if we begin with a G, we can transition to an A and then to a B, is that correct? I want to make sure I grasp the sequence you're proposing.","257":"Let's experiment with a variation that adds some emotional depth to the melody, perhaps by using a mix of major and minor chords to create a sense of contrast.","258":"And what if we add a minor seventh to that chord, to give it a bit of melancholy? That would be B flat, D, F, Ab.","259":null,"260":"It's like, when you drop something, it just falls down, right? And we want to figure out why that happens, so we can understand how the whole world works.","261":"I see what you mean by a line with numbers on it. Can you tell me more about how that line relates to the three-dimensional space we're discussing?","262":"If our line had labels or markers, I'd say where I am by referencing the closest one.","263":"One number isn't enough to capture its essence, is it?","264":"Think of it like a map, where you only need two coordinates to pinpoint a location \u2013 that's essentially what a two-dimensional space is all about.","265":"Okay, so imagine you've got a sheet of paper with a grid on it \u2013 think of it like a graph, but not too complicated. Now, let's say you've got a small mark or a dot on this paper. If you move that dot up or down, it's essentially sliding along the vertical axis \u2013 the Y-axis, to be precise.","266":"We can move left and right in one dimension, up and down in another, and forward and backward in the third.","267":"I'd love to know what led them to that conclusion, and how it might change our understanding of the universe.","268":"That's a great example! So, if I understand correctly, the Gmail program is using machine learning to automatically filter out spam emails by analyzing patterns and characteristics of the emails it's been trained on. But what I'm curious about is, how does it handle emails that are ambiguous or don't fit neatly into one category? Like, what if you receive an email from a friend who occasionally sends you spammy-looking emails, or an email from a company that you've never interacted with before?","269":null,"270":"Well, there are several ways the machine can learn features without human intervention. One approach is to use techniques like autoencoders, which can automatically identify the most relevant features in the data. Another approach is to use feature selection methods, such as mutual information or recursive feature elimination, which can help the machine identify the most informative features. Additionally, we can use techniques like PCA, which can help reduce the dimensionality of the data and identify the most important features.","271":"In terms of the algorithms themselves, supervised learning tends to rely on algorithms that leverage distance metrics, such as k-nearest neighbors, whereas unsupervised learning often employs algorithms that focus on density, like k-means, which seeks to minimize the sum of squared distances between each data point and its cluster centroid, but there are also algorithms like hierarchical clustering and DBSCAN that can be used for density-based clustering, offering a more nuanced approach to understanding the structure of the data.","272":"Reinforcement learning is indeed similar to the kitchen sink approach in that it involves trying many different strategies, but the key difference is that it's guided by feedback, whereas the kitchen sink approach is more of a brute-force approach. Think of it like a game where you're trying to learn the optimal strategy by experimenting and getting feedback on your actions, which is different from the other approaches we've discussed, like deep learning, which relies on large amounts of data and neural networks to make predictions.","273":"That's a great question. In situations where you have a clear understanding of the problem and a large amount of well-structured data, a deep learning algorithm can be a good choice because it can provide accurate predictions or classifications without the need for iterative learning and decision-making. However, if the problem is complex or the data is noisy or limited, a reinforcement learning algorithm might be a better fit, as it can learn from trial and error and adapt to changing circumstances.","274":"If you choose the wrong approach, you might end up with a system that works, but you won't understand why it's working. Imagine trying to fix a car without knowing how the engine works. You might be able to get it to run, but you won't be able to make any improvements or adjustments. Similarly, if you choose a machine learning approach that's not well-suited to the problem, you might get good results, but you won't be able to understand what's driving those results or how to improve them.","275":"I think so, because if a model is accurate but doesn't provide actionable insights, it's like having a crystal ball that shows the future but doesn't offer any guidance on how to change it.","276":"That's a great point. By building an interpretable system on top of the accurate predictions, we can not only improve the reliability of the model but also gain a deeper understanding of the underlying relationships between the features and the target variable. This can be achieved by using techniques such as feature importance, partial dependence plots, and SHAP values to visualize and quantify the contributions of individual features to the model's predictions. Furthermore, we can leverage techniques like model-agnostic explanations and model interpretability techniques to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the model's behavior and decision-making process.","277":"You're right, a wiring diagram is just the starting point. To get a more comprehensive understanding of the brain's function, we need to consider the dynamics of the connections, including synaptic plasticity, the role of glial cells in modulating neural activity, and how environmental factors influence neural development and function. This would give us a more nuanced view of how the brain processes information and stores memories.","278":"I'm still thinking about the analogy between the brain and the music sheet, but I think it's too simplistic. The brain's complexity is a major obstacle to mapping it out, and I'm not sure how to overcome that.","279":"I actually made the switch to fMRI and diffusion tensor imaging a while back, and I've been really fascinated by the insights it's given me into the brain's white matter connections. What about you, are you still working with EM or have you explored other techniques in your research?","280":"Hi, it's been a while since we last spoke. I've been following your work on laser applications in medicine, and I'm impressed. I'd love to hear more about your current projects and how you think lasers will shape the future of healthcare.","281":"I'm sure you'll get back to it, but for now, let's focus on what you've learned from this experience.","282":"we need to think of a way to boost the electron beam's energy without running into causality issues, otherwise we'll be stuck with the Schwinger limit.","283":"You can't cheat with laser accelerating for a long time, the gain is very small, and it's not a sustainable solution. It's more of a theoretical concept that might have some limited applications, but it's not something we can rely on to make significant progress in this field.","284":"I remember when lasers were first demonstrated in 1960, it was a game-changer. We already had light, but lasers enabled us to do so much more. From precision cutting to medical treatments, lasers have revolutionized many industries. And it's not just about the technology itself, but also the impact it's had on our daily lives. My cell phone, for example, relies on lasers to manufacture its tiny components. It's amazing to think about how far we've come.","285":"Actually, I think the breach at Target involved malware that was introduced through a third-party vendor that had access to their network, which allowed the hackers to gain access to their point of sale systems and steal customer data. I've also heard that the malware was able to spread through the network by exploiting vulnerabilities in the systems, rather than just using a single point of entry like a meat scale.","286":"A buffer overflow occurs when a program receives more input than it's designed to handle, causing it to write data into unintended areas of memory. This can lead to a crash or allow an attacker to execute malicious code, essentially gaining unauthorized control over the system.","287":"You're trying to get the program to execute arbitrary code, right? That's what buffer overflows are all about \u2013 executing malicious code that the programmer didn't intend. So, how does this relate to network security and designing software for penetration testing?","288":"Well, buffer overflows are a critical vulnerability that can be exploited to gain unauthorized access to a system, and they're a key aspect of network security and penetration testing. By understanding how buffer overflows work, you can design more secure software and identify potential vulnerabilities in existing systems. In fact, buffer overflows are often used as a teaching tool in cybersecurity training programs to demonstrate the importance of secure coding practices and the potential consequences of insecure coding.","289":"I'm really interested in the intersection of international relations and cybersecurity, and how countries use technology to shape their global influence. I've been reading about the impact of cyber threats on global stability and the role of diplomacy in mitigating these risks.","290":"I think that's a really striking example of the dual nature of the US government's approach to censorship, where you have one arm trying to help people circumvent it, and another arm trying to exploit it for their own purposes. It's like they're playing both sides of the same coin, and that raises a lot of questions about the motivations and priorities of the government in this area.","291":"revised sentence","292":"I was wondering, do you think cats prefer the unpredictability of a flashlight beam or the focus of a laser beam when it comes to chasing and playing?","293":"Is the laser's tiny dot actually more intense than the flashlight's bigger beam, even though it's so small?","294":"It's mind-boggling to think that we can harness the power of light to transmit information across vast expanses, essentially turning the globe into a giant, invisible network.","295":"With a laser, you can actually see the light beam as it follows the contours of the room and hits the wall behind the corner, even if it's out of sight, making it a really cool way to visualize the path of the light.","296":"I've seen lasers before, but this one seems so much more intense and fun! I'm curious, what did you think when you first saw it? Did you feel a little scared or excited?","297":"That's right, the laser is producing a red light, but it's also reflecting off the surface it's hitting, so you're seeing the red light from two sources - the laser itself and the reflection.","298":"What's your favorite part about watching a laser light show?","299":"I was reading it in the context of a class on computer security, and the professor was saying that it's a good example of how a seemingly innocuous piece of hardware can be exploited in a really clever way. What struck me was how the Rowhammer attack highlights the tension between the physical properties of memory devices and the logical abstractions we use to interact with them. It's a reminder that, even with modern security measures in place, the underlying physics of a system can still be used to subvert our expectations and create new vulnerabilities. I think this is a really interesting area of research, and I'd love to hear more about your thoughts on it.","300":"I can see why you'd be concerned about the unpredictability of these side-channel attacks, especially when it comes to memory devices. The Rowhammer vulnerability is a great example of how a seemingly innocuous action can have unintended consequences, like flipping gates in a different part of the memory. It's a bit like the butterfly effect, where a small change can have a ripple effect and compromise security. It's not just about updating devices, but also about understanding the underlying physics and how they can be exploited. What are your thoughts on how we can better mitigate these risks?","301":"I think that's a really important point about wireless routers. They can be a major vulnerability if not properly secured.","302":"I think a lot of people in the security community would be really upset if that happened. They already feel like they can't share their knowledge and findings with the public, so if it became a crime, they'd either stop doing this work or find ways to get around the law, which would be a disaster.","303":"I'm not sure that's a fair concern, though - if I own the vehicle, I should be able to inspect it and make decisions about its maintenance and repair, without the manufacturer or government interfering.","304":"I guess that's the thing, though - if it were illegal, it would change things for me. I'd have to think about it differently.","305":"I was thinking, what if blockchain technology could help create a more direct connection between buyers and sellers, without the need for intermediaries?","306":"You're suggesting that we could replace banks and other intermediaries with this network of computers, which could handle and validate transactions.","307":"It works by creating a permanent and transparent record of all trades, stored on a decentralized ledger that's maintained by a network of computers. This way, every transaction is visible to all participants, and the system is designed to be tamper-proof, ensuring the integrity of the trades.","308":"That's right. And what's more, this decentralized system allows for a level of transparency and accountability that's hard to achieve in a traditional, centralized database. If one computer tries to cheat, the entire network can see it, and that's actually what prevents the cheating from happening in the first place. It's like a self-correcting mechanism that ensures the integrity of the entire system.","309":"Each block in a blockchain contains a list of transactions that have happened, kind of like a record book.","310":"I'm actually in the process of applying to the three, two program for biomedical engineering, which is why I mentioned it. I'm really drawn to the intersection of engineering and medicine, and I think the program would be a great fit for me.","311":"So, what sparked your interest in lasers? Are you drawn to the theoretical aspects, or do you see practical applications in fields like medicine, materials science, or communications?","312":"Chirped pulse amplification is a technique that enables the creation of high-power lasers with short pulse durations. It works by first stretching a long pulse in time to reduce its power, then amplifying it, and finally compressing it back to a short pulse. This allows for the production of a laser that can deliver a high intensity beam in a very short time frame, making it suitable for applications like laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy or material processing.","313":"Yes, the idea is the same \u2013 to create a high-intensity pulse that can interact with the material. But with chirped pulses, we're using a different technique to achieve that. Instead of focusing all the light at once, we spread it out over time using the chirp, and then compress it back down to a short, high-energy pulse. This approach allows us to avoid the problem of the laser being too intense, and instead, we get a more controlled and efficient interaction with the material.","314":"The pendant is a visual aid that helps illustrate how the mode locker works. It's a diagram that shows how the different colors of light interact with each other, but I don't have it with me right now, so I can try to explain it in more detail if you'd like.","315":"when I was a violinist, I used to perform with a local orchestra, but I had to stop after I discovered the joy of singing in a barbershop quartet - it was like my voice was finally free to explore a whole new range of emotions and expression, and it completely changed my perspective on music.","316":"You'd hear a richer, more complex sound, with the overtones of each singer blending together to create a unique harmony.","317":"I think a lot of people get stuck in this mindset because they're not considering the harmonic function of the notes and the chord, and how the relationships between them can create tension and release, rather than just trying to add more notes to make it sound more interesting.","318":"If we invert the third of the F major triad, we can create a new chord, and I can show you how that works by using the note F as an example.","319":"and the chord is F major 7, with a flat 5 and a sharp 11 - essentially, that shows every note and every base note can work together, which is a really cool thing.","320":"I'm not sure I fully understand what you mean by negative harmony. Can you elaborate on that?","321":"Exactly, and that's what makes negative harmony so powerful - it can take a bright, cheerful sound and turn it into something melancholic and introspective. It's all about creating tension and contrast, and that's what makes music so compelling.","322":"By switching from A major to F major, you're essentially introducing a sense of tension and melancholy, which was not present in the initial A major key. This is because the dominant chord in F major, C major, has a more somber quality compared to the dominant chord in A major, D major, which is typically associated with a brighter, more uplifting mood. This shift in mood can significantly alter the emotional resonance of the song, making it more contemplative and introspective.","323":"You're saying that when the harmony shifts from major to minor, it's like the sky has suddenly darkened, and the atmosphere becomes more melancholic, like a gentle rain starting to fall on a previously sunny day.","324":"That's a really interesting question. In theory, if we could map the connectome of your brain, we might be able to replicate it in a computer. But that's a huge if, because the brain is a complex system, and we're still far from understanding how it works. However, researchers are exploring ways to use brain-computer interfaces to create more realistic simulations of brain function, which could potentially lead to breakthroughs in fields like artificial intelligence and neuroscience.","325":"So, if we could create a computer that thought and felt like a human, would it be the same as you or something entirely different?","326":"That's an interesting point, and it makes me wonder, how do we reconcile the static map of the connectome with the dynamic, constantly changing nature of neural activity? Is there a way to capture that temporal aspect in a way that's still meaningful and useful for understanding brain function?","327":"<model-generated> I mean, think about it, you're essentially in a position where you have to trust me, but you can't even trust that I'm telling the truth, right? <\/model-generated>","328":null,"329":"You wanted to exchange messages with someone that you knew, but you also wanted to keep the content of the messages secret from everyone else, including your friends and family, and even from the messaging app itself, so you had to be creative with your approach.","330":"You're saying that someone can prove a fact exists without revealing the details of how they know it, like a teaser?","331":"That's the power of memory, it's not just about recalling the past but also how it shapes our present and future decisions. It's like our brain is constantly updating and refining our understanding of the world through these memories. ","332":"I think that's one of the most striking things about memory is how it can be both a source of comfort and a source of pain, and how it can influence us in ways that are both conscious and unconscious. I've had experiences where memories have resurfaced and changed my perspective on things, and I'm curious to hear more about how you think memory works and how it relates to our sense of identity and purpose.","333":"I'm actually exploring the intersection of implicit and explicit memory, and how these seemingly distinct categories can influence our thoughts and actions in ways that aren't always immediately apparent. For instance, I've been looking at how memories that we're not consciously aware of can still shape our emotional responses and decision-making processes, even if we can't quite put our finger on why we're feeling a certain way or why we're making a particular choice.","334":"Actually, our findings suggest that it's not just a matter of which brain region is active, but how they interact with each other. When we learn a new skill, it's like a dance between the striatum, prefrontal cortex, and even the hippocampus. But when we form an episodic memory, it's a different rhythm altogether. The brain regions work together in a unique way, and that's what allows us to remember and relive experiences.","335":"I think what's really compelling about Proust's work is how it highlights the complex interplay between memory, experience, and perception. His writing shows that memories aren't just static recollections, but can be shaped and influenced by our current thoughts, emotions, and surroundings. It's almost as if our memories are constantly being rewritten, and it's this dynamic process that makes them so rich and nuanced.","336":"string","337":"That's what a zero-knowledge proof is - you don't know how I know where the puffin is, but you know I do, and that's a pretty cool thing. But think about it, how could I possibly know where the puffin is if I didn't have some kind of information or hint? What would be the minimum amount of information I would need to figure out where the puffin is?","338":"But now that you've seen the puffin, I'm curious - how do you think zero-knowledge proof can be applied to real-world problems beyond just hiding objects?","339":"That's exactly what I'm interested in - exploring how zero-knowledge proofs can revolutionize the way we think about online security and privacy, especially when it comes to authentication and verification processes.","340":"If the computer had a zero-knowledge proof system, you'd be able to show it you know your password without revealing what that password is, kind of like proving you're who you say you are without showing your ID.","341":"You could just be like, 'Hey, I'm Chelsea, and I'm 10 years old and in 5th grade,' and they'd know it's true without me having to spill all the details.","342":"You seem to be suggesting that infinity is a boundless quality, but that's a different concept from infinity as it's understood in mathematics, where it has specific rules and properties that don't always align with our intuitive understanding.","343":"What if we had a second guest join the hotel, and we wanted to accommodate them without having to create a new room, but instead find a way to make the existing rooms work for both of them?","344":"They can't live together because there's not enough space, and also because each room in one hotel corresponds to a unique guest, so even if we doubled the room count, we'd still have an infinite number of unique guests, making it impossible to merge the two hotels.","345":"So the guest who was in room two is now in room four, and that's increasing the room number by two each time.","346":"Infinity is a bit of a tricky concept in math, but basically it means something that has no end. Hilbert's Hotel is a crazy example that shows how you can keep adding more rooms to a hotel that's already full without having to kick anyone out. It's a real head-scratcher, and it helps us understand why math sometimes works in weird and counterintuitive ways.","347":"So, I was actually reading about this concept called the Singularity, where some people think that AI could become so advanced that it surpasses human intelligence in every way, and I was wondering if you've ever come across that idea before?","348":"coordinates would be a very narrow and specific thing, like the x and y coordinates of a specific spot on a table, but that's not what we want - we want the robot to be able to generalize to any point in space.","349":"Actually, I was going to say that perception is often considered one of the most challenging things for robots to learn, not motion. Motion is something that's often learned through reinforcement learning, but perception is a much more complex task that involves understanding the world through sensory inputs like vision, hearing, and touch.","350":"I think we're facing a chicken-and-egg problem. We need more data to train our robots, but we can't collect enough data because the tasks are too simple to be worth documenting, and the data we do collect isn't very useful because it's not in a format that's easy to use for robotics. It's a bit of a catch-22.","351":"I think what you're getting at is that fractals are often defined in terms of their self-similarity and the way they exhibit the same patterns at different scales, which is related to their Hausdorff dimension. The Hausdorff dimension is a way to measure the complexity of a fractal, and it's a key concept in understanding how fractals behave and how they're related to other mathematical objects.","352":"I think that's a great point, and it's actually a good example of how fractals can have properties that don't fit neatly into our usual notions of dimension. But what I was getting at is that the fractal dimension is a way to measure how complex and detailed a fractal is, even if it's not necessarily related to its physical size or shape. Does that make sense?","353":"Actually, when you crumple the paper into a ball, it becomes a three-dimensional object because it has length, width, and depth, which makes it a 3D shape.","354":"If I cut that box in half again, I'll have two smaller boxes that are half the size of the original one.

The self-similar structure of fractals means that the coastline is made up of smaller versions of itself, with the same patterns repeating at different scales. It's like a never-ending puzzle, where each piece is a smaller version of the whole, and that's what makes fractals so fascinating!","357":"Yes, and I think it was Perlin's work that helped to bring fractals into the mainstream of computer graphics, but the actual mathematical foundations of fractals were laid down by mathematicians like Mandelbrot, who built upon the work of earlier researchers such as Gaston Julia and Helge von Koch.","358":null,"359":"Well, it could be something like 0110 or 1011, which represent the numbers 6 and 11 in binary.

You can ask me questions about the cards, and I'll respond in a way that convinces you that I have a full house, without actually revealing any information about the cards themselves. That's basically what a zero-knowledge proof is \u2013 a way of proving something is true without revealing any underlying information.","362":"So let's say you have a bank account, and I want to prove to you that I have at least 0.2 Bitcoins in my bank account, without revealing the account balance or the account number.","363":"So, you'd ask me if two countries on the map share the same color, and I'd tell you yes or no. Then you'd pick another pair of countries and ask the same question, and I'd keep saying yes or no. If I ever say yes, you'd know to pick a new pair of countries. But if I keep saying no, you'd be pretty sure the map is properly colored.","364":"We could use a protocol like zk-SNARKs, which allows you to prove a statement is true without revealing any information about the statement itself, by creating a zero-knowledge proof that can be verified by anyone, without needing to know the underlying statement or its value.","365":"Let's create a mental map of the countries, where each one is associated with a specific color. I'll give you a hint: the country I'm thinking of is one of the ones we've already discussed. Can you try to recall which one it might be?","366":"But what's fascinating is that it's not just about the pieces fitting together \u2013 there's a clever trick behind it, right?","367":"because the new color palette is incompatible with the previous settings, so we need to rethink our approach","368":"I think they're a game-changer for implementation because they offer a way to prove something's true without revealing the details. It's all about finding that balance between security and transparency. Zero-knowledge proofs can help us do that, making them a really valuable tool for various applications. But they're not about proving a point; they're about proving that you have access to certain information without giving away the goods. That's the beauty of them.","369":"I see what you mean about implementations. Can you walk me through how zero-knowledge proofs are used in practice?","370":"I'd love to explore that further with you, because I think it's an area where our conversation about generative models and language can really intersect with some of the philosophical questions you're getting at, like the nature of existence and what it means for something to be real.","371":null,"372":"You used to play with the pool noodles and then go down the slide. After that, you went to the sandbox and played around.","373":"You're saying that as we age, our brains don't just forget things because we're making space for new ones, but it's more about what we choose to remember and what we don't. Can you explain that further?","374":"That's right! Our brain uses different regions to store and retrieve memories, and when we experience something new, it strengthens connections between neurons, especially in areas like the hippocampus, which plays a key role in forming new memories.","375":null,"376":"And that's why fractals can be challenging to measure precisely, as their dimensions can vary significantly depending on the scale of observation.","377":"I think a planet or an asteroid could exhibit fractal properties, especially if they have a surface with complex geological features like craters, canyons, or mountain ranges. The key aspect of fractals is self-similarity, where patterns repeat at different scales, and these celestial bodies often have surface features that display this characteristic. For instance, the cratered surface of the Moon or the Valles Marineris canyon system on Mars are examples of fractal-like structures. However, it's worth noting that the concept of fractals is often applied to two-dimensional geometric patterns, and the three-dimensional nature of planetary surfaces might make it more challenging to directly apply fractal analysis. Nevertheless, the idea of fractals can still provide a useful framework for understanding and describing the complex, intricate patterns found on these celestial bodies.","378":"You see, the more measurements you take, the more detail you capture, and the coastline appears to get longer. In fact, the length of the coastline is a classic example of a fractal, where the same pattern repeats at different scales. The more precise your measurements, the more closely you'll approximate the true, self-similar pattern of the coastline.","379":"I think that's a great way to put it. A fractal is like a shape that has a lot of complexity, but it's also got some underlying structure that makes it feel cohesive and connected, even though it's got a lot of different parts that are similar to each other.","380":"Hi Namina, I'm so glad to meet you! What brings you here today?","381":"So, you're talking about using tiny particles to measure tiny things, like temperature or movement. It's like having a super-sensitive tool that can detect really small changes. Can you tell me more about what you're trying to measure?","382":null,"383":"So, we're using quantum sensing to'see inside' the ball without disturbing it. It's a pretty cool technology!","384":"I was working on a project that involved developing a superconducting qubit-based magnetometer, which allowed me to appreciate the significance of precise sensing in quantum systems, particularly in the context of quantum computing and quantum information processing.","385":"I think it's because you can get a much clearer picture of individual components in quantum sensing, whereas in imaging large biological objects, you're looking at a bunch of stuff moving around at once, so it's harder to get a clear view of what's going on.","386":"Actually, the nitrogen-vacancy center is embedded pretty much right at the surface of the diamond, so you can get pretty up close and personal with it.","387":"One of the biggest challenges we face is calibrating the platform to accurately measure the subtle quantum effects we're trying to detect, which requires a deep understanding of the underlying physics and careful tuning of the system's parameters to minimize errors and maximize signal-to-noise ratio.","388":"such as dephasing, where the phase of the quantum state is affected by the fluctuations, which can happen due to interactions with the environment, like the surrounding materials or thermal noise, that can cause the quantum state to lose coherence and transition to a different state.","389":"And that's where the challenge really lies, because the signal and the noise can be so intertwined, it's like trying to untangle a knot. The noise isn't just random fluctuations, it's actually a reflection of the underlying physical processes that are occurring within the system, and it's only by understanding those processes that we can begin to separate the signal from the noise and extract the information we need.","390":"I mean, the quantum noise that's inherent to your system is a manifestation of the underlying physics, where the interactions between the particles, like the spins, are essentially a source of noise that's inseparable from the signal you're trying to measure.","391":"Well, things like irrelevant emails, social media updates, and background conversations can be distracting, but I'm more concerned about the constant stream of notifications from apps and devices that can be really intrusive.","392":"I think that's a good question, and it's an area we're actively exploring. The more spins you have, the more complex the dynamics becomes, but it could also lead to more powerful sensing capabilities. What are your thoughts on the potential trade-offs?","393":"I'm particularly excited about the potential for quantum sensing to revolutionize fields like medicine and materials science, which could lead to some game-changing discoveries.","394":"Explainer: I'm curious, what do you think is the biggest misconception that people have about quantum computing?","395":"The thing that's really interesting about quantum computing is that we're trying to solve certain types of problems that are intractable for classical computers, like simulating complex molecular interactions or factoring large numbers, which has significant implications for fields like chemistry and cryptography.","396":"And it's not just the number of qubits, but also the fragility of quantum states and the difficulty of maintaining control over them. We're still figuring out how to build robust systems that can handle the complexities of quantum computing without losing coherence, which is a major obstacle to scaling up our technology.","397":"But isn't Shor's algorithm a potential concern for encryption? I mean, if someone were to build a large enough quantum computer, wouldn't that break certain types of encryption?","398":"And the reason we can get that level of detail is because of the game's block-based rendering engine, which breaks down complex shapes into individual blocks that can be rendered on the fly.","399":"You're saying that recursion is like a pattern that repeats itself, like a tree with branches and leaves. If you draw the tree, you can draw the branches, and if you draw the branches, you can draw the leaves. It's like a smaller version of the same thing, over and over again. Does that sound right to you?","400":"I'm thinking of subdivision surfaces, which are a way to create smooth surfaces by breaking down complex shapes into smaller, simpler ones. It's similar to how we're creating the Koch curve by iteratively dividing the square into smaller parts. Does that sound familiar?","401":"I'm glad you're asking questions! So, let's dive deeper into how subdivision surfaces work. Essentially, they allow us to create smooth shapes by iteratively refining the mesh of a 3D object. It's like taking a rough sketch and gradually adding more details to create a more realistic representation. This process is especially useful in computer graphics because it enables us to model complex shapes, like characters or environments, with a high degree of accuracy and detail. By using subdivision surfaces, we can achieve a level of smoothness that would be impossible to achieve with traditional polygonal modeling techniques. And, as I mentioned earlier, the subdivision process can be quite fast, thanks to the work of researchers like Ed Catmull and his team at Pixar. But I'm curious, have you heard of any other applications of subdivision surfaces beyond computer graphics?","402":"Well, the rendering time can vary greatly depending on the specific fractal and the level of detail required. For instance, some fractals, like the Mandelbrot set, have a relatively simple formula, whereas others, like the Julia set, can be much more complex and time-consuming to render. Additionally, the process of subdividing the surface into smaller triangles can also impact rendering time, especially if the surface has many curved sections or is extremely detailed. However, with advancements in computer hardware and software, rendering times have decreased significantly, making it possible to create high-resolution images of complex fractals in a relatively short amount of time.","403":"I think one of the biggest challenges is that fractals are still a bit of a mystery, even to experts in the field. They have so many potential applications, but we need to do a better job of understanding and teaching them. That way, we can unlock their full potential and see how they can be used to solve real-world problems in fields like physics, engineering, and finance.","404":"I'm not sure what you mean by ARPANET, but I'd love to learn more about it. Can you tell me a bit about its significance and how it contributed to the development of the internet as we know it today?","405":"Packet switching would allow data to be broken into packets, which can take different routes through the network, making it more efficient and reliable.","406":"And that's exactly the point about abstraction. By abstracting away the details of how data is transmitted, we can focus on the higher-level concepts of communication, like request-response structures, without worrying about the intricacies of packet routing and network failures. It's a fundamental principle of computer science, and it's what allows us to build robust and scalable systems that can adapt to changing conditions.","407":"I think abstraction is a huge part of it. The people who built the internet were clever to create a system that's flexible and adaptable, but also kind of mysterious. They were thinking about the cool things people would build on top of it, not just the infrastructure itself. That's what makes it so powerful.","408":null,"409":"That's a great question! I've always wondered about the inner workings of the internet, and it's fascinating to learn about how packages get routed and what factors influence their path. It's like a giant, complex network of roads and highways, but instead of cars, it's data packets zipping along at incredible speeds. I've learned a lot just chatting with you, and I think our conversation has definitely given me a new perspective on the topic.","410":"I'm studying a field called quantum sensing, which uses quantum systems to measure things like temperature and magnetic fields.","411":"We're actually focusing on the electron spins in diamond, which possess some remarkable properties that make them ideal for quantum sensing. One of the key advantages is that the nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond can be controlled and measured at room temperature, a significant improvement over other quantum systems that often require cryogenic conditions.","412":"I think you're on the right track, but I'm not sure if you're directly referencing the nitrogen-vacancy centers in your question. Could you clarify if you're talking about using them to create a superposition state in the quantum sensing application?","413":"So, you're essentially using the quantum system as a probe, a kind of quantum sensor, that's interacting with the environment and losing its quantum properties, but in doing so, it's gaining information about the world that it wouldn't have if it were isolated. It's a bit like a quantum compass, where the needle is the quantum system's state, and the magnetic field is the environment it's interacting with, and the deflection of the needle is the information it's gathering.","414":"By entangling qubits, you can create a shared sensitivity to the environment, effectively 'amplifying' the measurement of any changes that occur.","415":"Actually, yes, an atomic clock can be considered a quantum sensor because it relies on the principles of quantum mechanics to achieve its high precision. But I'd like to clarify that it's not just any quantum sensor - it's a very specific type of one that uses the precise frequency of an atomic transition to measure time. This precision is what makes it so useful for applications like GPS, which relies on the consistency of timekeeping across multiple satellites.","416":"The idea is that if you could make those clocks even more precise, you could potentially use them to improve the accuracy of the GPS system, perhaps by reducing the time it takes for the satellites to send and receive signals, or by allowing for more precise triangulation of the user's location.","417":"I've always wondered, what's the actual infrastructure behind the internet? Like, how do all these networks in my house connect to the global network, and what's the physical journey of data as it travels from my laptop to, say, a server in California?","418":"The local network in your house acts as a hub, connecting to your internet service provider's network, which serves as a gateway to the city network, and from there, it's a seamless transition to the global network, allowing you to connect with anyone, anywhere in the world, including your friend in Australia.","419":"Actually, I was getting ahead of myself. To answer your question, it's primarily the undersea cables that allow for fast global communication. Satellites can also play a role, but they're not as fast or reliable. So, yes, there are undersea cables that crisscross the oceans, and they're a crucial part of how we connect with others across the globe.","420":"Actually, yes, there are undersea cables. They're a network of thick, insulated wires laid across the ocean floor, transmitting massive amounts of data between continents. The cables are made up of thousands of individual fibers, each capable of handling a substantial amount of information. These cables play a crucial role in connecting the world's networks, allowing for seamless communication across vast distances. It's fascinating to think about the infrastructure that enables our global connectivity.","421":"You connect to the internet wirelessly through Wi-Fi or cellular networks, like 3G or 4G. These connections are actually routed through undersea cables, which are the backbone of the internet, connecting major networks across the globe. Think of it like a vast network of roads that allow data to travel quickly and efficiently between continents.","422":"So, when you request a specific movie or TV show from Netflix, it's actually a complex process that involves multiple servers and protocols working together. Imagine a massive library with an infinite number of books, where each book represents a movie or TV show. When you want to watch a particular book, Netflix sends a request to the librarian, who checks if the book is available in the library. If it is, the librarian retrieves the book from the shelf and sends it to you over the internet. However, the book is not just sent as a single entity; it's broken down into smaller packets of information, which are then reassembled at your end to ensure that you receive the complete and correct movie or TV show. This process happens rapidly, often in a matter of seconds, and it's what allows you to seamlessly watch your favorite content without any issues.","423":"Well, when you open Netflix on your device, it's like sending a message to a big switchboard that says, 'Hey, I want to watch Vampire Diaries.' The switchboard, which is kind of like the internet, figures out the best server to connect you with so you can watch your show without any hiccups. It's like having a personal concierge service that makes sure you get the content you want, when you want it, without any delays or buffering.","424":"When you talk about infinite sets, I think you mean that some sets have an endless number of elements, and you're wondering if we can compare the size of these sets, even though they're endless.","425":"Exactly, you'd match negative one with two, negative two with three, negative three with five, and so on. That way, all the negative integers are matched with odd numbers, while all the positive integers are matched with even numbers. Does that sound right to you?","426":"That's an interesting intuition. Let's explore it further. If we assume that all positive integers are odd and all negative integers are even, how would that relate to the pattern we're seeing in the integer lattice?","427":"I think you're hinting at a potential bijective mapping, which would imply that the cardinality of the rational numbers is the same as the natural numbers, rather than larger. Is that correct?","428":"We're using this picture to show that the set of rational numbers is countably infinite by relating it to the set of pairs of integers, which we already know is countably infinite.","429":"We're counting everything, and when we do that, some numbers show up higher than others. It's not because 3\/2 is a big deal, it's just that our counting method is what's putting it at 25.","430":"You're suggesting that the size of infinity of the natural numbers is equivalent to the size of infinity of the rational numbers, yet you're also implying that the size of infinity of the rational numbers is smaller than the size of infinity of the real numbers. I'm having trouble reconciling these statements. Could you help me understand the relationship between these different sizes of infinity? ","431":"You can add one to any real number, but that's not what I'm trying to get at. What I want to do is create a real number that's different from this one in some way. For example, if this number starts with a 7, I can create a new number that starts with a 3. Does that make sense?","432":"And you're thinking that if we keep going, we'll never actually exhaust all the possibilities, so the list will never be complete.","433":"I think it's fascinating that this result has significant implications for the foundations of mathematics, and it makes me wonder if there are other areas of mathematics where we're similarly limited in our understanding.","434":"This is a good question, and the answer is that it has a number of interesting consequences in various areas of mathematics and computer science. One of the most significant areas where these ideas have practical implications is in the development of algorithms for generating random numbers, which is crucial in fields like cryptography and statistical modeling. For instance, understanding the nature of infinity can help us design more secure encryption methods and more accurate models of real-world phenomena.","435":"Okay, let me break it down. Quantum computers use qubits, which are the quantum equivalent of bits. Qubits can exist in multiple states at the same time, which allows them to process many possibilities simultaneously. This is called superposition. And qubits can be entangled, meaning their properties are connected even when they're far apart. This lets quantum computers solve certain problems much faster than regular computers.","436":"They work by using special microphones that pick up ambient noise and then produce a sound wave that's the opposite, or 'anti-noise', to cancel it out. This is called active noise control.","437":"We're still in the early days of quantum computing, but we're working on building tools that will make it easier for programmers to use quantum computers. Think of it like this: we're creating a bridge between the way you program today and the way you'll program with quantum computers. We're not trying to replace classical computers entirely \u2013 instead, we're looking at quantum computing as a way to speed up certain tasks that are really tough for classical machines.","438":"Imagine you're writing a program, but instead of using traditional logic and step-by-step instructions, you're working with a language that's more like a recipe or a blueprint for solving a problem. You're describing the problem in a way that's more intuitive and connected to the underlying physics, so the computer can use that to find the solution more efficiently.","439":"You might be able to add quantum-specific functions or libraries to your existing code, or use a hybrid approach where you run some parts of the program on a classical computer and other parts on a quantum computer. ","440":"That's a really interesting point, and I was wondering, how does the collapse of the core into a black hole affect the surrounding space and the other stars in the galaxy?","441":"I'm glad you're curious about that. So, a star becomes a black hole when it runs out of fuel and can no longer support its own weight, causing it to collapse in on itself. As it collapses, its gravity becomes so strong that nothing, not even light, can escape once it crosses a certain boundary called the event horizon. The star's mass is what determines whether it will become a black hole or not. If it's massive enough, it will collapse into a singularity, a point of infinite density, and that's what we call a black hole.","442":"Actually, that's a great question, and it's a bit mind-bending, but basically, the light gets pulled in because the gravity of the black hole is so strong that it warps the fabric of spacetime around it, creating a kind of cosmic sinkhole that anything, including light, gets sucked into. It's not that the black hole is physically touching the light, it's just that the gravity is so intense that it bends the light's path, making it impossible for it to escape. Does that make sense?","443":"That's right, the gravity of the black hole is so strong that it warps the fabric of space and time, causing the light to follow a curved path towards the event horizon, which is the point of no return around a black hole.","444":"I think it's mind-blowing that the black hole is warping the fabric of space around it, so even if I wanted to move your chair, it would be like trying to move it through a super-strong, invisible force field that's being created by the black hole's gravity. It's not that the chair would be moving on its own, but rather that the space around it would be curving in such a way that it would be incredibly difficult to move it without being affected by the black hole's gravity.","445":"I'm actually investigating how the axiom of choice interacts with other axioms in set theory, like the axiom of foundation, and exploring the implications of these interactions on the structure of the universe of sets. I'm particularly interested in the role of choice functions in this context, as they seem to play a crucial role in determining the'size' of infinite sets.","446":"I think the axiom of choice is also used in the proof of the Banach-Tarski paradox, isn't it? That's a pretty mind-bending consequence of the axiom, isn't it?","447":"What I find particularly striking is that the axiom of choice implies the existence of all sorts of bizarre and counterintuitive sets, like the Vitali set, which has the same cardinality as the real numbers but can't be put into a one-to-one correspondence with them. It's mind-bending to think about the kinds of structures that can exist in mathematics when you have the axiom of choice.","448":"I think you're getting at the idea of a Grothendieck universe, but it's more like a hierarchy of universes, with each one containing a set of sets that's a certain size, and then we can have categories within those universes that are bounded by those sizes.","449":"So, it makes sense that you'd want to keep the complexity of managing them steady, even as you add more devices, since they're sending over tiny amounts of data.","450":"Actually, most IoT devices have very limited data transmission capabilities, typically ranging from 10-100 bytes per second, depending on the specific device and its intended application. For example, a simple temperature sensor might transmit a single byte of data every minute, while a more advanced device like a smart camera might transmit 100 bytes of data every few seconds. And as you mentioned, these devices are often designed to report data to a central hub or cloud service, rather than transmitting data directly to other devices.","451":"I mean, it's a pretty big deal that you can prove something without giving away the details, right? That's what made zero-knowledge proofs so groundbreaking.","452":"That's a clever way of thinking about it, isn't it? By not showing the underlying data, you're essentially creating a puzzle that's solvable without giving away the solution, which is a pretty mind-bending concept.","453":"Zero-knowledge proofs enable private computations by using cryptography to verify outcomes without exposing the inputs or results.","454":"You're absolutely right, zero-knowledge proofs are a crucial aspect of ensuring the security and integrity of a blockchain ledger. By leveraging this technology, we can verify transactions without revealing sensitive information, which is a game-changer in the world of cryptocurrency and beyond.","455":"I think one of the key things we need to focus on is bridging the gap between theoretical advancements and practical applications, so that the benefits of zero-knowledge proof can be realized in real-world scenarios.","456":"To be honest, I'm a bit skeptical about the idea that the Large Magellanic Cloud doesn't have a big black hole. I mean, we do know that supermassive black holes can form through the merger of smaller ones, but it's still a pretty complex process. I'm not sure if we can rule out the possibility that there's a big black hole lurking in the Large Magellanic Cloud, even if the prevailing wisdom is that there isn't one.","457":"I've been trying to understand how supermassive black holes form in the centers of galaxies, and one theory is that they grow through the accretion of gas and dust over billions of years, but another theory suggests that they could form through the direct collapse of a massive cloud of gas, which would be a more rapid process. I'm not sure which of these theories is more widely accepted, but it's an area of ongoing research and debate in the field.","458":"One of the most promising ideas is that supermassive black holes can form through the direct collapse of a giant cloud of gas, which is a process that's been simulated in detail by some researchers. However, this scenario is still highly speculative and requires further investigation to determine whether it's feasible. Meanwhile, the merger scenario, while plausible, still faces significant challenges in explaining the rapid growth of supermassive black holes over cosmic timescales.","459":"Actually, black holes can also form through the merger of two neutron stars or a neutron star and a black hole, which is a process that's been observed and studied in recent years. It's not just about massive stars collapsing, but rather a complex process that involves the interaction of different types of celestial objects.","460":"I'm more curious about the supermassive black hole in the center of our galaxy, Sagittarius A*, and the implications of its presence on the stability of our solar system. For instance, how might its gravitational influence affect the orbits of the planets, and what are the potential consequences for the long-term evolution of our solar system?","461":"Actually, I've been thinking a lot about the potential applications of black hole energy, and it's fascinating to consider how it could be harnessed. But I think it's also worth noting that the scale of energy we're talking about is incredibly vast, and it's still unclear how we would even begin to tap into it safely and efficiently. It's a really complex problem, but it's definitely an area that warrants further exploration.","462":"But the thing is, even if we could harness the energy of a black hole, it would be extremely challenging to control and convert that energy into a usable form, not to mention the enormous engineering hurdles of even approaching a black hole. We'd be dealing with incredibly high-energy radiation and intense gravitational forces that would be difficult to manage. The energy density of a black hole is so immense that it would be hard to tap into safely, and the technology to do so would likely be far beyond our current capabilities.","463":"and that's a physical process, so it's limited by the laws of physics, you can't just make it faster by adding more bits, it's like trying to squeeze more water out of a sponge.","464":"That's right, and it's actually pretty cool. So, just like how classical computers use logical gates to process information, quantum computers use these quantum gates to do the same thing, but with a twist. They can manipulate multiple possibilities at the same time, which is really powerful for solving certain types of problems.","465":"That's a really cool idea - I've heard of superposition being used in quantum computing before, but I'm curious, how does it actually work in practice?","466":"That's a great question! So, to encode the inside of our quantum computer, we use a process called quantum encoding. Essentially, we prepare the qubits in a specific quantum state by applying a series of carefully controlled pulses. These pulses are designed to manipulate the qubits' quantum properties, allowing us to encode the information we need. It's a really cool process, and I'm happy to explain it in more detail if you're interested!","467":"To be more precise, I was going to say that the algorithms we're talking about are actually quite simple in concept, but they require an enormous number of operations to be performed on a quantum computer, which is why they're so computationally intensive and require a lot of qubits to achieve fault tolerance. The current state of the art is that we need millions of error-corrected qubits, but we're making progress, and it's impressive that we've already reached 50 qubits. There are certain problems that we know will be faster to solve on a quantum computer, and then there are others that we'll discover as we continue to develop and improve our technology.","468":"For instance, researchers are exploring the use of quantum computers to simulate complex systems, such as molecules or materials, which could lead to breakthroughs in fields like chemistry and materials science. They're also looking at how quantum computers can be used to improve machine learning algorithms, potentially leading to better predictive models and more accurate decisions. These near-term applications have the potential to make a significant impact in various industries and fields, and it's an exciting area of research right now.","469":"We're still figuring out how to make quantum computers work reliably, which is a major challenge. We're exploring new ways to correct errors, but it's a tough problem. If you're interested in helping out, I'd be happy to discuss potential projects or ways you could contribute.","470":"I think one of the biggest challenges is dealing with non-rigid deformable objects like tofu, which can crumble. I've been looking into some promising algorithms like the Deformable Object Simulation (DOS) algorithm and the Mass-Spring Damping (MSD) model. They've shown some promising results in simulating the behavior of deformable objects, but they can be computationally expensive and require a lot of fine-tuning. Additionally, I've been exploring the use of machine learning-based approaches, such as deep learning, to improve the simulation of these objects. However, these methods can be challenging to train and require large amounts of data. What are your thoughts on the potential applications of these algorithms in robotics and other fields?","471":"I'd love to explore that further. How do you think the type of feedback, whether it's through reward signals or explicit correction, affects the learning process and the efficiency of the robot's development?","472":"I think one promising direction is to combine data from real-world experiments and videos of humans interacting with the world to train our simulators, so that they can learn from both the physics data and the observed behavior, which can help bridge the gap between simulation and reality.","473":"I think fractals are really cool, and you can find them in nature, like in the way trees branch out or in the shape of mountains. It's like looking at a tiny part of something and seeing the same pattern repeated all the way up to the whole thing. Does that make sense?","474":"That's right, and each of those smaller branches will also split into two, creating a more detailed and realistic tree structure.","475":"I heard you've been working on a book about your experiences in the telecommunications industry. Can you tell me more about that?","476":"I think one of the biggest challenges to widespread softwarization is the lack of coordination between different providers. It's not just about agreeing on standards, but also on how to manage and troubleshoot the network, especially when things go wrong. It's a complex web of relationships and responsibilities that needs to be navigated.","477":"You're suggesting a useful analogy, but I'd like to clarify: is it more like a postal system where letters are encrypted, or is it more like a secure, private conversation between two people, where only the sender and receiver know what's being discussed?","478":"I think that's a pivotal moment for the entire ecosystem, as it's forcing these traditionally siloed communities to converge and collaborate, ultimately leading to more seamless and efficient interactions between wireless, networking, and cloud technologies. This, in turn, is enabling the widespread adoption of edge computing, which is a game-changer for applications that require low-latency, high-bandwidth connectivity to the physical world.","479":"I'm guessing you've had some exposure to general relativity, given your physics background. Can you tell me more about your understanding of the basics of black hole formation and the role of event horizons in that process?","480":"So the core of the star is collapsing in on itself, and the event horizon is like a boundary that marks the point of no return \u2013 once you cross it, the gravity is so strong that not even light can escape. It's a bit like a cosmic bookmark, where the star's history is frozen in time, but the actual matter has been consumed by the black hole, leaving behind an empty shell.","481":"I've heard that the singularity at the center of a black hole is a point of infinite density, but it's not directly observable. Instead, we rely on theoretical models and mathematical frameworks to understand what's happening inside a black hole. How does that relate to our current understanding of quantum mechanics and gravity?","482":"As you get closer to the event horizon, space and time get all mixed up and it's hard to make sense of them. It's like the fabric of space and time is being stretched and curved in extreme ways.","483":"The laws of physics as we know them are expected to fail catastrophically near a singularity, and some theories suggest that the intense gravitational forces and quantum effects could prevent the formation of a singularity altogether, effectively smoothing out the extreme conditions that would otherwise lead to a singularity.","484":"I think one of the most promising approaches is to look for signs of Hawking radiation in the cosmic microwave background radiation, which is the leftover heat from the Big Bang. By analyzing the tiny fluctuations in the CMB, we might be able to detect the faint signature of black holes evaporating. It's a long shot, but it's an area of active research, and if successful, it could provide some of the first experimental evidence for Hawking radiation.","485":"That's what the Event Horizon Telescope has been trying to do, and it's actually been able to image the event horizon of a black hole, which is a pretty remarkable achievement, but it's still a very different thing from watching the merger of two black holes, which would be an even more spectacular observation, and one that could potentially reveal some of the quantum effects that we've been discussing, such as the way the event horizon behaves during the merger process, which could be a real game-changer for our understanding of quantum gravity.","486":"I think what I love about this field is how it brings together seemingly disparate ideas and techniques, weaving them into a rich and intricate narrative that's full of surprises. The connections between zero-knowledge proofs and multi-party computation are a great example of this, and I think that's what makes the research so captivating \u2013 it's like being a detective, trying to unravel the threads of a complex mystery.","487":"But when you're trying to prove you don't know something, it's like turning the spotlight on yourself. You have to be really careful not to accidentally reveal something you do know, because then you'd be proving the opposite of what you wanted to prove.","488":"It would be fantastic to leverage zero-knowledge proofs to create a more transparent and trustworthy data storage experience, where users feel secure sharing their information with companies, and companies can demonstrate their commitment to protecting user data.","489":"Let's explore how your past experiences with pixie sticks, like the expectations you had before trying them, might have influenced your decision. Perhaps your initial excitement about trying something new was tempered by the actual taste, which might have made you more cautious in your decision-making process.","490":"What's it about pixie sticks that makes you think you'll enjoy them more than the other option?","491":"Let's break down what's happening in your mind when you're deciding between those two options. What are some of the factors that influence your choice, and how do you think your brain is processing the information?","492":"That's a great question! Can you think of any experiences or situations where you've found yourself liking a different type of candy or food than you normally do? For example, have you ever tried a new flavor or texture that surprised you and changed your preference?","493":"I was thinking it's a bit like a library or a bookshelf, but instead of physical books, it's like a vast collection of information and resources that are connected and accessible through the internet. Does that sound right to you?","494":"So, I've always thought that the internet is kind of like a giant game of telephone, where the video gets passed from one person to another, but instead of whispering it to someone, it's being sent through these invisible roads, called fiber optic cables, that crisscross the whole world, and it's like a big relay race, where each 'runner' in the race gets a tiny piece of the video and passes it on to the next 'runner' until it finally reaches its destination.","495":"I mean, think of it like a map, right? If one road is blocked, you can just take a detour and still get to where you're going. That's basically what's happening with the internet, it's like a big network of roads that can adapt and find the best route for the video to get from here to there.","496":"That's a great point, and it's one of the main reasons why having multiple paths is so valuable - it allows you to adapt and find alternative routes when one of them becomes unavailable, ensuring that you can still reach your destination.","497":"What's really interesting is how all these devices can communicate with each other in real-time, even when they're not physically connected. It's like they're all part of a giant, invisible web.","498":"So, how does that play out in terms of the dynamic reconfiguration of a circuit, or how does the pattern of connectivity change over time to support different mental states or tasks?","499":"I think that's a fascinating connection to make, and it makes me wonder how the schema concept can be applied to the dynamic and adaptive nature of mental models. In other words, how do we reconcile the static notion of a schema with the fluid, ever-changing landscape of our mental models? For instance, how do we update our schemas when new information or experiences challenge our existing mental models, and how do these updates influence our perception of the world and our place within it?","500":"I think that's a great point about the dynamic nature of memory. It's not just about accumulation, but also about pruning and editing. I'm reminded of the idea of 'liquid memory' where memories can shift and change over time, rather than being fixed in place. This idea challenges the notion of memory as a static repository of information, and instead suggests that it's a more fluid and adaptive process. It makes me wonder how this might relate to the concept of'mental flexibility' and how it might impact our ability to navigate complex situations.","501":"And I think that's where the real magic happens \u2013 where neuroscience and computational modeling come together to reveal the brain's remarkable ability to reconfigure its internal representations of the past, essentially rewriting the script of memory in real-time. It's a dynamic process, where the brain constantly updates and refines its mental models, making them more nuanced, more flexible, and more relevant to our ever-changing present. This is what allows us to learn from experience, to adapt to new situations, and to create new possibilities \u2013 in essence, to bring our memories to life.","502":"I think that's a fascinating perspective, and it's making me think of the idea that memory is not just a storage container, but a creative process that shapes who we are and how we interact with the world. It's like our brains are constantly rewriting the script of our lives, and that's what makes us who we are today.","503":"I'd be happy to elaborate on that. The theory of black holes has led to some fascinating discussions about the nature of space-time and the universe. For instance, some scientists have proposed that black holes could be portals to other dimensions or even parallel universes. Others have suggested that the information paradox surrounding black holes could be resolved by considering the role of black holes in the context of quantum mechanics. These ideas have sparked a lot of debate and research in the field, and it's exciting to see how the study of black holes continues to push the boundaries of our understanding of the cosmos.","504":"Want to plug in the guitar and see how it produces sound waves that are similar to the gravitational waves produced by black holes?","505":"We know it's a black hole because the wave pattern is eerily reminiscent of the simulations we ran, and the fact that it's a merger event is confirmed by the way the waves are oscillating at the same frequency, kind of like the harmonics of a perfectly tuned piano string.","506":"The effects of these gravitational waves on Earth are incredibly subtle, but they're there. In fact, the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory, or LIGO, was able to detect these waves by measuring tiny changes in the distance between mirrors suspended from towers, which is equivalent to about one-thousandth the diameter of a proton. These minute distortions in spacetime are what allow us to infer the presence of massive, compact objects like black holes, and they're a direct consequence of the extreme gravity these objects possess.","507":"I've been diving into the world of computer vision, and let me tell you, it's a real brain-twister. I've been digging into the work of Frank Rosenblatt and his perceptron, and it's clear that object recognition is a fundamental hurdle in the field of AI. I mean, it's one thing to get a robot to recognize a simple object, but when you start talking about complex scenes and nuanced environments, it's a whole different story.","508":"I think that's one of the key challenges in this field. People often have unrealistic expectations about what a robot can do, and that's because they're anthropomorphizing it. They're projecting human-like qualities onto it, and that's not always justified. It's like when you see a robot that can fold a towel, people immediately start asking it to do other tasks that are similar, but not necessarily related. We need to be clear about what a robot can and can't do, and that's not always easy. It's a delicate balance between making it seem capable and accessible, while also being honest about its limitations.","509":"I think that's a great point, and it's also related to the idea of Moravec's paradox, where the simple tasks that seem easy for humans, like grasping a cup or recognizing a face, are actually the hardest for AI to replicate, because they require a level of common sense, spatial reasoning, and world knowledge that is difficult to program into a machine. In fact, these tasks are often taken for granted until we try to teach a machine to do them, and then we realize how complex and nuanced they are.","510":"I think that's a fascinating perspective, and it highlights the limitations of relying solely on language models. By focusing on human experiences, we may be able to develop AI systems that are more grounded in reality and better equipped to handle the complexities of the world. However, this approach also raises questions about how we can effectively capture and replicate human experiences in a way that's useful for AI development. For instance, how do we identify the key aspects of human experience that are relevant for AI learning, and how can we ensure that these experiences are accurately represented in the AI system?","511":"I've been exploring the concept of embodied cognition, which suggests that our perceptions of social stimuli are deeply rooted in our bodily experiences and sensorimotor interactions. For instance, research has shown that our brain processes facial expressions in a way that's closely tied to our own emotional experiences, which can influence how we interpret and respond to social cues. It's a fascinating area of study that has implications for our understanding of social behavior and cognition.","512":"I was thinking about how your research on emotional responses might help us better understand which memories get updated and how, especially in situations where there's a strong emotional connection. For example, do you think that people are more likely to update their memories of positive experiences, like the cute cat video you mentioned, or do they tend to stick with their initial emotional response?","513":"I think that's a great point, and it highlights how our understanding of memory and decision-making is still evolving. The interplay between emotion, cognition, and memory is a complex one, and there's still so much to be learned about how these processes interact and influence each other. For instance, research has shown that emotions can significantly impact memory consolidation and retrieval, and that's an area that's still being explored.","514":"It's like trying to study a puzzle with missing pieces. We need to figure out how people with damaged brain regions are still able to learn and adapt, even if it's not in the same way as everyone else. It's a challenging but fascinating area of research.","515":"But then there are tasks that are easy for humans but hard for computers, like recognizing objects in a picture or understanding the nuances of human language, which is what makes our conversation so fascinating.","516":"Let's take it a step further. If this super-intelligent robot had to pick up a penny that had fallen on the ground, how would it decide where to pick it up and what would be the first step in getting it back into the other hand?","517":"Okay, try to pick up the object, and as you do, I'll give you some feedback on how you're doing. See if you can adjust your movements based on my hints.","518":"And I think that's what's so fascinating about learning to pick up an object - it's not just about the physical act, but also about understanding the underlying mechanics and how our bodies interact with the world.","519":"I think one reason is that robots are often designed to excel at very specific tasks, like assembly line work, where the environment is controlled and predictable, but they can struggle when faced with the unpredictability of real-world environments, like navigating around furniture or avoiding obstacles.","520":"They don't really know when they've messed up, but what's fascinating is that they can still learn from feedback, even if it's implicit. For example, if a robot drops a vase, it might not know it messed up, but if it's programmed to learn from its actions, it can infer that it made a mistake based on the consequences of its actions. That's a really interesting aspect of their learning process, don't you think?","521":"But what's interesting is that the robot doesn't perceive the world in the same way we do. While we have a direct visual experience, the robot's perception is more akin to a computational interpretation of the visual data it receives from the camera. The camera captures a vast array of numbers representing the intensity of red, green, and blue light at each pixel, which the robot then uses to construct a representation of its environment through complex algorithms and machine learning models. This process is fundamentally different from human perception, where we directly experience the world through our senses.","522":"I'm not sure what you mean by'see' in this context, but I think you're asking if a robot perceives its environment in a way that's similar to how humans do. Robots don't have eyes or a visual system like humans do, so they don't'see' in the same way. But they can use sensors and cameras to detect and interpret visual information, and they can use that information to navigate and interact with their environment. Does that make sense?","523":"Well, that's a question that gets to the heart of the safety and ethics of robotics. There are a few ways a robot could potentially go off the program, like if there's a software bug or a hardware failure, or if the robot is designed to learn and adapt, but not well enough to avoid making decisions that are outside of its programming. We're working on developing safety protocols and guidelines to mitigate these risks, but it's an ongoing challenge.","524":"I think it's because the fractals' self-similarity allows for infinite detail at every scale, making them aesthetically pleasing.","525":"You're saying that the fractal nature of the pattern comes from the smaller copies of itself that are embedded within it, is that correct?","526":"I think Ken's work, especially his noise functions, really resonated with the idea of capturing the intricate patterns found in nature, which is why his tools were so effective at creating realistic environments. His approach was almost like a digital version of the layering technique used by artists like Bob Ross, don't you think?","527":"That's a great start, but infinity is a bit like a mystery that's hiding in plain sight. It's not just a never-ending number, but a concept that challenges our understanding of limits and the universe itself. In a way, it's like trying to grasp a handful of sand - the more you think you have, the more slips through your fingers. And speaking of slippery things, I've got a jar of glitter over here that's making me wonder... how many pieces of glitter do you think are in that jar?","528":"because if we were to count all of them, we'd run out of time, but we'd also have to consider the size of the jar and how many Skittles it can actually hold, right?","529":"Because we can always find more jars in the attic, no matter how many we have already.","530":"Your point about the infinite jars outside the room is a great way to visualize the concept. It's almost like trying to grasp a never-ending staircase - the more steps you climb, the more you realize there are even more steps beyond what you can see.","531":"What I'm getting at is that the concept of infinity is often misunderstood as simply being a large number, but it's actually a more complex and nuanced idea that challenges our traditional understanding of space, time, and causality. It's a bit like trying to grasp a mirage \u2013 the closer you get, the more it recedes, and yet it's always just out of reach.","532":"I know exactly what you mean - sometimes my camera's autofocus is way off, and it's like it's guessing all wrong. We're actually working on a project to develop new AI algorithms that can help improve autofocus accuracy, but we're exploring some really innovative approaches, like using machine learning to predict where the subject is in the scene. Have you heard of anything like that?","533":"Let's see what happens when it lands! It might just land on its edge, who knows?","534":"So, when the top is spinning, its quantum state is also spinning, and if we were to entangle two tops, their properties would be connected in such a way that if one top's properties change, the other's properties change instantly, no matter the distance between them, which is a pretty mind-bending concept.","535":"because it's actually much more efficient to simulate complex quantum systems using a quantum computer rather than a classical one, that's why we're exploring the potential of quantum computers to tackle simulations like modeling chemical bonding.","536":null,"537":"Actually, an MRI uses a strong magnetic field and radio waves to create detailed images of the inside of your body, kind of like a super-powerful version of an MRI is like a high-definition camera that takes pictures of your internal organs and tissues.","538":"We're exploring how these cells can be used to detect various phenomena, such as magnetic fields and
