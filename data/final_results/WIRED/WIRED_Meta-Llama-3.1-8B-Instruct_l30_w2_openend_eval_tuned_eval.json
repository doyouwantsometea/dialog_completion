that's good, because that's why you're here, and so we're talking about sleep today, and really about kind of what is the brain machinery through which we go through consciousness to unconsciousness and that transition.","1":"Okay. The best way to think about this transition is really called, it's a flip flop switch, okay? So this term comes from engineering, and the idea is that in sleep, you basically have kind of this all of nothing experience. Certainly people kind of drift off to sleep, but then all of a sudden you're unconscious, right? So it seems like it's this flip flop between the arousal system and the sleep promoting system, and it's certainly regulated, and we'll get a little bit into that, but they're certainly kind of made up of two reciprocally inhibitory processes. Okay, so we have the ascending reticular activating system. It originates in the brain stem, and there's a dorsal and a ventral arm to this, and so the dorsal arm has neurons, cholinergic neurons, that go up to the thalamus and then it projections into the fore brain, and then there's the ventral arm, and this is comprised of a whole bunch of different types of neurons, so there are monominergic, so there's kind of dopaminergic neurons that come from the periaqueductal gray, serotonergic ones from the dorsal raphae nuclei, histaminergic neurons that come from the tuberomammillary nucleus of the hippothalamus, and then noradrenergic neurons from the locus coeruleus, and so all of those are kind of working in tandem to kind of drive wake within the brain. So if we just think about drugs that are available inducing wakefulness, we can certainly, kind of the dopaminergic ones jump out, right? So we have amphetamines that kind of drive those signaling, and then modafinil, which is a wake promoting drug for people that have kind of excessive day-time sleepiness that maintains alertness throughout the day.","2":"For the role that they play with respect to the sleep-wake system is really kind of amping up the wake system, right? And so certainly that has like down stream consequences for the sleep system, because now the flip flop switch is kind of pushed in a much stronger direction, and we have to kind of rely on what regulates sleep to get it pushed back to sleep.","3":"And do we know much about why, or which stages of the sleep cycle are affected? You know, if you take amphetamines, is it then when you go to sleep, that you're not able to transition through each of the sleep periods, or is that less clear?","4":"You know, so I think that's less clear. In some ways, you know, getting back to this idea of this wake-sleep system, we have this sleep system that is kind of the counterpoint to this wake arousal system, and so the primary nucleus region is the ventral lateral pre-optic nucleus, also called VLPO, and that has particular neuron outputs that release GABA and galanin, which work in an inhibitory way on kind of the wake promoting ones. And so, it's kind of this delicate balance of these two systems that are ongoing. In your cognitive neuro-science training, right, it sounds like it's pretty specific and focused in a particular part of the brain, the cerebellum, and one thing that I'm interested in is you bring a participant into the study, have you ensured that they got a good night's sleep? Have you asked them about their sleep?","5":"You know, what we do in our studies, is we actually track people, for say a week, and they have to get in within this range of amount of sleep and then it has to be both amount of sleep and how stable it is. That variability can kind of impact it and certainly might have an impact on the machinery that's happening in the brain.","6":"A lot of people will see you as somebody who's drank in harmony their whole life. They've seen so much harmony, heard so much harmony. How do you make the choices, there's so much that's possible when you know stuff. How do you have the courage to make a choice?","7":"Yeah, yeah, yeah. I find it fascinating in music to think about, you know, say I arrive in a place, if I'm going, say I'm going to D flat major. And there's something you once taught me. You taught me this song Don't Follow the Crowd.","8":"But at that moment, I'm coming from here, and I wanna forge some, some solution. I get myself in a situation. (keyboard music)","9":"'Cause, you know, I just wouldn't think to use that chord in that situation. And there it was! And, you know, if you read the rule book, it's, that not in it.","10":"Something like that. And that's not 'cause like emotionally, it's almost like I'm here, I'm arriving here. But, if the base note is the same, it's like this inevitability about it, it's like I was there all along.","11":"Yeah, yeah. It's like one thing is moving in one direction and one thing has arrived, so it's this tension and it's glorious. I love thinking about these things emotionally, just because that's a feeling, I know that feeling in my life.","12":"And so, we could play a bit of that if you want to. And we could talk about some stuff. I've been doing it in F. (keyboards playing Amazing Grace) (laughing) Thanks Herbie, that was a trip.","13":"It's a good one. The melody on its own just goes. (hums Amazing Grace) That melody on its own is kind of lonely, right? And no one really knows how it feels. (plays and hums Amazing Grace) So which one did you prefer?","14":"Yeah, ah, that's great. I can decide how I want this melody to feel and the more notes there are, the more exciting it is. That's what musical harmony is. Does that make sense?","15":"Its basically a delay and it happens in all parts of the system: monitors can be a big one. Like consumer televisions can often have 15 milliseconds or more of latency just in the TV part. And then you've got the processing and the computer and all of these add up to the total latency.","16":"30 years ago, you had desktop PCs which were, you spent whatever on that, but there was always this idea well you could spend a million dollars and buy a super-computer and its gonna be a lot faster. And that's not really true today. For scalar processing, when you just do one thing after another, a high-end, overclocked, cool gaming PC is about the fastest thing in the world. It is within a very small delta, yeah for some things you'll get some IBM power system that might be a little bit faster, but not a whole lot. So if I'm looking at this and saying we need to be five times faster. What do you do? You can't just say make each thing faster. As a developer you're making a trade-off, I can put my effort into making this more efficient or making it more fun. And more fun usually wins out for very good reasons. So there's some good judgment and trickery that goes into the design of things. But you can always just design a game that will just not work well. (laughing) I mean in the old days, games had to be so precisely designed. Nowadays you've got a ton more freedom. You really can--","17":"But VR makes, you have to give up a little bit of that freedom, you have to not do so many crazy things, so you can wind up having it be as responsive and high quality as it needs to be.","18":"That's right. When we teach machines to learn from data, to build a model from that data or a representation of that, and then to make a prediction. One of the places we often find machine learning in the real world is in things like recommendation systems. So do you have an artist that you really like?","19":"So I'm gonna look up Melanie Martinez. And it says here, If you like Melanie Martinez, one of the other songs you might like is by Au\/Ra. Do you know who that is?","20":"And that's actually a really interesting thing to think about because that creepy vibe is something that you can perceive and I can perceive, but it's actually really hard to describe to a machine. What do you think might go into that?","21":"It's a great question. The machine can understand whatever we tell it to understand. So there might be a person thinking about things, like the pitch or the pacing or the tone, or sometimes machines can figure out things about music or images or videos that we don't tell it to discover, but that it can learn from looking at a lot of different examples. Why do you think companies might use machine learning?","22":"Sometimes, the ads you see are really uncanny. And I think that's because they're based on so much data. They know where you live. They know where your device is. It's also important to realize that people in aggregate are actually pretty predictable. Like when we talk to each other, we like to talk about the novel things, like here, we're having this conversation. We don't do this every day. But we probably still eat breakfast. We're gonna eat lunch. We're gonna eat dinner. You probably are going to the same home you go to most of the time. And so, they're able to take that data that we already give them and make predictions based on that as to what ads they should show us.","23":"So there are things that machines are really great at that humans are actually not great at. And imagine watching every video posted to TikTok every day. So we just don't have enough time to do that at the rate at which we can actually watch those videos. But a machine can analyze all of them and then make recommendations to us. And then thinking about things that machines are bad at and people are good at, people are really great with only one or two examples of learning something new and incorporating that into our model of the world to make good decisions. Whereas machines often need tens of thousands of examples, and that's not even getting into things like good judgment because we care about people, because we can imagine a future that we want to live in that doesn't exist today. And that's something that is still uniquely human. Machines are great at predicting based on what they've seen in the past, but they're not creative. They're not going to invent. They're not gonna, you know, really change where we're gonna go. That's up to us.","24":"Black holes are so amazing that when the neutron star stops and there's something actually there. There's material there. If it's so heavy it becomes a black hole, so it keeps falling, once the event horizon of the black hole forms, which is the shadow, the curve that's so strong that not even light can escape, the material keeps falling. And like you said, maybe space-time breaks down right at the center there, but whatever happens, the star's gone, that black hole is empty. So in a weird way black holes are a place and not a thing.","25":"There isn't a sensible way to talk about it yet, and that probably means that's where Einstein's theory of gravity as a curved space-time is beginning to break down, and we need to take the extra step of going to some kind of quantum theory of gravity. And we don't have that yet. So even though the black hole isn't completely understood, we do know that they form astronomically, that in the universe things like neutron stars form and things like black holes form. The consequences are very much speaking to this curved space-time. So, for instance, if two black holes orbit each other, they're like mallets on a drum, and they actually cause space-time to ring, and it's very much part of gravitation. The ringing of space-time itself, we call gravitational waves. And this was something Einstein thought about right away in 1950-1960, he was thinking about that.","26":"[Janna] Yes, they ring space-time also like a drum, and you can record the sound of that ringing after a billion years, when it's traveled through the universe. But then the next thing that happens is those neutron stars collide, and because of this incredibly high energy state of matter, which you study, it becomes this firework of different explosions. It's really quite spectacular.","27":"So when the gravitational waves were recorded and they realized, oh this sounds like, you can reconstruct the shape and size of the mallets of the drum from the sound, these sounds like neutron stars colliding, not black holes. And so, like you said, there was a trigger for satellites and experiments all over the world to point roughly in the direction that the sound was coming from. So, from your point of view, they're like two super-conducting giant magnets colliding, an experiment you could never do on Earth. That's just the most tremendous scales and peculiarities of matter.","28":"Not an experimental one. So, our theme here today is dimensions. So this is great that you have some math background because mathematicians think about dimensions in a different way.","29":"Now, in some sense that's kind of trivial to you and me, because of course you have space, which is three dimensional, you have time which is one dimensional, so spacetime is four dimensional. But it didn't turn out, it didn't occur to anyone that that was a sensible way to talk until really relativity. This is the crucial thing, right? Is that what Einstein realized is that sure there's both time and space, but how we divide spacetime into time and space can be different for different people, and really there's a real sense in which four dimensional spacetime is kind of a generalization of three dimensional space. And I think to really explain this we're gonna need a blackboard.","30":"Why? This is a very good question. So, let's just start with space, right? We know a little bit about space. So here's my simple minded way of drawing space two dimensions, because that's how many I can draw on the blackboard. Let's say X and Y. And what is special about space, there's many things, but one is that if I have a curve or a path between two points, there's a distance that you can calculate, right? And the distance between those two points doesn't depend on your coordinates. It doesn't depend on whether you're in radial coordinates or Cartesian coordinates, or whatever. I'm allowed to imagine a curve that does something like this between those two points, and if I were a person walking on that curve, I would have an odometer with me maybe, and I would know, you would know, even without having done that, this path is always gonna be longer than that path. There's a formula, Pythagoras' Theorem that tells you what the shortest distance path is. That's the point. The physical-ness of what is real is the distance along a certain curve. So spacetime is like that. That's why it is useful to think about spacetime.","31":"And it's almost exactly like the space story. The space story says there's a distance, distance is different along different curves. Einstein says there's something that measures the length of these curves, and we call it the proper time. It is literally the time that you would read on your wristwatch.","32":"And the crucial difference is that time is not the same for this person who stayed behind and sat in their chair, and this person who zoomed out there.","33":"There is what we call a metric on spacetime, and when we talk about Euclidean space versus a curved space, versus a sphere or something, that's a different metric. And spacetime has its own metric which says the following thing, that the path between two events in spacetime that is a straight line, will always be the longest time.","34":"So when Einstein had this idea, oh gravity could be related to the curvature of spacetime, he did some equations, so he got it, that's a long story, we'll put that aside. What he figured out was that rather than gravity living on top of spacetime, it's a manifestation of the curvature of spacetime so when you have like the earth, the sun, the moon, they cause a gravitational field, they're actually warping the spacetime around them. They're giving it a different geometry.","35":"Yeah, exactly. If you had a sheet that was originally flat, and you set a marble on it, it would go in a straight line, but then if you put something on it so it warps it, that marble is now gonna be deflected.","36":"Yeah, that's right. And it goes exactly back to what we drew on the board where how those two people in the train and on the ground would divide spacetime up differently to space and time.","37":"So a nice place to start is with the idea of a triad. A triad is a three-part harmony, basically. (keyboard harmonic tone) So that's a triad. So this triad's called C major.","38":"So in Amazing Grace, you start with F. You know, if I go (melodic humming) \u266a How sweet the sound \u266a (scat singing) (laughs) Where am I right now? I don't know where I am. (scat singing) And my job is to get back home, but to make this chord make sense.","39":"You know, a lot of people, a lot of string theorists, they care a lot about all the different ways in which we could hide the extra dimensions. As someone who cares about cosmology, I wanna start asking why are the extra dimensions small at all? How did that happen? Is this something you think about yourself?","40":"The thing I want to talk about is this paper I wrote with Matt Johnson and Lisa Randall where we realize there's another way to compactify extra dimensions spontaneously, dynamically. If you imagine starting with this big piece of paper you couldn't wrap up everything, but within some region of space you could make a tube.","41":"Right? And down there in the tube it looks like your long thing that is compactified in one direction and infinitely extending in the other direction, so there's one less macroscopic dimension of space.","42":"Yeah. So we certainly assume that they're all large as a starting point, and it's worse than that. So in our paper we imagine you start in de Sitter space. You start in a universe with no matter, no anything like that, just empty space but with an energy that is positive and all the dimensions are large.","43":"Yeah, I've been trying to explain this to lower levels, and they always look at me like, are you pulling my leg here a little bit? Or is this the real thing that they use? Yes, it is the real thing they use. We study these branes in de Sitter space, and so what we found is that there are black brane solutions which instead of having a singularity inside are non-singular, and stable, and compactified. Is this a familiar thing? I know things like this have been discussed, right?","44":"Right. Imagine that rather than going down to a point, it just asymptotes to some fixed radius that continues infinitely far down there. But then you can ask, okay what about the rest of the universe? You have some sphere, some two dimensions compactified, and the balance between the cosmological constant and the electromagnetic field keeps it at a fixed distance.","45":"But then the other dimensions, the transverse dimensions, don't need to be anti-de Sitter. They can have either positive, zero, or negative cosmological constant. So you can basically get any sort of cosmological solution times a compactified sphere.","46":"I guess. I mean, maybe you'd think otherwise. Again or maybe you could change my mind, I think that as long as it can happen it will happen some of the time, right?","47":"Someone probably wrote it for him. So it's possible that if you do have this starting point of an empty de Sitter space with positive cosmological constants and fields lying around you inevitably get a multiverse. It just happens, you know, it's just part of quantum nucleation to different things, and then maybe you need to explain why we live in this universe rather than some other one via the anthropic principle or something like that. So how does our kind of, you know, low-tech old fashioned way of making new universes intersect with the kinds of things you'd think about.","48":"And if we put aside for the second the concerns of our colleagues in other parts of physics, and it's just amongst us chickens, what do you think about the future of cosmology and string theory, and the dynamics of these extra dimensions?","49":"And I just wrote a book called Something Deeply Hidden about many worlds, quantum mechanics, and how spacetime can emerge from it. Plenty of reading material for the audience out there.","50":"The reason we're not just flying off the earth is because earth has gravity, so if we throw something up, it comes back down, so that's why when we're walking on the earth, we don't fly off the earth because the earth has gravity, and it keeps us down.","51":"The main thing about black hole to remember is that it's just, like I said, how the earth holds you down, the black hole pulls you in, as well. Now, try and take the ball from me, black hole--","52":"Alright, so, at some point, you can probably see it right now? So without moving your eyes, this is kind of hard, tell me how many fingers I'm holding up?","53":"Okay. So this is about high intensity lasers. Not only how do you make them, but what was really stopping them being made in both cases is non linear optics. We wanna do something that requires a huge photon density application, and so that's how come we came up with chirped pulse amplification, so that we could stretch the pulse, safely amplify it, then compress it at the end, and then we're ready to do whatever we want at the end. So what do you think the main difference is between the continuous wave laser that you have that runs at 10 watts and a chirped pulse amplifier?","54":"And so we get the power with a lot less energy 'cause its power is energy per unit time. So we aren't depositing much energy in comparison. Can I just ask, 'cause you are using the thermal process of it heating up, but have you ever had the opportunity to use laser tweezers?","55":"So chirped pulse amplification took us sort of from, we were at 10 to the 12, but when I was working the 10 to the 12 sort of sat on a football sized field. It was a kilojoule laser with a nanosecond pulse. And we brought it down to something we call tabletop terawatt. So it was the same terawatt but now it was one joule and one picosecond, so it could fit on a basic optical bench like you would have in your lab. We were able to take that up to, I think the record is right around somewhere between 10 to the 22 and 10 to the 23 watts per square centimeter. So then in going forward, one of the holy grails is can we reach 10 to the 29 watts per square centimeter? So we still have six orders. So we've gone from 10 to the 12 to 10 to the 23. So we've done 11 orders, so you think six isn't so much harder. I have to tell you, over time, it's rolling over. We need another Nobel Prize winning idea. But if we get out there, that's where, if you focus the intensity, the energy in that volume is enough to break the vacuum.","56":"I don't know if people are working on that because I'm not so much in the medical field, but I should look into that and see if that's a possibility. So after hearing about high intensity lasers, can you think about next time you go back to the lab and you're wondering how to do something in the lab with lasers, can you see how short pulses might help you?","57":"Mostly today, I've been talking a lot about what can we do, what's possible. We think might be possible in the next couple of years. But really at the professional level its more the question of wisdom of what should we be doing.","58":"The end goal of reality, of course in computer graphics people chase photo-realistic form for a long time. And basically, we've achieved it. Photo-realism, if you're willing to throw enough discreet path traced rays at things, you can generate photo-realistic views. And we understand the light really well. Of course it still takes a half hour per frame like it always has, or more, to render the different things. So its an understood problem and given infinite computing power we could be doing that in virtual reality. However, a point that I've made to people in recent years is that, we are running out of More's Law. Maybe we'll see some wonderful breakthrough in quantum structures or whatever--","59":"You know there's tons of opportunities for the synthetic case where you want to be able to have your synthetic fantasy world where everybody is a creature that's created by the computer and simulated reasonably. But of course we've got, you know we still don't do people well simulated. That's a hard problem, we've been beating our heads against it for a long time. I do think we're making progress and I wouldn't bet on that being solved in 10 years, but maybe 20 years. Because it is going to take a lot of AI. Its going to take a lot of machine-learning, where its not going to be a matter of us dissecting all the micro-expressions that people do. Its gonna be lets take every youtube video ever made and run it through some enormous learner that's going to figure out how to make people realistic.","60":"I'm still a believer that the magic's out there. We haven't found it yet, so somebody's going to happen upon the formula. I feel like I've felt little pockets of magic.","61":"All right, you're in the wrong place. [laughs] We're not gonna be talking about biology or computer science. So we wanna talk about the idea of dimensions. Do you know what dimension is? How we would define dimensions?","62":"Right, you know the difference between like one dimension two dimensions, three dimensions, et cetera. So let's do a little experiment here. So there's one dimension. I'll give that to you. Now, here's your task. I'm going to give you another dimension, and I'm gonna ask hold those two things at right angles to each other. It's easy to do. Yeah, so there's no trick here.","63":"I'm not trying to fool you here. Okay. Now this is going to be slightly trickier. I'm going to give you this. I want you to hold all three of them at right angles to all the others at the same time.","64":"Well, we could also say how far we are away from the center, just the distance. And then the angle that our little line makes with let's say the X axis.","65":"So that's a different way of giving you two numbers and locating yourself, and we call those polar coordinates. It's a different coordinate system. What we want to do as physicists is look for extra dimensions. Can you imagine, can you think of any way that there could be extra dimensions?","66":"Time. Yes, Einstein said that we can think of time as a fourth dimension, and that's a very fascinating thing that we could talk about all by itself. But what about space? What about the solar system? Like, if you wanted to tell me where a certain star was in the sky, do you know how we do that?","67":"So astronomers call them right ascension and declination, which are two terrible words, but basically you've seen on the globe where you draw latitude and longitude, what it looks like.","68":"So you can define something as, well you know, how high above a certain location on earth it is, but the earth is rotating and revolving around the sun so we have to define separate celestial coordinates.","69":"We don't know. You know, the optimistic view is that there are six, but the thing is, some of them might be really, really, really, really, really small, like way too small for us to ever see.","70":"You know, honestly out there, if you go out onto campus and talk to the physicists, half of them will say probably extra dimensions exist, and half of them say no, that's just nonsense.","71":"For my studies, I actually, when I started at UCLA in graduate school, I worked with a professor named Matt Malkin who was, gotten a lot of data observations from the Hubble Space Telescope, so that was one of my very first projects to work on, so any, space-based observatories have been a really big advantage, and then I've moved on now to the Spitzer Space Telescope. In addition to that, then there's other people who've used a lot of X-ray telescopes, NuSTAR, Chandra have used data from that. It's been a combination of both ground-based observatories, as well as space-based ones, and going everywhere from X-ray observations, not done by me, but certainly ultraviolet, and then optical, and infrared, particularly, those are the ones that I've been most involved with.","72":"That's pretty good. So gravity wants to attract us to the Earth, and the Earth to us. But the Earth is so much bigger that even though we're actually pulling the Earth a little bit to us, you don't notice it so much. You know, the Moon pulls on the Earth a little bit.","73":"[Janna] Exactly, the Moon is such a big body compared to anything else very nearby that it has the larger effect, pulling the water of the Earth. But more than the Moon, think about the Sun pulling on the Earth. We orbit the whole Sun, just the way the Earth pulls on the Moon and causes the Moon to orbit us. All of those things are acting on you and me right now.","74":"That's such a good question. No, we actually couldn't. In the Moon, gravity is weaker, you can almost float between footsteps if you look at the astronauts on the Moon. On the Earth, it's harder, 'cause it's bigger. If you go to a bigger, heavier planet, it gets harder and harder. But there are stars that have died that are so dense that there's no way we could lift our arms, no way we could step or walk. The gravity is just way too strong. Do you know how tall you are?","75":"Maybe four three. People think that while you're sleeping, your body has a chance to stretch out and gravity isn't crunching you together, but when you're standing or walking or sitting, the gravity contracts your spine ever so slightly, so that in the morning you might be a little bit taller than in the evening. See if it works for you. [Woman] Wow.","76":"They say that astronauts in space, definitely their spine elongates. There were two twin astronauts, one who stayed here on Earth and the other who went to the International Space Station. He was there for a long time, and when he came back, he was actually taller than his twin brother.","77":"Yeah, and that was because gravity wasn't compressing him all the time and he was floating freely in the International Space Station and his spine just kind of elongated. After a while here on Earth though he'll readjust, he'll go back to the same size. Have you ever heard of how gravity was discovered?","78":"Isaac Newton would ponder, how does the Earth cause things to fall? There's a famous story that Isaac Newton was sitting under a tree and the apple fell from the tree and hit him on the head and he had an epiphany and understood this law, this mathematical law for how that works. I don't actually think that's a true story, though.","79":"They look the same, but this is much heavier, right? Okay, so try it, just try holding your arms up front, a little higher maybe, give them a chance to drop, and then drop them. [balls thud] [Janna laughs] Did they fall at the same time? Did they hit at the same time? So, Isaac Newton, he was also the one who realized that that's the same force that keeps the Moon in orbit around the Earth and the Earth in orbit around the Sun, and that's a huge leap. Here he is, looking at just things around him, and then looks at the stars and has this really big realization, that that's actually the same force. So, what have you learned today talking about gravity?","80":"It turns out, for people that are between the ages of 18 and 65, the agreed upon amount of sleep that people should get is between seven and nine hours, and it's really at least seven hours per night, to maintain optimal health as an adult. So at least seven hours. When we look at across all of the data that is available on like sleep and health, and sleep and psychiatric illness and those types of things, the largest risk is when people get five hours or less. What do you think is responsible for driving how much sleep you need, and things like that?","81":"Yeah, no, that's a really great question, and the same is true in places where the sun never goes down during the summer, and when it's dark all the time during the winter, and it turns out light isn't the only thing that kind of gates your circadian rhythm. But I think the thing that's really important, again there are two processes, that the other one is the S process, and that one's just kind of a really important driver of sleep. One name we call it is the homeostatic sleep drive. Kind of the longer you're awake, the sleepier you get. You stay up, you get sleepy. Time goes by, you get sleepier. Time goes by, you get sleepier. But it's actually kind of a fundamental principle for how sleep is regulated, and it's really kind of akin to like a balloon, okay? So you wake up in the morning and your balloon is flat. You've kind of like drained out all of the sleepiness. But then as you kind of go throughout the day, it kind of fills up, so you use your energy, it gets filled up. And then it gets filled up more as you get towards nighttime, right? And then when it's at this optimal amount is when you kind of go to sleep and let out all of the sleepiness again. And this is really what underlies why napping can also be bad for you. So napping's not inherently bad, but if you actually let out some of this air during the day, it's going to take longer for the balloon to get bigger, right, I see to where you feel sleepy, right?","82":"So yeah it's a light bulb and there's a couple of mirrors. Now the light bulb has to be a little bit special. It has to be a type of material that can store the energy in an excited state right? It has to stay up there really energetic and sit there for a while so that when the light comes along, it takes that energy and becomes stronger light and then the mirror sends it back and it does it again and again and again and between these two mirrors, it makes the light come out in a nice beam. In a laser, it comes out as a single color. They all come out with their waves at the same time. Every wave peaks at the same time which then makes it a giant wave and it's this giant wave that has a tremendous amount of power. So it can do something like cutting steel. But when you cut steel, or if you were cutting this floor, it's gray, it actually will absorb the light. That's why the light, you don't see it because the light isn't bouncing back or through it. So I like to use demos to explain how my laser works. So I've brought basically a hammer and a nail. I'm sure you've probably hammered a nail before into a piece of wood but the question is, if you asked yourself why it is we hit the big end and it's the tiny end that we put on the piece of wood. We could never pick up a hammer and hit the sharp end and hope this would go in to the piece of wood.","83":"That's right. All the force that we apply here, goes all the way through but then it can only basically come out when it contacts the wood in that one tiny spot. And so sometimes it's the force that you push something with but sometimes it is that force per unit area. But sometimes it's not even the force per unit area 'cos, you know, push down as hard as you can on that and see if we can get it pushed in. See it doesn't really work does it?","84":"Well it depends. So if you're cutting steel, you need to have the nail. You need to have it concentrated all of the light, not going in all directions but you need it into as small a point as possible. And for that we use a lens. For a lens, the light's coming down as a column, you put in a lens, it all focuses it down in the same way as the nail and then it starts cutting that steel. Okay so that force per unit area--","85":"Exactly. You know sometimes you want to have all of your energy not just in a small area but in the small volume and so one of the other dimensions is time or length. But with light, time and length are the same thing because light always travels at the speed of light.","86":"But if you send a one second long light pulse out into the skies there, the beginning of the pulse is actually two thirds of the way to the moon. It's 300,000 kilometers long. So now, if you talk about light being concentrated, that doesn't seem very concentrated. The type of lasers I play with in my lab will be no thicker than this piece of paper. So we take that energy that might be in three hundred thousand kilometers and we squeeze it all the way down into just this piece of paper and actually the beams are more the size of this piece of paper and so, in my lab, pieces of paper like this would be flying through the sky but we can't see them. 'Cos they don't come in our eyes, they fly by us and they're infra red.","87":"Exactly. And so now, if we have light like that that we wanna machine with. I bring this funnel and so, if we had a lens here and the light was coming down--","88":"Into a spot. So here would be my light coming from my laser and it would just be coming down, down, down, down, down. Hit a lens and it would have to focus down. But now, all the light started out with this big of a spread so concentrated this much. Eventually it would be here, more concentrated. But by the end, right at the focal spot, that's when I get all of my light, all of the energy has been squeezed down into fitting inside this piece of paper and that's why I say that I built a laser hammer. Because when this hits a piece of glass, it just smacks hose electrons right off the atoms and there's nothing else for them to do, they have to fly away. So can you tell me what you learned and maybe about the focusing of the light?","89":"You know, everybody's been just coming at it from different wavelengths at the optical infrared, and, but definitely the X-rays has been one of those things where it's like, oh, finally.","90":"You try, we all gotta try. You've probably heard about sleep as this kind of, you know, it's a biological process that happens in your brain. It's really important for your body, but it's a lot more complex than that. Sleep is made up of different parts. You know, when you think about sleep, what do you think about?","91":"So our sleep is made up of different types, okay? The first one is called non-rapid eye movement sleep, or non-REM, okay? Or NREM. And then the other one, which might not be a surprise, is called REM. Rapid eye movement sleep. And those are the two main types of sleep that happen. The way that we measure that as a sleep scientist is that we'll actually bring people into the lab where they can do this at home, where we put electrodes on their scalp while they're sleeping, and that allows us to measure the brain activity that's going on during the night.","92":"When we measure all of that, we're able to see how much time someone's asleep, and how many times they wake up and stuff during the night. You know, we're also really interested in kind of, the amount of non-REM sleep someone gets and the amount of REM sleep that someone gets, because each part of those types of sleep do different things for the body. And so it's important to get both of those. And so within non-REM sleep, there are three stages ranging from N-1 to N-2 to N-3. So not particularly clever in our naming, but that's how we know what stages they are. And what they do is it moves from lightest to deepest sleep, okay? N-1, it's more kind of light, wakefulness sleep, kind of in and out of sleeping. Then you go into N-2, which is where we spend 45 to 55 percent of our sleep. And it's more this kind of light sleep, but then we get into kind of the really restorative sleep, and that's N-3. And in N-3, when we look at someone's EEG wave, we see these big slow waves, and it's called slow wave sleep. And so we spend about 20% of our sleep in slow wave sleep, though it can vary on a day to day.","93":"Okay? So we wake up a lot during the night, and we just don't remember it. And you'll go back down into deep sleep, and then up again into REM, you know, in kinda these cycles.","94":"Okay. Usually we want to keep naps, like 20 to 30 minutes. When people drop into deep sleep, and then they're woken up out of a nap, most people report that they feel way worse than they did before they took the nap, and that's because you've been in deep sleep, and it's this term called sleep inertia. So what are the stages of sleep?","95":"I think to really get deep into nanomaterials and nanoscale devices, you really have to understand to some level, quantum mechanics. What it teaches us as we make these devices smaller and smaller, their properties begin to now depend on the size and the orientation of these devices. There are materials, and you're taking a 2D materials class, you know about this, that are intrinsically thin. As they're grown, as they're fabricated, they're already at the nanoscale and they possess these quantum confinement properties that as a nanotechnologist, you try to exploit. And so the first ones I wanted to talk to you about are quantum dots, have you heard of quantum dots before?","96":"So these are typically semiconductors. They can be cadmium selenide cadmium sulfide, zinc selenide and they're small clusters of atoms. They can be from 2 to 10 nanometers. What's interesting about these materials?","97":"That's correct. Yeah. Because of quantum confinement, once you get below this 15 nanometer range, the band gap of the material depends completely on the size of the material. So in bulk materials, if you want to change the band gap, you have to change the material, right? But in these quantum dots specifically, just by changing the size, you can change their band gap. And because their band gap is changing, their optical properties are different. And you can precisely tune the wavelength of light that they emit just by changing their size.","98":"The optical applications are in development. The science has really been worked out. The health stuff, because of all of the things you have to consider when you're putting something in someone's body is definitely further out there. For example, some of them are made from cadmium. Cadmium's toxic. You would never put that in someone's body. But there are other materials like gold and silver and titanium dioxide, which are less toxic and people are exploring using those. So have you learned about graphene?","99":"Carbon nanotube, right. So if you roll up graphene, depending on how you roll it and the angle, you roll it with, it has different properties. So if I roll it one way, it'll act like a metal. If I roll it a different way, it'll act like a semiconductor. The one that gets everyone most excited is that the electrons and holes move very fast through graphene. And so there's a lot of interest in using these for certain types of high-speed electronics. The other interesting application is because it's one atom thin, it's very sensitive to changes in the environment. And so there's a lot of interest in using them as diagnostics. It's on us researchers to find ways to A, control that process and then B, to actually build some sort of interesting technology from them.","100":"You're speaking my language. This is what I spent many years of my life working on. You don't physically roll up graphene. You grow nanotubes by basically taking nanocrystals and you deposit them on a surface. And then you do a CVD process, chemical vapor deposition. So you basically flow in a carbon source, the carbon dissolves in a nanocrystal and then once nanocrystal is saturated, the nanotubes precipitate out of them in tubes. Then you have to develop ways to go into this pile of nanotubes and pull out exactly the ones that you want. So I have to find ways to program them to go exactly in the places that I want. I modify the surface of the nanotube with specific molecules that recognize one type of surface over another. And then I just pattern the surface and the tubes just land exactly where we want them to. And it's still very much in the research stage. The ultimate goal is to build functional high-speed electronics using these new materials.","101":"It's just pretty lights. [laughing] But now that you suggested it, these were inspired by the array of quantum dots that we showed earlier. So that's the story I'm going to stick with. [laughing] I like it.","102":"So machine learning is a way that we teach computers to learn things about the world by looking at patterns and looking at examples of things. So can I show you an example of how a machine might learn something?","103":"This one's a jackal. And it's actually a kind of dog. But you made a good guess. That's what machines do too. They make guesses. Is this a cat or a dog?","104":"And so, you did something pretty amazing there. Because we asked the question, Is it a cat or a dog? And you said, I disagree with your question. It's a human. So machine learning is when we teach machines to make guesses about what things are based on looking at a lot of different examples. And I build products that use machine learning to learn about the world and make guesses about things in the world. When we try to teach machines to recognize things like cats and dogs, it takes a lot of examples. We have to show them tens of thousands or even millions of examples before they can get even close to as good at it as you are. Do you have tests in school?","105":"Which means that in the test, you're not seeing any problems that you don't know how to solve. As long as you did all your practice, right?","106":"Yes, we're gonna talk about science and we're gonna talk about a very specific kinda science, about people who study brains. Do you know what a brain is? What is it?","107":"Okay, well there's more cells in your brain, like way more cells, than all the stars we can see. (Daniel gasps) (Bobby laughs) And so what the connectome is, is we'd like to know where every cell in your brain is and how it talks to every other cell in your brain.","108":"We're also scratching the surface of, like, what is possible? It's not necessarily just the system itself and not necessarily that algorithm itself. Like you said, you don't necessarily need to attack the math in some cases. You can just attack that check. And I think something that's been pretty cool is looking at higher energy particles. It's going to be maybe hard to entirely confirm, but I think it'd be really, really cool to actually see. Like, I want to see one of these faults because I haven't seen it myself. And also, how do you know that you've seen it? I've started playing with, like, setting up a cloud chamber. A cloud chamber lets you actually view high energy particles going through sort of like in a small jar with some evaporated alcohol. And I thought it'd be really cool if we put some memory chip in there, like a basic memory chip and we just fill it with some data, but then you put a camera on that area and you just watch. Assuming that there is a high energy particle that actually hits that memory, that should potentially flip the energy state of that bit. The outside microcontrollers should be able to read that and actually say, Oh wait, the data, even though I'm not changing data, I'm only reading data, and we should be able to visibly or optically see it. What I'm wondering is could that be a next area of research? Because I don't think anyone's actually looking at intentionally injecting high energy particles to take over a computer, when really, you know, that's another technique for fault injection, technically speaking.","109":"The thing is, even if you know about that, then there's so many others that someone won't necessarily know about, because there's so many, I guess, potential areas for a fault to occur. Where do you think security is going or new research is going? Are there any new areas you think are coming out or are going to be more interesting, you know, pretty soon?","110":"For me, I think the things that have been recent and super interesting are typically down to physics-level effects that maybe we haven't seen before. I think my mind was blown with the, there was the light commands research, and they were able to modulate sound, although it's purely over light using a laser, they would hit the MEMS microphone, and it was picking that up and was able to then interpret it and essentially take control over light.","111":"You got, pretty much, you got a very good idea about it. Basically you have a star, at the core its generating energy, which is countering the pressure of all that mass trying, being pulled in by gravity. Once it can't generate that energy anymore, the core collapses, once the core is collapsing, it keeps collapsing, and collapsing, and collapsing, and that's the critical thing that makes a black hole. You have enough mass in the volume, such that the escaped velocity becomes the speed of light, once light can't escape, hence the black part. (laughs) But that's the thing, is that just because there's an intense amount of gravity very close to a black hole, things don't start behaving differently. And my favorite analogy is a vacuum, everybody thinks, like, if you point a vacuum cleaner at something, it's just gonna suck everything in--","112":"I wouldn't call them educational, but the movie Interstellar actually had, as one of the people involved in both writing it, and as a science advisor, Dr. Kip Thorne, who's a Professor at Caltech, who was part of the team that detected gravitational waves, and just won a Nobel Prize for it. So he made sure to try and get it as accurate as possible, so Interstellar, I think, is one of the best examples of getting black holes right.","113":"It's, there're multiple theories, there's observational evidence, more than some other theories that are really feeding into this because now we have the instrumentation, both in X-rays and infrared, in particular, because we don't have a direct optical line of sight to the center of our galaxy because there's just a lot of dust in the way. But the infrared can penetrate the dust, the X-rays can penetrate the dust, the radio can penetrate all of that dust, so by combining all of these different wavelengths, people are really coming to a point of okay, how is this happening, by looking at different wavelengths of light, we can get a better sense, but they're still working on the theory, it's not all done.","114":"Right. And so, to say that another way, when you're collecting data from the real world and then building machine learning systems that automate decisions based on that data, all of the biases and problems that are already in the real world then can be magnified through that machine learning system. And so, it can make many of these problems much worse.","115":"And so, it's not just the provenance of that data, but it's, sort of, deeply understanding, Why does it look the way it looks? Why was it collected this way? What are the limitations of it? We need to think about that in entire process, how we document that process. This is an issue in companies where somebody might create something that even their peers can't recreate.","116":"These are great questions. So things like actuarial science, operations research, where they actually are not using machine learning as much as you might think. And then you have other sorts of companies or on the FinTech side, or even the ad tech side of things where they perhaps are using machine learning to the point of even absurdity.","117":"I am incredibly optimistic and not... Perhaps it's a personality flaw, but I can't help but look at the potential of the technology to reduce harm, to give us information that help us make better decisions. And to think that we would choose to address the big problems ahead of us. I don't think we have a hope of addressing them without figuring out the role that machine learning will play. And to think that we would then choose not to do that is just unthinkable.","118":"The thing that makes them cool is they're sort of like tilings, it looks like you could put this together by cutting little pieces of paper and sliding them together, but they're still one sheet.","119":"Mm-hmm. Each of these folds is peaked like a mountain and we call these mountain folds but if I made it the other way, then it's shaped this way and we call it a valley fold. In all of origami there's just mountains and valleys.","120":"So they're all reversible and it turns out that in every origami shape that folds flat, it's going to be either three mountains and a valley or, if we're looking at the backside, three valleys and a mountain, they always differ by two.","121":"That's a rule of all flat origami no matter how many folds come together at a point and I'm going to show you a building block of tessellations, it's called a twist because that center square, as I unfold it, it twists, it rotates.","122":"If I had another twist in the same sheet of paper I could make these folds connect with that, and these folds connect with that. And if I had another one up here, I could make all three. And if I had a square array and all the folds lined up I could make bigger and bigger arrays, like these, because these are just very large twists. In this case it's an octagon rather than a square, but they're arranged in rows and columns. And let's just try going along. All right, there is our tessellation with squares and hexagons. So you have now designed and folded your first origami tessellation and perhaps you can see how just using this idea of building up tiles and small building blocks you could make tessellations as big and complex as you want.","123":"Awesome, good. (laughs) It's a map of all the connections between every neuron in your brain. It literally, in a human brain, something like a map of the one quadrillion connections that a hundred billion neurons make with each other.","124":"We have to use electron microscopes and then what we have been developing a way to slice the brain into really thin slices, use an electron microscope to take a picture of each slice, and then use computers to put it all back. Imagine that we could get a map of every connection, right? And we knew how neurons fire. Do you think we could put that in a computer, that map, and then therefore, that computer should be able to think just like the brain that we extracted it from?","125":"Neurons are also digital. Meaning a Neuron either fires or it doesn't fire, so that's either one or zero. And it's the combination of those ones or zeros that actually produce the 10 thousand different answers that you say.","126":"So fortunately there's, I'm also doing it from space with the Spitzer Space Telescope, so particularly in the infrared, and my main interest has been to try and study the environment around the super massive black holes, not as close as where the X-rays are coming from, but clearly there's something from the X-ray corona that illuminates the rest of the accretion disk, and the dust that's further out. And so fundamentally, that's one of the key things that I'm trying to use, is trying to see how long, once you've got this sort of pulse that's generated close to the black hole, it propagates out, and so you can use optical wavelengths to see that the accretion disk lights up in the optical a little bit as it gets heated up from the X-ray, and then later on, the infrared dust, the dust absorbs it, and emits it in the infrared. And so that, I love that, the ability to exchange time for resolution, because these structures are so far away that we're never gonna get a telescope big enough where that has the resolution to see the accretion disk, or the dust distribution around--","127":"Yeah, again, we don't know exactly where X, Y, Z, zero is, we're assuming that it's something, you know, the X-rays that are coming out are very close to the event horizon of the black hole, but this is still, you know, your realm of X-rays, to really figure out those kinds of things. But once the X-rays, once the photons hit the corona, and are re-scattered, and up, energized, and then they start illuminating the accretion disk, it heats it up, and so just by the light travel time, when the optical, if it gets, you know, brighter and fainter, and then the infrared gets brighter and fainter, two weeks later, then the dust is two light weeks away from that. So it's a one dimensional one, so we're averaging, so we don't get the two dimensional, or even three dimensional one. And then we've done it now, of course, we have better telescopes, there was a project where you could do it with the Hubble Space Telescope and the ultraviolet, you used the Swift Observatory, which had optical and ultraviolet, and then from ground base, we did optical, and then from space we did it with Spitzer and the infrared. So you could actually see this bright flash go off in a nearby AGN called NGC5548, and then you see it propagate as it warms up the disk, as all that light is falling onto it, and then eventually you hit the, the, further away, where the dust is, and the dust tends to radiate in an infrared. So we got basically a structure, and you just, you see this flashbulb go off, and then it illuminates, effectively, the structure.","128":"So you do see it, basically the dust sublimation radius, and you see it at, and it tells you, depending on what kind of dust it is, and it's actually one of the problems for me studying, whenever we try and do X-ray studies of low luminosity active galactic nuclei in your, by galaxies, because there're all these X-ray binaries that are also emitting X-rays, which make our lives difficult. But they're also in black holes, when it's this really interesting sort of both, it's great, but ugh, it's also a source of noise for those of us who are trying to do X-ray observations of nearby galaxies.","129":"And this goes to the idea that you don't have a core balance, that a supernova with a black hole as its final result, actually never has any kind of expulsion, that it all just goes. (imitates sucking)","130":"Which was one idea, but again, it's, I'll leave this to your theoreticians, I think there are problems with that, as well. I call it job security. That's right. (both laugh) We have a lot of things about black holes, both in terms of their formation, or even how they exist as they are, and how they're interacting with their environment that we're still not understanding.","131":"Do you think there are going to be general principles that guide those decisions? Because right now, it's generally up to the machine learning engineer to decide what tools they want to apply.","132":"If you train a model off of language off the internet, it sometimes says uncomfortable things or inappropriate things and sometimes really biased things. Have you ever run into this yourself? And then how do you think about that problem of potentially even measuring the bias in a model that we've trained?","133":"I imagine in the last few years, we've seen a lot of changes and improvements in the capabilities of NLP systems. So is there anything in that that you're particularly excited about exploring further?","134":"So when we think about quantum mechanics, we think about particles and their quantum charges in the Feynman way, the way that Feynman taught us. They come in and they exchange a force carrier and then they come out again, so that's how we think of an electron and light scattering, for instance, or something like that. And the language that Einstein gave us is so different. It's completely geometric, it's all this space-time. And it's also unnecessary.","135":"So do you think there's some sense in which we shouldn't be thinking about individual universes, individual space-time, so we should be thinking about superpositions of space-times?","136":"So when we're talking about the multiverse or the Big Bang, we are really talking about gravity ultimately, and we're talking about how a theory of gravitation which we know think of as a theory of space-time has a quantum explanation, has a quantum paradigm imposed on it that will help us understand these things, and we don't have that yet. One of the things that I think is so amazing is that the terrains in which we're going to understand quantum gravity are very few. It's the Big Bang, because that's where we know that quantum and gravity both were called into action. And there's black holes. One of the most interesting discoveries is of course Hawking's discovery, kick-started a kind of crisis, right? In thinking about why quantum mechanics and gravity were so knocking heads. It was one of the most beautiful examples.","137":"This idea that the darkest phenomenon in the universe actually is forced to radiate quantum particles is pretty wild. I think everyone understood that it was a correct calculation, but I don't think a lot of people understood the implications, that it meant something really terrible was happening. Because this black hole, which could have been made of who knows what, is disappearing into these quantum particles which, in some sense, have nothing to do with the material that went in. So do you think that's a big crisis? The black hole evaporates, the information is lost?","138":"So this is a huge crisis 'cause either quantum mechanics is wrong, and as you described it, it's the most accurately-tested paradigm in the history of physics, how could it be wrong, right? Or the event horizon is letting information out and violating one of the most sacred principles of relativity.","139":"Do you think it's possible that gravity is really ultimately just quantum mechanics and doesn't exist at all in the fundamental ways that we've been talking about so far, like the Newtonian way and the space-time way, that those are just these kind of macroscopic illusions? Sometimes I talk about it in terms of temperature. Temperature is not a thing. There is no single thing called temperature. It's a macroscopic illusion that comes from the collective behavior, really quantum behavior of random motions of atoms. And is it possible that the whole of gravity is some kind of emergent illusion from what's really quantum phenomenon underlying it?","140":"I mean, temperature is still great to talk about. It doesn't mean we shouldn't talk about temperature. I mean, we should absolutely adjust our thermostats and talk about temperature. But if we look at it closer and closer and closer, we realize there's not a thing in the world that has as a quantum value temperature, isolated. And so maybe there is no such thing as gravity isolated from quantum mechanics.","141":"Okay, so we'll do some, but I want to tell you a little bit about origami. Most origami follows two, I'll call them customs, almost like rules. It's usually from a square and the other is it's usually folded with no cuts. So these guys are folded from an uncut square.","142":"Okay. We're going to start with a model that every Japanese person learns in kindergarten, it's called a crane, traditional origami design, it's over 400 years old. So, people have been doing what we're about to do for 400 years.","143":"Let's fold it in half from corner to corner, unfold it and then we'll fold it in half the other direction, also corner to corner but we're going to lift it up and we're going to hold the fold with both hands. We're going to bring these corners together, making a little pocket and then, this is the trickiest part of this whole design, so you're going to put your finger underneath the top layer and we're going to try to make that layer fold right along the edge. Now you see how the sides kind of want to come in as you're doing that?","144":"Now, this is a traditional Japanese design but there are origami designs that have been around so long we're not entirely sure where they originated. We're going to learn how to fold a cootie catcher.","145":"So we'll start with the white side up and we're going to fold it in half from corner to corner, in one fold and now we're going to fold all four corners to the crossing point in the center. We'll fold it in half like a book. On the folded side we'll take one of the folded corners and I'm going to fold it up through all layers. There's a pocket in the middle. We're going to spread the pocket and bring all four corners together. Where you have original corners of the square, we're gonna just pop those out. This is one of the most satisfying moments, I think-","146":"There's thousands of other origami designs but these are some of the first people learn and this was, in fact, one of the first origami designs I learned some 50 years ago.","147":"A lot of people are seeing blockchain in the news and maybe seeing a lot of sort of initial coin offerings (laughs) and sort of monetization opportunity around blockchain and getting very excited about it. And some of that excitement is real and should be, you know, encouraged, but some of it is also hype. How do you feel about the hype cycle around blockchain today?","148":"It will develop. It will take five years. It will take 10 years. That kind of time is necessary. One of the areas that brought me to supply chain research is the fact that we're not just gonna see blockchain emerge. We're gonna see artificial intelligence continue to evolve. We're gonna see connective devices and this sort of growing internet of things and machinery that can do a lot more and have a wallet and transact on their own. And so I actually think a lot of where blockchain and other technologies are headed is this interesting synergy that will help us elevate the kinds of institutions we've used in the past and cobbled together to create that identifiable, verifiable trust.","149":"In that it's hard to compare it to some perfect future. Just like you compare autonomous vehicles to this very high standard because machines are doing it. It should be perfect. There should be zero car deaths.","150":"When you say, well, there's hundreds of thousands, millions of car deaths on the road due to human error today. I think we're in a similar place. We're going to see problems with this technology, and we are going to need to develop multiple kinds of standards that also have some flexibility. But it's going to also be a version, a system, that allows us to fix some of the things that are broken today.","151":"Yeah, it's crazy. They're really a lot of bad or malicious hackers out there who are doing just that. They're going into people's accounts and they're stealing money, but there's also another side of computer hacking where there are people who are trying to learn how those bad hackers are actually breaking in to the bank accounts.","152":"Yeah, exactly. They're looking for ways that they can create protection. It's kind of like the lock on your front door. That lock is to essentially prevent bad people from coming in or people accidentally coming in when they shouldn't. A hacker is essentially looking at a way, how can I get into this lock? But then there are the good ones who are trying to unlock it so that they can tell the company that made the lock, hey, we can actually protect people by making the lock a little harder.","153":"In many cases, they'll send them a new lock. So it's an upgraded, better version. Sometimes that's new features, but sometimes that's bug fixes and ways to protect you as well.","154":"That's a very good point. You should definitely make sure that you're obeying the law. They might work with the lock company and say, I'm trying to improve your product. And they're trying to find these holes or problems, and then share that with the company. Even though the good hacker is doing exactly the same thing as the bad hacker, it's the same exact skillset, and you're using the same exact techniques and information to try to break that lock, but your goal as a good hacker is really to help everyone like you and me to make sure that our stuff is protected. So hopefully they don't get in trouble because they're the good guys.","155":"I started going on the computer and playing video games, but I had some ideas of my own, and that's where I started to learn how to hack. I wanted to play with my friends on this video game and just change the way that things look.","156":"That's entirely possible. They may have done it for a reason, but you may have come up with a really good idea that, do you think there are other people who might like the idea that you came up with?","157":"When you have creative ideas like that, hacking can actually allow you to change the way a system works, and that means you can change a game and how the game is played, and then you can share that with your friends and other people who like that game. Once I started learning how to do it, I found that, things that were harder for me, I could make easier.","158":"You know, you're right. When you read about some of these technologies, it does feel like science fiction. But the part of nanotechnology I wanted to talk to you about is stuff that you probably use every day, most of your day, all of the time. Can you guess what aspect of nanotechnology I'm gonna talk to you about?","159":"So this is a silicon wafer, and they're embedded in basically almost every object that you use, from a laptop, to a phone, to cars, television sets, appliances. We ended up cutting these into little squares and those repeating patterns, each of those is a processor. And those chips are what goes into all of these objects. What I want to talk to you about is how we got from where we started, and how we're able to actually fit 18 billion of these little devices in a little one inch by one inch area. They're called transistors. It's a switch. Very simply, think of it as a light switch that turns on and turns off using an electric field by applying a voltage.","160":"Exactly. So these are made using a technique called lithography. You basically coat the silicon wafer with a polymer. Then you put a mask on it and then you shine light through it. And the features of the mask, the size of those holes determine the feature size in the chip. It's not just the size of the mask that matters. It's the wavelength of the light that's used. We talked about nanotechnology being science fiction before, but this is real stuff that's being produced, that's being made, that's being used every day by people.","161":"That's probably a good idea, maybe somebody else likes it more than you do. So normally, when people trade, they have to go to the store, or they have to know the person so they can get what they asked for. With blockchain, you can make that exact same trade, but you don't need the store, and you don't even necessarily need to know the other person.","162":"So on code.org, one of the things you've been doing is actually building a game or that they have a game and then you can actually rewire some of the inputs and outputs of that. Is that right?","163":"That's absolutely another input that exists on your computer. That's how I try to think of things is there's just a bunch of inputs. Often, if you're trying to break something or hack something, you're really saying, okay, how can I control these inputs in a way that wasn't necessarily expected?","164":"It just depends what you're trying to do. In some cases, it could literally be seconds because you already know how the system works, and other times, it could be years. So what have you learned about hacking?","165":"In a weird way, that is gravity pulling it. So have you ever had a yo-yo where you swing it around like this? The string is pulling it in at all times, but you've also given it this angular momentum. And as long as you give it the angular momentum, pulling it in actually keeps it in orbit. And so the Earth is pulling it in at all times, so that's why it doesn't just travel off in a straight line. It keeps coming back around. So it's funny, people think that the International Space Station is so far away that they're not feeling gravity, and that's not the case at all. They're absolutely feeling gravity. They're just cruising so fast that, even though they're being pulled in, they never get pulled to the surface.","166":"Yeah. You ever had that experience where you're sitting in a train and the other one moves and for a second you're not sure if you're the one moving?","167":"That's because in some sense, you're really not. Imagine you're in this train and it's going near the speed of light relative to the platform, but it's so smooth, then you should be in a situation in which there's no meaning to your absolute motion, there's no absolute motion. So that if you throw a ball up, you might think from the outside of the platform, be confused that when gravity pulls that back down, it's gonna hit you or something, but it'll land in your palm as surely as if you were in your living room.","168":"So, let's say you and Marina are floating in space and you can't tell who's moving. Let's say you both see a flash of light. A flash of light comes from somewhere, you don't know where. So you measure the speed of light to be 300,000 kilometers per second. But here comes Marina and she's racing at the light pulse, as far as you can tell. Two cars driving towards each other seem like they're going faster towards each other than somebody who's standing still relative to one of the cars, right?","169":"[laughs] That's exactly right. It kinda is like recharging your battery, right? And sleep is so critical for so many parts of our body and our mind, right? It plays a really important way that we learn, and it helps us kind of recover from the day before. It affects our immune system and our metabolism, all of these things that we need to kinda be healthy.","170":"And so what's really cool about this is that giraffes need to sleep like everybody else, and so the way that it does is it kind of slumps over and it gets down on its legs and it kind of becomes this ball, but what's crazy about the whole thing is they only sleep for like 30 minutes a day. 30 minutes! Because it can't waste any more time, because it can't be vulnerable for any longer. It can get eaten by lions and that kind of thing. It has kind of evolved in a way that it can still survive and still get all the restoration it needs under such a short period of time.","171":"So we think it works the same way, but maybe just like more efficiently. And so we're still really learning about how this works. Sleep science itself is kind of a new field.","172":"Really tired. Do you think you were a little crankier than usual? Yeah. That's actually really interesting, because what happens is humans and everything needs to sleep eventually, and so you can't stay up indefinitely, right? What do you think happens if you don't sleep?","173":"Right, right! So how do they do it? In the area that they live in, they need to stay cool, right? And so they spend a lot of time in the water, and so then as a consequence, they need to sleep in the water, but how do they do it? So it's really fascinating. What they do is while they're sleeping, they actually float back up to the surface and breathe without waking up. They're able to go about their whole sleep cycles but still able to breathe, because their body has adapted in a way that they can still get the oxygen that they need. It's a really amazing thing. What do you think?","174":"So now I want to talk about our last animal, and I think this one is probably the most amazing of all. Okay, so what's this?","175":"A dolphin! Yes. So dolphins, kind of like hippos, have to sleep in the water, okay? But because they're mammals, right, they need to breathe. Dolphins breathe air. They have to go up to the surface and breathe, right? And for an animal like that, it needs to figure out a way that it can sleep but also still survive, right? You know how dolphins sleep?","176":"One half of their brain at a time. So half of their brain goes to sleep, and the other half stays awake, so that they can continue to breathe and swim, and they do it in this four hours a time, so like their right part of their brain sleeps, they're able to go up to the surface and breathe. Then their left part of their brain sleeps for four hours, and it goes back and forth, back and forth, so they can kind of maintain alertness, still breathe, and survive. Is that amazing or what?","177":"Nano is kind of a funny word, right? It's a word that's used before another word, and it means one billion. What's the smallest object you can think of?","178":"A baby ant? Very good. So I have over here a meter stick, let me show it to you. And so that's a meter and if I divide it by 1000, I get a millimeter. So milli just means 1000. There's all these little lines on the ruler. And each of those little lines is one millimeter. So a baby ant is probably a couple of millimeters. So even the thing, that's the smallest thing you can think of, it's a million times bigger than a nanometer. Tiny, tiny, tiny.","179":"That was a perfect explanation. But what if I told you that scientists invented a special type of microscope that not only lets you see atoms, but also lets you move them around and build things with them. Would you think that would be pretty cool?","180":"So it's called a scanning tunneling microscope. And not only can you see the atoms, but you can move them around. Atoms are kind of sticky. You can actually build things using this instrument with actual individual atoms. So if I gave you that machine, would you want to make something? Would you want to look at something very carefully?","181":"I study it because objects that are that small have really interesting properties. They behave completely different than objects that are big. And because of that, we can build really cool things with them. Like really fast computers, for example, or new types of batteries or new types of solar cells. And a lot of nanotechnology is kind of like playing with Legos. You take these small objects and you put them together to build something new. Something interesting that no one's built before. It's like Legos for scientists.","182":"You know an interesting topic is: what are the limits to what we can do with virtual reality? Where I'm pretty pleased with what we have today. What we can show people and say virtual reality, its cool. People get an amazing response from it. But we're still clearly a very, very long ways from reality.","183":"Mostly in VR we talk about the display and optics, the visual side of things, but we should at least tick off the other senses. And haptics is an interesting thing about virtual reality really doesn't have that aspect of touching things. You can move your hands around, you can do everything but its a disconnected experience because you know you don't have an actual solidity there. And I am pessimistic about progress in haptics technology. Almost all other areas I'm an optimist and I'm excited about what's coming up, but I don't have any brilliant vision about how we're going to revolutionize haptics and make it feel like we're touching the things in the virtual world.","184":"Yeah, that is one potential quality improvement that is still on the horizon is when we do spatialization, we use HRTF, the Head Relative Transfer Function, to make it sound like its in different places. But usually we just use this one kind of generic, here's your average human, HRTF function. Its possible, that of course, if you are right in the average then its perfect for you. But there's always people off to the extremes, that it doesn't do a very good job at. And there may be better ways to allow people to sample their own perfect HRTF which can improve the audio experience a lot. It all comes down to all these trade-offs.","185":"There was a huge concern about that at Oculus. And the term internally that went around was poisoning the well. They were very, very concerned. I mean for a long time there was a fight about whether gear VR should even be done, because the worry was if we let a product go out, like gear VR that didn't have those things. That if somebody saw it and it was bad, made them sick, made their eyes hurt, then they would be like I'm never going to try VR again. I tried it that time and it was terrible. And there was legitimate arguments about whether it was even a good idea to do that. And it turned out that yes, its obviously better to have all those things, but you can still do something that's valuable for the user without it. Its weird being at the beginning of a medium like this.","186":"So, when you say it's an inverse-square law, that means that the closer you are, the more strongly you feel the gravitational pull. And that makes sense. There's very few things that are stronger when you're further apart.","187":"So you can also think of a gravitational field, something that permeates all of space. Even though the earth is three stories below us, it's not as though it's pulling at us from a distance. We're actually interacting with the field at this point and there's a real interaction right here at this point. And that's nice, because people were worried that if things acted at a distance, that the way that old-fashioned inverse-square force law describes it, that it was as spooky as mind-bending a spoon, that it was like telekinesis. If you don't touch something, how do you affect it? And so the first step was to start to think of gravity as a field that permeates all of a space. And it's weaker very far from the Earth and it's closer very close to the Earth. So one way to think of this field as a field that's really describing a curved space-time that is everywhere. Forget the difficulty of the math, just the intuition comes from two kind of simple observations. One was what Einstein described as the happiest thought of his life. So, right now, you might feel heavy in your chair, and we might feel heavy on the floor and our feet, or standing in an elevator cab. And Einstein said, what does the chair have to do with it, or the floor, or the elevator? Those aren't gravitational objects. So he wanted to eliminate them, and one way to do the thought experiment is to imagine standing in an elevator that you can see out of, a black box. And imagine the cable is cut and you and the elevator begin to fall.","188":"You're in total free fall. Now, because things fall at the same rate, including the elevator and you, you can actually float in the elevator. If you just floated in the elevator, the two of you would drop, and you might not even know you're falling. You could take an apple and drop it in front of you, and it would float in front of you. You would actually experience weightlessness. It's called the equivalence principle. It was Einstein's happiest thought that what you're really doing when you're experiencing gravity isn't being heavy in your chair, it's falling weightlessly in the gravitational field. And that was the first step, to think of gravity as weightlessness and falling.","189":"You can make somebody look like they're in the International Space Station by flying up in a plane and then just free-falling, the plane just drops out of the air. And while it's falling, they will float weightlessly, and there's been a lot of experiments about it, but you don't want it to end unhappily, so the plane has to scoop back up, and then you see them become pinned to the floor of the plane, because then the plane is interrupting their fall. So that's the first thought, and then the next is, what is the shape that's chased? So if you were floating in empty space, really empty space, and you had an apple, and you threw the apple, what shape do you think it would chase, the path?","190":"Yeah, it would chase a curve, it would chase an arc. And the faster you throw it, the kind of longer the arc. So the second step to think about curved space-time is to say that when things fall freely around a body like the Earth, they trace curved paths, as though space-time itself, space itself was curved.","191":"You went, Oh. [Janna and Lisa laugh] So, that's the intuition, that's how Einstein gets from thinking that space-time is curved from the idea that, well, there's this field that permeates all of space, and what is really describing is the curves that things fall along. And from there, it's a very long path to finding the mathematics and the right description, that's really hard. But that intuition is so elegant and so beautiful and just comes from these two simple thought experiments.","192":"So you described learning in a class about light the theory of special relativity where Einstein is really adhering to the constancy of the speed of light and questioning the absolute nature of space and time. And it seems like that has nothing to do with gravity, but he later begins to think about the incompatibility of gravity with his theory of relativity. So suppose the Sun were to disappear tomorrow. Some evil genius comes and just figures out a way to evaporate the Sun. In Newton's understanding of gravity, we would instantaneously know about it all the way over here at the Earth. And that's incompatible with the concept that nothing can travel faster than the speed of light. No information, not even information about the Sun, could possibly travel faster than the speed of light. So we shouldn't know about what happened to the Sun for a full eight minutes, which is the time it would take light to travel to us. And so he begins to question why gravity is so incompatible with relativity, but he already knows he's thinking about space and time in relativity. So then he gets to his general theory of relativity where he realizes if I eliminate everything but just the gravitational field of let's say the Earth and I look at how things fall and I see that they follow curves, well, then he realizes that space and time don't just contract or dilate, that they can really warp, that they can bend and that they can curve. And then he finds a way to make gravity compatible with relativity by saying if the Sun were to disappear tomorrow, the curves that the Sun imprinted in space-time would actually begin to ripple, and those are the gravitational waves, and they would change and they would flatten out, 'cause the Sun was no longer there. And that would take the light-travel time to get to us to tell us that the Sun was gone, and then we would stop orbiting and just travel along a straight line.","193":"It does. In fact, one way that different universes might be created and be different from each other is that different universes could have effectively different numbers of dimensions. Like we have three dimensions around us, but there's people out there, aliens, who could live in five dimensional universes.","194":"We think that it would be, no all of this is incredibly speculative, and we don't know for sure. But the idea is that there is some deep down underlying laws that are universal and the same, but they show up differently, so they appear different. So the specific particles and forces and masses would be completely different in different parts of the multiverse.","195":"That's the good news. The bad news is that it only seems to work if spacetime is ten dimensional. [chuckles] So you would say well then it's wrong. It can't be right. Spacetime is not ten-dimensional. Spacetime is four dimensional. We've observed that. But instead, we say if spacetime looks four dimensional to us, but string theory, which might be the best theory we have of quantum gravity says it must be ten dimensional, maybe we can hide those extra six dimensions somehow. So here's how we could get lucky. We could imagine that there are extra dimensions of space that are curled up somehow that are so small that we can't see them. This is actually an old idea. It goes back to Kaluza and Klein right after general relativity was invented in 1915. But there's a more recent idea that says there could actually be relatively large extra dimensions. There could be extra dimensions that are actually that big, like a millimeter across that you would not have noticed. But here's the new, exciting idea. So let's imagine, okay. This is a piece of paper. But let's imagine this is our entire world. So, in other words, our real world is three dimensional, but let's imagine that we're just idealizing it down to two dimensions, so we all live here. You and I live here. But let's imagine that we're embedded in this bigger space. So there are extra dimensions that are actually big, okay? And let's imagine that. When I say we live on this three dimensional world what I mean is imagine that the particles that you and I are made of, right, the quarks, the leptons, the electrons and everything, all the forces we know about, electromagnetism, the weak nuclear force, the strong nuclear force, imagine they can't leave this surface. This is what we call a brane. B-R-A-N-E. Have you heard this word before?","196":"From membranes, you know. We have lines, one dimension. We have two dimensional surfaces. So if you have a line that is a vibrating physical thing, you call it a string, right?","197":"If you have a two dimensional surface that vibrates and is a physical thing, we call that a membrane. Membrane theory goes back, it never was as popular as string theory, but it's been around for a while. But if you had extra dimensions of space, then you can three dimensional vibrating things, and four dimensional vibrating things.","198":"Yes, string theory's even better. So the phrase Grand Unified Theory was coined in the 1970s for theories that joined electricity and magnetism. So a good string theory is gravity plus the Grand Unified Theory.","199":"It's even better. It's the theory of everything. What would you tell a friend of yours if they asked you what dimensions are, what extra dimensions are, what a brane is?","200":"Yeah, that's exactly right. And you can append it. You can sort of add new information that's more current, but you can't actually go erase anything.","201":"We're gonna have to create entire new concepts of how they do trade and how they work with us, too. What kind of barriers or road blocks would you imagine are gonna happen in the blockchain space?","202":"Yeah. One of the problems that Bitcoin has faced is Bitcoins getting stolen or lost. But a lot of that actually comes from people trying to recentralize Bitcoin in different ways making themselves actually a pretty easy target.","203":"Well, we have a lot of public blockchains. Like we have Bitcoin. We have the Ethereum network and XT, but a lot of companies and consortiums are getting together to build private blockchains, so ones that are more closed off at first and then may evolve into a public network where people feel comfortable using it. And some are also proof of concept out in the real world, projects in energy and in pharmaceuticals and in retail and lots of different fields are starting experiments. And we'll see in the next few years how all of those interact and what we learn about the best use cases for blockchain and what it means for trade.","204":"Because the materials are so small, they're at the nanoscale, their properties are dominated by quantum mechanics, which means that even slight changes in their size, in their orientation give profound changes in their properties. And while that's very scientifically interesting, and it allows you to tune their properties by making subtle changes, from a technology point of view, it's a bit of a headache in the sense that in technology want to optimize for a property and then repeat that over and over again. So what are some of the challenges that you face in the lab related to working with these materials and then trying to incorporate them into the batteries?","205":"That's actually, I think a very common problem. We can build a device in the lab it could be a transistor, can be a battery. And then you ask the question, okay, so what's the next step? How do we take it from that lab demonstration into a technology? The kind of work that I'm very interested in is developing tools to make the exact type of materials that you want. The tools that we've used in the past for conventional fabrication just don't work with these materials because they're all grown from the bottom up. They're intrinsically small, and you have to find ways to either use chemistry or some other means to get them to assemble into the structures that you want to actually either grow specifically what you want or after you grow them, to pull out the ones that you want. You need to be able to build that same thing over and over again, with the exact same properties. No one institution, no one research lab, no one national lab is gonna solve all of these problems on their own because they are difficult problems. And there is a real important payoff at the end. And it's gonna take all of us, making our contributions to push this field forward.","206":"Origami applications have in common, is that at some stage the thing is flat and so whenever you need to either start from a flat state and then take it to a 3D state, or conversely, for deployables like space, you want to have it in a fully folded flat state but then take it to a 3D state, or possibly an unfolded flat state. Whenever a flat state is involved, origami is a really effective way of making the transition between those states.","207":"New problems arise when we try to make origami out of things other than paper, but also new opportunities. An example here which is a kind of a variant of the Miura-Ori. It's got a three-dimensional structure. If I stretch it one way, it expands the other but because it has these S-bends in the pattern, if you squeeze it, it doesn't go all the way flat. This is a epoxy impregnated aramid fiber and so if I put this fold pattern into it and then compress it and then put a skin on the top and bottom, this becomes incredibly lightweight but incredibly strong.","208":"Another origami challenge that comes up with these patterns is if we're going to make an aircraft out of this thing we're going to need hundreds of yards of folded origami. We're not going to do it by hand and this might be the new frontier in origami engineering, which is the design of machines that can fold patterns that have applications.","209":"It's something we've talked about a little bit that with all the richness of behavior of origami from a flat sheet, it seems like there ought to be an equally rich world of things that don't start flat but are still made from flat sheets of paper.","210":"When we were much smaller societies, you and I could trade in our community pretty easily. As the distance in our trade grew, we ended up inventing institutions, right? If you Uber or you use Airbnb or you use Amazon even, these are just digital marketplaces and platforms that help us facilitate an exchange of value. But today, we actually have a technology that allows us to trade one to one but at scale, and it's called blockchain technology. There is some kind of interface for it. You could have an app, or you could use a computer to do it, but instead of there being a company in the middle that's helping you make that transaction, it's a bunch of software code.","211":"And so it's being run by all of these different computers that have like a node. So they're all running the same software and guaranteeing your transactions as they happen.","212":"In some cases, yeah, it is. And a lot of people in the financial industry, in particular, are looking at it from the banking side of how do we use this technology to trade things like Bitcoin or other tokens that are easier to use instead of today's currency. A lot of people think about blockchain as Bitcoin because it's sort of in the news a lot, and it's this new cryptocurrency. And it's kind of exciting. But we're actually seeing a lot more use cases for blockchain that aren't around the currency side. They're more around, how do you take any asset and be able to trade that using this same technology.","213":"Really glad that you could join us. So we've been talking about sleep today, various levels of complexity. But now with you, I really want to talk about what do we know about sleep and the aging brain. Can you tell me a little bit about some of the work that you've been doing in that area?","214":"So it's interesting, so I also saw that there was also a recent meta-analysis around sleep disturbances and dementia risk, and in that study, they looked about 250,000 people in this meta-analysis, and they followed them around for 10 years, and you know, when they pulled all the samples together, they found there was a 1.2 fold increased risk for developing all caused dementia, so it sounds like both sleep apnea and then maybe sleep disturbances more generally are associated with increased risk for dementia. When I think about that, I think about how sleep lives in the brain, these neurodegenerative diseases live in the brain, and so what do we know about the causality of this? Could it be that individuals who have early onset of say, Alzheimer's, have then poor sleep kind of as a consequence of that?","215":"So within dementia risk in particular, Alzheimer's for instance, there are kind of two clear features that seem to be part of the pathology, right? So there's beta-amyloid which accumulates in the brain, and then there's kind of these tangles, this tauopathies, right? And so it sounds like sleep seems to be related to the tauopathies. What about kind of beta-amyloid?","216":"Okay, so there is this bio-directional piece, but I think perhaps the most exciting thing that happened in the sleep field, at least in my view, has been understanding the role of sleep and its clearance of beta-amyloid in the brain. This idea that sleep is kind of the dishwasher of the brain, it seems like, that you know A betta accumulates as we kind of use energy, and you know it's kind of a waste product, and the idea that if you don't clear it out, that it's going to build up and accumulate.","217":"I'm excited about the future of sleep medicine. I think there are incredible innovations that are happening in the basic sciences, kind of really starting to understand what are the clear biological processes that underly some of these things as they relate to disease risk, and what is the true function of sleep, kind of the why we sleep phenomenon, right?","218":"To figure out how to do that we need to learn a little bit about what makes a point. So, let's come back to the crane. You can probably tell that the corners of the square ended up as points, right?","219":"Yeah, exactly. Actually you've discovered something pretty neat because you made your point not from a corner so you've already discovered one of the key insights. Any flap, any point, leg of the ant, takes up a circular region of paper. Here's our boundary. To make your point from an edge you use that much paper and the shape, it's almost a circle. If we take the crane we'll see if the circles are visible in the crane pattern. Here's the crane pattern, and here's a boundary of the wing, and here's the other wing.","220":"And to do that we use a new technique called circle packing in which all of the long features of the design are represented by circles. So, each leg becomes a circle, each wing becomes a circle and things that can be big and thick, like the head or the abdomen, can be points in the middle. Now we have the basic idea of how to design the pattern, we just count the number of legs we want. We want a spider, if it's got let's say eight legs, it's also got an abdomen, that's another point, and it's got a head, so maybe that's 10 points. If we find an arrangement of 10 circles we should be able to fold that into the spider. So in this book, Origami Insects II, it's one of my books and has some patterns, and this is one of them for a flying ladybug and, in fact, it is exactly this flying ladybug. We've got the crease pattern here in the circles and you might now be able to see which circles end up as which parts, knowing that the largest features like the wings are going to be the largest circles, smaller points will be smaller circles. So any thoughts which might be?","221":"Origami artists all around the world now use ideas like this to design, not just insects, but animals, and birds, and all sorts of things that are, I think, unbelievably complex and realistic but most importantly, beautiful.","222":"It's really fascinating work, especially now we're all familiar with the viruses and how they act. And I'm not aware of any viruses that build nanostructures. So how did you come to that? And then how do you actually program a virus to do your bidding?","223":"These are the building blocks of many, many origami deployable shapes, it's called a degree-4 vertex. It's the number of lines. So in this case, we use solid lines for mountain, we use dash lines for valley. We're going to fold it and use these two to illustrate some important properties of origami mechanisms. It's important in the study of mechanisms to take into account the rigidity. So what we're going to do to help simulate rigidity is to take these rectangles and we're going to fold them over and over so that they just become stiff and rigid.","224":"So this is what's called a single degree of freedom mechanism. You have one degree of freedom, I can choose this fold, and then if these are perfectly rigid every other fold angle is fully determined. One of the key behaviors here is that with the smaller angles up here, the two folds that are the same parity and the folds that are of opposite parity move at about the same rate but with this, as we're getting closer to 90 degrees, we find they move at very different rates and then at the end of the motion, the opposite happens. This one is almost folded but this one goes through a much larger motion so the relative speeds differ.","225":"So when we start sticking together vertices like this, if they're individually single degree of freedom then we can make very large mechanisms that open and close but with just one degree of freedom. So, these are examples of a pattern called the Miura-Ori. When you stretch them out they're pretty big.","226":"Yeah, so typically the mechanism will run from corner to corner, to diagonally to opposite corners because then you can stretch it out that way. Notice some differences between the one you have and the one I have in how this one sort of opens out almost evenly but this one opens out more one way and then the other.","227":"And it's exactly the difference between the motions of these two vertices. So these angles are closer to right angles and the closer you get to a right angle the more asymmetry there is between the two directions of motion. And then the other difference is how efficiently they pack, so these started at about the same size but when they're flat notice that yours is much more compact. So if I were you making a solar array, I'd say, oh, I want that one. But if I say, well, I want them to open at the same rate, then I want this one.","228":"There's an engineering trade-off to get them both to work. And there's another place that shows up in deployable structures in a very cool structure. This is a folded tube, it sort of pops out like this but it has this neat property that if you twist it quickly, it changes color. There's a Mars Rover application where they need a sleeve that protects a drill and as the drill goes down, the sleeve is going to collapse and they're using a pattern very much like this.","229":"There are many open mathematical questions and so room for mathematicians, like yourself, to have a big impact on the world of origami and mechanisms. And even though those studies are mathematically interesting, they're going to also have real-world applications in space, solar arrays, drills, telescopes, and more. Any questions or thoughts about this?","230":"That's actually a really good description. The idea is that if you've got a system here that can make you see whatever we want you to see, then we can make you believe that you're anywhere else, like on top of a mountain, or in a dungeon or under the ocean.","231":"Yeah, or in Minecraft. When you look at a TV on the wall there showing like a picture of a mountain or something, how can you tell that its not just a window and there's something else behind it. Because it always doesn't look quite right if you have a static picture of a person on a screen and you move around like this, its not really changing. And its interesting, those are things we have to figure out We need to figure out when you look at something in reality how can you tell whether its real or not. Have you been to a 3-D movie where you put on the little glasses?","232":"So what they do, the trick for that is, if you ever at a theater and you take up the glasses and you look at it, you'll see its blurry where there's actually two pictures that they're showing at the same time. And what those little glasses do, is they let one eye see one picture, and the other eye see a different picture. So then your eyes can say, oh it looks like I'm seeing through the screen or something is floating out in front of it. In the VR headsets, what we do is, there's actually either two screens or one screen split in half, so that it draws a different picture, completely different picture, for each eye. And we make sure that each eye can only see the picture it intended to. And that's what can make things feel like they got this real depth to them, that its something that you could reach out and touch and it doesn't feel like a flat TV screen.","233":"Essentially what harmony is, is like a language, right? And so as with any language, the more words you're capable of speaking in a language, the more you can say. All right, so in harmony, this might be how many notes you can think to add to a chord to make it feel a different way. Have you ever heard of the circle of fifths?","234":"Okay, that's great. On one side, we have a lot of the notes which make us feel brighter, you know, like these kinds of, (keyboard music) these really bright sounds. And the other side is a lot more to do with the darkness of a key center. So we're home in F, but imagine we're taking a quick visit to B-flat, but then the sun comes out.","235":"You got it. Ooh! Yeah? Yeah, yeah. So this is really, this is like a gleaming glade or something, you know? Let's play this tune, Amazing Grace. Let's play it in its simplest form.","236":"All right, so we're gonna start in F, right? Yeah. So say. \u266a I once \u266a F, yeah. (Amazing Grace) B-flat, yeah. F. C. F. So we're home.","237":"Just to see how things feel. Yeah. All right, lets do it. (both playing Amazing Grace) So it's F major seven, but its over A. Which is F seven over A. (both playing) B flat major seven with an A and a G in it. F major seven with an E and a D and a G, yeah. (laughter) D minor seven with a G in it. C softs, or minor, nice. B flat major. G seven, F sharp major seven. Home, yeah! I like that. So what harmony does is just gives us even more tools to tell those stories. Cool, yeah. Nice, man.","238":"Oh, very good. You've come to the right place. So we're gonna think about physics. Have you heard the word physics before? Do you know what that is?","239":"Okay. I just think of physics as the study of everything. What stuff is, what stuff does. So today we're gonna talk about space, and in particular the idea of dimensions. Have you heard about dimensions?","240":"And how would you find yourself, like if someone said where are you, could you use some words or ideas to say where you are on that line?","241":"But here's what I want you to think about. If I say I'm at this point on the line, I could translate that into saying I'm at the three centimeter point, if I were here I'd be at the four centimeter point, the five centimeter point, right?","242":"We need one number to tell you where we are. That's one dimension. That's what it means to be one dimensional. I only need to tell you one number to figure out where we are.","243":"There you go. Exactly. We're gonna build a little two dimensional space. You wanna do it? You wanna do the honors here? Why don't you put those two lines together?","244":"So those are the dimensions. That's how we think about dimensions. Remember, we just needed one number to find ourselves on the line, we need two numbers to find ourselves on the plane.","245":"This is why physicists think about things we don't know about. We're wondering whether there could be extra dimensions you've never seen. Yeah. That are tinier than atoms. So, okay. So what have you learned? What do you know about dimensions now? How do you think about dimensions in a slightly different way than you did before?","246":"I think so. I think you're right. All right Hank, we want you to keep up studying, learn a lot of math and physics and help us discover new dimensions some day. Does that sound like a fun idea?","247":"Absolutely. And that's a great example because you have models that are operating to do things like figure out if a new email is spam or not. So what would you think about if you were looking at an email and trying to decide if it went in one category or another?","248":"So these are things we would call features. And we go through a process where we do feature engineering, where somebody looks at the example and says, Okay, these are the things that I think might allow us to statistically tell the difference from something in one category versus another. So for example, perhaps you don't speak Russian, you start getting a lot of email in Russian.","249":"This is a great question because it really gets to the difference between some of our different tools in our machine learning tool belt in addressing problems like this. So if we were to use a supervised learning classic classification approach, a person would need to think about those features and creatively come up with them in approach we call the kitchen sink approach, which is just try everything you can possibly think of and see what works. Unsupervised learning, where we don't have labeled data and we're trying to infer some structure out of the data is you're projecting that data into a space and looking for things like clusters. And there's a bunch of really fun math about how you do that, how you think about distance and by distance, I mean that if we have two data points in space, how do we decide if they're similar or not?","250":"It is, but it also thrives in environments where you have a decision point, a pallet of actions to choose from. And it actually comes historically from trying to train a robot to navigate a room. If it bonks into this chair, it can't go forward anymore. And if it falls into that pit, you know, it's not going to succeed. But if it keeps exploring, it'll eventually get to the goal.","251":"So typically, you would choose deep learning if you have sufficient high quality data, hopefully labeled in a useful way. If you really are happy not to necessarily understand or be able to interpret what your system is doing or you're willing to invest in another set of work afterwards to understand what the system is doing once you've already trained it. And this also comes down to the fact that some things are actually really easy to solve with linear regression or simple statistical approaches. And some things are impossible.","252":"Yeah. This is actually a good example of a very real world kind of machine learning problem where the solution to this was to build an interpretable system on top of the accurate predictions not to throw it away, but to do a bunch more work to figure out the why.","253":"It's actually fairly new that we're able to solve all of these problems and start to build these products and apply it in businesses and apply it, you know, everywhere. And so, we're still developing good practices and what it means to be a professional in machine learning. We're really developing a notion of what good looks like.","254":"Sometimes when people get, they worry about connectomics, I think what they're actually worrying about is that it's the end of the that we used to do neuroscience.","255":"So and a musician, how much of it do you think is in your hands versus in your brains? Meaning like, you do have connections in your muscles from the nerves that are from your spinal cord, what if some of the learning is there?","256":"Yeah. We do a lot of X-ray in addition to EM and this is actually, I'm not saying it's the only problem, but it's the only problem that needs to be solved right away, is that the data analysis, right? In fact, I think we calculated that there aren't enough humans ever to map a mouse brain where you collect every connection and et cetera so the problem is to get algorithms to trace, to recognize things in brains the way humans would recognize things in brains, or map things, trace things in brains. It's gonna cost a lot of money to imagine setting the gold standard for the wiring diagram even once and those are the kinds of ethical concerns that I'm worried about.","257":"Good to see you Mike, nice to have you here with me. So we go way back. 1991, the year I got married, I moved across the country, left my husband in New Jersey, to work with you in Livermore.","258":"Okay, but that's kind of cheating. That's not getting to 10 to the 29. If you could do it with 100% efficiency that's all we need.","259":"And that's, like you said, we're stuck a little bit, we're not up to that kind of acceleration, so that would be a Nobel Prize winning possible idea.","260":"And right across the beam. Don't you think that's gonna be the challenge? 'Cos it's not like our beams are as perfect as we like to think they are.","261":"Okay so there's a lot of us working around the world on these high intensity lasers and so, what do you think the real fun is? What do you see the real excitement being?","262":"So it is amazing, the parallels. And optics is used everywhere. We're gonna possibly take over from CERN, we'll just do high energy physics with lasers, we're looking at gravity waves with lasers, we wanna do black holes with lasers, we wanna machine with lasers, we wanna do medicine with lasers. It's everywhere. And now, with the Nobel prize, people are hearing more about it so they know lasers are everywhere.","263":"So where people are swiping credit cards, those credit card numbers were stolen. They hired a company to come in and perform a penetration test to see, can the good guys essentially break in again to prevent this sort of thing in the future? And when this team came in, they found they actually were able to get pretty much to the same point of sale system, and the way they did that was by exploiting an internet-connected deli meat scale. Once the company was able to essentially get into the deli scale, because the deli scale was on the internal network, then they were able to really escalate privilege and find a vulnerability within another system. Essentially, that just got them into the network. and once you're in the network, it's often really easy to then escalate from there.","264":"Yeah, that's another interesting concept. It's really just different layers that we have for protection, because often when you're talking about something like a corporate network, or even your home network, you typically have sort of one level of defense, right? If someone can break that or it can get in through some other system that is connected or exposes some other protocol, like Bluetooth, right? You can connect to a Bluetooth device without being on the wireless network, without being on the LAN. That potentially gives you another place that you can pivot on and then access other devices, because if something has both Bluetooth and also Wi-Fi, well, if you can get in through Bluetooth, then you can then access the Wi-Fi and get to other devices on the network. Are you familiar with buffer overflows?","265":"If we were to write a program that asked for your name and you typed in your name, but before you could type in your name, in a low leveling, which is like C or C++, you'd have to allocate some memory. So you might allocate a buffer of a hundred bytes because whose name is going to be longer than a hundred bytes or a hundred character? But what happens if you were to not really check that they limited to a hundred bytes? Do you know what happens if they essentially start typing over that hundred bytes?","266":"But what's really cool about that is, when you're going into memory, you're starting to cross over that boundary of that hundred byte allocation, and now you're starting to write over additional memory. That other memory is really important stuff. So you have your name, the hundred bytes there, and then right next to your name is the return address, and that's the address that the code is gonna execute and it's going to return to after that function is done, and it's going to jump to that address, but after you type your hundred bytes, the next few bites that you type, you're actually going to overwrite that return address. So that return address could essentially be another address in memory. So what you end up doing is you type a name and it's not really a name, it's really just code. And that code, you keep typing until you get to the return address, and you start typing an address, which is really the beginning of your name and your computer or your processor is actually going to read that address and it will jump back to the beginning and then execute that payload. So that was sort of the very first thing that I think was super exciting to me when I started learning about really reverse engineering.","267":"You brought up China and Iran, and something that's interesting about those areas is really censorship, right? They have essentially censored internet. In the US, we have a really interesting internal struggle here where we actually have government agencies like the state department that are funding software to evade censorship, like Tor and other mechanisms. While then we also have an internal struggle where we have other organizations like the NSA who are specifically looking to break that exact same system that the US government is also funding.","268":"It's good for us to understand how these systems can really break down. Although, I think one thing that I see is that some of, let's say, the organizations that are looking to break this are not necessarily going to share once they actually learn that information. They might actually sort of hold that in their back pocket and use it when it's advantageous to them.","269":"You haven't got to play with lasers. So I brought one. It's my friend's cat toy. Do you ever use a laser as a cat toy?","270":"Well one of the fun things people do with lasers, the cat will try to grab that dot. I'm sure what you have at home is a flashlight. I brought a cute little one. So the question is, do you see any difference between what a flashlight does and what a laser does?","271":"That's true, that laser's just a dot. And so the other thing to notice though is that, like if I shine it in your eyes and I'm sorry if I do! But it seems awfully bright doesn't it? And yet when, you know, you shine this down and you put the laser, which one do you see easier?","272":"One of the things that lasers are great for is that because it's a directed beam, we can actually put that light where we want the light to go and sometimes you maybe just want to see something around the corner and you can't see it. But with a laser, you can actually and this is a smoky one so you can actually watch it go. You see it actually bending the corner?","273":"And that's because the light will go through this glass and, when it hits that corner, it has to bend. And we actually send laser beams down glass fibers, the size of your hair.","274":"So this is just a demonstration. If you have a laser like this, it actually bends and comes out, I'm gonna point it to you and you'll see it coming out the other end. It hits these walls, it has to go around and come out the other side. You wanna play? So is this the first time you've seen a laser or have you gotten to play with lasers somewhere else?","275":"That's a laser. We cut steel with them now. We actually do surgery with lasers. You know when some people have either scars or birth marks that they don't want to see? We can actually remove those with lasers now. Never seen a laser light show? When they light up the sky with lasers, it's almost like fireworks.","276":"Oh you got to see a shooting star? Well that's cool, that's nature giving you the show there. So what do you think about lasers? You think they're fun?","277":"So the side channel analysis is really looking not at a vulnerability within a system, but really unintended consequences of what the system is built on. A very simple example of a side channel is putting your ear to the ground to hear if there are horses coming towards you, and the same thing applies to technology. So you can have something like a CPU, it's executing instructions, certain instructions that use a little bit more power, and power is reserved in these capacitors, which are like tiny batteries next to your CPU. And as they're pulling power, there's something in physics called the electrostrictive effect where the capacitor will move in a very, very tiny amount. And then although we can't hear it, the microphone on a mobile device can actually listen to that. If you then listen to that and you say, oh, I see a pattern here, and you can go all the way down and then extract and reveal the full password, the full key, even though it could be argued that the algorithm itself, there's no problem with it.","278":"Yeah, I suppose the physical adjacency of the underlying transistors and capacitors that are holding that storage. That's crazy. I think the first time I heard of an interesting attack like that was learning about the cold boot attack. Being able to, you know, someone enters their password on their computer and that decrypts their hard drive and then they walk away. Being able to extract that password is really difficult. If I can pull that memory chip out and extract that memory, put it in my own device, except the problem is memory is volatile, so it'll erase as soon as I pull it out. You can take something like canned air, turn it upside down, cool that computer, make it real nice and cool. Then you have a minute or two to pull out the memory, put into your own device, extract the memory, and then you're good. It's such a simple method to really extract something kind of critical. Like Rowhammer, it's such a low level of vulnerability and you could argue that it's not necessarily a vulnerability in the architecture itself, but rather exploitation of physics at that point.","279":"The risk right now, just during this quarantine, is actually massive now that we think about it, because you might have these legacy systems. You know, they were built 20, 30 years ago, and it's too costly to upgrade, but now you can't actually have a lot of people in a single location, so potentially, they actually do have to now add some sort of remote capabilities to these systems that were never meant to be on the internet. Have you ever had any ethical concerns with the stuff you're interested in or the work you do?","280":"Especially now that we're seeing more and more companies who are trying to make it illegal for you to inspect the vehicle that you've purchased, right? Something that you actually own.","281":"What if it were illegal? Would you then do it? Fortunately it's not today, right? It hasn't been, you know, despite their attempts, none of that has been passed, but if you had a vehicle and you wanted to inspect it, but all of a sudden, it passed, I mean.","282":"But the laws don't always equate to hurting anyone. I ethically think similar to you in that, you know, what is moral to me is as long as I'm not intentionally hurting others, right?","283":"So what if I told you that blockchain technology is basically a tool where you can do the exact same thing, but it goes to you and I directly? You wouldn't need an eBay or a brand in between.","284":"We have a lot of companies that sort of help us make sure that our trades happen, but if we could guarantee the same trade using technology as sort of a technological trust, then we wouldn't really need all those middlemen in between.","285":"It's basically a network of computers that all have the same history of transactions. And so instead of sort of there being one company with one database that holds all the information, the same sort of list is held by all these different people. Like, you could have it on your computer. And then it gets validated by everyone, and basically, that turns into the next part of the list. So it's sort of constantly updating itself.","286":"So it use cryptography, and that helps it basically encode all of the transactions. So you can't really see exactly what happened, but you can know it happened because it's like a marker.","287":"So it's kinda this like really big ledger or accounting system for all sorts of things that get traded, but instead of being owned by one company, it's owned by everybody.","288":"Excellent. I got an engineering physics degree. There you go, something in common. We're here today talking about lasers. So have you have had much exposure to lasers yet at school?","289":"Well I brought a little bit of a prop to explain how chirped pulse amplification works. Our short pulses are made of different colors. So I've got a colored slinky here. We probably could've called it stretched pulse amplification but that's kind of boring so we used the word chirped. The word chirped comes around because birds chirp. When the birds are singing, the notes are actually changing audio frequency with time and that's a chirp. The point is is that when all the light is squeezed together like this, it's a short pulse. And that's when it's a hammer because all of the light is now concentrated and you can imagine if this was coming along and also using a lens to focus it small, then all of that light at the focal spot, concentrate. And so that was the laser hammer. So we can't have that in the laser. So the question is what could we do? The fact that it's different colors and different colors because of dispersion, travel different speeds inside material. So we used a long fiber, 1.4 kilometers of fiber but, in fiber, the red colors really haven't got that much in common with the glass atoms and so they spend very little time interacting and they travel fast. The red is going to start traveling faster than the green, faster than the blue and, as you travel down the fiber, next thing you know, you have a long pulse and it's chirped from red at the beginning to blue at the back. And so the frequencies go hoo! Like this okay? So this is a chirped pulse and now it's a long pulse. And so, first this is what we did, we chirped it, we stretched it, then we can safely amplify it because it's not all concentrated and, after we amplify it, then we use something called a compressor and we put all of the colors back together and it was back being a short pulse but a high energy pulse. And then we really had what I like to call a laser hammer. When this laser pulse goes inside, it smacks those electrons right off the atom.","290":"Well a lot of lasers and when lasers first came along, they were only single color. Your cat toy, would only be a single color, probably a red one and so that's just one color. And one color means that it has to really be there for the whole time. One color is one wave length of light and so it's just one wave that goes on and on and on. If you want a short pulse, you actually have to have all the colors. And if you can imagine that one point in time, and I like to say it's like a conductor of an orchestra. When you're listening to an orchestra warm up, they sound terrible, they're all playing their own notes. But when the conductor conducts them, they all play different notes but, together, it's beautiful music. So we have something in the laser called a mode locker and it's like the conductor and it says go now. And all the colors will start together but some colors are long wave length and others are shorter. So next thing you know, you have peaks meeting valleys and they cancel each other. And the more colors you can bring in, the faster that happens and the shorter the pulse you can make.","291":"The necklace is something that was designed for my Nobel prize. It's sold at the Nobel museum and it is a chirped pulse. So we've been talking a lot about lasers and applications, what have you learned about chirped pulses?","292":"Yeah. The amazing thing about harmony is that it exists in nature. So, take the harmonic series of the note F, for example. Okay. You have the ups on the fifth and the fourth and then the, (hums) That seemed a little bit sharp, but that's fine. And then tones get increasingly small. Beneath that note, you have the undertone series, which essentially is like a reflection of something. In the same way that when a tree grows in nature, you have the branches which grow upwards and the roots which go downwards. So it's quite a nice thing to thing about, this being the key center, the floor, the ground, and then these two different directions of ways in which it can express itself, and the differences in the sensations with that. Lots of the time I think when it comes to reharmonization or harmonization, people think that the solution to the problems come when we add more notes.","293":"Because I can delay the gratification of going home. First of all, just by using inversions, even before we add the notes to the chord. One thing that I was very joyful to discover is that every single melody note works with every single base note.","294":"That's it! (laughs) A flat soft, A flat major seven. A flat major seven sharp five, with a sharp 11. Essentially, what that demonstrates is that every note and every base note are compatible. So once we realize this its like, that's great! Now what should we do? What, how, what should we, what should we, how, what am I supposed to do? What to do, right. And sometimes the paralyzing thing when it comes to arranging, there are too many options, too many things are possible. So that's when it becomes super, super important to be aware of what you wanna try and say emotionally.","295":"So essentially, the way I'd apply negative harmony would be this idea of polarity, you know, between the overtone series and the undertone series, or you know, the one side and the other side. The perfect and the play goal. The feeling of a minor perfect-- (keyboard music) Resolving, it's so moving, you know? And it's a good alternative to something like, (keyboard music)","296":"Exactly, yeah. No, for sure. And, you know, F major can be something you arrive in from, if you arrive in F major from D flat, then it's like the sun's come up.","297":"That's good, that's a great place to start. There are cells in your brain. Those brain cells are connected by wires to each other. Electricity travels down those wires and communicates from one part of the brain to the other part of the brain, and each of those brain cells makes, you know, a thousand connections, it's something like a hundred trillion connections.","298":"I would say that that map also has your feelings in it because, here's why, your feelings, most neuroscientists think, come from your brain anyway, and amazingly, whether when you feel happy or sad or angry or scared, that's just brain cells communicating with each other.","299":"Huh. It would be like if you simulated a hurricane. Imagine we could keep track of every variable of a hurricane. Ever. Wind speed, every water molecule, et cetera, et cetera. Temperature. And we put that inside a super-fast computer and we simulated it, right? I don't think anyone would think that the inside of the computer would get wet. Even though we had simulated the hurricane perfectly, that wetness is consciousness, it's what we are. Is it ethical to imagine mapping a male brain versus a female brain to look for differences between those, to explain alleged behavioral differences between them?","300":"But it's not. You wouldn't use like, a physical lock, or a physical box. We would instead use mathematics to do these kinds of things. You could take a message and encrypt it using mathematics. And then, I could prove to you that I know the key, I could open it up, and send it back to you. That way I would be proving to you that I know the mathematical key to the mathematical lockbox. So based on what we've discussed today, in your own words, what is a zero-knowledge proof.","301":"I've got one too. I was nine and we were at the science expo in San Francisco. Two scientists were dissecting an eye, a cow's eye. And I was like that is the coolest thing I've ever seen. And something about that that carried me forward. Something happened so long ago, it left some long lasting trace through neural circuits and it continues to shape the decisions we make about what to study and what to do.","302":"So we're interested in the idea that memory is kind of a pervasive force that shapes all our behaviors. And we're trying to understand how different kinds of memory are organized in different structures of the brain. And then to understand how those different structures work together to orchestrate complex cognitive behaviors like decision-making or reasoning and thinking.","303":"The best way to kind of think about that distinction really goes back historically to one of the most important discoveries in memory research. The patient was referred to famously as patient HM. The neurosurgeon went in and removed the tissue that happened to be right around the hippocampus on both the left side and the right side of HM's brain. But then they started noticing something odd in his behavior. He was not able to create new memories of the experiences he had after the surgery. And that led Brenda Milner and her colleagues to report that the hippocampus was very important for memory, but a one particular kind, these sort of explicit, or as now referred to them episodic memories. But the hippocampus was not necessary for learning skills like mirror tracing, things that you can't necessarily articulate but you just get better at over time. And it really led to a couple of decades or more even of an enormous amount of very important work that kind of kept on breaking memory down further and further into different types. Episodic and semantic as both forms of explicit memory where episodic refers to memory for an event that happened like what you did yesterday morning and semantic refers to general knowledge about the world. Implicit memory is being broken down into a bunch of different kinds like skills or habits or conditioning. And when I started graduate school, many of us felt kind of the next question was really to understand how do we now understand how they work together. This was right around when functional magnetic resonance imaging started becoming a popular tool for measuring brain activity. We could scan the entire brain and we could ask questions about multiple brain regions at once. And we discovered that what we might expect during a skill learning task that only the striatum might show activity, that we also saw the activity in the hippocampus. Or when we asked someone to form an episodic memory that we thought might depend only on the hippocampus we suddenly also saw activity in the prefrontal cortex. And so the confluence of these new ideas and questions about how different forms of memory interact together with the development of new tools for studying the human mind and brain allowed us to kind of adjust our view of memory systems, to think of them less as multiple completely separate independent systems and instead to try to understand how they really work in concert with each other and give rise to all kinds of behaviors that might not fit neatly into one category or another.","304":"Yeah, you know things are kind of breaking down in unexpected ways I'd say. I think there's been a lot of really great work out of multiple labs showing hippocampal activity related to behaviors that don't look anything like episodic memories, but which might depend on episodic memories right? So for example also when you're making a decision about how to choose between two good options that suddenly you might see activity in the hippocampus related to the choice itself, others have found that you find activity in the hippocampus not only when people are forming memories, but also when they're imagining events that are gonna happen in the future. So it kind of forced us to rethink the way we define what the hippocampus might be doing in a way that can account for creating memories, thinking about the future, making decisions and other kinds of behaviors that involve what we would refer to you in the field as relational processing. And that raises all kinds of new questions about what memory really is. Reminiscing about our early influences that made us want to be scientists is that, you know, of course we know, we know better than to think that those are necessarily accurate memories. You know this reminds me of sort of the classic example from literature when people talk about memory of course is Marcel Proust's Madeleine in Remembrance of Things Past. Where in the book it's this taste for the, for the protagonist this taste of the crumbs of the Madeleine cookie and the tea that bring him back to his childhood. You know, seven volumes then emerge of memories of, of that childhood. Digging further into earlier drafts of Proust's novel that initially it didn't describe a Madeleine at all.","305":"I love math for the same reason. Today, I'm gonna tell you about a thing called zero-knowledge proof. So in a zero-knowledge proof, there are two people. There's a prover and a verifier. And I wanna prove that something is true to you. But the weird thing is, I wanna prove to you that it's true without telling you any reasons why. I remember when I first heard about it, I was like, wait, what? How can that possibly be? Right?","306":"What if instead, we could somehow use a zero-knowledge proof to log in. You would just be able to prove that, hey, I'm Chelsea, without revealing anything to them. If you could do that, then it would be amazing, right?","307":"Because then even if the hacker hacked into the computer, he wouldn't learn anything. Because even the computer doesn't learn anything. So Chelsea, in your own words, what is a zero-knowledge proof?","308":"Yeah, that's absolutely right. So infinity gets used a lot of different ways in mathematics. There's a way that mathematicians think of infinity as a number, just like the number 13, just like the number 10 million. So the reason that mathematicians consider infinity to be a number is that it is a size of a set. So the first example of an infinite set in mathematics is the set of all counting numbers. So one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, et cetera. That list goes on forever. That is an infinite set. And to be a little bit more precise, it's a countably infinite set. But as a number, infinity is pretty strange.","309":"Adding infinities. Multiplying infinities. And there's a sense in which it's very similar to the arithmetic that you learned about already. But it's also totally different. It has some very weird properties. Welcome to Hilbert's Hotel. Unlike an ordinary hotel, has accountably infinitely many rooms. Suppose a new guest shows up, you might think that the new guest could take the room that's all the way down at the end of the hall, all the way at infinity, except there isn't a room like that. The rooms each have a number, and even though there's infinitely many rooms, each room is only a finite distance away. So here's how we're gonna make room for the new guest. I'm gonna ask the guest in room one to move into room two, and then we're gonna ask the guest in room two to move into room three, and we'll continue this all the way along. It looks to me like there's space for the new guest. Where is it?","310":"Absolutely. So now I'm gonna make this story a little more complex. That there's another Hilbert's Hotel down the street and they're having plumbing issues and we need to find room for them.","311":"They can't live together. That would be a great solution. I don't know. I think these people don't really get along. So I need to somehow create infinitely many new rooms, but I can only ask each person in the hotel to move a finite distance away. So let's take the guest who is originally in room one and move them into room two. So that's creating one new space for us. And I'm gonna take the guest who was originally in room two and move them into room four. Are you starting to see a pattern here?","312":"Yeah, I'm increasing by one more each time. So I'm doubling the room number in fact. So this is some of the strange arithmetic of infinity. So we have two Hilbert Hotels, each of which have infinitely many guests, then this is equal to?","313":"So when I'm teaching calculus and talking about concepts like limits and derivatives, those are only defined precisely with infinity. Teaching algebra, which is meant in a different sense about number systems, we deal with infinite families of numbers in their operations. Infinite sets are somehow very exotic. They're not found so commonly in their real world, but they're all over mathematics.","314":"It describes something in AI, which is that things that are really intuitive and easy for humans, are actually really difficult to build into AI systems. And on the flip side, picking up an object, really simple for people, but it's actually really difficult to build that into robotic systems. So do you have any experience working with robots or other AI systems?","315":"Yeah, exactly. One thing that my research has been looking into is, if we can have robots learn from data, we'll collect data from the robot sensors. And if the robot has sensors in its arm, to figure out the angle of one of its wrist, for example, then we'll record that angle. And all of the robots experience will go into a data set, that if we wanted a robot to solve a task, like, I don't know, picking up a cup, and then maybe you want to pick up a different cup, if it only had the data of picking up the first cup, do you think it would be able to perform well on the second cup?","316":"So you can think of robotics as having two core components. One is perception, being able to see and feel and so forth, and action, where the robot actually figures out how to move its arm. And both components are really essential, and both components are quite difficult. If you train a perception system independently of how to choose actions, then it might make errors in a way that mess up the system that selects actions And so if you instead try to train these two systems together, to have it learn perception action for the goal of solving these different tasks, then the robot can be more successful. One thing that's really difficult about robotics is, there actually isn't that much data of robots in the world. On the internet, there's all sorts of text data, all sorts of image data that people upload and write. But there isn't a lot of data of doing a simple thing, like tying your shoe, for example, because it's so basic. One challenge is even just getting data sets that allow us to teach robots to do these simple kinds of tasks.","317":"That's a great question. I think we should be able to accelerate the data collection process by having robots collect more data autonomously on their own. And by doing that, we might be able to overcome some of the challenges of Moravec's paradox.","318":"Deep learning is a common toolbox for addressing some of these challenges, because it allows us to leverage large data sets. And so, deep learning is basically, corresponds to methods for training these artificial neural networks. Another common method that comes up is reinforcement learning. A third kind of algorithm is meta learning algorithms. And these algorithms learn not just from the most recent experience on the current task, but leverage experience from other task in the past. And they're not just completely separate. We can combine the aspects of these algorithms into a single method that gets the benefits of each of them.","319":"The Mandelbrot set or the Julia set, you know, the idea is always, oh, I'm gonna apply some polynomial over and over again. Z squared plus C or something like that. When I think about fractals, I try to get away from these very specific examples and ask, what is it fundamentally that makes a fractal, a fractal. And one thing that I think you can be precise about, even if you can't really say exactly what a fractal is, is you can talk about this idea of fractal dimension. Have you ever heard of that?","320":"Yeah, great. So, so the real physical paper has some amount of thickness, but when we model this mathematically, we might ignore the thickness and say, yeah, this is really just kind of a two dimensional sheet of paper. And then you have your apple, how many dimensions is the apple?","321":"Totally, now, as a little experiment, take your piece of paper and just crumple it into a ball. So what is it? Is the paper three dimensional or is it two dimensional?","322":"And so what this box counting is getting at is saying, well, I still can never decide what the length of the coastline is, but what I can do is I can see how quick does the number of boxes grow relative to how it would grow just for an ordinary one dimensional curve, like a line or a circle.","323":"So procedural computer graphics, which kind of came out of thinking about fractals is one answer to this question about how do you add more detail without for instance, consuming tons of memory or requiring artists to paint ultra detail the textures. So if, if you can instead describe at least some aspect of what you're looking at in a procedural or recursive way, then you can add as much detail as you need when you get close to objects.","324":"Yeah like perlin noise is a great example, right? Perlin noise was one of the early ways of synthesizing additional texture at any level of detail that you needed to make things look natural and realistic.","325":"Yeah like perlin noise is a great example, right? Perlin noise was one of the early ways of synthesizing additional texture at any level of detail that you needed to make things look natural and realistic. I have a, a random question. Do you know how the research into fractals began? You can look pretty far back in history to see kind of glimmers of this idea of fractals in science in the 19th century, people were trying to look for examples of things in mathematics that were very unnatural. So there was, for instance, this guy named Georg Cantor, who was showing that you can have these sets with really strange properties, or you can have functions with really strange properties. This thing called the devil staircase and so on. And it wasn't until about a century later where someone named Mendel Brock said, Oh, actually this strange mathematics that was meant to show how unnatural things can happen is actually a perfect description of things that really do happen in nature. And from there, people really ran with it and said, Oh, okay, well, if these fractal descriptions are good for nature, we can also use that for creating really realistic and believable pictures in computer graphics.","326":"Exactly, right? That seemed pretty simple for the robot to do. Say we even just move the cup over here. Do you think the robot would still be able to stack the cups?","327":"this really specific combination of zeros and ones everything that your computer does showing you pink panther videos on youtube calculating things searching the internet it does all of that with a really specific combination of zeros and ones which is crazy right that would be like saying your computer only understands these quarters for each quarter you need to tell it that you're going to use heads tails and you assign it heads or tails so i can switch between heads and tails and i can switch the zeros and ones in my computer so that it represents what i wanted to represent like an a and with quantum computers we have new rules we get to use too we can actually spin one of our quarters so it doesn't have to choose just one or the other","328":"So actually, in the blockchain space is one of the spaces where we are seeing zero-knowledge proofs being implemented. And I think it's just the beginning. Let's talk about zero-knowledge proofs. At its core, a zero-knowledge proof is an interaction between two people. Then I should be able to convince you that some statement is true, but you won't have any idea why it's true.","329":"What you're basically asking is, wait, what? Right? Right. So this is what makes zero-knowledge proof so fascinating, and so counter-intuitive. And I think the best way I can explain it to you is by means of an example. But before we do that, I have to decide what I'm gonna prove to you in a, with a zero-knowledge proof.","330":"Without revealing what the address is of your account. It turns out I can take that statement that I have at least 0.2 Bitcoins, and convert it into a map of countries. And that map of countries will be three-colorable like this only if you have at least 0.2 Bitcoins.","331":"Of course, the first step is we have to erase all the colors. What I've done is I've put a color inside each of these envelopes. Now, how do you know that it's a valid coloring? You don't. Right? You have to pick any two neighboring countries. You can pick them however you like. At random.","332":"Right? So now, of course, one way to get more confidence is to open up more of them for you, but that would be revealing information to you. I don't wanna do that. So instead, I'm gonna ask you to please turn around. And now, let's change up these colors. Can you pick two countries at random and we'll reveal two of the colors again.","333":"But as you'll see, now it's not green, it's blue. And this one on the other hand, is green. Okay. The colors I showed you last time, don't work with these new colors, right? This wouldn't have worked before.","334":"It's not about making something more efficient. It's about doing things that we just didn't know how to do before. I can actually prove to you without revealing to you any of my secrets that I use to behave honestly. Right? I could prove to you that I signed some encrypted document correctly. Right? Without revealing to you what that secret document was. That ability to change the game. Like, really just change what we can do is what zero-knowledge brings to the table.","335":"One great example is like in elections. If you could prove that an election was correctly conducted. That every vote was counted, and it all added up to one person winning with a particular total, in zero-knowledge, then you don't have to give up the actual votes of any person. And yet everyone could see that, hey, yeah, it was done correctly.","336":"I'll grant you that Hilbert's Hotel does not exist. For me, infinite objects absolutely exist. And I can't read the thoughts in your head, but I have a high degree of confidence that we have a lot of the same ideas about infinity.","337":"I mean I think that's another common misconception about mathematics is that it's so far removed from the humanities, for instance. I mean it's hard to ignore some of these philosophical questions, particularly when we're talking about certain things like infinity. And I think one of the most difficult things to really be precise about and to explain to students is the continuum hypothesis. What do you say to students about the continuum hypothesis?","338":"It's pretty amazing, right? Because it happened like a year or two ago. Our memory is basically a record in our brain of something that happened in the past, but that record it created isn't perfect. So that day, do you remember was the pool at your hotel?","339":"When you were telling me about the sandbox, it felt like you didn't have to make that guess, that you could just see the sandbox in your eyes. I asked you about the towel. It doesn't come to mind immediately, but you can stop and think about it and kind of make a good guess because there are things you know about the world. And for those of us who study memory that's a really strong hint as to how memory works. And so for you your memory kept all the fun stuff and all the stuff that was important to you, but the details like did you have to have a ticket to get in or how you got there, all these other less interesting, less exciting aspects, your brain kind of decided letting go of all that information.","340":"Yeah, that's a great insight. Basically we can't remember everything. So when you tell us this memory of that vacation and your brain is able to kind of play almost this movie of a memory, a moment, a day that you had in your life a while ago, where do those memories come from?","341":"The hippocampus is a part of your brain that if you kind of took it out and looked at it, it looks a lot like a seahorse and it plays a really important role in creating those kinds of memories that help you two years after your vacation share with me what happened that day, all these details of that day. There's another part of the brain. It's actually also important for memory and it's called the amygdala and it is important for keeping all the kind of emotional processing going for memory. So memory for things that are really scary, it's gonna talk to the hippocampus now and get that memory to be really strong. Why do you think it might be important to remember scary things?","342":"You got it. And so we don't just remember everything and we don't remember random things. We remember the things that matter to us the most. So Abigail based on our conversation today, can you tell me what is a memory?","343":"I think I agree with you, but I think to really validate our scientific experiment, we should probably compare the length of the string. A lot of extra slack in that pig of string. So what we noticed with great Britain is we were never able to measure it's length. It just kept getting longer and longer. This is called the coastline paradox where there's not really one definite number you can assign to the length of the coastline, but it depends on how you measure it. Like if we kept going to really get this to be accurate, we might have to like actually go down the beach and start measuring these tiny little details along the coastline. But really there's so much detail. We would probably never get a definite answer for how long the coastline is. Fractals also give us a really nice language. We're talking about how smooth or rough some kind of shape is. And actually a lot of people, engineers and scientists use this idea of fractals and this language of fractals to compare different shapes, not in terms of their size, but in terms of their roughness. So based on everything we talked about today, how would you describe a fractal to somebody in your own words?","344":"Yeah, totally.  Like it's a shape that you can't use sort of the ordinary language that we use to talk about shapes you really need some other ideas or concepts to talk about.","345":"Our topic today is quantum sensing. So quantum is about the study of stuff that's really, really, really small and sensing is about measuring. So the word sensing comes from kind of like our senses. So do you know what your five senses are?","346":"Touch, exactly. So it's kind of really important for us to be able to have these senses, so we know what's happening in the world around us, right? In doing quantum sensing is we're trying to measure things that can be hard to see. Let me show you. Can you see inside it with your eyes?","347":"You wouldn't be able to see into the middle. If you had the right tools, you could start to think about ways to look inside the ball without cutting it open. That would then, you'd still have your ball. We could still play with it.","348":"For example, we want to go inside, let's say the human body and see what's happening. Sometimes we can look under the surface of the Earth and see what's underneath it. We can make really, really precise clocks that will tell us, that can measure time really, really accurately. And we can make very, very fine measurements that'll tell us about the rules of science and how the world works around us. But we need to build better tools that allow us to do that.","349":"In a way, it's part of the same continuum. What you're doing is changing the technological platform and you're actually able to probe it more sensitively. The resolution you're able to get is much higher, so you can see smaller signals in a much smaller volume.","350":"You have to be close to it. You can detect it optically because if we tried to detect the magnetic moment of the electron, we wouldn't be able to do that because there, the energy is too low compared to thermal energies. But what the diamond system gives you is a natural up conversion in energy. So you can couple into an optical photon, which is then much easier to detect a single optical photon than it is to detect a micro wave.","351":"And that was a source of noise, like, it's completely random, but it is still there. And then the other form is very much what is intrinsically within your experiment itself because some of the materials that you have have defects that are coupling into your sensor, into your quantum system and are also producing noise.","352":"Right, it could give you information if you read it out, about what's happening or you have to find smart ways to suppress it so that you can focus on what you really do care about.","353":"I would tend to agree that I think, in some sense, anything that uses superposition could be a quantum sensor, but then spectroscopy uses superpositions and has been around for 60, 70 years. I think what excites me most now is the idea that can we push the boundaries of how sensitive one can make this technique? How improving sensitivity, specificity, what other limits and we define it better, are there fundamental physical limits?","354":"Right. People bring in very different perspectives into what used to be a very niche field. I remember in physics, you'd only talk to people in your subfield and now we're picking up the phone and talking to people in the different departments, completely different areas and we're forced to learn different languages.","355":"it's something that we've already figured out for classical computing like something that amazes me is all the parallels between what we're going through now for quantum computing and what we went through for classical computing","356":"exactly so i think something that frustrates a lot of people about quantum computing is the concept of decoherence right you can only keep your information quantum for so long right and that limits how many operations you can do in a row before you lose your information","357":"you know now that everybody around the world can access a quantum computer through the cloud people are doing all kinds of cool things they're building games we've seen the emergence of quantum gains right what do you think people want to do with them","358":"Yeah it looks really blocky. And it's the same thing not only with shapes and games, but also colors and textures. And this is an especially a big problem in virtual reality because you have no control over where people are gonna go. What they're gonna look at, how close they're gonna get to various objects. So fractals on the other hand are these things that have infinitely, you know, nice details you get closer and closer and closer. And so this is something that can help us solve this problem in computer graphics of generating more detail. One of the reasons why fractals are really nice for computer graphics is because the algorithms that we use to draw images also have this kind of recursive flavor. What's recursion?","359":"They're easy for a computer to execute, right? It just has to run this recursive procedure over and over and over again. We can kind of get as much detail as we want or need. When I think about fractals and kind of what they've done for computer graphics. The example I think is subdivision surfaces. Did you, did you encounter subdivision surfaces in your graphics class at all?","360":"So subdivision surface is a way of describing a smooth shape on a computer rather than some complicated fractal shape. So meshes and computer graphics are usually made of these flat polygons with kind of sharp edges. And so the question is how can I get something nice and round and smooth out of these sharp looking polygons? What I can do is I can start cutting one at a time, the corners of this paper off, it still looks very angular. I still have these really sharp points.","361":"Because I want to draw a smooth curve on the screen, but all my computer can do is draw straight lines. And that's actually too true of GPUs. It's kind of interesting. GPUs are basically really fast machines that can only draw one thing and that's a flat triangle. And so if we keep doing this with our paper, you kind of get pretty quickly the idea of what's gonna happen. So when you go to see a Pixar movie, for instance, every surface has been subdivided down. So you have tiny little triangles called micro polygons that are even smaller than the size of a pixel.","362":"Well, because people who really need to use these subdivision services for everything, people who worked hard over the years to make this super, super fast. In fact, subdivision services were invented basically at Pixar. There's this guy, Ed Capel, and he was harshly responsible for one of the most famous kinds of subdivision surfaces called Capel Clark subdivision surfaces. And in fact recently won the touring award for these subdivision services.","363":"So we've, talked a little bit about the positive features of fractals and procedural graphics, which is you can write one simple recursive program and the computer creates a lot of detail for you. So that's really nice, right? It's saving you a lot of work, but the downside is you lose a lot of control. So because the only thing you're describing is this short little program, you don't have complete control over how this is gonna end up. And so adding more controllability to procedural graphics is something people have been thinking about for many years. So how has our conversation changed your understanding of what fractals are all about?","364":"Okay, back into the 1960s, there was a research agency in the United States called DARPA, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency. Actually, it was called ARPA at the time. They wanted to build this notion of a packet-switching network. Not a circuit switch network like a phone network where you get a dedicated path and a dedicated set of bandwidth and links from source to destination.","365":"There's a lot big, right? And so remember, this was a Department of Defense, was they wanted to have forms of of communication that were very robust, that were survivable. Packets could all find their own ways, be routed differently through the network. So if parts of the network failed, you could route around failures.","366":"So you can sort of see how the network architecture that wasn't designed to be 100% reliable inside the core of the network, and had that complexity built into the edges of the network. And to me, the really cool thing is you put this infrastructure in place, and then all these super creative people think about amazing things to build on top of it. And you see this proliferation of amazing applications.","367":"Okay, well I don't know about the number seven, but there's something in the internet that's sort of similar to that. It's called the Domain Name System. The DNS's role is to translate names like gaia.cs.umass.edu, or ibm.com, or facebook.com to an IP address so that your application can actually send a message to that name, to that named service.","368":"That's 98% true. And if you own a network, like you're att.com, or your verizon.com, you can do, within that network, you can do what you want, right? So in that sense, the internet is very decentralized, that the control of the network is up to whoever owns the network. The 2% where you said there's nobody in control, there's a little bit of centralized control. There's an organization called the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers. Its responsibility is to handle, as the name ICANN suggests, names and numbers. It's that little bit of centralization, central authority that you need.","369":"In terms of tenfold speeds of increases, depending on what device you're using right now, it's available, all you need to do is upgrade. So the Wi-Fi protocol's called 802.11. And this is sometimes a source of confusion for people. How can it be that I've got a connection at 100 megabits per second from our TV into our router? 100 megabits per second not enough?","370":"Exactly, right. And maybe they're dropped in your apartment, but much more likely, they're dropped because of congestion somewhere between the Hulu or the Netflix or the Disney server, if you're watching a video, and your home. So even though you've got 200 megabits per second on that last hop, you don't have 200 megabits per second from the server into your apartment.","371":"Yeah. It is exactly using quantum phenomena to sense and measure things and the idea is that, if I can harness quantum phenomena and I can push the limits that are possible, I can get something that's ultimately more precise and potentially more accurate over time too.","372":"So in some sense, the phenomena we're studying essentially is nuclear magnetic resonance or electron spin resonance which is a very similar phenomena, but uses the spin of the electron rather than the spin of the nuclei.","373":"So you can implant nitrogen into a diamond and then you bombard it with electrons to create the vacancies and then you heat it up and anneal it, and then you get these nitrogen-vacancy centers in your system. So you mentioned quantum computing earlier. So have you heard of the idea of superposition?","374":"So that's in some ways the key to both quantum sensing, as well as quantum computing. It's the idea that you can take a system and put it in a superposition of two states. Normally we think of classically a bit can be a zero or a one. So switch is either on or off. Whereas in a quantum system, it can be in what's called a superposition. So it can be partially on and partially off. But one of the challenges with quantum systems is that these superpositions are really hard to maintain because we don't see superpositions in the world around us. In quantum computing, you try really hard to isolate everything so that you can maintain this quantum property and the fact that it's actually going to lose its quantum properties as it interacts with the world also makes it a great sensor because now you're actually, you're using that fact that it's interacting with the world to say, wait, it's sensing something.","375":"So rather than trying to build a lot of complex algorithms and gates with it, what you do is, you take these quantum bits and you take them out into the world and say, what do you see? What are you sensitive to? So you can use an idea called entanglement to make an even more sensitive quantum sensor, but it's even more fragile. So there's always this trade-off between being super fragile and being super sensitive at the same time.","376":"So entanglement is the idea that two particles are correlated. They're essentially in the same quantum state, so that you can't disturb one particle without disturbing the second particle. And so, if I have a large number of quantum sensors that are entangled, then they're all going to interact much more strongly than if I just had one of them interact at a time.","377":"In some ways, it is and you know, atomic clocks are remarkable devices and being able to measure time that precisely has really important consequences. In fact, our old GPS system is based on the accuracy of atomic clocks. They're a set of satellites, each of which has an atomic clock on board and they send out a timestamp and so, once it gets a signal from three different satellites, it can triangulate and figure out exactly where you are. Now, if you could make those clocks even more precise, you could actually accurately position where you are even more accurately.","378":"So some ways, you know, when atomic clocks were designed and built, we didn't necessarily think of GPS, but technology often works that way is that, there are new discoveries and then someone else comes along and says, hey, this is a great tool for some other application.","379":"Wow. Great question. Often, it's a little blue wire called an ethernet cable. So that cable is able to bring bits of information up into your apartment at say, a billion bits per second. That's pretty fast, right? Literally a wire that goes between a box in your apartment, sometimes called a router or a modem in your apartment that comes from an internet service provider come into this first network and then that network connects to another network connects to another network connects to another network.","380":"The underseas cables are so cool! They're these big cables that are laid down by switches. They cross both the Atlantic, the Pacific, the Indian Ocean. So the undersea cables are how the networks in Europe, United States, Asia are all connected together.","381":"That's really what we call the first hop. It's like from your phone, from your tablet, from the computer that you're on, there's no cables coming in. You go over a wireless connection. Wi-Fi is the protocol that allows your computer to talk to that first hop router over a wireless communication link.","382":"Ah, you said they're all in one spot. In fact, they're in lots of spots in Netflix. And so most applications would like to connect you with a server that's close to you. Server is really just a big computer with a lot of memory, a lot of discs that store all the Netflix movies, and also so that you don't have to cross over too many internet links to get from where the server is to the TV or the device in your home.","383":"Today we're gonna think about infinity as a cardinality, which is a technical term for a number that could be a size of a set. And we're gonna use this idea of one-to-one correspondence to try and investigate the question of whether all infinite sets have the same size. So what I've drawn here are some pictures of some of the infinite sets that appear in mathematics. So the natural numbers are the prototypical example of an infinite set. So the natural numbers are clearly a subset of the integers. Both of these are infinite sets. Are they the same size infinity or different size infinities?","384":"I'm gonna now try and convince you that they are in fact the same size infinity. And this is using this idea of a one-to-one correspondence which was applied in this context by Georg Cantor. What he says is if we can match up the elements of the integers with the elements of the natural numbers so that there's nothing left over, so that there's a bijective function between them, then that's a proof that there's exactly as many natural numbers as there are integers. Start by matching zero with zero and one with one. But then we wanna include the negatives in the list. So which natural number would we match with negative one?","385":"Maybe two. Why not? Because now we're starting to make progress on matching all the negatives. We can match the natural number three with the integer two, the natural number four with the integer minus two. And do you see a pattern?","386":"Exactly. That's exactly right. So we were hoping to compare the size of infinity of the rational numbers with the size of infinity of the natural numbers. What we've done is introduced an intermediate set, these pair of integer points, and this proves that this size of infinity is smaller than this size of infinity. Since we also have an injective function the other way, this size of infinity is smaller than this size of infinity so therefore they must be the same size.","387":"Georg Cantor proved that it is impossible to count all real numbers like we've just counted the rational numbers or just counted the integers. This is called the cardinality of the continuum, it is uncountable. What I'm going to do now is form a new real number that I guarantee is not on this list. Okay, so here's how we do this. What I'm gonna do is I'm gonna look at the diagonal elements. So I'll highlight them. This continues forever, and now I'm going to form a new real number by changing all of these.","388":"Yes. You see the idea right away. So I'm gonna form a new real number whose first digit is different from this one. And you've already convinced yourself that this number is not on this list anywhere. Why is that?","389":"Great. That's exactly right. So what we've proven is that this number is missing, and therefore it is impossible to define a bijection between the natural numbers and the real numbers.","390":"So we've started to explore some of the counterintuitive properties of infinity. On the one hand there are infinite sets that feel very different like the natural numbers, the integers, the rational numbers that nevertheless have the same size or the same infinite cardinality. While there are other infinities that are larger. So there's more than one size of infinity, not all infinities are created equal.","391":"Really glad you asked me that. There's a practical implication for computer science. Alan Turing, he came up with a mathematical model of a computer, something called a Turing machine. So Turing was wondering is it possible to compute every real number, an arbitrary real number to within arbitrary precision in finite time? He defined a real number to be computable< if you could calculate its value, maybe not exactly, but as accurately as you'd like in a finite amount of time. And because there are uncountably infinitely many real numbers, but only a countably infinitely many Turing machines, what that means is that the vast majority of real numbers are uncomputable. So we'll never be able to access them with a computer program.","392":"yeah this whole infrastructure is all about creating levels that get progressively colder as you go from top to bottom down to the quantum chip which is how we actually control the state of the cupids","393":"okay so it's this idea that you have two objects and when you entangle them together they become connected and then they're sort of permanently connected to each other and they behave in ways that are sort of a system now so superposition is one quantum property that we use entanglement is another quantum property and a third is interference how much you know about interference","394":"so step one is you need to be able to have an object or physical device we call it a qubit or quantum bit that can actually handle those things can actually be put into superpositions of states you know two cubit states that you can physically entangle with each other that's not really trivial right and things in our classical world you can't really entangle things in our classical world so easily we need to use devices where they can they can support a quantum state and we can manipulate that quantum state atoms ions and in our case superconducting qubits we make qubits out of superconducting materials","395":"it's a perfect question i mean it's very early for quantum computing but we're building assembly languages we're building layers of abstraction that are going to get you to a point as a programmer where you can interchangeably be programming something the way that you already do and then make calls to a quantum computer so that you can bring it in when it makes sense we're not envisioning quantum computers completely replacing classical computers anytime soon we think that quantum computing is going to be used to accelerate the kinds of things that are really hard for for classical machines","396":"simulating nature is something that's really hard because if you take something like you know modeling atomic bonding and electronic orbital overlap instead of now writing out a giant summation over many terms you try and actually mimic the system you're trying to simulate directly on a quantum computer which we can do for chemistry and uh we're looking at ways of doing that for other types of things there's a lot of exciting research right now on machine learning trying to use quantum systems to accelerate machine learning problems","397":"So black holes, you describe them as huge. The interesting thing about black holes is they're hugely heavy, but they're actually physically really small. What really matters is the density. Do you know what density is?","398":"I can also ask how big it is, which is a question about its volume. If I make it smaller, then what's happening is it's becoming more dense. So imagine I crushed this really, really small. It would weigh the same, it would have the same mass, but it would be much more dense.","399":"If a star is heavy enough to explode into supernova what's left begins to collapse under its own weight. And if that's heavy enough, the core will not be able to stop collapsing, 'cause it no longer has the thermonuclear fuel, it's run outta fuel. And if it's run outta fuel, it's no longer shining and pushing outward. And without that it itself begins to go dark and there's nothing fighting the collapse anymore. And that's when you form a black hole.","400":"Well, that's a really good question. So interestingly, the sun itself isn't heavy enough. So it has to be heavy enough that when it begins to collapse, it just overcomes all attempts to fight it. If you made something really dense, you would have to travel faster than the speed of light to actually escape. That's 300,000 kilometers per second.","401":"It is taking other stuff, but the funny question was like, if I wanted to move your chair, you'd think it was really strange if I didn't have to come near you and actually grab the chair and move it. One of the things Einstein thought about is he imagined that what the black hole is doing is it's changing the shape of space around it. What do you think of that idea?","402":"Isn't it crazy? And then Einstein goes a step further and thinks, well, what black holes must be doing is curving the space so strongly that even light gets caught. Sometimes you can get light caught into a whole orbit, literally the light going round and round in an orbit.","403":"So one of my main research areas is something called category theory, it's been described as the mathematics of mathematics. It's a language that can be used to prove very general theorems. And an interesting aspect of being a researcher in category theory that doesn't come up as much in other areas is that we have to really pay attention to the axioms of set theory in our work. When you're proving theorems, have you ever used the axiom of choice?","404":"So the way I think about it is if you have an infinite or an arbitrary family of sets and you know for sure that none of these sets are empty, then a choice function would allow you to select an element from each set sort of all at once. When you've used the axiom of choice in proofs, do you know which incarnation of this you've used?","405":"So there are three well-known famous equivalent forms of the axiom of choice. The well ordering principle is the assumption, the axiom that any set can be well ordered, but there are lots of subsets of real numbers that do not have a minimal element. So that ordering is not a well ordering. So here's the key question. Do you believe the axiom of choice?","406":"We're used to ethernet cables that can handle many hundreds of gigabits per second over a wired device. What are the typical data rates for IoT devices? I mean, not hundreds of gigabits.","407":"My sense is you're spot on, that they'll produce over time, a lot of data. And that a lot of IoT is about computing on that data. That computation happened mostly at the edge, or somehow a combination between the edge and something happening in a far away data center.","408":"I think for a long time, the internet hasn't grappled with, but now has with IoT and also with cellular networks, generally is the question of mobility. Do you imagine in the future that it might be possible for mobile devices not to always have to connect through the same provider to go from one network to another?","409":"Absolutely. I don't think we still have a completely satisfactory answer to that question. What was so, such a beautiful insight, as I'm sure you know, is that the idea of zero-knowledge","410":"If you can already predict the answer, then you must not be gaining any knowledge by that interaction. This insight of being able to predict the future accurately, and that being an evidence of a lack of new knowledge,","411":"Right. Sometimes. I mean, for example, in medical research, how amazing would it be, right, to be able to have a drug, and be able to prove that my drug works in this model.","412":"in a zero-knowledge way, without any interaction, right. I can just take the program, convert it to a zero-knowledge program, or an obfuscated program, and then just send it to you.","413":"We're definitely at this moment now, where zero-knowledge is gonna be used more and more. There are so many conferences and meetings that occur in the zero-knowledge space, where you and I are not invited. Because it's for the people who are developing. You know, the people who are programming, not us mathematicians.","414":"It's a great question. I wish I could see the future. I can't actually, but let me try. The part of that that I'm the most comfortable answering is of course the mathematical side.","415":"Yeah, and probably nobody is. Have you heard a lot in your studies about these super massive black holes that we think lurk in the centers of very nearly every galaxy?","416":"Yeah, I think it's a really good question. The only mechanism that we know for sure can form black holes is to collapse of very massive stars. So it's sensible to think, well maybe some very massive stars in a young universe collapsed under their own weight and then they merged and after some time they got big enough, but the black holes from stars can be tens of times the mass of the sun, maybe hundreds of times to the mass of the sun if they merge. To get to millions and billions, and if you just do the simple arithmetic of how many years that would take, there aren't enough years in the 14 billion years of the universe's lifetime. So they must have come from somewhere else.","417":"There might be many alternate routes. It might be in the very early universe that bubbles in unusual phase transitions from very high energy universe to a low energy universe can make black holes. Like, we haven't really thought of the range of possibilities.And so there could also be primordial black holes that are still around that also skipped the star stage altogether that were formed really in the very earliest phases. And I think the interesting thing is, with your looking at like the Large Magellanic Cloud, is to wonder if we're gonna merge.","418":"But when we do merge with Andromeda, presumably our black holes will merge and Andromeda indeed has a very big black hole as well at its center. And then we'll have this just gigantic-","419":"Yeah, and it's very possible that as you said, the collision won't be so severe that it'll be very disruptive. So our entire solar system could stay intact and here we would go with the sun and all the other planets in orbit around a new black hole.","420":"We work a lot right now on thinking of black holes as batteries. So a black hole that can take, like a giant magnet, astronomical magnet in the form of another collapsed star, like a neutron star, and flip it around so fast, near the speed of light, that it actually creates an electronic circuit out of this moving magnet. And so that the power that can come out of these electronic circuits created by these batteries can be tremendous.","421":"So Claire, we've had this pretty fascinating conversation about supermassive black holes in particular. And after our discussion, what is it that has changed for you in your perspective or what is it that excites you?","422":"if you think about even just classical information like bits right at the end of the day when you store a bit in your hard drive there's a magnetic domain and you have a magnetic polarization right","423":"you can change the magnetization to be pointing up or pointing down right quantum systems we're still manipulating a device and changing the quantum state of that of that device you can imagine if it's a spin that you could have spin up and spin down but you can also if you isolate it enough you can have a superposition of up and down","424":"there's sort of two main classes of quantum algorithms there's algorithms which were developed for decades right things like shore's algorithm which is for factoring grover's algorithm for unstructured search and these algorithms were designed assuming that you had a perfect fault tolerant quantum computer which is many decades away so we're currently in a phase where we're exploring what can we do with these near-term quantum computers and the answer is going to be well we need different kinds of algorithms to really even explore that question","425":"One thing I find really fascinating about robotics is that the things that are so simple for us, like feeding yourself broccoli, so second nature to us, are really hard for robotics. When you try to take a robot and train it to do a task and simulation, and the simulation isn't perfectly accurate, it's really hard to actually model the physics of how tofu crumbles.","426":"I think I have a somewhat similar perspective to you in that, if we provide more structure and support, and sort of forms of prior knowledge or experience in the algorithm, that should make it more efficient. And so if we can acquire those kinds of priors about the world and about interaction from previous data, maybe offline data, then I think we should be able to make learning of new tasks more efficient.","427":"It's a really, really hard problem. A lot of simulators, they don't simulate the world as a fine enough time granularity to really accurately capture things like skewing an object, for example. One thing that I think is promising is to try to not build simulators entirely from first principles, from our knowledge of physics. But instead to look at real data and see how real data might inform our simulations and try to build, allow robots to build models of the world, build simulators of the world, based on data and based on experiences. There's a little bit of a chicken and egg problem, because if we wanna use simulators to get lots of data, and we also need data to get good simulators, then there's no way to get around this.","428":"So a fractal is something that we see every day, but it's a little bit hard to describe. It's it's a shape that if you look at it really far away, or you look at it really up close, it has kind of a similar appearance. And actually that word fractal sounds a little bit like fraction.","429":"And that's kind of what we're gonna try out today. In fact, we're gonna have you build a fractal. A tree is a really good example of a fractal because if you look at the whole tree and then you break off a big branch of the tree.","430":"So your tree is totally beautiful, but it took a long time to make, right. How would you feel if I said, now you have to make a thousand of those trees.","431":"Yeah, it's a ton of work. If you think about Moana's island, it has these tens and hundreds of thousands of trees on it. And that's why we need computers to help us out because computers are really good at taking these really simple rules, like put two branches on every other branch and doing it really, really fast.","432":"Like coding, exactly. That's what actually a lot of the artists for the movies are working with code rather than with a paintbrush. So in your own words, how would you describe a fractal to somebody?","433":"We're in level five now. So you're the expert-expert. I'm a huge fan of the work that you did in RCP, the Routing Control Platform being a precursor to software-defined networking and the notion that rather than having protocols actually always compute things, that we could compute things in data centers. I'd be interested if you could sort of just reflect back on that time and sort of the beginnings of SDN and where it's come since then.","434":"I mean, even you could just tell that two people are communicating even though the traffic itself is encrypted. So you don't know what they're saying, just even knowing two devices are communicating.","435":"You're one of the most awesome networking researchers that I know. I'm curious, just to pick your brain, what do you think are some of the hot topics in networking research? Where do you think the field is heading?","436":"You know, we've had cellular networks now for 20, 30 years. So when we hear about 5G, what's trumpeted the most is the fact that oh, super high bandwidth, right? But I sense that the exciting things are more than just the network being faster.","437":"Coming back again to the softwarization. SDN and softwarization is a maybe a little bit behind the covers, that you wouldn't normally see it as a user going from 3G to 4G to 5G. You just see an increase in speed. But yet, the way the network is now being managed again, I think is bringing the cellular networking world sort of into the internet world in terms of the softwarization-","438":"So that's a great definition and I wanna pick that apart a little bit. So what you described is just right. Stars, when they run out of thermonuclear fuel are gonna collapse under their own weight. It'll explode in a supernova, it'll leave a core, and if the core itself is heavy enough, it will keep collapsing. It does, as you say, reach this point where not even light can escape. But the amazing thing is it leaves that point, you called it rightly the event horizon, it leaves it behind kind of like an archeological record because the start itself can no more sit at the event horizon than it can race outward at the speed of light. So the core of the star keeps collapsing and where it goes nobody knows. So in a weird way, the black hole isn't anymore a crush of matter. It left it behind in its wake, but the stuff of the star is gone.","439":"So from the outside, if you're an astronaut, you're watching your friend, another astronaut going into the black hole, it's as though your times become rotated relative to each other. So the profound thing is as an astronaut on the outside, looking at this round event horizon, you think of the center of black hole as a point in space, but to the person who's fallen in, it's not a point in space at all, it's a point in time. The singularity, or the end of it all, the crush in the center of a black hole is in their future. So they can no more avoid the singularity than you can avoid the next instant of time coming. So the death in the singularity is inevitable. Although we don't really think the singularity necessarily exists.","440":"I would say to some extent we don't know for sure. What we have found is that the mathematics is so unbelievably powerful that we're able to disprove wrong ideas just in pen and paper. Just very recently, within the past couple of years, the first ever human-procured image of a black hole showed us what we expected to see of the event horizon. So Jayda, after our conversation today, what would you say a black hole is?","441":"The beauty of being a student of something like black holes is you never stop having new impressions of what this enigmatic phenomena is. So in a year, I'll tell you what I learned that's new.","442":"There's this domain of black holes in astrophysics where we see stars collapse, and we know that they exist and there's whole observational astronomy around them. And then there's this domain that we're talking about, where, as you said, black holes are so special because they're kind of guiding us in the right direction to understand the very nature of reality. And that makes them really unusually special. And one of the things I wanted to draw out is that we talk about the fundamental forces of nature. So there's the matter forces, and then the outlier is gravity. We've quantized all the matter forces in a way that we're rather comfortable with. Gravity keeps resisting quantization of gravity itself. And now we're thinking in a way that you're describing that, well, maybe it's only the quantum forces altogether.","443":"It is amazing in the numerical simulations of two black holes merging, you really see the event horizons bobble around. And we were talking earlier about how really black holes are flawless, they don't tolerate those kinds of imperfections. And so you can so quickly watch the system wring away that misshapen merger. And it comes out in the gravitational waves, which is literally the ripples in the shape of spacetime until it settles down, and then it's utterly flawless again. It really happens fast. It's quite amazing.","444":"Exactly. Right. Because random is unpredictable and that's what we want. Right. We want that unpredictability around us to be utilized, to actually hide the information that we wanna hide. How have you used your knowledge in the projects that you've worked on? What are the challenges that you find?","445":"And also in the blockchain space, for example, if you wanna speed up the generation of proofs, if that could be done in a distributed way, then that would be great. One of the hopes that I have is that the power of multi-party computation is about bringing people together who are mutually distrustful.","446":"And on one hand memory is like a record of something that happened in the past that we can carry with us and we can like bring it back to mind. And on the other hand we need to be a little bit suspicious sometimes because we might get it wrong. In what world would that memory of the orange juice maybe be useful?","447":"Everything you just said is exactly what we know from research. All the thoughts running through your mind, were really at kind of about a prediction into the future, right? You're like, how, how will this taste if, when it's in my mouth or how will I feel about my decision down the road? You know we think of memory as something in the past, but it's an example of how you use your memories of these two candies to predict what's gonna happen in the future so that you can make a decision in the present. But you did it, you made your way through that torture. And now you've got to keep the candy.","448":"We fluctuate a lot because we use different kinds of memory to kind of resolve the uncertainty basically every time. But also the way we make decisions will change because our memories change. What's interesting about your brain as a teenager is that we know it's actually a phase of life where the brain is especially sensitive to rewards, to things that are exciting and positive. It's a phase of life where those rewards, whether it's candy or your friends or whatever it is that's exciting can have an especially powerful control over the decisions you make and the memories you create.","449":"The internet is, physically, these computers that all talk to each other. Billions of computers, in the case of the internet. The internet allows us to do a lot of really, really interesting, what we call applications. You ever think about how that video gets to you over the internet?","450":"Matilda. All right. We're gonna actually build an internet. I've got a couple of things here that I wanna show you, or a couple of toys, actually. Okay, let's pretend that these round balls are computers. And the internet is something that connects them. And right now, the internet is just one communication link. And Matilda is sent over the internet from this computer to your computer. So the internet is a network for carrying information from one computer to another. Now this network here looks pretty simple, doesn't it? Right? It's just one thing. Should we add some more friends in?","451":"That's right. So that's pretty cool. There are actually lots of different ways to actually go through the internet to get from what we call a source, the place that's sending the information, to the receiver, the place that's actually gathering the information together. And that's something we actually call routing.","452":"Yeah. So that's a really good observation. In most pieces of the internet, that's exactly what would happen. We want to take what's called a shortest path. But still, there are multiple paths. And why do you think that might be valuable?","453":"Exactly. So, Skylar, that was a great discussion about what we just built. And I wanted to talk to you about, or ask you about maybe one other really important part about networks. And it's not so much the thing itself, the physical thing, but more about the rules about communication. That's governed by something that are called protocols. Are you up for one?","454":"Lettuce go on. [Skylar and Jim laughing] A knock, knock joke is an example of a protocol, right? The computer that you are using say, makes a request, you ask for something, you get something in return. In the internet, there are protocols everywhere. So that two computers that have never talked to each other before know the rules for talking to each other. This global internet with billions of people using it are just lots of smaller networks that are all hooked together to each other. But also, what the internet allows are all of these what we call applications, Zoom, video playing services, can all run on top of the same internet.","455":"It's a great analogy. You know I remember when I first learned of your work, for me as somebody who studies learning and memory, which are processes that are all about rapid updating that to me was really mind blowing that we can now start asking questions about dynamics of circuits on a timescale that's much closer to the timescale of human thought than anything we had before.","456":"In the field we often talk of have having a mental model that we use to make predictions about what's about to happen and really use that to mean kind of a general understanding of what's going on. What does that look like in terms that come from your world of like the configuration of, of a circuit?","457":"We now think of the hippocampus so much in terms of memory but really some of the earliest work in neuroscience on the hippocampus talked about the role of the hippocampus in spatial navigation. And it really exposed I think one of the deepest questions in memory research, or at least from the neuroscience perspective is like, well what is the connection? What is the connection between spatial processing and memory? And why is it that neurons in the hippocampus when an animal is navigating a maze, why is it that there's spatial specialization there? I really do think that this notion of a mental model, a generative model is where those, where memory and space meet.","458":"I agree. I think, you know, as you were speaking I was thinking maybe the most important word to replace there is record. Record implies an etching of something as it was. And maybe what we need instead is that it's a model, it's an approximation, it's an abstraction that can help us create the illusion of constructing your record. But that it's the model that's the important thing that drives the whole thing.","459":"Okay, you wanna do the demo for me? So the LIGO instrument electronically records the ringing of the shape of space with its very complicated instrument. It stands for Laser Interferometric Gravitational-Waves Observatory and the design was incredibly difficult and they didn't know if they would succeed. I think of the instrument as like the body of the electric guitar. And then they take the readout of the motions of the waves that they're recording, just like that guitar is recording the motions of the waves on the string. Now just play it like a little bit. And you can't hear anything, right? You're not meant to hear an electric guitar when it's not plugged in. What's happening is the guitar strings are ringing, but so quietly that we can't actually hear the sound. And this is like the gravitational waves, which are ringing the drum of spacetime, but so quietly that they're not move the air and we're not hearing them. So now play and I'm gonna turn the volume up a little bit. While I can't actually hear the ringing of the strings themselves, I can hear the data of the shape of the string recorded and played through this amplifier. And that's kind of the idea behind the LIGO instrument.","460":"It's a great question. If I didn't see you playing the guitar, I would recognize the sound of a guitar. And even if I had never heard of a guitar before I could figure out the frequencies that the string was playing, I could tell how strongly it had been plucked, and I could tell the length of it and where it was pinned down from the harmonics of the string. And I can tell the different lengths of the strings from the notes that they play. So I can actually reconstruct the instrument that's playing it. And it's very similar to LIGO, we can listen to the notes, the amplitude, the harmonics, and we can deduce the size and shape of the objects doing that. And they're very massive and they're very small and they have all the markings of a black hole.","461":"It's a really good question. Only this instrument, and that's why it was so hard to build. And by the time it gets here, it's so weak that it's only squeezing and stretching space at like the fraction of a nucleus over very large distances. Has your understanding of black holes changed over the course of our conversation?","462":"So over the past four levels, we've been talking about Moravec's paradox. I'm curious to get your perspective. There are still a lot of open questions for how to leverage previous experience and learn cumulatively over time.","463":"I think it's interesting. And also a huge challenge. I think that it's interesting that if a person sees a robot doing something that seems very capable, they assume that the robot can do all sorts of other capable things. It's a huge challenge, because that's actually not the case.","464":"I like that description, because it conveys how much complexity there is to these really basic tasks that we're doing. Is there a definition for the simple tasks that we do versus things that are more complex, like playing chess?","465":"That notion of hierarchy is really interesting, because it is these higher level things, like playing chess, for example, that are easier for AI systems. And the reason why they're easier is that we're providing the abstraction for the system already, then when we give the game of chess to an AI system, we abstract away all the challenges of like picking up pieces and moving them, and we say, 'Okay, there's this board of however many boxes on it.' And you just need to figure out within that very narrow, small world, what to do. But handling and learning what those abstractions should be and handling everything from low level sensory inputs to that higher level processing is really, really hard.","466":"I suspect that we'll start by doing whatever is most convenient, 'cause that's whatever we can get. But I think that for robots to be capable alongside humans, in a world with humans, I think that we may need to actually use human experience, human learning, to inform how robots learn, if we want them to follow the same kind of mistake pattern as humans, so that humans can interpret robots, and humans can understand what robots will and will not do.","467":"What I love about what you were describing is like you didn't use the word memory, were how you were talking about kind of perceptions and social judgments but I think probably we'd both agree that memory is a big part of that.","468":"Some of those examples really remind me also some of the questions about kind of abnormalities in, in memory or trauma or disruptions in memory and how they also play out in terms of not just what people remember but what they do with those memories right?","469":"I think what we're still kind of trying to understand as a field is the more kind of detailed and bigger picture of where does this model live? How does it get updated based on experiences? Why does that sometimes happen and sometimes not? There are actually people who are born without a hippocampus. They have disruptions to episodic memories. They have trouble after this conversation remembering what the conversation was about, but they do have pretty good semantic information. They have a good sense of knowledge about the world. And that's interesting for two reasons. One, it shows this association between the role of the hippocampus and these two forms of memory, episodic memories and semantic memory. The other reason it's interesting is that people often assume that we get to semantic memory through episodic memory, that we encounter one dog and then another dog, and then another dog and then we learned the concept, the semantic notion of a dog. And these people, their profile suggests that you can learn semantic information. You can learn general knowledge about the world, even without ever having the capacity to build those individual memories.","470":"You know when I look back at, some of the work for my own lab and in the field in general, I really feel like some of the most exciting discoveries were not an answer to a question that was around before, but they were discoveries that made us realize we weren't asking the right question. I think one example of that even has to do with the connection between memory and decision-making. There was a discovery about how the striatum responds to rewards and to learning that just all of a sudden flipped the way we thought about the role of reward and learning and memory, and may force us to realize there was something fundamentally connected between these processes. And that discovery just raised a whole new set of questions that didn't exist before.","471":"And things that are hard for humans should also be hard for robots and humans to do. But it turns out that it's actually the opposite. I wanna try a little demo.","472":"So I have a penny in my hand and I'd like you to pick it up with your right hand and put it into your left hand. So that was pretty easy, right?","473":"We're gonna make this a little bit harder now. So, can you put these on? And we'll try to do the same thing again with your eyes closed. There you go. Let's try that one more time, and see if you can do any better. So close your eyes.","474":"Yeah. So that you're able, with a bit more practice, you're able to figure it out. When it fell on the ground, how did you know to pick it up off the ground?","475":"Yeah. It's really unintuitive. In order to survive, we need to pick up objects and everything. Basically many, many, like billions of years of evolution actually created humans and the ability to manipulate objects like that. So, it actually turns out that things that are really basic for us are actually just really complex tasks in general.","476":"That's a great question. So in reinforcement learning, the robot tries the task, and then it gets some sort of reinforcement, some sort of feedback. It's similar to how you might train a dog.","477":"So you could give it feedback like that. So it won't necessarily know itself, especially on the first few tries, but it's trying to figure out what the task is even.","478":"It depends on how you program the robot. If you program the robot to follow exact motions and follow a very specific program, then it won't go off that program. It will always do those actions. But if something unexpected happens, that the program wasn't designed to handle, then the robot might go off court.","479":"I think that robotics is really, really hard. Having robots do even really basic stuff, like pick up objects, is really, really hard. So if they do take over the world, I think it'll be a very, very, very, very long time from now.","480":"Or you don't even need computers. Like I remember when I was a kid, I played electric guitar and I had all these guitar pedals with different effects and oh, what happens if you put the output back in the input and just run it through itself, you're gonna start hearing this kind of fractal sound, right? So today we've been telling people, fractals are things that are somehow self-similar, they have detail at all scales. Are there other ways you might introduce fractals to somebody or are there other things you might say, this is what a fractal is?","481":"I think that's also, what's so beautiful about fractals is that, you know, if you think about sort of the history of geometry as well, Felix Klein was looking at geometry by saying, well, geometry is all about in variance. I have some group of transformations and I look at objects that are sort of in variant with respect to these transformations. So if you just look at translations, okay, what kinds of shapes remain the same under translations? Will you get tiling? You get wallpaper. And if you start asking that same question, what if I allow scaling in my transformations then boom, you have fractal.","482":"Now you work on kind of the future of virtual reality and augmented reality and extended reality. But it's kind of interesting because I think if I think about exploring these infinite fractal landscapes in some way, they still feel a little bit lonely or they feel a little bit poor of the kind of richness that we have in the real world.","483":"So one of the things I guess that touches on is this question about controllability or the ease of, with which everybody can create these worlds. Not just people, not just mathematicians, not just, you know, trained computer scientists. One thing when I think about Ken Musgraves working about this program, Bryce, this one I felt like I could really use, what do you think we still need to do in terms of putting these kinds of tools in, in people's hands, making it easier for people to use procedural machine learning, to build these kind of worlds?","484":"Yeah. And I think this is what what's so beautiful also about Mandelbrot's work is him saying, you know, it's not really about these exotic examples. Like even the Mandelbrot set or Julia sets or whatever. Yeah they're like really interesting mathematical curiosities, but they get at this idea that fractals are kind of inevitable. And Bob Ross probably never, as far as I know, never sat down and you know, thought about recursive descriptions of trees or anything like that. But it's just something that naturally comes to you as an artist.","485":"That's a great way to think about it. Infinity is something that never ends, where finite, the opposite of infinity, refers to a process or a quantity that we could actually count all the way through, at least in theory if given enough time. So if you had to guess, how many Skittles are in this jar?","486":"217. And if we wanted to figure out the exact number, how would we find out? We could put them all out and divide them into pieces of five and then we could use that. Yeah, absolutely. In fact, I did that before you got here, and it's 649 Skittles. Here's a much harder question. How many pieces of glitter do you think are in that jar?","487":"Yeah, absolutely not. Because this room holds only a finite amount of space. And in fact, infinitely many jars would not even fit in something called the observable universe, which is the portion of the universe that astronomers can see. Really how does that make you feel?","488":"You have very good intuition. So there are ways that mathematicians can build infinite collections of things. And if you repeat those processes, it's in fact possible to build even bigger and bigger sizes of infinity. So what have you learned today about infinity?","489":"so did you know that there's certain kinds of problems that computers sort of run out of space almost like you're trying to solve the problem and just like how you run out of space on your iphone when you're trying to take a picture if you're trying to solve the problem you just run out of space and even if you have the world's biggest supercomputer did you know that can still happen","490":"okay so quantum mechanics is a branch of science just like any other branch of science it's a branch of physics it's the study of things that are either really really small really really well isolated and really really cold and this particular branch of science is something we're using to totally reimagine how computing works so we're building totally new kinds of computers based on the laws of quantum mechanics that's what a quantum computer is","491":"i don't know what it's worth but uh i can put it face up right in that heads i can put it face down right so at any given time point in time if i ask you is my penny heads or tails probably you could answer it right","492":"it's sort of it's sort of a combination of heads and tails right would you say so superposition is this idea that my penny is not just either heads or tails it's in this state which is a combination of heads and tails this quantum property is something that we can have in real real physical objects in the world so that's super position and the second thing that we'll talk about is called entanglement so now i'm going to give you a penny","493":"but in the quantum world when we entangle things they're really now connected it's much much harder to separate them again so using the same analogy we spin our pennies and eventually eventually they both stop right and when they stop it's either heads or tails right so in my case i got tails and you got heads you see how they're totally disconnected from each other right our pennies in the real world now if our pennies were entangled and we both spun them together right when we stopped them if you measured your penny to be ahead i would measure my penny to be ahead and if you measured your penny to be a tails i would measure my opinion to be a tails if we measured it at exactly the same time we would still find that they were both exactly correlated","494":"the way that we are able to actually see these quantum properties is by making our quantum chips really really cold so that's what this is all about actually this is called a dilution refrigerator and it's a refrigerator it doesn't look like a normal refrigerator right but it's something that we use actually there's usually a case around it to cool our quantum chips down cold enough that we can create superpositions and we can entangle qubits and the information isn't lost to the environment","495":"And at some level, there's different set of rules that seem to come into play 'cause you can have particles at very microscopic scales seem to do really strange things. But one of the quests of quantum sensing is to harvest some of these unique properties at the micro scale. We are really interested in quantum sensors because we think they can give us the ultimate limit of sensitivity. So they're really, really sensitive to small changes, but they're also gonna be really reliable. Every time I make that measurement, I'll always get the same results.","496":"And what the MRI scanner is doing is, it's measuring the signal from all the water molecules that are present and specifically the hydrogen atom. In our bodies, we have these hydrogen atoms that are essentially spinning around magnetic fields all the time and we just don't know them. So in some sense, you've already used a quantum sensor.","497":"And then the different chemicals in the cells. If you look at the MRI images, you can see that they give you the broad features of what the tissue looks like. But if you wanna zoom in a little bit more and see what's actually happening inside a tissue or inside a cell and you need a different type of sensor that's gonna be more sensitive and for something like that, you're gonna need a quantum sensor.","498":"We can do it on tissues right now or on the surface, but we can't actually do it inside the body. So right now, we're struggling to figure out which scenarios can we use this to get better information and when can we not do it.","499":"So there are quantum sensors that are sold for very specific applications, one of them is a magnetometer and those can be really, really sensitive to measure small variations in magnetic fields. They are trying to develop sensors that are gravitational sensors. Right now, we have no way of probing what's under the ground without digging into the ground."},"dialogue":{"0":"Explainer: Great.\nExplainee: I'm biased because I study one of the other sub-critical parts of the brain, the cerebellum.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","1":"Explainer: So that's good, because that's why you're here, and so we're talking about sleep today, and really about kind of what is the brain machinery through which we go through consciousness to unconsciousness and that transition.\nExplainee: Great.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","2":"Explainer: Okay. The best way to think about this transition is really called, it's a flip flop switch, okay? So this term comes from engineering, and the idea is that in sleep, you basically have kind of this all of nothing experience. Certainly people kind of drift off to sleep, but then all of a sudden you're unconscious, right? So it seems like it's this flip flop between the arousal system and the sleep promoting system, and it's certainly regulated, and we'll get a little bit into that, but they're certainly kind of made up of two reciprocally inhibitory processes. Okay, so we have the ascending reticular activating system. It originates in the brain stem, and there's a dorsal and a ventral arm to this, and so the dorsal arm has neurons, cholinergic neurons, that go up to the thalamus and then it projections into the fore brain, and then there's the ventral arm, and this is comprised of a whole bunch of different types of neurons, so there are monominergic, so there's kind of dopaminergic neurons that come from the periaqueductal gray, serotonergic ones from the dorsal raphae nuclei, histaminergic neurons that come from the tuberomammillary nucleus of the hippothalamus, and then noradrenergic neurons from the locus coeruleus, and so all of those are kind of working in tandem to kind of drive wake within the brain. So if we just think about drugs that are available inducing wakefulness, we can certainly, kind of the dopaminergic ones jump out, right? So we have amphetamines that kind of drive those signaling, and then modafinil, which is a wake promoting drug for people that have kind of excessive day-time sleepiness that maintains alertness throughout the day.\nExplainee: In terms of the dopamine, if you're taking amphetamines, that's usually to promote, as you said, wakefulness, but does that actually improve the quality of your sleep? How reliable are those kinds of interventions?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","3":"Explainee: In terms of the dopamine, if you're taking amphetamines, that's usually to promote, as you said, wakefulness, but does that actually improve the quality of your sleep? How reliable are those kinds of interventions?\nExplainer: For the role that they play with respect to the sleep-wake system is really kind of amping up the wake system, right? And so certainly that has like down stream consequences for the sleep system, because now the flip flop switch is kind of pushed in a much stronger direction, and we have to kind of rely on what regulates sleep to get it pushed back to sleep.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","4":"Explainer: For the role that they play with respect to the sleep-wake system is really kind of amping up the wake system, right? And so certainly that has like down stream consequences for the sleep system, because now the flip flop switch is kind of pushed in a much stronger direction, and we have to kind of rely on what regulates sleep to get it pushed back to sleep.\nExplainer: And do we know much about why, or which stages of the sleep cycle are affected? You know, if you take amphetamines, is it then when you go to sleep, that you're not able to transition through each of the sleep periods, or is that less clear?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","5":"Explainer: You know, so I think that's less clear. In some ways, you know, getting back to this idea of this wake-sleep system, we have this sleep system that is kind of the counterpoint to this wake arousal system, and so the primary nucleus region is the ventral lateral pre-optic nucleus, also called VLPO, and that has particular neuron outputs that release GABA and galanin, which work in an inhibitory way on kind of the wake promoting ones. And so, it's kind of this delicate balance of these two systems that are ongoing. In your cognitive neuro-science training, right, it sounds like it's pretty specific and focused in a particular part of the brain, the cerebellum, and one thing that I'm interested in is you bring a participant into the study, have you ensured that they got a good night's sleep? Have you asked them about their sleep?\nExplainee: Well in most studies, probably it is advised for your participants before they come in to get a good night's sleep, so those would be recommendations that you would lay out, you know, in communication with the participant, before they come in.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","6":"Explainer: {missing part}\n","7":"Explainer: A lot of people will see you as somebody who's drank in harmony their whole life. They've seen so much harmony, heard so much harmony. How do you make the choices, there's so much that's possible when you know stuff.

Complete surprise. (laughs)\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","8":"Explainer: Yeah.

When we teach machines to learn from data, to build a model from that data or a representation of that, and then to make a prediction. One of the places we often find machine learning in the real world is in things like recommendation systems. So do you have an artist that you really like?\nExplainee: Yeah, Melanie Martinez.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","20":"Explainer: All right. So why do you think Spotify might've recommended that song?\nExplainee: Well, I know that in Melanie Martinez's music, she used a lot of the filtered voice to make it sound very deep and low and that song had that.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","21":"Explainer: And that's actually a really interesting thing to think about because that creepy vibe is something that you can perceive and I can perceive, but it's actually really hard to describe to a machine. What do you think might go into that?\nExplainee: Pitch of the music. If it's really low or if it's super high, it could know that. What can the machine understand?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","22":"Explainer: It's a great question. The machine can understand whatever we tell it to understand. So there might be a person thinking about things, like the pitch or the pacing or the tone, or sometimes machines can figure out things about music or images or videos that we don't tell it to discover, but that it can learn from looking at a lot of different examples. Why do you think companies might use machine learning?\nExplainee: Well, I think things like Facebook or Instagram, they probably use it to target ads.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","23":"Explainer: That's right.\nExplainee: So do you think that we've been able to teach machines enough so that they can do things that even we can't do? And on the opposite side of that, do you think there are things that we can do that a machine might never be able to do?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","24":"Explainer: So what's the connection between neutron stars and black holes?\nExplainee: So, as I understand it, a black hole is sort of like a neutron star's big brother. It's more intense, though. If you have so much matter when a star is collapsing that it can't hold itself up, it collapses to a black hole, and those are so dense that space-time breaks down in some way or another.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","25":"Explainer: Black holes are so amazing that when the neutron star stops and there's something actually there. There's material there. If it's so heavy it becomes a black hole, so it keeps falling, once the event horizon of the black hole forms, which is the shadow, the curve that's so strong that not even light can escape, the material keeps falling. And like you said, maybe space-time breaks down right at the center there, but whatever happens, the star's gone, that black hole is empty. So in a weird way black holes are a place and not a thing.\nExplainee: So is there a sensible way to talk about what's inside a black hole, or is that, should you think of it as there is no space-time inside?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","26":"Explainer: There isn't a sensible way to talk about it yet, and that probably means that's where Einstein's theory of gravity as a curved space-time is beginning to break down, and we need to take the extra step of going to some kind of quantum theory of gravity. And we don't have that yet. So even though the black hole isn't completely understood, we do know that they form astronomically, that in the universe things like neutron stars form and things like black holes form. The consequences are very much speaking to this curved space-time. So, for instance, if two black holes orbit each other, they're like mallets on a drum, and they actually cause space-time to ring, and it's very much part of gravitation. The ringing of space-time itself, we call gravitational waves. And this was something Einstein thought about right away in 1950-1960, he was thinking about that.\nExplainee: Those waves are very exciting for me too because neutron stars orbiting each other also give off gravitational waves and we might be able to get some data about neutron star material from that kind of signal.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","27":"Explainer: Yeah, it was, to my knowledge, the most widely studied astronomical event in the history of humanity.\nExplainee: Wow, that's amazing.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","28":"Explainer: Usually if it's math and physics, you end up as a theoretical physicist, right?\nExplainee: Yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","29":"Explainer: [Sean] Being four dimensional, right?\nExplainee: Mm-hmm.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","30":"Explainer: Let's bring one in. All right. The thing about relativity is that they really want you to think of spacetime as one four dimensional thing, right? It's kind of like space. It's not just three dimensions of space and one dimension of time.\nExplainee: Why though?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","31":"Explainer: When people ask me can you travel through time? I say yes, yesterday I traveled 24 hours into the future and here I am, a day later. So that's just this. Okay, you're moving through time, like it or not. So what Einstein says is look, I can travel through spacetime in different ways, like I could hop in a rocket ship and fly out and then fly back, and then I could meet you there. So this is a different trajectory through spacetime, right?\nExplainee: Yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","32":"Explainer: Well kind of. What Einstein wants to get across is there's no such thing as fundamental, like there's the universe's time, this big letter T that might tell you how old the universe is, but then every individual has a clock with them, and they measure their own time depending on how they're moving through the universe.\nExplainee: I see.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","33":"Explainer: And the crucial difference is that time is not the same for this person who stayed behind and sat in their chair, and this person who zoomed out there.\nExplainee: Why is that, that this one's shorter then?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","34":"Explainer: [Sean] That's the difference.\nExplainee: All right.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","35":"Explainer: So when Einstein had this idea, oh gravity could be related to the curvature of spacetime, he did some equations, so he got it, that's a long story, we'll put that aside. What he figured out was that rather than gravity living on top of spacetime, it's a manifestation of the curvature of spacetime so when you have like the earth, the sun, the moon, they cause a gravitational field, they're actually warping the spacetime around them. They're giving it a different geometry.\nExplainee: Would it be if I had like a spring or not a spring, but like a sheet, and I dropped a book in the sheet, curves down?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","36":"Explainer: But there are no straight lines, because spacetime itself is curved. So do you think if you had to explain relativity what would you say?\nExplainee: I think I'd go with kind of the train paradox. Let's say I'm stationary, and someone's moving past me on the train, they think they're stationary on the train. Like they think that they're not accelerating, but if they start walking through the train cars, then they are accelerating in their frame, but then from my outside frame where I'm completely removed, I see they are accelerating. So I guess that relativity is all about perspective, I guess in a way.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","37":"Explainer: Harmony is about injecting melody with emotion so that ultimately, you leave home and you return home and you've learned something along the way.\nExplainee: Yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","38":"Explainer: Yeah, I like that, yeah.\nExplainee: Yeah, yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","39":"Explainer: And so when you think about extra dimensions, you put them together with brains and different fields wrapping around the extra dimensions and so forth, right?\nExplainee: Yes.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","40":"Explainer: You know, a lot of people, a lot of string theorists, they care a lot about all the different ways in which we could hide the extra dimensions. As someone who cares about cosmology, I wanna start asking why are the extra dimensions small at all? How did that happen? Is this something you think about yourself?\nExplainee: Yes, well ultimately we'd like to understand the observable universe. If string theory turns out to be the thing that the universe cares about, we'd like to know, with all of these possibilities that are in string theory, how do we get the one that looks like the world we live in?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","41":"Explainer: The thing I want to talk about is this paper I wrote with Matt Johnson and Lisa Randall where we realize there's another way to compactify extra dimensions spontaneously, dynamically. If you imagine starting with this big piece of paper you couldn't wrap up everything, but within some region of space you could make a tube.\nExplainee: Okay.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","42":"Explainer: [Sean] You think that sounds plausible to you?\nExplainee: It sounds like fun. What I would immediately ask is where do the large dimensions come from in the first place? Is that something you address, or you just assume that all the dimension are large as a starting point?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","43":"Explainer: Why don't you explain to us what a black brane is?\nExplainee: Well in some ways, it's very much like a black hole in that you have far away from it you have these large just flat dimensions. As you move in, there's something in the interior. It has, itself, higher dimensions, and so because physicists love to joke they thought, well it's like a membrane but it can have many different dimensions. Let's use P to stand in for those number of dimensions, and so they called them P-branes.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","44":"Explainer: Yeah, I've been trying to explain this to lower levels, and they always look at me like, are you pulling my leg here a little bit? Or is this the real thing that they use? Yes, it is the real thing they use. We study these branes in de Sitter space, and so what we found is that there are black brane solutions which instead of having a singularity inside are non-singular, and stable, and compactified. Is this a familiar thing? I know things like this have been discussed, right?\nExplainee: Yeah. Yeah. So, a lot of the branes that are relevant for studying things to do with anti-de Sitter spacetimes in various dimensions actually start out as these non-singular type brains, and then you find in the core, there's actually an anti-de Sitter spacetime.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","45":"Explainer: Right. Imagine that rather than going down to a point, it just asymptotes to some fixed radius that continues infinitely far down there. But then you can ask, okay what about the rest of the universe? You have some sphere, some two dimensions compactified, and the balance between the cosmological constant and the electromagnetic field keeps it at a fixed distance.\nExplainee: Right. Good, good.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","46":"Explainer: But then the other dimensions, the transverse dimensions, don't need to be anti-de Sitter. They can have either positive, zero, or negative cosmological constant. So you can basically get any sort of cosmological solution times a compactified sphere.\nExplainee: Is it that these have the lowest action of all the things that could possibly, all the possible solutions?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","47":"Explainer: It's quantum. [laughing] It's a loud, it's of a loud it's gonna happen.\nExplainee: I still laugh from Keanu Reeves I'm afraid. [laughing]\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","48":"Explainer: I know not everyone buys that, right?\nExplainee: Not everyone buys it. There's a big discussion in the literature right now.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","49":"Explainer: If the viewers wanted to know more about how spacetime can emerge from quantum mechanics, they could read the graphic novel you just wrote.\nExplainee: Right, yes. I wrote and drew a graphic novel called The Dialogues: Conversations About the Nature of Universe.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","50":"Explainer: It's what keeps us on the earth.\nExplainee: What?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","51":"Explainer: The reason we're not just flying off the earth is because earth has gravity, so if we throw something up, it comes back down, so that's why when we're walking on the earth, we don't fly off the earth because the earth has gravity, and it keeps us down.\nExplainee: Nice.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","52":"Explainer: Try look over there and concentrate on his face over there. Can you see me waving my hand without turning your eyes?\nExplainee: No.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","53":"Explainer: Do you know a lot about lasers? Or just about the laser that you use.\nExplainee: Not a lot, just a little bit.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","54":"Explainer: Okay. So this is about high intensity lasers. Not only how do you make them, but what was really stopping them being made in both cases is non linear optics. We wanna do something that requires a huge photon density application, and so that's how come we came up with chirped pulse amplification, so that we could stretch the pulse, safely amplify it, then compress it at the end, and then we're ready to do whatever we want at the end. So what do you think the main difference is between the continuous wave laser that you have that runs at 10 watts and a chirped pulse amplifier?\nExplainee: I feel like the continuous laser delivers power at a continuous rate, whereas you want all that power to be delivered in a really, really short time with your amplification.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","55":"Explainer: You haven't? Okay.\nExplainee: So I was always curious, how much further, like what higher power can we go now?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","56":"Explainer: Yes. And maybe what, do pump-probe spectroscopy and watch the cell? Or to ionize it?\nExplainee: I mean I was thinking more on the lines of if we want to, let's say destroy one cell, like a tumor cell or something like that. So that the neighboring areas are not affected but just the cell burns.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","57":"Explainer: {missing part}\n","58":"Explainer: As an engineer of course, I love quantifiable things. I like saying here's my 18 millisecond motion to photon, here's my angular resolution that I'm improving. I'm doing the color-space right. But you can look not too far back where you say we have blu-ray DVDs at this amazing resolution, but more people want to watch Youtube videos at really bad early internet video speeds. Where there are things that if you deliver a value to people then these objective quantities may not be the most important thing. And while we're certainly pushing as hard as we can on lots of these things that make the experience better in potentially every way or maybe just for videos or for different things. I don't think that its necessary. I've commented that I think usually my favorite titles on mobile that are fully synthetic are ones that don't even try, they just go and do light-mapped, black-shaded. And I think its a lovely aesthetic. I think that you don't wind up fighting all of the aliasing. While you get some other titles that, oh we're gonna be high-tech with our specular bump maps with roughness. And you've got aliasing everywhere, and you can't hold frame rate and its all problematic. While some of these that are clearly very synthetic worlds where its nothing but these cartoony flat-shaded things with lighting, but they look and they feel good. And you can buy that you're in that place. And you want to know what's around that monolith over there.\nExplainee: We did a project called Life of Us, which was exactly that mindset. We were let's embrace low-poly aesthetic and just simple vertex shading. And we ended up realizing, you can embody these various creatures and transform yourself. And when you do that with co-presence of another creature, another human, it makes for a totally magical journey. You don't even think for a second, you actually dismiss the whole idea of photo-realism and embrace that reality for what it is. I think it actually helps put you at ease a little bit.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","59":"Explainer: But if we just wind up following the path that we're on, we're gonna get double and quadruple, but we're not gonna get 50 times more powerful than we are right now. We will run into atomic limits on our fabrication. So given that, I'm trying to tell people that, start buying back into optimization, start buying back into thinking a bit more creatively. Because you can't just wait, its not going to get to that point where it really is fixed to those highest degrees just by waiting for computing to be advanced. If we want this to be something used by a billion people then we need it to be lighter, cheaper, more comfortable.\nExplainee: And there's constantly novel UX innovations. Like Google Earth, where the kind of elimination of your periphery as you zoom in and move. And also, giving you the user action to decide where you're going and looking. I'm constantly seeing people coming up with ways to break from the paradigms of actual reality and then introduce mechanisms that work very well.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","60":"Explainer: You know there's tons of opportunities for the synthetic case where you want to be able to have your synthetic fantasy world where everybody is a creature that's created by the computer and simulated reasonably. But of course we've got, you know we still don't do people well simulated. That's a hard problem, we've been beating our heads against it for a long time. I do think we're making progress and I wouldn't bet on that being solved in 10 years, but maybe 20 years. Because it is going to take a lot of AI. Its going to take a lot of machine-learning, where its not going to be a matter of us dissecting all the micro-expressions that people do. Its gonna be lets take every youtube video ever made and run it through some enormous learner that's going to figure out how to make people realistic.\nExplainee: Absolutely, there are these crucial thresholds where you pass a technological hurdle and all of a sudden that unlocks a whole world of creative potential. But I think, to your point very much, we need to solve the actual human and social challenges and turn those into opportunities to figure out how this technology fits into our lives.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","61":"Explainer: [Sean] What kind of science?\nExplainee: I like biology and computer science.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","62":"Explainer: All right, you're in the wrong place. [laughs] We're not gonna be talking about biology or computer science. So we wanna talk about the idea of dimensions. Do you know what dimension is? How we would define dimensions?\nExplainee: I guess, I don't know how to exactly define it, but I know, like the first four.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","63":"Explainer: Right, you know the difference between like one dimension two dimensions, three dimensions, et cetera. So let's do a little experiment here. So there's one dimension. I'll give that to you. Now, here's your task. I'm going to give you another dimension, and I'm gonna ask hold those two things at right angles to each other. It's easy to do. Yeah, so there's no trick here.\nExplainee: [laughing] Yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","64":"Explainer: That's right. So that's exactly what these would be. Have you heard that there are other coordinate systems other than XYX?\nExplainee: No.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","65":"Explainer: Well, we could also say how far we are away from the center, just the distance. And then the angle that our little line makes with let's say the X axis.\nExplainee: Yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","66":"Explainer: So that's a different way of giving you two numbers and locating yourself, and we call those polar coordinates. It's a different coordinate system. What we want to do as physicists is look for extra dimensions. Can you imagine, can you think of any way that there could be extra dimensions?\nExplainee: Time?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","67":"Explainer: It's exactly the same thing as latitude and longitude but we put coordinates on the sky.\nExplainee: Oh.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","68":"Explainer: [Sean] And sort of the peels of an orange kind of thing, right?\nExplainee: [Juliana] Yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","69":"Explainer: So you can define something as, well you know, how high above a certain location on earth it is, but the earth is rotating and revolving around the sun so we have to define separate celestial coordinates.\nExplainee: So, there's like how many dimension would there be?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","70":"Explainer: Absolutely right. And this is sort of the state of uncertainty that physicists are stuck living in.\nExplainee: Oh. [laughs]\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","71":"Explainer: So we've been, we've had, now, effectively two different ways of getting more direct measurements, one is the LIGO, which is the Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory, which is where, getting the ripples in space time, coming off of the merging of black holes. The other one that you're mentioning is actually called the Event Horizon Telescope, where they're using radio waves to actually image the event horizon, that region where light cannot escape from the black hole at the center of our galaxy, which I know they're working on it right now. It's an amazing thing, but that'll be the most direct imaging of a black hole. LIGO is a direct detection of the consequence of the merging of black holes. The critical part has been, like, for the super massive black hole at the center of our galaxy, we've seen the stars orbiting it, and we've measured the mass, so that way, so if you look at a spinning black hole, it actually fundamentally alters the emission that's coming off the stuff that's falling into it. These are discovered as what are called X-ray binaries, that is, you know, there's an X-ray member of the binary that is emitting in the X-rays, and it's really not very bright in the optical (mumbles) at all, so there's always, people are looking at these X-ray binaries.\nExplainee: What sort of technology and, like, I guess tools have you been using in your studies, or, like, just in general, in the study of black holes?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","72":"Explainer: Do you know what gravity is?\nExplainee: It's something that, so, right now, we would be floating if there was no gravity, but since there's gravity we're sitting right down on these chairs.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","73":"Explainer: That's pretty good. So gravity wants to attract us to the Earth, and the Earth to us. But the Earth is so much bigger that even though we're actually pulling the Earth a little bit to us, you don't notice it so much. You know, the Moon pulls on the Earth a little bit.\nExplainee: Mm-hmm, just like the ocean tides.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","74":"Explainer: [Janna] Exactly, the Moon is such a big body compared to anything else very nearby that it has the larger effect, pulling the water of the Earth. But more than the Moon, think about the Sun pulling on the Earth. We orbit the whole Sun, just the way the Earth pulls on the Moon and causes the Moon to orbit us. All of those things are acting on you and me right now.\nExplainee: If gravity was too strong, would we be able to get up?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","75":"Explainer: That's such a good question. No, we actually couldn't. In the Moon, gravity is weaker, you can almost float between footsteps if you look at the astronauts on the Moon. On the Earth, it's harder, 'cause it's bigger. If you go to a bigger, heavier planet, it gets harder and harder. But there are stars that have died that are so dense that there's no way we could lift our arms, no way we could step or walk. The gravity is just way too strong. Do you know how tall you are?\nExplainee: I'm in the fours. In the fours?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","76":"Explainer: Yes.\nExplainee: [Bonet screams] Ooh.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","77":"Explainer: They say that astronauts in space, definitely their spine elongates. There were two twin astronauts, one who stayed here on Earth and the other who went to the International Space Station. He was there for a long time, and when he came back, he was actually taller than his twin brother.\nExplainee: Wow.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","78":"Explainer: Yeah, and that was because gravity wasn't compressing him all the time and he was floating freely in the International Space Station and his spine just kind of elongated. After a while here on Earth though he'll readjust, he'll go back to the same size. Have you ever heard of how gravity was discovered?\nExplainee: Mm-hmm.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","79":"Explainer: And a heavy object.\nExplainee: Oh my God. [Janna laughs]\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","80":"Explainer: And so, how much do you think you need?\nExplainee: I mean, I've read that six is ideal for people in my age range.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","81":"Explainer: Right. You can do part of this level, and you can do the other part, clearly. Got some expertise under your belt, and that's awesome, because I think that everyone should know more about sleep. And so the way that we think about what drives sleep are two independent but related processes and so they have kind of lame names. Process S and process C, and what you've kind of described is process C, and that's the master clock, right? And it helps regulate kind of the rhythms like all over your body, all your cells, and all those kind of things. It drives the release of melatonin from the pineal gland, and melatonin comes online under darkness, so when the sun goes down, your brain knows okay it's time to start getting ready for sleep, and so you start releasing melatonin, which really kind of sets the table for sleeping.\nExplainee: I'm from Hoi, so we have very long days. We have early sunrises, late sunsets. Does that signify less sleep, because we have a shorter amount of time for melatonin to be released?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","82":"Explainer: What is a laser made out of? Well really it's sort of the same thing as a light bulb. Right?\nExplainee: So it's a beam?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","83":"Explainer: So yeah it's a light bulb and there's a couple of mirrors. Now the light bulb has to be a little bit special. It has to be a type of material that can store the energy in an excited state right? It has to stay up there really energetic and sit there for a while so that when the light comes along, it takes that energy and becomes stronger light and then the mirror sends it back and it does it again and again and again and between these two mirrors, it makes the light come out in a nice beam. In a laser, it comes out as a single color. They all come out with their waves at the same time. Every wave peaks at the same time which then makes it a giant wave and it's this giant wave that has a tremendous amount of power. So it can do something like cutting steel. But when you cut steel, or if you were cutting this floor, it's gray, it actually will absorb the light. That's why the light, you don't see it because the light isn't bouncing back or through it. So I like to use demos to explain how my laser works. So I've brought basically a hammer and a nail. I'm sure you've probably hammered a nail before into a piece of wood but the question is, if you asked yourself why it is we hit the big end and it's the tiny end that we put on the piece of wood. We could never pick up a hammer and hit the sharp end and hope this would go in to the piece of wood.\nExplainee: Because it needs to be centered so it can more easily just go in.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","84":"Explainer: That's right. All the force that we apply here, goes all the way through but then it can only basically come out when it contacts the wood in that one tiny spot. And so sometimes it's the force that you push something with but sometimes it is that force per unit area. But sometimes it's not even the force per unit area 'cos, you know, push down as hard as you can on that and see if we can get it pushed in. See it doesn't really work does it?\nExplainee: So the laser needs ultimately many things. It needs to be centered, it needs time to actually penetrate and then it needs--\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","85":"Explainer: Well it depends. So if you're cutting steel, you need to have the nail. You need to have it concentrated all of the light, not going in all directions but you need it into as small a point as possible. And for that we use a lens. For a lens, the light's coming down as a column, you put in a lens, it all focuses it down in the same way as the nail and then it starts cutting that steel. Okay so that force per unit area--\nExplainee: So it's kind of like a magnifying glass? Like it magnifies the light down to a point?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","86":"Explainer: Exactly. You know sometimes you want to have all of your energy not just in a small area but in the small volume and so one of the other dimensions is time or length. But with light, time and length are the same thing because light always travels at the speed of light.\nExplainee: Exactly.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","87":"Explainer: But if you send a one second long light pulse out into the skies there, the beginning of the pulse is actually two thirds of the way to the moon. It's 300,000 kilometers long. So now, if you talk about light being concentrated, that doesn't seem very concentrated. The type of lasers I play with in my lab will be no thicker than this piece of paper. So we take that energy that might be in three hundred thousand kilometers and we squeeze it all the way down into just this piece of paper and actually the beams are more the size of this piece of paper and so, in my lab, pieces of paper like this would be flying through the sky but we can't see them. 'Cos they don't come in our eyes, they fly by us and they're infra red.\nExplainee: There'd be like little concentrated beams of light just flying everywhere?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","88":"Explainer: Exactly. And so now, if we have light like that that we wanna machine with. I bring this funnel and so, if we had a lens here and the light was coming down--\nExplainee: It funnels into--\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","89":"Explainer: That was, it was like, oh, wow, this might be it, and then, but very early on, it was, as I just started my, it was basically my second year of graduate school, it was like, uh, this is not that simple.\nExplainee: It isn't.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","90":"Explainer: And sleep science. Do you sleep?\nExplainee: I do, I try. [laughs]\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","91":"Explainer: But being off is not just being off. There's lots of things that are happening. We're gonna kind of talk about those different pieces of sleep.\nExplainee: Okay.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","92":"Explainer: So our sleep is made up of different types, okay? The first one is called non-rapid eye movement sleep, or non-REM, okay? Or NREM. And then the other one, which might not be a surprise, is called REM. Rapid eye movement sleep. And those are the two main types of sleep that happen. The way that we measure that as a sleep scientist is that we'll actually bring people into the lab where they can do this at home, where we put electrodes on their scalp while they're sleeping, and that allows us to measure the brain activity that's going on during the night.\nExplainee: Okay. Are you like able to tell how much sleep someone's getting or what their sleep schedule is by REM?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","93":"Explainer: You know, some of that is totally accurate, that like when your brain's more engaged by being on your phone or doing things that you really enjoy or things that stress you out or any of those types of things, it's harder to get to sleep and to kind of fall into that deeper levels of sleep. Most of the REM sleep, this dreaming sleep, happens in the second half of the night.\nExplainee: Oh.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","94":"Explainer: One to six hours? That's a long nap.\nExplainee: It is a long nap.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","95":"Explainer: So have you taken a quantum mechanics course?\nExplainee: I have. I took that last year.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","96":"Explainer: I think to really get deep into nanomaterials and nanoscale devices, you really have to understand to some level, quantum mechanics. What it teaches us as we make these devices smaller and smaller, their properties begin to now depend on the size and the orientation of these devices. There are materials, and you're taking a 2D materials class, you know about this, that are intrinsically thin. As they're grown, as they're fabricated, they're already at the nanoscale and they possess these quantum confinement properties that as a nanotechnologist, you try to exploit. And so the first ones I wanted to talk to you about are quantum dots, have you heard of quantum dots before?\nExplainee: Yes.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","97":"Explainer: So these are typically semiconductors. They can be cadmium selenide cadmium sulfide, zinc selenide and they're small clusters of atoms. They can be from 2 to 10 nanometers. What's interesting about these materials?\nExplainee: Well, the other day we were talking about the different dimensions you can have of nanotechnology. So all the way from like 0D to 3D. If I remember correctly, my professor labeled it as 0D?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","98":"Explainer: There are people that are exploring using these materials for diode lasers. There are companies that are building displays from these materials. And there're even people thinking about if I take these quantum dots, and I change the chemistry on the outside so they stick to specific types of cells or tissue, that I could really do some interesting imaging and therapeutic work to track disease, even maybe to treat disease, if you can very precisely control the chemistry.\nExplainee: How far away is this from being actually used on an industrial level?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","99":"Explainer: Do you know what this is?\nExplainee: Carbon nanotube?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","100":"Explainer: Carbon nanotube, right. So if you roll up graphene, depending on how you roll it and the angle, you roll it with, it has different properties. So if I roll it one way, it'll act like a metal. If I roll it a different way, it'll act like a semiconductor. The one that gets everyone most excited is that the electrons and holes move very fast through graphene. And so there's a lot of interest in using these for certain types of high-speed electronics. The other interesting application is because it's one atom thin, it's very sensitive to changes in the environment. And so there's a lot of interest in using them as diagnostics. It's on us researchers to find ways to A, control that process and then B, to actually build some sort of interesting technology from them.\nExplainee: So you've been talking about the different ways you can say, roll these nanotubes. So how do you go about building and controlling these nanotubes in terms of their diameter?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","101":"Explainer: Yeah. 100%. That's right. And that's the motivation for looking at these emerging materials. But I would never bet against the innovation and the creativity in this nano electronic space. Tens of thousands of scientists, every time they hit a barrier, at least historically, as a guide, they have found a way to overcome it. It's a real marvel in ingenuity.\nExplainee: I gotta ask. The lights that are behind you, is that related to the quantum dots that you work with at all?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","102":"Explainer: Do you know what machine learning means? Have you heard that before?\nExplainee: No.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","103":"Explainer: What about this one?\nExplainee: A dog. A cat. I think, a cat? Because it's more skinny. And also, its legs are like really tall and its ears are a little pointy.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","104":"Explainer: And how did you know that it's not a cat or a dog?\nExplainee: Because cats and dogs... Because they walk on their paws and their ears are like right here, not right here, and they don't wear watches.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","105":"Explainer: Are those like the practice problems you do before the test?\nExplainee: Well, just like everything that's gonna be on the test is on the review.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","106":"Explainer: Do you know why we're here today?\nExplainee: Because we're talking about science.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","107":"Explainer: Do you know that your body is made up of really tiny things called cells?\nExplainee: Um, yes, I know that.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","108":"Explainer: Maybe a mutual acquaintance of ours, Jasper gave a example of fault injection, and I like to use that as, when I'm trying to explain fault injection, he shows a pinball machine and the pinball machine, obviously the two inputs are the two plungers when you're playing a pinball machine, but fault injection, you can tilt the entire pinball machine, right? You're just introducing some external variable that's outside of the traditional inputs that you're used to and you've now controlled the environment in a advantageous way to the user or the player. Can you give an example of some type of fault injection that you're doing or working on?\nExplainee: One of them was looking at, like, a little hardware Bitcoin wallet, and you could use fault injection to actually recover secrets from it, and a lot of devices. I mean, the whole idea is pretty cool, right? Because you tell the device, Hey, I want to authenticate, and it's supposed to run some really crazy math that authenticates it, but instead of doing that crazy math and attacking the math, you just attack the check at the end.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","109":"Explainer: I've never seen... Maybe call it a verifiable visualization of it, right? We know it's true, you know, you can get skin cancer by going outside and having too many high energy particles hit you, but we've never seen it. And we know it can happen to a computer chip, but I've never seen both.\nExplainee: Yeah, so actually, so it's funny you mentioned, like, making it more obvious. I mean, staying on fault injection right now, this is lately what I've been up to. A lot of making a little kind of, you know, like electronics kits of old, right? And you can assemble it all yourself and see how it works. So making something like that for fault injection. So all kind of older logic and stuff like that. So, I mean, it's sort of based on, like, you're presented the little MUX chip. You know, voltage switcher. That sort of idea, using just discreet logic to generate the actual glitch itself. So, but you know, it's part of, I think, this stuff, right? It's like people don't know about it sometimes. Like, even engineers designing systems. It's new to a lot of people.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","110":"Explainer: The thing is, even if you know about that, then there's so many others that someone won't necessarily know about, because there's so many, I guess, potential areas for a fault to occur. Where do you think security is going or new research is going? Are there any new areas you think are coming out or are going to be more interesting, you know, pretty soon?\nExplainee: Fault injection has become pretty interesting. Like, there's been a lot of people poking at that, and I think a lot more products of interest. Side channel still might have a bit of a comeback. Basically, what I kind of see is a lot of the really cool stuff has been in academia because product security hasn't kept up, right? For the longest time, doing these attacks on hardware was pretty straightforward. You didn't need these crazy attacks. It looks like a lot of devices are coming out now that actually have real claims to security, right? More than just a data sheet mentioned. There's actually something behind it.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","111":"Explainer: So tell me, what do you know about black holes?\nExplainee: Well, I know they're created when stars, once they start growing, it doesn't, it can't expand anymore, so they collapse inward.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","112":"Explainer: Right, you will feel the gravitational pull, and it'll redirect you in some way, and if you're far enough way, it's just like you're very far away from the sun, or something else. If you're close enough, it will divert your path more, if you're close enough still, then you will get what are called tidal forces, where the difference between, for example, if you're standing next to a black hole, the difference in gravity between your feet and your head actually becomes significant. Next time you see a science fiction movie, if somebody says, Oh, my god, we've been caught in the gravitation field of a black hole, and we're gonna fall in, it's like, no, no, just, if you're far enough away, just thrust a little bit this way, and then you'll slingshot around the black hole.\nExplainee: So are there any movies that actually do, like, get space right?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","113":"Explainer: I wouldn't call them educational, but the movie Interstellar actually had, as one of the people involved in both writing it, and as a science advisor, Dr. Kip Thorne, who's a Professor at Caltech, who was part of the team that detected gravitational waves, and just won a Nobel Prize for it. So he made sure to try and get it as accurate as possible, so Interstellar, I think, is one of the best examples of getting black holes right.\nExplainee: So it's, I'm assuming it's hard to, like, detect a black hole, besides if it's, if things are close enough that they're being pulled in, so it's basically a theory?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","114":"Explainer: And part of the challenge of it is not the mathematics of building models, but the challenge is making sure that the data is sufficiently representative, potentially high quality.\nExplainee: And how transparent do I need to build it for it to be adopted at some point? What types of biases in the data collection, and then also in the usage? We now call it the bias, but we're still struggling with the society not really living up to its expectations and then machine learning, bringing it to the forefront.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","115":"Explainer: Right. And so, to say that another way, when you're collecting data from the real world and then building machine learning systems that automate decisions based on that data, all of the biases and problems that are already in the real world then can be magnified through that machine learning system. And so, it can make many of these problems much worse.\nExplainee: Feeling increasingly challenged that my skillset of being very good at programming has become somewhat secondary. And it's feeling... [both laugh] It's really the bigger picture understanding of Who would be using that? How transparent do I need to build it for it to be adopted at some point? What types of biases in the data collection and then also in the usage? I think, in certain areas, we have societal expectations as to what is fair and what isn't.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","116":"Explainer: And so, it's not just the provenance of that data, but it's, sort of, deeply understanding, Why does it look the way it looks? Why was it collected this way? What are the limitations of it? We need to think about that in entire process, how we document that process. This is an issue in companies where somebody might create something that even their peers can't recreate.\nExplainee: What have you seen in terms of which industries, where they stand, like who is adopting now? Who is ready to utilize it? Where would you maybe wish that didn't even try? [Hilary laughs]\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","117":"Explainer: So when we think about the next five to 10 years, the things that are really still holding us back are these uneven applications of resources to problems because the problems that get attention are the high value ones in terms of how much money you can make or the things that are fashionable enough that you can publish a paper on it. So what do you think is holding us back?\nExplainee: I fully agree on the steps you pointed out and the processes. I think there is a chicken and egg problem, like your former example, that these areas that need to wait for data, the value of the data collection is then also slightly less apparent. And so, it gets delayed further and you'll see that happening. But what my experience has been, there's unfortunately, I feel a drifting apart between academia and the uses of AI, but I am somewhat frustrated with a generation of students who have standard data sets that they never think about what the model needs to be used for, that they never have to think about how the data was collected. So with all of these challenges ahead of us, how optimistic are you about this world that I deeply believe we can create and the steps towards it?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","118":"Explainer: A lot of origami is animals, birds and things. There's also a branch of origami that is, it's more abstract or geometric, called tessellations. Tessellations, like most origami, are folded from a single sheet of paper but they make patterns, whether it's woven patterns like that, or woven patterns like this. If you hold them up to the light you can see patterns.\nExplainee: Wow.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","119":"Explainer: There's no cuts in these just folding. We can build these up from smaller building blocks of folds, learn how to fold little pieces and put them together in the same way that a tiling like this looks like it's built up of little pieces. Can you make a fold that starts at the dot that doesn't run all the way across the paper?\nExplainee: How about like that?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","120":"Explainer: Mm-hmm. Each of these folds is peaked like a mountain and we call these mountain folds but if I made it the other way, then it's shaped this way and we call it a valley fold. In all of origami there's just mountains and valleys.\nExplainee: So all the folds are reversible?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","121":"Explainer: So they're all reversible and it turns out that in every origami shape that folds flat, it's going to be either three mountains and a valley or, if we're looking at the backside, three valleys and a mountain, they always differ by two.\nExplainee: Oh.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","122":"Explainer: That's a rule of all flat origami no matter how many folds come together at a point and I'm going to show you a building block of tessellations, it's called a twist because that center square, as I unfold it, it twists, it rotates.\nExplainee: Twists?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","123":"Explainer: Yeah.\nExplainee: No, I don't think so.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","124":"Explainer: Yeah.\nExplainee: I'm understanding more so that it's these, a mapping of the circuitry, the pathways between neurons that can lead to evidence of patterns in your brain that are common between different people.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","125":"Explainer: We have to use electron microscopes and then what we have been developing a way to slice the brain into really thin slices, use an electron microscope to take a picture of each slice, and then use computers to put it all back. Imagine that we could get a map of every connection, right? And we knew how neurons fire. Do you think we could put that in a computer, that map, and then therefore, that computer should be able to think just like the brain that we extracted it from?\nExplainee: Well, the computer only communicates with itself in binary so it only has two options, it can only ask itself yes or no questions, but a human brain has an infinity of directions that it can go.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","126":"Explainee: So how do you do your observations in optical and infrared?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","127":"Explainer: So fortunately there's, I'm also doing it from space with the Spitzer Space Telescope, so particularly in the infrared, and my main interest has been to try and study the environment around the super massive black holes, not as close as where the X-rays are coming from, but clearly there's something from the X-ray corona that illuminates the rest of the accretion disk, and the dust that's further out. And so fundamentally, that's one of the key things that I'm trying to use, is trying to see how long, once you've got this sort of pulse that's generated close to the black hole, it propagates out, and so you can use optical wavelengths to see that the accretion disk lights up in the optical a little bit as it gets heated up from the X-ray, and then later on, the infrared dust, the dust absorbs it, and emits it in the infrared. And so that, I love that, the ability to exchange time for resolution, because these structures are so far away that we're never gonna get a telescope big enough where that has the resolution to see the accretion disk, or the dust distribution around--\nExplainee: So do you get dimensions of the disk out of that?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","128":"Explainer: Yeah, again, we don't know exactly where X, Y, Z, zero is, we're assuming that it's something, you know, the X-rays that are coming out are very close to the event horizon of the black hole, but this is still, you know, your realm of X-rays, to really figure out those kinds of things. But once the X-rays, once the photons hit the corona, and are re-scattered, and up, energized, and then they start illuminating the accretion disk, it heats it up, and so just by the light travel time, when the optical, if it gets, you know, brighter and fainter, and then the infrared gets brighter and fainter, two weeks later, then the dust is two light weeks away from that. So it's a one dimensional one, so we're averaging, so we don't get the two dimensional, or even three dimensional one. And then we've done it now, of course, we have better telescopes, there was a project where you could do it with the Hubble Space Telescope and the ultraviolet, you used the Swift Observatory, which had optical and ultraviolet, and then from ground base, we did optical, and then from space we did it with Spitzer and the infrared. So you could actually see this bright flash go off in a nearby AGN called NGC5548, and then you see it propagate as it warms up the disk, as all that light is falling onto it, and then eventually you hit the, the, further away, where the dust is, and the dust tends to radiate in an infrared. So we got basically a structure, and you just, you see this flashbulb go off, and then it illuminates, effectively, the structure.\nExplainee: So you can map out the dust, where do you see it?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","129":"Explainer: Which is great, although it still doesn't help us in the AGN community, because we don't know how the millions to billions solar mass black holes came to be. But it's, at least we're building up, or hopefully that at some point, and by understanding these lower mass, how these lower mass black holes came to be, then we can see where there are a large scale number of mergers can potentially give us this, or you really need something, other, another corridor to fundamentally get us something that's a million solar masses, you know, on the minimum side, but definitely, you know, we've gotten those which are billion. So we know we can merge the million solar mass black holes to get the bigger ones, but how do you get to those in the beginning, particularly so early in the universe, when you get quasars at really high red shifts, so they're really early on.\nExplainee: Yeah, it is odd, it is very odd. I mean, the other thing that's a little odd, now we're going back to stellar mass black holes is, so we look at a lot of supernova remnants, and we, so we see them, we can only really see them in our own galaxy, and so we have a lot of supernova remnants, and so how we see them is, you see the expelled mass from the star as it died, so that creates an extended source, and then you look for the compact object that was left behind. And what's interesting is that you see, you quite often see the neutron stars because they pulse, so they're easy to see, but so far, we've not found a single black hole at the center of a supernova remnant. And so, which is interesting, so you say, you should see them, you know, you ought to see some fallback, you know, you need some matter, you need something, but no, never, not yet been detected.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","130":"Explainer: And this goes to the idea that you don't have a core balance, that a supernova with a black hole as its final result, actually never has any kind of expulsion, that it all just goes. (imitates sucking)\nExplainee: Yeah, that might be, yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","131":"Explainer: So what are some of the techniques you're applying to look at that debate data?\nExplainee: Something I'm interested in exploring is how well it works to use deep learning and sort of automatically extracted features from this text versus using some of the more traditional techniques that we have, things like lexicons or some sort of template matching techniques for extracting features from texts. That's a question I'm just interested in, in general. When do we really need deep learning versus when can we use something that's a little bit more interpretable, something that's been around for a while?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","132":"Explainer: So is that where some of that frustration around the lack of controllability and interpretability comes from?\nExplainee: Yeah, if you're building a model that just predicts the next thing based off of everything it's seen from texts online, then yeah, you're really gonna be replicating whatever that distribution online is.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","133":"Explainer: If you train a model off of language off the internet, it sometimes says uncomfortable things or inappropriate things and sometimes really biased things. Have you ever run into this yourself? And then how do you think about that problem of potentially even measuring the bias in a model that we've trained?\nExplainee: Yeah, it's a really tricky question. As you said, these models are trained to, sort of, predict the next sequence of words, given a certain sequence of words. So we could start with just, sort of, prompts like the woman was versus the man was, and, kind of, pull out common words that are, sort of, more used with one phrase versus the other. So that's, sort of, a qualitative way of looking at it. It's not ever kind of a guarantee of how the model is gonna behave in one particular instance. And I think that's what's really tricky and that's why I, sort of, think it's really good for creators of systems to just be honest about, This is, sort of, what we have seen. And so then, someone can make their own judgment about, Is this gonna be too high risk for, sort of, my particular use case?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","134":"Explainer: So we've been talking about gravity from Newton and celestial bodies, the Earth, the Moon, pulling on each other in the conventional sense of gravity being an attractive force, to the Earth creating curves in space-time, then we moved on to just diffused seas of energy and space-time as the real universe and gravitation is really just talking about space-time in general, and here we are, and you're really hardcore in theoretical physics. Where would you take the exposition of gravity from that point?\nExplainee: Well, one thing is quantum mechanics. Quantum mechanics is the most successful theory in the history of science, it explains the most different phenomena the most precisely. Yet many people would still say we don't understand even the basics of it.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","135":"Explainer: To have the waves together.\nExplainee: Yeah, and in two states and in two possible states of the world, you can just literally put a plus sign between them and that's a sensible state, that's a good state, it makes sense.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","136":"Explainer: So do you think there's some sense in which we shouldn't be thinking about individual universes, individual space-time, so we should be thinking about superpositions of space-times?\nExplainee: Yeah, I think so. I think if you were to go far enough back in the history of the universe, back to when it was very, very dense, very small, and when quantum mechanics was certainly important, then it must have been like that. I mean, if we believe that the dominant standard model of cosmology, something had to produce the density perturbations, the things that seeded all the galaxies and stars and everything else in the world. So there's a galaxy over there, let's say, and not over there, so how did that happen? Why is there a galaxy there and not there? In the standard theory, as you know, that was a quantum event, a random event. And it doesn't mean that if happened there and not there 'cause you flipped a coin, it actually happened in both places. There's gotta be a wave function where in one branch of the wave function there's a galaxy there and not there, and on the other branch it's the opposite.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","137":"Explainer: Right.\nExplainee: You know, you try to pin something down near a black hole, well, it's a surface, it's got a particular radius for a round black hole, and wanna say something is inside or outside, well, you can't absolutely say that in quantum mechanics. And this kind of uncertainty produces a radiation, which you can think of as pulling some of the energy out of the black hole. The black hole is formed out of some mass and there's an energy in that. If you think of pulling some energy out of that and sending it off to infinity in the form of particles being admitted. And what Hawking found is that it's a thermal spectrum, it looks like a hot, or not so hot for a large black hole, but like an oven, the kind of radiation that comes out of a cast iron.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","138":"Explainer: Practical purposes.\nExplainee: Yes.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","139":"Explainer: Right, exactly. And the most knowledge you could ever have would only be on a two-dimensional surface.\nExplainee: Right, and as big as the universe, and then you're done. So, you know, not likely that we're ever gonna hit that limit any time soon.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","140":"Explainer: Do you think it's possible that gravity is really ultimately just quantum mechanics and doesn't exist at all in the fundamental ways that we've been talking about so far, like the Newtonian way and the space-time way, that those are just these kind of macroscopic illusions? Sometimes I talk about it in terms of temperature. Temperature is not a thing. There is no single thing called temperature. It's a macroscopic illusion that comes from the collective behavior, really quantum behavior of random motions of atoms. And is it possible that the whole of gravity is some kind of emergent illusion from what's really quantum phenomenon underlying it?\nExplainee: If we buy the idea of holography, then absolutely, that's for sure, that's what it's telling us. Although which side is the illusion and which side is the reality? They're the same.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","141":"Explainer: [Robert] Would you like to give it a try?\nExplainee: Sure.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","142":"Explainer: So you ready?\nExplainee: Yep.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","143":"Explainer: Okay. We're going to start with a model that every Japanese person learns in kindergarten, it's called a crane, traditional origami design, it's over 400 years old. So, people have been doing what we're about to do for 400 years.\nExplainee: Wow.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","144":"Explainer: It's called a petal fold, it's a part of a lot of origami designs and it's key to the crane. Now we're ready for the magic. We're going to hold it in between thumb and forefinger, reach inside, grab the skinny point that's between the two layers, which are the wings, and I'm going to slide it out so it pokes out at an angle. We'll take the two wings, we spread them out to the side and you have made your first origami crane.\nExplainee: Wow.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","145":"Explainer: Now, this is a traditional Japanese design but there are origami designs that have been around so long we're not entirely sure where they originated. We're going to learn how to fold a cootie catcher.\nExplainee: Okay, good.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","146":"Explainer: Yeah, but there's something else we can do with this model. If we set it down and push on the middle then pop it inside out so that three flaps come up and one stays down and then it's called talking crow because here's a little crow's beak and mouth.\nExplainee: Wow.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","147":"Explainer: Sure, and people are working on that already.\nExplainee: Yeah, yeah, exactly. And it's this very fruitful area of research, and you can find yourself looking like 20 years out, right, where you have an enormous number of electric cars. You have all of these batteries. That's essentially a distributed peak load power grid, right. Like, the cars are getting plugged in and unplugged at different times. If you have a mechanism that's able to automatically and autonomously be distributing power based on batteries that are scattered throughout the grid that are being used for other purposes. Their owners don't even necessarily need to be aware. I mean, to have something that looks like a much more viable society that still has a lot of electricity needs but is able to base that much more on renewables, is able to make up the difference during peak load periods or during differences in weather, that is able to have power much closer to where it is needed rather than having to be distributed over great distances. It's like, that's something that would be an enormously hard problem to solve. And it's not that the blockchain makes it easy, but it makes it possible.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","148":"Explainer: And it's because we've had a lot of PR, a lot of proof of concept, but truthfully, this is more like a science, right?\nExplainee: Yes.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","149":"Explainer: The system we have today is also broken. (laughs) Right?\nExplainee: Yes.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","150":"Explainer: In that it's hard to compare it to some perfect future. Just like you compare autonomous vehicles to this very high standard because machines are doing it. It should be perfect. There should be zero car deaths.\nExplainee: (laughs) Yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","151":"Explainer: Do you know what computer hacking is?\nExplainee: It's bad. Like, I'm going into someone's personal account or account, changing some stuff or just stealing some information or your money.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","152":"Explainer: What they're trying to do is they're trying to even prevent the bad hackers from getting in in the first place.\nExplainee: So they put like a protection account or something.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","153":"Explainer: Yeah, exactly. They're looking for ways that they can create protection. It's kind of like the lock on your front door. That lock is to essentially prevent bad people from coming in or people accidentally coming in when they shouldn't. A hacker is essentially looking at a way, how can I get into this lock? But then there are the good ones who are trying to unlock it so that they can tell the company that made the lock, hey, we can actually protect people by making the lock a little harder.\nExplainee: What would they do about the people and the broken lock?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","154":"Explainer: In many cases, they'll send them a new lock. So it's an upgraded, better version. Sometimes that's new features, but sometimes that's bug fixes and ways to protect you as well.\nExplainee: But like, they may get arrested because they might get mistaken.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","155":"Explainer: I started doing the good hacking when I turned nine years old.\nExplainee: Wow.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","156":"Explainer: I started going on the computer and playing video games, but I had some ideas of my own, and that's where I started to learn how to hack. I wanted to play with my friends on this video game and just change the way that things look.\nExplainee: But that would be kinda bad, because maybe the creator did it for a reason.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","157":"Explainer: That's entirely possible. They may have done it for a reason, but you may have come up with a really good idea that, do you think there are other people who might like the idea that you came up with?\nExplainee: Yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","158":"Explainer: What do you think of when you think of nanotechnology?\nExplainee: It kind of seems very science fiction.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","159":"Explainer: Yeah, so modern computer chips rely heavily on nanotechnology. Does this look familiar to you? Can you guess what this might be?\nExplainee: I don't know.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","160":"Explainer: You have to make it smaller. Exactly. But here's the problem. So about 10 to 15 years ago, the devices got so small that if you shrunk them this gate, that actually turns it on and off loses its ability to control the channel. And so what they did, was they took devices like this into these things, we call them, FinFETs, kind of like a fin on a fish. So they're very thin transistors. The width of these fins is only six nanometers. Okay? So 6 nanometers is 25 to 30 atoms across. And they repeat this over the entire wafer just about perfectly. It's just a huge feat in engineering. But these types of devices are exactly the kind of devices that your phones and computers either have, or will have in the near future. And it's a way that nanotechnology is directly impacting you right now.\nExplainee: How do you make stuff that small? Obviously it's not handmade, so is it factories and stuff?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","161":"Explainer: Yeah.\nExplainee: If I could trade with any kid, I would trade, well, I would trade something I don't like so much.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","162":"Explainer: Oh, that's pretty cool. What do you know about computer hacking?\nExplainee: I don't really know much about computer hacking actually.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","163":"Explainer: Yep, there's also things like your mouse and there's even things like the microphone itself is actually an input device. It's taking something from you, which is the sound and it's then transmitting that, ad it's actually sending it to me. Are there any other things that you can talk to a computer? You can give it information.\nExplainee: Camera.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","164":"Explainer: Typically, it's going to be something like the keyboard, right? I'm just going to be typing keystrokes to be talking to some piece of software or hardware, but other times it can be other things like even the temperature of a computer can actually affect how the computer operates, and it might be advantageous to me to cool down the computer and actually slow down the movement of electrons in something like memory, so that if a computer shuts off, it stores something that wasn't memory like a password and stores it for a long enough time that I might be able to actually extract it through some other methods.\nExplainee: How long does it take to get in?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","165":"Explainer: Well, that's true, we do use slingshot technology once things are out in the solar system. So, for instance, we use Jupiter and other planets so that when some of the spacecraft gets close, it'll slingshot around and it'll cause it to speed up. But mostly, around the Earth, gravity pulls things down, so when we want to send a rocket into space, when we wanna go to the Moon, when we wanna send supplies to the International Space Station, the trick is to get something moving fast enough that it escapes the gravitational pull of the Earth. Have you heard the expression what goes up must come down? It's actually not true. If you throw it fast enough, you can actually get something that doesn't come back down again, and that's basically how rocket launches work. You have to get the rocket for the Earth to go more than 11 kilometers a second. Think of how fast it is. Just one breath and it's gone 11 kilometers. If you get it to go that fast, it's not gonna come back down again. So you know the International Space Station which is orbiting the Earth? That's going around the Earth at 17,000 miles an hour. It has no engines anymore, the engines are turned off. So it's just there falling forever. So once it's out there, it's not coming back down as long as it's cruising like that.\nExplainee: And does the gravity pull it or is it just floating?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","166":"Explainer: Yeah, you feel pinned to that. It's exactly like that. There's something called the equivalence principle where people realized, especially Einstein, that if you were in outer space in a rocket ship and it was dark and painted and it was accelerating at exactly the right rate, you actually wouldn't know if you were sitting on the floor of a building around the Earth or if you were on a rocket ship that was accelerating.\nExplainee: That's crazy.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","167":"Explainer: Yeah. You ever had that experience where you're sitting in a train and the other one moves and for a second you're not sure if you're the one moving?\nExplainee: Yeah, 'cause I go on the train every day to go to school, but I never feel like I'm moving when I'm in the train, and then I'm like, wait, what?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","168":"Explainer: So let me tell you where it gets really crazy.\nExplainee: [Maria laughs]\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","169":"Explainer: Mine too, because I get to spend all day studying it. Because you know what sleep does for you?\nExplainee: It rests your body, like an electric car.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","170":"Explainer: They're pretty cool, right?\nExplainee: Mhm.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","171":"Explainer: And so what's really cool about this is that giraffes need to sleep like everybody else, and so the way that it does is it kind of slumps over and it gets down on its legs and it kind of becomes this ball, but what's crazy about the whole thing is they only sleep for like 30 minutes a day. 30 minutes! Because it can't waste any more time, because it can't be vulnerable for any longer. It can get eaten by lions and that kind of thing. It has kind of evolved in a way that it can still survive and still get all the restoration it needs under such a short period of time.\nExplainee: And how does it like recharge, like humans?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","172":"Explainer: And how did you feel?\nExplainee: Really tired.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","173":"Explainer: A hippopotamus.

Okay, so what's this?\nExplainee: Aww a dolphin.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","176":"Explainer: A dolphin! Yes. So dolphins, kind of like hippos, have to sleep in the water, okay? But because they're mammals, right, they need to breathe. Dolphins breathe air. They have to go up to the surface and breathe, right? And for an animal like that, it needs to figure out a way that it can sleep but also still survive, right? You know how dolphins sleep?\nExplainee: How?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","177":"Explainer: I wanted to talk to you about a specific type of science called nanotechnology. Have you ever heard of this word before?\nExplainee: Nhn nhn.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","178":"Explainer: Nano is kind of a funny word, right? It's a word that's used before another word, and it means one billion. What's the smallest object you can think of?\nExplainee: A baby ant?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","179":"Explainer: If I took this stick and I was to draw 1 billion lines, the distance between those two lines would be one nanometer. So that's really all it is. It's just a measure of size. But it's really, really, really tiny, smaller than anything that we can see with our eyes. The reason why, in nanotechnology, scientists, we care about things that are that small, is because there are objects called atoms. Have you ever heard of atoms before?\nExplainee: Yes. I first heard of them on a show I watched called StoryBots. They're just little things that make up everything on Earth, even earth.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","180":"Explainer: That was a perfect explanation. But what if I told you that scientists invented a special type of microscope that not only lets you see atoms, but also lets you move them around and build things with them. Would you think that would be pretty cool?\nExplainee: Yeah!\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","181":"Explainer: You are definitely a second grader! [laughing] My daughter would probably answer the exact same way. A unicorn would be awesome.\nExplainee: Why do you study stuff so small?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","182":"Explainer: {missing part}\n","183":"Explainer: You know an interesting topic is: what are the limits to what we can do with virtual reality? Where I'm pretty pleased with what we have today. What we can show people and say virtual reality, its cool. People get an amazing response from it. But we're still clearly a very, very long ways from reality.\nExplainee: That kinds of notes back to Realism in our history and how Realism was a response to Romanticism. And Realism was meant to capture the mundane, everyday lives of individuals and not idealize any of their activities in any way. And I think that that's really important for virtual reality. I think its kind of rite-of-passage for any kind of our technology to go through.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","184":"Explainer: Mostly in VR we talk about the display and optics, the visual side of things, but we should at least tick off the other senses. And haptics is an interesting thing about virtual reality really doesn't have that aspect of touching things. You can move your hands around, you can do everything but its a disconnected experience because you know you don't have an actual solidity there. And I am pessimistic about progress in haptics technology. Almost all other areas I'm an optimist and I'm excited about what's coming up, but I don't have any brilliant vision about how we're going to revolutionize haptics and make it feel like we're touching the things in the virtual world.\nExplainee: So I've tried the demos, at VRLA there's one that has waves, like audio waves I believe, that come up and then you can put your hands through that and feel the waves whenever you're supposed to be feeling bubbles or any kind of force field or something. And those are pretty interesting. I've seen some pretty interesting things that you can do with audios, you can cut down a lot of the storage I guess and the power that you would need in order to power a huge scene, you can just mimic the sounds of those scenes actually being there and they're not actually. For example, a professor at USC would have the sound of a train drive by without actually rendering the sound. And you would feel like you're deeply immersed in this world without having to have such an expensive scene built around you. So I think those are pretty significant.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","185":"Explainer: Yeah, that is one potential quality improvement that is still on the horizon is when we do spatialization, we use HRTF, the Head Relative Transfer Function, to make it sound like its in different places. But usually we just use this one kind of generic, here's your average human, HRTF function. Its possible, that of course, if you are right in the average then its perfect for you. But there's always people off to the extremes, that it doesn't do a very good job at. And there may be better ways to allow people to sample their own perfect HRTF which can improve the audio experience a lot. It all comes down to all these trade-offs.\nExplainee: You know, with display and with resolution, its one of those things where if people have one bad experience they kind of, oh well everything else. Its really difficult to build trust again with people who haven't done VR before but its easy to break off that trust when they have a bad experience.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","186":"Explainer: So, from your perspective, how would you describe gravity?\nExplainee: I'm taught that it's a force. It's described by inverse law. But I also know that it's a field. And there's a recent discovery with gravitational waves, although I don't know the specific details about that.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","187":"Explainer: So, when you say it's an inverse-square law, that means that the closer you are, the more strongly you feel the gravitational pull. And that makes sense. There's very few things that are stronger when you're further apart.\nExplainee: Yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","188":"Explainer: So you can also think of a gravitational field, something that permeates all of space. Even though the earth is three stories below us, it's not as though it's pulling at us from a distance. We're actually interacting with the field at this point and there's a real interaction right here at this point. And that's nice, because people were worried that if things acted at a distance, that the way that old-fashioned inverse-square force law describes it, that it was as spooky as mind-bending a spoon, that it was like telekinesis. If you don't touch something, how do you affect it? And so the first step was to start to think of gravity as a field that permeates all of a space. And it's weaker very far from the Earth and it's closer very close to the Earth. So one way to think of this field as a field that's really describing a curved space-time that is everywhere. Forget the difficulty of the math, just the intuition comes from two kind of simple observations. One was what Einstein described as the happiest thought of his life. So, right now, you might feel heavy in your chair, and we might feel heavy on the floor and our feet, or standing in an elevator cab. And Einstein said, what does the chair have to do with it, or the floor, or the elevator? Those aren't gravitational objects. So he wanted to eliminate them, and one way to do the thought experiment is to imagine standing in an elevator that you can see out of, a black box. And imagine the cable is cut and you and the elevator begin to fall.\nExplainee: So, in free fall?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","189":"Explainer: Yeah, exactly.\nExplainee: Yeah, yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","190":"Explainer: Yeah, it would just go straight. But if you did that on the Earth, what would happen?\nExplainee: It would just go down.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","191":"Explainer: You had that moment, I saw that it your face!\nExplainee: Yeah, yeah, yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","192":"Explainer: Isn't it kind of amazing?\nExplainee: Yeah. [laughs]\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","193":"Explainer: Mm-hmm.\nExplainee: Is that an extra dimension? Does that fit into that, or is that something?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","194":"Explainer: It's a, yeah.\nExplainee: [Bela] Or how does that work?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","195":"Explainer: Mm-hmm. So we have quantum mechanics, right? The theory of atoms and so forth and how those work, and then we have gravity, and gravity doesn't seem to fit in. It's the one force of nature that we can't really easily fit into this quantum mechanical framework, so string theory is one of the best ideas.\nExplainee: Right.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","196":"Explainer: [Sean] Do you know where it comes from?\nExplainee: No.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","197":"Explainer: From membranes, you know. We have lines, one dimension. We have two dimensional surfaces. So if you have a line that is a vibrating physical thing, you call it a string, right?\nExplainee: Right.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","198":"Explainer: Well basically the strings are the particles that we see. It's exactly the same thing as we said for the straw, if you look at it far away it looks one dimensional. A little loop of string, so a little one dimensional circle that is vibrating. If you look at it from very, very far away, it just looks like a particle. So in string theory, an electron is a little string. A photon is a little string.\nExplainee: So, is string theory part of what they call the Grand Unified Theory? Is it supposed to be the last thing that sort of unifies all the forces together?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","199":"Explainer: Yes, string theory's even better. So the phrase Grand Unified Theory was coined in the 1970s for theories that joined electricity and magnetism. So a good string theory is gravity plus the Grand Unified Theory.\nExplainee: Okay.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","200":"Explainer: [Bettina] Have you ever heard of blockchain?\nExplainee: I have. Whenever we have a transaction, and let's say I buy something from you, this information gets logged. And it gets verified by a third person or third party. And then if like all this information verified and it all matches, right, the transaction goes through without any intermediary basically, right? It gets stored, and when you make further transactions, this information is ready, embedded. It's in the ledger.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","201":"Explainer: Same with, who are the actors? It's not just people anymore. It's machines.\nExplainee: [Valentinas] Absolutely.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","202":"Explainer: We're gonna have to create entire new concepts of how they do trade and how they work with us, too. What kind of barriers or road blocks would you imagine are gonna happen in the blockchain space?\nExplainee: So at least when we talk about Bitcoin, there are some trust issues and some hacks. So there's obviously a need to work on trust and feeling that it's a safe technology.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","203":"Explainer: Yeah. To actually transition into the mainstream and make it useful for average people to use, we're going to need to make sure we have a lot more education, a lot more standards and probably work with a lot of enterprises to create sort of a user experience around this being a technology that is safe and usable and understandable. What is the current state of blockchain in your understanding? What's gonna have to happen next?\nExplainee: The current state is in the research state, and it's being developed to be applied in many, many areas. It must be used almost everywhere to where we won't even imagine how we lived without it. But I'm not sure where it's going to go. I mean, no one really knows, right.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","204":"Explainer: What is it exactly that you're trying to tease out of these materials to improve the battery's performance?\nExplainee: At first, one of the main things that we did was use nanomaterials to add conductivity. And so carbon anodes and graphene are really good at adding conductivity to batteries. And then in the subsequent years, nanomaterials have been really interesting from things like incorporating sensors into batteries, to increasing the functionality of batteries, having some responsive materials that use things like graphene sheets that are incorporated into a matrix, and then you add a safety functionality to a battery. We're trying to squeeze out almost all the functionality that we can. And as new nano materials are being discovered and there're new properties being discovered, a lot of the time that someone tries to think of a way to translate that into a battery.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","205":"Explainer: Because the materials are so small, they're at the nanoscale, their properties are dominated by quantum mechanics, which means that even slight changes in their size, in their orientation give profound changes in their properties. And while that's very scientifically interesting, and it allows you to tune their properties by making subtle changes, from a technology point of view, it's a bit of a headache in the sense that in technology want to optimize for a property and then repeat that over and over again. So what are some of the challenges that you face in the lab related to working with these materials and then trying to incorporate them into the batteries?\nExplainee: I think every step of a process in a battery is something where you have to think about how would this translate to making a battery in terms of the production? One thing that I think is very interesting about the field of nanoscale materials in general, is that how you make the material changes the properties a lot. And so we claim that this 2D material has this property, then tying that to the battery performance is something that's pretty difficult to do. It takes a few steps in between. So we have to think kind of creatively with how we can do that.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","206":"Explainer: The first thing I want to show you is origami in the real world. This is the origami lamp. It comes shipped flat but it folds, clip holds it together. The lamp has LEDs on the inside so when we power it up we get light, we have a lampshade and we get the base.\nExplainee: Why does origami lend itself to, say, this type of application?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","207":"Explainer: This is another real-world application but this particular implementation is used to make a wheel for a Rover.\nExplainee: Cool, so this is something that can actually get really, really tiny but then get big and fat and roll.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","208":"Explainer: New problems arise when we try to make origami out of things other than paper, but also new opportunities. An example here which is a kind of a variant of the Miura-Ori. It's got a three-dimensional structure. If I stretch it one way, it expands the other but because it has these S-bends in the pattern, if you squeeze it, it doesn't go all the way flat. This is a epoxy impregnated aramid fiber and so if I put this fold pattern into it and then compress it and then put a skin on the top and bottom, this becomes incredibly lightweight but incredibly strong.\nExplainee: Yeah!\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","209":"Explainer: Yeah, so what goes in as sheet and what comes out is this, or something this wide.\nExplainee: That's cool, yeah. What do you see as kind of like the next big breakthrough? Is there anything out there on the horizon that you're just like, oh wow, this is really exciting?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","210":"Explainer: We're gonna talk about blockchain technology. Have you heard of blockchain?\nExplainee: I've heard of the words blockchain, but I'm not sure I know what it is.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","211":"Explainer: When we were much smaller societies, you and I could trade in our community pretty easily. As the distance in our trade grew, we ended up inventing institutions, right? If you Uber or you use Airbnb or you use Amazon even, these are just digital marketplaces and platforms that help us facilitate an exchange of value. But today, we actually have a technology that allows us to trade one to one but at scale, and it's called blockchain technology. There is some kind of interface for it. You could have an app, or you could use a computer to do it, but instead of there being a company in the middle that's helping you make that transaction, it's a bunch of software code.\nExplainee: Okay.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","212":"Explainer: And so it's being run by all of these different computers that have like a node. So they're all running the same software and guaranteeing your transactions as they happen.\nExplainee: I mean, I would assume this technology is taking away business or activity from these middlemen.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","213":"Explainer: Good to see you again, Yue.\nExplainee: Yes, good to see you.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","214":"Explainer: So how strong is the link?\nExplainee: Our study has found really strong associations looking at these populations, for example, with sleep apnea. We've done one meta-analysis and it's showed that those with sleep apnea, they have a ratio of 1.26, which means that those who have sleep apnea have 26% elevated risk of developing Alzheimer's compared to those without sleep apnea.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","215":"Explainer: So it's interesting, so I also saw that there was also a recent meta-analysis around sleep disturbances and dementia risk, and in that study, they looked about 250,000 people in this meta-analysis, and they followed them around for 10 years, and you know, when they pulled all the samples together, they found there was a 1.2 fold increased risk for developing all caused dementia, so it sounds like both sleep apnea and then maybe sleep disturbances more generally are associated with increased risk for dementia. When I think about that, I think about how sleep lives in the brain, these neurodegenerative diseases live in the brain, and so what do we know about the causality of this? Could it be that individuals who have early onset of say, Alzheimer's, have then poor sleep kind of as a consequence of that?\nExplainee: Yeah, so I think what's really fascinating is all these bio-directional relationships that's being identified in animal studies especially, showing that sleep changes actually occur very early on in the disease process, so it could be a prodromal stage of Parkinson's, and also in transgenic model of AD, they're already showing a lot of circadian abnormalities in this mouse.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","216":"Explainer: So within dementia risk in particular, Alzheimer's for instance, there are kind of two clear features that seem to be part of the pathology, right? So there's beta-amyloid which accumulates in the brain, and then there's kind of these tangles, this tauopathies, right? And so it sounds like sleep seems to be related to the tauopathies. What about kind of beta-amyloid?\nExplainee: Yes, in the transgenic mouse models of AD, including those expressing human mutant amyloid precursor protein, APP type or both, so that's kind of showing the sleep changes in both of these pathologies.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","217":"Explainer: Okay, so there is this bio-directional piece, but I think perhaps the most exciting thing that happened in the sleep field, at least in my view, has been understanding the role of sleep and its clearance of beta-amyloid in the brain. This idea that sleep is kind of the dishwasher of the brain, it seems like, that you know A betta accumulates as we kind of use energy, and you know it's kind of a waste product, and the idea that if you don't clear it out, that it's going to build up and accumulate.\nExplainee: So the thing I'm most excited about sleep research is, I think, first of all, this complexity of the daytime\/nighttime sleep, what sleep is really doing to our body and to our brain, and then is really from the epidemiologic or public health perspective, how we can best use sleep as a tool for the detection and prevention of neurodegeneration in the long-term.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","218":"Explainer: Here's a spider with eight legs, ants with legs and these, just like the crane, are folded from a single uncut square.\nExplainee: What?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","219":"Explainer: That's a corner, four corners of the square, four points. How would you make one point out of this sheet of paper?\nExplainee: I'm thinking of, like, a paper airplane.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","220":"Explainer: The crane has four circles but, actually, there's a little bit of a surprise because what about this? There's a fifth circle, which is like that, but does the crane have a fifth flap in it? Let's refold it and put the wings up. Well, yes, there is, there's another point and that point is the fifth circle of our crane.\nExplainee: Okay.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","221":"Explainer: You've got it, so you are ready to design origami.\nExplainee: Awesome.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","222":"Explainer: I remember reading your papers when I was a student and we're all trying to create these materials and finding ways to exploit their properties. What I love, and I'm delighted that you're here to talk to us about is how you took inspiration from nature and sort of recognize that nature's figured out a way to both synthesize incredibly complex nanostructures with high functionality and how you sort of were inspired by that to do the research that you're doing now.\nExplainee: Life gave us this toolkit that is already on the nanoscale. So we think that that's a great place to think about making materials on the nano scale and manipulating materials on the nano scale, and wiring them together as well. This abalone shell, you can see the exquisite beautiful colors and structures of it. This is a nano composite material. If you take this and fracture it, and you look at it in a scanning electron microscope, what you'll see is that it's made out of these beautiful tablets. And I studied that as a graduate student. I looked at that and I said, that is completely amazing. You have an organism in the ocean, that takes what's in its environment, which is calcium and carbonate. That's dissolved in the water and templates it into this really exquisite structure. And so you think that's great. Calcium carbonate is great, but what if we wanted to make a solar cell or a another electronic device or a battery, how would you get an organism to do that? And you say, okay, that's a really crazy idea. But is it really that crazy if this abalone, already figured out how to do it, 500 million years ago? So we're saying, okay, abalones build shells. Can viruses build solar cells, can viruses build catalysts? Can they build batteries using the same kind of idea?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","223":"Explainer: Telescopes, solar arrays, they need to be packed into a rocket, go up, but then expand in a very controlled, deterministic way when they get up into space.\nExplainee: Okay.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","224":"Explainer: These are the building blocks of many, many origami deployable shapes, it's called a degree-4 vertex. It's the number of lines. So in this case, we use solid lines for mountain, we use dash lines for valley. We're going to fold it and use these two to illustrate some important properties of origami mechanisms. It's important in the study of mechanisms to take into account the rigidity. So what we're going to do to help simulate rigidity is to take these rectangles and we're going to fold them over and over so that they just become stiff and rigid.\nExplainee: [Grad Student] Okay.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","225":"Explainer: So this is what's called a single degree of freedom mechanism. You have one degree of freedom, I can choose this fold, and then if these are perfectly rigid every other fold angle is fully determined. One of the key behaviors here is that with the smaller angles up here, the two folds that are the same parity and the folds that are of opposite parity move at about the same rate but with this, as we're getting closer to 90 degrees, we find they move at very different rates and then at the end of the motion, the opposite happens. This one is almost folded but this one goes through a much larger motion so the relative speeds differ.\nExplainee: Right.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","226":"Explainer: And they fold flat and a pattern almost exactly like this was used for a solar array for a Japanese mission that flew in 1995.\nExplainee: So then you like fly it up compactly and then once you get up there, there's like some sort of like motorized mechanism, but you only need it on one fold.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","227":"Explainer: So, sadly, the only way to get them at exactly the same rate is when these are microscopic slivers and then that's not useful.\nExplainee: For sure, right, right.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","228":"Explainer: And it's exactly the difference between the motions of these two vertices. So these angles are closer to right angles and the closer you get to a right angle the more asymmetry there is between the two directions of motion. And then the other difference is how efficiently they pack, so these started at about the same size but when they're flat notice that yours is much more compact. So if I were you making a solar array, I'd say, oh, I want that one. But if I say, well, I want them to open at the same rate, then I want this one.\nExplainee: So, it's kind of a trade-off?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","229":"Explainer: There's an engineering trade-off to get them both to work. And there's another place that shows up in deployable structures in a very cool structure. This is a folded tube, it sort of pops out like this but it has this neat property that if you twist it quickly, it changes color. There's a Mars Rover application where they need a sleeve that protects a drill and as the drill goes down, the sleeve is going to collapse and they're using a pattern very much like this.\nExplainee: Interesting.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","230":"Explainer: So do you know what virtual reality is?\nExplainee: Yes, its simple. Its like a video game except it feels like you're in the video game.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","231":"Explainer: That's actually a really good description. The idea is that if you've got a system here that can make you see whatever we want you to see, then we can make you believe that you're anywhere else, like on top of a mountain, or in a dungeon or under the ocean.\nExplainee: Or in Minecraft.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","232":"Explainer: Yeah, or in Minecraft. When you look at a TV on the wall there showing like a picture of a mountain or something, how can you tell that its not just a window and there's something else behind it. Because it always doesn't look quite right if you have a static picture of a person on a screen and you move around like this, its not really changing. And its interesting, those are things we have to figure out We need to figure out when you look at something in reality how can you tell whether its real or not. Have you been to a 3-D movie where you put on the little glasses?\nExplainee: Yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","233":"Explainer: {missing part}\n","234":"Explainer: Essentially what harmony is, is like a language, right?

Alright so lets visit the B flat, with a bit more imagination.\nExplainee: Yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","238":"Explainer: We're gonna talk about some science. Do you like science?\nExplainee: Yes, a lot.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","239":"Explainer: What's your idea what physics is?\nExplainee: Um, I'm not so sure.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","240":"Explainer: Exactly. It's not really one dimensional, right?\nExplainee: So everything has to be one or two dimensional before it's three dimensional.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","241":"Explainer: And how would you find yourself, like if someone said where are you, could you use some words or ideas to say where you are on that line?\nExplainee: I think I would be maybe there, since I'm facing it.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","242":"Explainer: Has its own unit, has one number.\nExplainee: Yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","243":"Explainer: We need one number to tell you where we are. That's one dimension. That's what it means to be one dimensional. I only need to tell you one number to figure out where we are.\nExplainee: Unlike three dimensional, you have to tell a lot 'cause if it's like a sphere, you kind of have to start using points.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","244":"Explainer: I think you should be in this chair and you should be explaining this to me. You're much better at this than I am.\nExplainee: Yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","245":"Explainer: Well, as far as we know.\nExplainee: Yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","246":"Explainer: Yeah, do you think you'd be excited if physicists said that they found extra dimensions of space?\nExplainee: That would be an amazing discovery. The news would be spreaded around the world rapidly.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","247":"Explainer: So in your studies, have you learned about machine learning?\nExplainee: Yeah, I have. So to me, machine learning is essentially exactly what it sounds like. It's trying to teach a machine specifics about something by inputting a lot of data points and slowly, the machine will build up knowledge about it over time. For example, my Gmail program, I assume that there would be a lot of, like, machine learning models happening at once, right?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","248":"Explainer: Absolutely. And that's a great example because you have models that are operating to do things like figure out if a new email is spam or not. So what would you think about if you were looking at an email and trying to decide if it went in one category or another?\nExplainee: I'd probably look at certain keywords. Maybe if the recipient and the sender had exchanged emails before and generally, those fell into in the past.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","249":"Explainer: So these are things we would call features. And we go through a process where we do feature engineering, where somebody looks at the example and says, Okay, these are the things that I think might allow us to statistically tell the difference from something in one category versus another. So for example, perhaps you don't speak Russian, you start getting a lot of email in Russian.\nExplainee: Obviously, like the features that you just described are features which a person would have had to think about. Are there features which, like, the machine itself could learn?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","250":"Explainer: Supervised learning, we have our labels and we're trying to figure out what statistically indicates if something matches one label or another label. Unsupervised learning, we don't necessarily have those labels. That's the thing we're trying to discover. So reinforcement learning is another technique that we use sometimes. You can think about it like a turn in a game and you can play, you know, millions and millions of trials so that you're able to develop a system that by experimenting with reinforcement learning can eventually learn to play these games pretty successfully. Deep learning, which is essentially using neural networks and very large amounts of data to eventually iterate on a network structure that can make predictions.\nExplainee: With reinforcement learning versus deep learning, it seems to me that reinforcement learning, is it sort of like the kitchen sink approach that you were talking about earlier, where you're just kind of trying everything?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","251":"Explainer: [Hilary] Yes. [both laugh]\nExplainee: Oh, I didn't realize it was that deep, almost. Is there a situation which you'd want to use a deep learning algorithm over a reinforcement learning algorithm?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","252":"Explainer: You build a system that could actually be useless. So years ago, I had a client that was a big telecom company and they had a data scientist who built a deep learning system to predict customer churn. It actually was very accurate, but it wasn't useful because nobody knew why the prediction was what it was. So they could say, you know, Sunny, you're likely to quit next month. But they had no idea what to do about it. And so, I think there are a bunch of failure modes.\nExplainee: Would that be an example of, like, linear regression where the regression is accurate, but, you know, for marketing purposes, it's like, if you don't know why I'm quitting the service, then how can we fix this?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","253":"Explainer: Yeah. This is actually a good example of a very real world kind of machine learning problem where the solution to this was to build an interpretable system on top of the accurate predictions not to throw it away, but to do a bunch more work to figure out the why.\nExplainee: How can we improve machine learning algorithms?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","254":"Explainer: Maybe a wiring diagram is not sufficient to understand the brain, and it would be crazy to think that that would be sufficient, actually.\nExplainee: If you limit the connectome to be just the wiring diagram without, you know, more information about myelination or glial cells, all types of environmental features that surround the neurons and axons then you have an incomplete picture, no doubt.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","255":"Explainer: Yes.\nExplainee: I'm a musician and I don't think it's possible. I think that there are too many, you know, so much of it is associative to what you already know.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","256":"Explainer: So and a musician, how much of it do you think is in your hands versus in your brains? Meaning like, you do have connections in your muscles from the nerves that are from your spinal cord, what if some of the learning is there?\nExplainee: Are you still doing EM or?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","257":"Explainee: Hello Donna, good to see you.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","258":"Explainer: That's right, if you can do that, go for it.\nExplainee: And then we will shine that laser onto that electron beam, and the electron's rest frame, we beat the Schwinger limit.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","259":"Explainer: So we can either cheat by doing laser accelerating and going into that rest frame.\nExplainee: Yes.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","260":"Explainer: Okay.\nExplainee: And make them act as one coherent source. So one of the things that we'll be doing with our two petawatts, we're going to see if we can actually combine them into a 50. If you can do that, you can begin to imagine doing this with many lasers. Many petawatt lasers of the scale we're talking about. So one could possibly see an exawatt from that. People have been able to combine 10s of lasers together for a coherent source so you have to be able to phase lock them, you have to be able to make their phases be exactly connected and related and be able, as they propagate through all the different optical components, whatever it may be--\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","261":"Explainer: And right across the beam. Don't you think that's gonna be the challenge? 'Cos it's not like our beams are as perfect as we like to think they are.\nExplainee: So that's right so you have to have the aperture size, you have to have them phase locked across the entire aperture. Which will be a great challenge and people have done it, again, with small lasers. The lasers we'll be trying to do is about a 40cm aperture. So we'll begin to start looking at this. And actually wavelength control and then be able to adaptive optics other ways which you can control the uniformity of the phase is something that's been developed in lots of ways now. For defense applications, for science applications. So we will do our best to make use of all these technologies. Lasers I think have progressed so much. Just like the semi conductor did, 'cos there's such a market for it, there were so many different applications for that.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","262":"Explainer: Okay so there's a lot of us working around the world on these high intensity lasers and so, what do you think the real fun is? What do you see the real excitement being?\nExplainee: I remember when laser was first demonstrated 1960, what could we do with this? We already got light. Now we can't live without lasers. My cell phone, that is in my pocket, has billions of transistors. How is that made? With lasers. All of the greatest circuitry is done with lasers. Actually now it's using x-rays, made from laser heated matter. That came out of the laser fusion program.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","263":"Explainer: Have you heard of the breach of Target where they were breached many years ago and their point of sale systems were hacked?\nExplainee: Yes, I heard about that.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","264":"Explainer: So where people are swiping credit cards, those credit card numbers were stolen. They hired a company to come in and perform a penetration test to see, can the good guys essentially break in again to prevent this sort of thing in the future? And when this team came in, they found they actually were able to get pretty much to the same point of sale system, and the way they did that was by exploiting an internet-connected deli meat scale. Once the company was able to essentially get into the deli scale, because the deli scale was on the internal network, then they were able to really escalate privilege and find a vulnerability within another system. Essentially, that just got them into the network. and once you're in the network, it's often really easy to then escalate from there.\nExplainee: I've heard about similar attacks in hospitals using hospital equipment, but I'm surprised that something as simple as a meat scale would have been used in such an attack. We discussed it in class as how hackers look at some of the weakest links in these large networks and use those to tap into networks.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","265":"Explainer: Yeah, that's another interesting concept. It's really just different layers that we have for protection, because often when you're talking about something like a corporate network, or even your home network, you typically have sort of one level of defense, right? If someone can break that or it can get in through some other system that is connected or exposes some other protocol, like Bluetooth, right? You can connect to a Bluetooth device without being on the wireless network, without being on the LAN. That potentially gives you another place that you can pivot on and then access other devices, because if something has both Bluetooth and also Wi-Fi, well, if you can get in through Bluetooth, then you can then access the Wi-Fi and get to other devices on the network. Are you familiar with buffer overflows?\nExplainee: No, I am not familiar with that.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","266":"Explainer: Absolutely, you would essentially cause a segmentation fault.\nExplainee: Yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","267":"Explainer: Ever since buffer overflow started many years ago, there been a lot of protection mechanisms built to make it difficult to exploit. More and more, we're actually using smaller and smaller computers with smaller amounts of compute power. If you take a car, you have hundreds of microcontrollers that are all running there. So they don't really have a sophisticated operating system that can try to prevent attacks like buffer overflows. So how do we keep these low cost computers in here while adding layers of protection to prevent malice and these types of attacks? Sometimes it actually is, how can we write software or how can we build a system that prevents these types of attacks from entering? But oftentimes, it's really looking for how can we find new attacks that we haven't even necessarily thought of? What got you interested in computer science and information security?\nExplainee: I got interested in cybersecurity because I'm really into global affairs, global politics, and you often hear in the news about the rising power of China, the rising power of Iran. I enjoy how interdisciplinary computer science is. Like, nowadays there's so much going on in the world of computers and that's what fascinated me.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","268":"Explainer: You brought up China and Iran, and something that's interesting about those areas is really censorship, right? They have essentially censored internet. In the US, we have a really interesting internal struggle here where we actually have government agencies like the state department that are funding software to evade censorship, like Tor and other mechanisms. While then we also have an internal struggle where we have other organizations like the NSA who are specifically looking to break that exact same system that the US government is also funding.\nExplainee: There are a lot of ethical questions about whether we should be intervening in other countries, but it's pretty interesting that two different agencies of the government are actually working on contrasting technology. I can actually understand that because if we are creating a technology that we are going to deploy somewhere else, we should know its limitations. We should know how to control it.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","269":"Explainer: Oh really? Oh excellent. Well I'm somebody who studies lasers. So what do you think about lasers?\nExplainee: I don't know--\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","270":"Explainer: You haven't got to play with lasers. So I brought one. It's my friend's cat toy. Do you ever use a laser as a cat toy?\nExplainee: No.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","271":"Explainer: Well one of the fun things people do with lasers, the cat will try to grab that dot. I'm sure what you have at home is a flashlight. I brought a cute little one. So the question is, do you see any difference between what a flashlight does and what a laser does?\nExplainee: Flashlight is a bigger shine and the laser is just a dot.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","272":"Explainer: [Donna] And yet it's not. Isn't that amazing?\nExplainee: Yes.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","273":"Explainer: One of the things that lasers are great for is that because it's a directed beam, we can actually put that light where we want the light to go and sometimes you maybe just want to see something around the corner and you can't see it. But with a laser, you can actually and this is a smoky one so you can actually watch it go. You see it actually bending the corner?\nExplainee: Yes.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","274":"Explainer: So this obviously is much bigger than our hair. Right?\nExplainee: Yes.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","275":"Explainer: Have you ever seen that maybe there's a little bit of a red light when you do that?\nExplainee: Yes.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","276":"Explainer: That's a laser. We cut steel with them now. We actually do surgery with lasers. You know when some people have either scars or birth marks that they don't want to see? We can actually remove those with lasers now. Never seen a laser light show? When they light up the sky with lasers, it's almost like fireworks.\nExplainee: Well I saw a shooting star before.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","277":"Explainer: Have you done any work in side channel analysis?\nExplainee: Like, a little bit. I read the Rowhammer paper. I found it really interesting, but it's nothing that I've actually worked with.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","278":"Explainer: So the side channel analysis is really looking not at a vulnerability within a system, but really unintended consequences of what the system is built on. A very simple example of a side channel is putting your ear to the ground to hear if there are horses coming towards you, and the same thing applies to technology. So you can have something like a CPU, it's executing instructions, certain instructions that use a little bit more power, and power is reserved in these capacitors, which are like tiny batteries next to your CPU. And as they're pulling power, there's something in physics called the electrostrictive effect where the capacitor will move in a very, very tiny amount. And then although we can't hear it, the microphone on a mobile device can actually listen to that. If you then listen to that and you say, oh, I see a pattern here, and you can go all the way down and then extract and reveal the full password, the full key, even though it could be argued that the algorithm itself, there's no problem with it.\nExplainee: So all memory devices are just, it's just a bunch of gates and they're in rows. They basically all hold different pieces of memory. That's all the gates are. Either they're turned on or they're turned off. So what Rowhammer found was they tested a bunch of different memory devices and found that by doing a certain order of storing things, and then pulling that information back in a certain way in one place would actually flip gates in a different place. So you could actually do a bunch of things to a piece of memory that had nothing to do with something that may be critical in a different place and actually change its contents, and that obviously exposes all sorts of security issues, because that's very hard to predict.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","279":"Explainer: That's pretty challenging if you want to use wireless, right? If you wanna use a wireless router.\nExplainee: Yeah, I mean, there's obviously essentials, but yeah, no matter what, you can't really avoid any of this.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","280":"Explainer: The risk right now, just during this quarantine, is actually massive now that we think about it, because you might have these legacy systems. You know, they were built 20, 30 years ago, and it's too costly to upgrade, but now you can't actually have a lot of people in a single location, so potentially, they actually do have to now add some sort of remote capabilities to these systems that were never meant to be on the internet. Have you ever had any ethical concerns with the stuff you're interested in or the work you do?\nExplainee: Oh yeah, for sure. When people find vulnerabilities, I think it's their duty to release those to the public.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","281":"Explainer: Especially now that we're seeing more and more companies who are trying to make it illegal for you to inspect the vehicle that you've purchased, right? Something that you actually own.\nExplainee: Yeah, I think that's nuts. I'm firmly against that for sure.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","282":"Explainer: What if it were illegal? Would you then do it? Fortunately it's not today, right? It hasn't been, you know, despite their attempts, none of that has been passed, but if you had a vehicle and you wanted to inspect it, but all of a sudden, it passed, I mean.\nExplainee: I don't know, probably, yeah. [laughing] I don't think that's hurting anyone,\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","283":"Explainer: That's amazing. What made you decide to trade on eBay?\nExplainee: Well, I mean, I've heard of it, and I trust it a lot because they have all of their guarantees, so I know that I'm gonna get money and the person's gonna get what they want.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","284":"Explainer: And there's a lot of those kinds of middlemen in our society today, right? We have a lot of banks.\nExplainee: Yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","285":"Explainer: We have a lot of companies that sort of help us make sure that our trades happen, but if we could guarantee the same trade using technology as sort of a technological trust, then we wouldn't really need all those middlemen in between.\nExplainee: So how does it work?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","286":"Explainer: It's basically a network of computers that all have the same history of transactions. And so instead of sort of there being one company with one database that holds all the information, the same sort of list is held by all these different people. Like, you could have it on your computer. And then it gets validated by everyone, and basically, that turns into the next part of the list. So it's sort of constantly updating itself.\nExplainee: So like, how do you make sure that it's secure?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","287":"Explainer: [Bettina] Exactly.\nExplainee: That's cool.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","288":"Explainer: [Donna] And what's your major?\nExplainee: I'm an engineering physics major with a minor in math. I'm in the three, two program for biomedical engineering.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","289":"Explainer: Okay. As opposed to the experimental side and seeing things? Okay so I'm much more, I like to see the things happening. So then the question is, what's so special about making a light that's intense enough to actually possibly blow things up? Certainly we can blow atoms up with the laser hammer and when the laser light comes in and just smacks the electrons right off the atom. And so the question really is how do you make that? Back in the 70s and into the 80s, I know that was a long time ago for you, we had big energy lasers and we had short pulse lasers, we couldn't have big energy, short pulse lasers and actually it was my supervisor and I that figured the way around that and we got something called chirped pulse amplification. Have you heard of chirped pulse amplification by any chance?\nExplainee: Vaguely.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","290":"Explainer: Well I brought a little bit of a prop to explain how chirped pulse amplification works. Our short pulses are made of different colors. So I've got a colored slinky here. We probably could've called it stretched pulse amplification but that's kind of boring so we used the word chirped. The word chirped comes around because birds chirp. When the birds are singing, the notes are actually changing audio frequency with time and that's a chirp. The point is is that when all the light is squeezed together like this, it's a short pulse. And that's when it's a hammer because all of the light is now concentrated and you can imagine if this was coming along and also using a lens to focus it small, then all of that light at the focal spot, concentrate. And so that was the laser hammer. So we can't have that in the laser. So the question is what could we do? The fact that it's different colors and different colors because of dispersion, travel different speeds inside material. So we used a long fiber, 1.4 kilometers of fiber but, in fiber, the red colors really haven't got that much in common with the glass atoms and so they spend very little time interacting and they travel fast. The red is going to start traveling faster than the green, faster than the blue and, as you travel down the fiber, next thing you know, you have a long pulse and it's chirped from red at the beginning to blue at the back. And so the frequencies go hoo! Like this okay? So this is a chirped pulse and now it's a long pulse. And so, first this is what we did, we chirped it, we stretched it, then we can safely amplify it because it's not all concentrated and, after we amplify it, then we use something called a compressor and we put all of the colors back together and it was back being a short pulse but a high energy pulse. And then we really had what I like to call a laser hammer. When this laser pulse goes inside, it smacks those electrons right off the atom.\nExplainee: So the laser hammer that you were describing with other types of lasers and the one in the chirped is it still the same premise?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","291":"Explainer: Well a lot of lasers and when lasers first came along, they were only single color. Your cat toy, would only be a single color, probably a red one and so that's just one color. And one color means that it has to really be there for the whole time. One color is one wave length of light and so it's just one wave that goes on and on and on. If you want a short pulse, you actually have to have all the colors. And if you can imagine that one point in time, and I like to say it's like a conductor of an orchestra. When you're listening to an orchestra warm up, they sound terrible, they're all playing their own notes. But when the conductor conducts them, they all play different notes but, together, it's beautiful music. So we have something in the laser called a mode locker and it's like the conductor and it says go now. And all the colors will start together but some colors are long wave length and others are shorter. So next thing you know, you have peaks meeting valleys and they cancel each other. And the more colors you can bring in, the faster that happens and the shorter the pulse you can make.\nExplainee: What's the pendant?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","292":"Explainer: Right.\nExplainee: Then I finally understood the idea where the overtone series came from that if a bunch of singers were to nail a chord or have it perfectly tuned, the overtones, you would hear a tone that necessarily wasn't being produced by one the singers.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","293":"Explainer: I think that people forget that you can work with the notes you already have by just rearranging them, just the simple idea of inversion, inversion of the simple triad, of F major. \u266aI once was lost and now I'm found \u266a \u266a Was blind \u266a \u266a But now I see \u266a Now how home do I want to go here, you know? Is there another verse to come?\nExplainee: Right.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","294":"Explainer: F major, F minor, D flat major seven G flat diminished, G flat minor major seven, G minor seven, G soft, G seven, G seven sharp 11. And then, G seven with a flat 13\nExplainee: (laughs)\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","295":"Explainer: That's it! (laughs) A flat soft, A flat major seven. A flat major seven sharp five, with a sharp 11. Essentially, what that demonstrates is that every note and every base note are compatible. So once we realize this its like, that's great! Now what should we do? What, how, what should we, what should we, how, what am I supposed to do? What to do, right. And sometimes the paralyzing thing when it comes to arranging, there are too many options, too many things are possible. So that's when it becomes super, super important to be aware of what you wanna try and say emotionally.\nExplainee: But what about negative harmony, the dark side?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","296":"Explainer: Right.\nExplainee: You know, you changed the feeling of it, what otherwise would, you know, if you were to tell a kid that this is a major song, we should be happy.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","297":"Explainer: Connectome.\nExplainee: To be honest, I have no idea.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","298":"Explainer: In one brain, in your brain. Could I take all of that information and put it inside a computer? Would that computer then be you?\nExplainee: Computers they don't have feelings, they won't have feelings and I think that's one thing that makes the human race strong.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","299":"Explainer: Because there's more to you in here than just information passing between neurons.\nExplainee: I'd like to think so.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","300":"Explainer: It sounds impossible. Right?\nExplainee: It does.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","301":"Explainer: Is there any particular memory for you that you feel has been either kind of influential in your, in deciding which areas to pursue or that you feel is sort of emblematic of what it is to have a memory?\nExplainee: I was probably six years old and my aunt who had stage four ovarian cancer, she battled it for 20 years. She got me my first science kit and she asked me to cure cancer and I will never forget running into my aunt's room and just opening up the box and seeing that microscope, it was a tiny little blue one and the little microscope slides and the little pipettes. So they just, that memory will never be forgotten my whole life.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","302":"Explainer: I've got one too. I was nine and we were at the science expo in San Francisco. Two scientists were dissecting an eye, a cow's eye. And I was like that is the coolest thing I've ever seen. And something about that that carried me forward. Something happened so long ago, it left some long lasting trace through neural circuits and it continues to shape the decisions we make about what to study and what to do.\nExplainee: Just being able to apply those memories in the future is just so crucial in everyday life of the humans and the fact that we're learning how that works. And I would love to hear more about your side of memory and the mechanisms that you're studying.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","303":"Explainer: My work has actually kind of pushed against that distinction between memories that kind of are consciously accessible versus unconscious.\nExplainee: When you say that you don't necessarily look at implicit and explicit memory as anything different, if you were to take a step back, what would you define as implicit and explicit memory?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","304":"Explainer: The best way to kind of think about that distinction really goes back historically to one of the most important discoveries in memory research. The patient was referred to famously as patient HM. The neurosurgeon went in and removed the tissue that happened to be right around the hippocampus on both the left side and the right side of HM's brain. But then they started noticing something odd in his behavior. He was not able to create new memories of the experiences he had after the surgery. And that led Brenda Milner and her colleagues to report that the hippocampus was very important for memory, but a one particular kind, these sort of explicit, or as now referred to them episodic memories. But the hippocampus was not necessary for learning skills like mirror tracing, things that you can't necessarily articulate but you just get better at over time. And it really led to a couple of decades or more even of an enormous amount of very important work that kind of kept on breaking memory down further and further into different types. Episodic and semantic as both forms of explicit memory where episodic refers to memory for an event that happened like what you did yesterday morning and semantic refers to general knowledge about the world. Implicit memory is being broken down into a bunch of different kinds like skills or habits or conditioning. And when I started graduate school, many of us felt kind of the next question was really to understand how do we now understand how they work together. This was right around when functional magnetic resonance imaging started becoming a popular tool for measuring brain activity. We could scan the entire brain and we could ask questions about multiple brain regions at once. And we discovered that what we might expect during a skill learning task that only the striatum might show activity, that we also saw the activity in the hippocampus. Or when we asked someone to form an episodic memory that we thought might depend only on the hippocampus we suddenly also saw activity in the prefrontal cortex. And so the confluence of these new ideas and questions about how different forms of memory interact together with the development of new tools for studying the human mind and brain allowed us to kind of adjust our view of memory systems, to think of them less as multiple completely separate independent systems and instead to try to understand how they really work in concert with each other and give rise to all kinds of behaviors that might not fit neatly into one category or another.\nExplainee: Are the connectivities that you're seeing using the FMRI in your studies, are they different when you look at the implicit and explicit memories? Are you seeing more activity in the striatum in comparison to the hippocampus or the prefrontal cortex?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","305":"Explainer: What's your favorite subject?\nExplainee: I'd say math. Some of the small problems can actually be really big and complicated. It's like a puzzle.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","306":"Explainer: When I first learned about them, I just thought they were so cool. But it turns out they're also really useful, not just for finding like, puffins. If you just type in your password and the hacker hacks into the computer, they can just get your password. Right?\nExplainee: Yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","307":"Explainer: What if instead, we could somehow use a zero-knowledge proof to log in. You would just be able to prove that, hey, I'm Chelsea, without revealing anything to them. If you could do that, then it would be amazing, right?\nExplainee: Yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","308":"Explainer: What does infinity mean to you?\nExplainee: Really anything that has no end to it.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","309":"Explainer: Yeah, that's absolutely right. So infinity gets used a lot of different ways in mathematics. There's a way that mathematicians think of infinity as a number, just like the number 13, just like the number 10 million. So the reason that mathematicians consider infinity to be a number is that it is a size of a set. So the first example of an infinite set in mathematics is the set of all counting numbers. So one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, et cetera. That list goes on forever. That is an infinite set. And to be a little bit more precise, it's a countably infinite set. But as a number, infinity is pretty strange.\nExplainee: What do you mean by that?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","310":"Explainer: Room number one. Exactly. I'm gonna use this symbol for infinity, but what we've just shown is that one, the one new guest plus infinity is equal to the same infinity. What happens if we had a second guest?\nExplainee: Would it be two plus infinity equals infinity?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","311":"Explainer: Absolutely. So now I'm gonna make this story a little more complex. That there's another Hilbert's Hotel down the street and they're having plumbing issues and we need to find room for them.\nExplainee: They can't live together?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","312":"Explainer: They can't live together. That would be a great solution. I don't know. I think these people don't really get along. So I need to somehow create infinitely many new rooms, but I can only ask each person in the hotel to move a finite distance away. So let's take the guest who is originally in room one and move them into room two. So that's creating one new space for us. And I'm gonna take the guest who was originally in room two and move them into room four. Are you starting to see a pattern here?\nExplainee: Yes. You're going up one each time?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","313":"Explainer: Infinity, great. Hilbert's Hotel is a story that mathematicians have been telling themselves for almost 100 years because it's a really visceral way to think about some of the counterintuitive properties of the arithmetic of infinity.\nExplainee: How does infinity come across in mathematics for you?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","314":"Explainer: Yeah. That's what it's called.\nExplainee: Yeah. yeah, I haven't heard of it before.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","315":"Explainer: Do you have any thoughts on like what the data might look like in a robotic setting, if you were to apply machine learning to robots?\nExplainee: I think of like coordinates.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","316":"Explainer: Yeah, so there's this generalization gap, this gap between what it was trained to do and the new thing.\nExplainee: So what's like the most complicated thing for a robot to learn, is it motion?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","317":"Explainer: So you can think of robotics as having two core components. One is perception, being able to see and feel and so forth, and action, where the robot actually figures out how to move its arm. And both components are really essential, and both components are quite difficult. If you train a perception system independently of how to choose actions, then it might make errors in a way that mess up the system that selects actions And so if you instead try to train these two systems together, to have it learn perception action for the goal of solving these different tasks, then the robot can be more successful. One thing that's really difficult about robotics is, there actually isn't that much data of robots in the world. On the internet, there's all sorts of text data, all sorts of image data that people upload and write. But there isn't a lot of data of doing a simple thing, like tying your shoe, for example, because it's so basic. One challenge is even just getting data sets that allow us to teach robots to do these simple kinds of tasks.\nExplainee: Do you think that we'd be able to kind of accelerate that process of collecting data? Or do you think, is it the way that we've been collecting those types of data sets, Is that what's keeping us behind?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","318":"Explainer: That's a great question. I think we should be able to accelerate the data collection process by having robots collect more data autonomously on their own. And by doing that, we might be able to overcome some of the challenges of Moravec's paradox.\nExplainee: What are some common algorithms that are used in these types of techniques as the robot is learning?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","319":"Explainer: Do you have any sense of how you would give a really precise mathematical definition to, you know, what is a fractal?\nExplainee: It would probably have to be some kind of recursive definition, like imaginary numbers. I know the Mandelbrot set we'll use those.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","320":"Explainer: The Mandelbrot set or the Julia set, you know, the idea is always, oh, I'm gonna apply some polynomial over and over again. Z squared plus C or something like that. When I think about fractals, I try to get away from these very specific examples and ask, what is it fundamentally that makes a fractal, a fractal. And one thing that I think you can be precise about, even if you can't really say exactly what a fractal is, is you can talk about this idea of fractal dimension. Have you ever heard of that?\nExplainee: No, I have not actually.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","321":"Explainer: And why three?\nExplainee: I would also say three.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","322":"Explainer: But if you take a more interesting shape, some kind of fractal shape, like let's say the coastline of great Britain and you start doing this box, counting experiment, something really interesting happens as you make these boxes smaller, the number of boxes you need to cover the coastline grows faster than it would for just a straight line.\nExplainee: Four.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","323":"Explainer: And so what this box counting is getting at is saying, well, I still can never decide what the length of the coastline is, but what I can do is I can see how quick does the number of boxes grow relative to how it would grow just for an ordinary one dimensional curve, like a line or a circle.\nExplainee: Yeah, I've, I've heard about that. Where if you, if you change the amount of measurement for a coastline, you can actually change like how much of the coast that, that there is like if you measure in mile lengths, you're gonna get a much different estimate than if you measure in one inch increments.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","324":"Explainer: So procedural computer graphics, which kind of came out of thinking about fractals is one answer to this question about how do you add more detail without for instance, consuming tons of memory or requiring artists to paint ultra detail the textures. So if, if you can instead describe at least some aspect of what you're looking at in a procedural or recursive way, then you can add as much detail as you need when you get close to objects.\nExplainee: Is there any other interesting applications of fractals?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","325":"Explainer: Yeah like perlin noise is a great example, right? Perlin noise was one of the early ways of synthesizing additional texture at any level of detail that you needed to make things look natural and realistic.\nExplainee: Oh, you mean like perlin noise?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","326":"Explainer: And then program the robot to move over here and open the- \nExplainee: And drop it.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","327":"Explainer: yeah do you know what your computer thinks that is\nExplainee: An A\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","328":"Explainer: Have you ever heard of zero-knowledge proofs?\nExplainee: Only in passing.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","329":"Explainer: So actually, in the blockchain space is one of the spaces where we are seeing zero-knowledge proofs being implemented. And I think it's just the beginning. Let's talk about zero-knowledge proofs. At its core, a zero-knowledge proof is an interaction between two people. Then I should be able to convince you that some statement is true, but you won't have any idea why it's true.\nExplainee: Will I, like, understand that it's true because like, you know, the operations performed in the proof are like, of a certain, like, you know, they have like, certain attributes that would make them true?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","330":"Explainer: And the way we're gonna approach this is through something called NP-completeness. What an NP-complete problem is, it's a problem that's really hard to solve. But if you can solve it, you can solve any problem that's in the class NP. And that includes a vast number of problems. And what we're gonna do is we're gonna use an NP-complete problem to actually prove an incredible variety of statements through a zero-knowledge proof. And the specific Np-complete problem that we're gonna be looking at is called map three-coloring. Okay, so here we have a map. Okay. And these are a bunch of countries. And we've arranged them so that no countries that have the same color share a border. That's what makes a map like this validly colored. And now you might think, well, why should we care? It turns out that whether or not a map can be three-colored in this way is an example of an NP-complete problem. And it turns out that, you know, maybe what you really wanna do, is you wanna give a zero-knowledge proof that you have at least 0.3 Bitcoins, right? That would be cool.\nExplainee: Yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","331":"Explainer: Without revealing what the address is of your account. It turns out I can take that statement that I have at least 0.2 Bitcoins, and convert it into a map of countries. And that map of countries will be three-colorable like this only if you have at least 0.2 Bitcoins.\nExplainee: How would we turn something like this into a zero-knowledge proof?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","332":"Explainer: Right? So you have a little bit of confidence, right, that I have managed to color this correctly. but not that much confidence. 'Cause I've only shown you two of the countries.\nExplainee: Yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","333":"Explainer: Nice. And that's smart of you to check with the same one of the ones you already had. Right?\nExplainee: Mm-hmm.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","334":"Explainer: You would use encryption. Right. But it's really, this is the protocol.\nExplainee: So what are the broader implications of like, zero-knowledge proofs. Are they supposed to be like, more practical for like, implementation, and or, are they supposed to like, structurally prove something?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","335":"Explainer: Right.\nExplainee: And it's implementations?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","336":"Explainer: It can be generative for sure.\nExplainee: It's definitely a really interesting thing to try to talk to students about.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","337":"Explainer: I'll grant you that Hilbert's Hotel does not exist. For me, infinite objects absolutely exist. And I can't read the thoughts in your head, but I have a high degree of confidence that we have a lot of the same ideas about infinity.\nExplainee: It's this idea that are things that you can think of, do they exist? You're getting into philosophy of math now. It's just exciting.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","338":"Explainer: So on your trip what was the funnest day ever?\nExplainee: There was this pool, I love pools. And then there's a slide you go down and there's pool noodles in there too. And then there's a little tiny sandbox.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","339":"Explainer: Do you remember from that day what color towel you used when you got out of the pool?\nExplainee: I think the one I used was a dark blue or a light blue or, or like sort of a teal.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","340":"Explainer: When you were telling me about the sandbox, it felt like you didn't have to make that guess, that you could just see the sandbox in your eyes. I asked you about the towel. It doesn't come to mind immediately, but you can stop and think about it and kind of make a good guess because there are things you know about the world. And for those of us who study memory that's a really strong hint as to how memory works. And so for you your memory kept all the fun stuff and all the stuff that was important to you, but the details like did you have to have a ticket to get in or how you got there, all these other less interesting, less exciting aspects, your brain kind of decided letting go of all that information.\nExplainee: I think as you get older you start forgetting things more because you have to make space for new things, which is why you forget stuff.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","341":"Explainer: Yeah, that's a great insight. Basically we can't remember everything. So when you tell us this memory of that vacation and your brain is able to kind of play almost this movie of a memory, a moment, a day that you had in your life a while ago, where do those memories come from?\nExplainee: I do know that there's different parts of the brain. So there's probably a part of your brain that remembers a bunch of stuff.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","342":"Explainer: The hippocampus is a part of your brain that if you kind of took it out and looked at it, it looks a lot like a seahorse and it plays a really important role in creating those kinds of memories that help you two years after your vacation share with me what happened that day, all these details of that day. There's another part of the brain. It's actually also important for memory and it's called the amygdala and it is important for keeping all the kind of emotional processing going for memory. So memory for things that are really scary, it's gonna talk to the hippocampus now and get that memory to be really strong. Why do you think it might be important to remember scary things?\nExplainee: Let's say you, you accidentally cut yourself. Then your brain makes a note and says don't get too close to sharp things, or you're going to cut yourself again.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","343":"Explainer: Yeah, so if you look at kind of the wrinkly surface of an asteroid, each one of those little wrinkles adds a little bit to the surface area. And so it's really hard to say, what is the area of an asteroid? Let's take a look at a little example of where fractals actually show up in nature. What we're gonna try to do is we're gonna try to say what the length of the coastline of great Britain is. So we're gonna start out with the blue ones, which are spaced further apart. We're gonna ask you to connect the blue pins with a piece of string so we can get a measurement of the coastline. So we have our first measurement of the length of the coastline, and we're gonna do it over again. But this time we're gonna use the white pins, which are spaced closer together. So we measured the coastline again. And what do you think happens?\nExplainee: There's more in and out. Therefore probably takes more string for this one.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","344":"Explainer: I think I agree with you, but I think to really validate our scientific experiment, we should probably compare the length of the string. A lot of extra slack in that pig of string. So what we noticed with great Britain is we were never able to measure it's length. It just kept getting longer and longer. This is called the coastline paradox where there's not really one definite number you can assign to the length of the coastline, but it depends on how you measure it. Like if we kept going to really get this to be accurate, we might have to like actually go down the beach and start measuring these tiny little details along the coastline. But really there's so much detail. We would probably never get a definite answer for how long the coastline is. Fractals also give us a really nice language. We're talking about how smooth or rough some kind of shape is. And actually a lot of people, engineers and scientists use this idea of fractals and this language of fractals to compare different shapes, not in terms of their size, but in terms of their roughness. So based on everything we talked about today, how would you describe a fractal to somebody in your own words?\nExplainee: It's a shape, that you can't describe as a shape.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","345":"Explainer: What's your name?\nExplainee: Namina.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","346":"Explainer: Mm-hmm.\nExplainee: Yeah, and touch.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","347":"Explainer: But with the magnifying glass, you'd only be able to see what's right near the surface, right? Just.\nExplainee: Yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","348":"Explainer: That's exactly the type of thing that we're doing. We are sensing, is we're trying to measure what's inside, and do it without destroying the ball.\nExplainee: Yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","349":"Explainer: Yeah, I started out doing magnetic resonance, studying things like bone and biomedical magnetic resonance. Ended up playing with spins for a long time and the physics of spins just fascinated me.\nExplainee: So what do you think is a big difference between imaging large biological objects versus sensing very small quantum objects, I guess?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","350":"Explainer: So it's because the nitrogen-vacancy center is a single defect. So you can actually see a single electron. In normal magnetic resonance, you don't have the sensitivity.\nExplainee: In order to be sensitive to like a single electron, do you have to be really close to it?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","351":"Explainer: I think as you said, you know, anything that interferes with my signal is noise, but it can come from different sources. In some ways, the operation of the quantum system itself, as it's sensitive to different physical phenomena, the ones that I don't like, I call noise. The ones I do like, I call signal and that's an artificial definition that I'm making when I choose to build a sensor. One of the challenges we have is, we're trying to figure out if I wanna control it, where is it coming from? I remember we had experiments running in our lab one day and we were running these experiments about 100 megahertz. All of a sudden, we saw these big spikes coming in and we realized we're picking up the local FM stations.\nExplainee: Oh, yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","352":"Explainer: And that was a source of noise, like, it's completely random, but it is still there. And then the other form is very much what is intrinsically within your experiment itself because some of the materials that you have have defects that are coupling into your sensor, into your quantum system and are also producing noise.\nExplainee: But yeah, the interesting stuff really is where you're picking up the quantum noise intrinsically from whatever.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","353":"Explainer: Right.\nExplainee: Maybe they should be using elements of quantum computation. So I don't have a strong view on it, but I do think it's an interesting question.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","354":"Explainer: Yeah.\nExplainee: And that I think is gonna make real breakthroughs in the next 10 years, is the fact that we're just having this much larger group of scientists.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","355":"Explainer: so steve tell me about your research and the work you've been doing in quantum computing\nExplainee: I'm a theoretical physicist. I started out in condensed matter theory, the theory that studies superconductors and magnets and I had to learn a new field of quantum optics and apply those ideas. One of the nice things about being a theorist Is you get to keep learning new things.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","356":"Explainer: common myth how many qubits do you have that's the only thing that matters like just add more qubits what's the big deal pattern them on your chip\nExplainee: I was asking a computer scientist recently where to read about fault tolerance in classical computing. He said oh they don't teach that in computer science classes anymore because the hardware has become so reliable. In a quantum system, when you look at it or make measurements, it can change in a way that's beyond your control. We have the following task, build a nearly perfect computer out of a whole bunch of imperfect parts.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","357":"Explainer: one last myth i think we should bust steve quantum computers are on the verge of breaking into your bank account and breaking encryption and creative cryptography\nExplainee: (laughing) Right, in the next five years there'll be tremendous progress in the field but people really have to understand that we're either at the vacuum tube or transistor stage. We're trying to invent the integrated circuit and scale up. It's still very very very early in the development of the field.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","358":"Explainer: What happens in Minecraft if you get really, really close to a shape?\nExplainee: Well, it just looks like a block.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","359":"Explainer: Yeah it looks really blocky. And it's the same thing not only with shapes and games, but also colors and textures. And this is an especially a big problem in virtual reality because you have no control over where people are gonna go. What they're gonna look at, how close they're gonna get to various objects. So fractals on the other hand are these things that have infinitely, you know, nice details you get closer and closer and closer. And so this is something that can help us solve this problem in computer graphics of generating more detail. One of the reasons why fractals are really nice for computer graphics is because the algorithms that we use to draw images also have this kind of recursive flavor. What's recursion?\nExplainee: Recursion is a function that uses itself or calls itself in it's definition. And basically with that, you can figure out minute details such as searching for a value in a binary tree. It's kind of like iterating through itself, but it's often more sophisticated in that it's easier to write.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","360":"Explainer: They're easy for a computer to execute, right? It just has to run this recursive procedure over and over and over again. We can kind of get as much detail as we want or need. When I think about fractals and kind of what they've done for computer graphics. The example I think is subdivision surfaces. Did you, did you encounter subdivision surfaces in your graphics class at all?\nExplainee: The name doesn't really ring a bell.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","361":"Explainer: So subdivision surface is a way of describing a smooth shape on a computer rather than some complicated fractal shape. So meshes and computer graphics are usually made of these flat polygons with kind of sharp edges. And so the question is how can I get something nice and round and smooth out of these sharp looking polygons? What I can do is I can start cutting one at a time, the corners of this paper off, it still looks very angular. I still have these really sharp points.\nExplainee: Right why are we doing this?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","362":"Explainer: Because I want to draw a smooth curve on the screen, but all my computer can do is draw straight lines. And that's actually too true of GPUs. It's kind of interesting. GPUs are basically really fast machines that can only draw one thing and that's a flat triangle. And so if we keep doing this with our paper, you kind of get pretty quickly the idea of what's gonna happen. So when you go to see a Pixar movie, for instance, every surface has been subdivided down. So you have tiny little triangles called micro polygons that are even smaller than the size of a pixel.\nExplainee: How long does this process take?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","363":"Explainer: Well, because people who really need to use these subdivision services for everything, people who worked hard over the years to make this super, super fast. In fact, subdivision services were invented basically at Pixar. There's this guy, Ed Capel, and he was harshly responsible for one of the most famous kinds of subdivision surfaces called Capel Clark subdivision surfaces. And in fact recently won the touring award for these subdivision services.\nExplainee: What do you think are the current shortcomings in, I guess applying fractals to computer science right now, what are, what is the cutting edge?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","364":"Explainer: I wanted to ask you a little bit about what you know about the history of the internet. Have you heard of ARPANET, for example?\nExplainee: I have not heard of ARPANET.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","365":"Explainer: Okay, back into the 1960s, there was a research agency in the United States called DARPA, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency. Actually, it was called ARPA at the time. They wanted to build this notion of a packet-switching network. Not a circuit switch network like a phone network where you get a dedicated path and a dedicated set of bandwidth and links from source to destination.\nExplainee: So what would packet switching enable? I'm sure there's something big here, for sure.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","366":"Explainer: There's a lot big, right? And so remember, this was a Department of Defense, was they wanted to have forms of of communication that were very robust, that were survivable. Packets could all find their own ways, be routed differently through the network. So if parts of the network failed, you could route around failures.\nExplainee: Sounds like the reason for like a request response type of structure.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","367":"Explainer: Ah ha! Spoken like a real computer scientist, right? You're a computer scientist. I'm a computer scientist. We talk about APIs, application programming interfaces. The API for the internet is something called a socket. And a socket simply says, I can communicate if I know your internet address, you know, 128.119.40.186, that number is the IP address of my server, the University of Massachusetts. If you know that, you can write a program anywhere in the world and send a message, and it'll pop out at my end.\nExplainee: I will be remembering that. [Jim laughs] I've heard that there are like seven keys to the internet, something like that.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","368":"Explainer: Okay. What does that mean?\nExplainee: No one authority holds control over any sort of decisions or destinations.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","369":"Explainer: That's 98% true. And if you own a network, like you're att.com, or your verizon.com, you can do, within that network, you can do what you want, right? So in that sense, the internet is very decentralized, that the control of the network is up to whoever owns the network. The 2% where you said there's nobody in control, there's a little bit of centralized control. There's an organization called the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers. Its responsibility is to handle, as the name ICANN suggests, names and numbers. It's that little bit of centralization, central authority that you need.\nExplainee: When can we see the next tenfold increase in in Wi-Fi speed?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","370":"Explainer: Where do they get dropped, do you think?\nExplainee: Somewhere in their travel process.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","371":"Explainer: Cool. What do you think of when you hear the words quantum sensing?\nExplainee: I think that using some sort of quantum computing to sense some quantum level molecules or particles, like interactions and stuff, maybe.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","372":"Explainer: Which is a really nice platform because the spins show their quantum properties, even at room temperature.\nExplainee: So, are you studying the spins of the electrons?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","373":"Explainer: Right.\nExplainee: So how long does it take to make a sensor and to make that diamond? Is that created? Do you like, put energy into it or?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","374":"Explainer: So you can implant nitrogen into a diamond and then you bombard it with electrons to create the vacancies and then you heat it up and anneal it, and then you get these nitrogen-vacancy centers in your system. So you mentioned quantum computing earlier. So have you heard of the idea of superposition?\nExplainee: Mm-hmm, yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","375":"Explainer: So that's in some ways the key to both quantum sensing, as well as quantum computing. It's the idea that you can take a system and put it in a superposition of two states. Normally we think of classically a bit can be a zero or a one. So switch is either on or off. Whereas in a quantum system, it can be in what's called a superposition. So it can be partially on and partially off. But one of the challenges with quantum systems is that these superpositions are really hard to maintain because we don't see superpositions in the world around us. In quantum computing, you try really hard to isolate everything so that you can maintain this quantum property and the fact that it's actually going to lose its quantum properties as it interacts with the world also makes it a great sensor because now you're actually, you're using that fact that it's interacting with the world to say, wait, it's sensing something.\nExplainee: Okay, so it's like using like, the quantum computer would be kind of like the base level and then like you take it out into the world and see how like it differs?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","376":"Explainer: So rather than trying to build a lot of complex algorithms and gates with it, what you do is, you take these quantum bits and you take them out into the world and say, what do you see? What are you sensitive to? So you can use an idea called entanglement to make an even more sensitive quantum sensor, but it's even more fragile. So there's always this trade-off between being super fragile and being super sensitive at the same time.\nExplainee: How does entanglement work into it?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","377":"Explainer: It's more precise, Absolutely.\nExplainee: Okay. Is an atomic clock a quantum sensor?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","378":"Explainer: In some ways, it is and you know, atomic clocks are remarkable devices and being able to measure time that precisely has really important consequences. In fact, our old GPS system is based on the accuracy of atomic clocks. They're a set of satellites, each of which has an atomic clock on board and they send out a timestamp and so, once it gets a signal from three different satellites, it can triangulate and figure out exactly where you are. Now, if you could make those clocks even more precise, you could actually accurately position where you are even more accurately.\nExplainee: Okay, that's really cool.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","379":"Explainer: Well, we're gonna be talking about computers here today, and we're gonna be talking about the internet. I always like to think of the internet by analogy to say road systems for example, where you have roads in your neighborhood. You have state roads, you have the Interstate Highway System. And so the internet is a lot like that. It's an interconnection of local roads, local networks like the network in your house for example.\nExplainee: How does like all of the networks in my house connect to all the city networks?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","380":"Explainer: We could talk about that by analogy to a road system. It's not just one big, super highway. It's a lot of smaller super highways that are all interconnected. And those interchanges are what are called routers. That's where the links come together. You're talking about talking to a friend in Australia. So oh, it's coming in from the East Coast of the United States to this router, and it's going out say, that routers in San Francisco, it's going out on an underseas cable over to Australia rather than in this direction up to Japan.\nExplainee: So there is an underseas cable?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","381":"Explainer: The underseas cables are so cool! They're these big cables that are laid down by switches. They cross both the Atlantic, the Pacific, the Indian Ocean. So the undersea cables are how the networks in Europe, United States, Asia are all connected together.\nExplainee: How do you connect wirelessly?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","382":"Explainer: That's really what we call the first hop. It's like from your phone, from your tablet, from the computer that you're on, there's no cables coming in. You go over a wireless connection. Wi-Fi is the protocol that allows your computer to talk to that first hop router over a wireless communication link.\nExplainee: And I was wondering how there's so many different movies or TV shows that you can download and they're all there. And if you just play it, it just knows what to play. Like they're all in one spot.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","383":"Explainer: That's the computer science brain thinking right there. So we wanna think of a function as procedure or mapping between sets. So a function defines a one-to-one correspondence if it defines a perfect matching between the elements of its domain set and the elements of its output set. We call such functions bijections or isomorphisms. So the reason I'm so interested in this idea of a bijective function or a one-to-one correspondence that guarantees that every element of one set gets matched with an element of the other set, no matter how many elements there are, these bijections or these one-to-one correspondences as they help mathematicians reason about infinity.\nExplainee: How can you compare something that is endless?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","384":"Explainer: Today we're gonna think about infinity as a cardinality, which is a technical term for a number that could be a size of a set. And we're gonna use this idea of one-to-one correspondence to try and investigate the question of whether all infinite sets have the same size. So what I've drawn here are some pictures of some of the infinite sets that appear in mathematics. So the natural numbers are the prototypical example of an infinite set. So the natural numbers are clearly a subset of the integers. Both of these are infinite sets. Are they the same size infinity or different size infinities?\nExplainee: Yes, the integers would, there'd be more integers than natural numbers.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","385":"Explainer: I'm gonna now try and convince you that they are in fact the same size infinity. And this is using this idea of a one-to-one correspondence which was applied in this context by Georg Cantor. What he says is if we can match up the elements of the integers with the elements of the natural numbers so that there's nothing left over, so that there's a bijective function between them, then that's a proof that there's exactly as many natural numbers as there are integers. Start by matching zero with zero and one with one. But then we wanna include the negatives in the list. So which natural number would we match with negative one?\nExplainee: Maybe two.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","386":"Explainer: Yeah, that's exactly right. And now for each pair of integers, I'm gonna represent it by a corresponding natural number. That's what's going on with this counting. And when I compose those operations, what I've done is I've encoded rational numbers as natural numbers in a way that reveals that they can be no larger, there are no more rational numbers than natural numbers.\nExplainee: So this slope is represented by three, two, and three, two is in here as 25.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","387":"Explainer: Now there's one final collection of numbers that we haven't yet discussed, which are the real numbers, all of the points on the number line. Do you think that's the same size infinity?\nExplainee: I guess again, intuition seems like it must be much larger, but I don't know, I haven't been on a roll.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","388":"Explainer: Georg Cantor proved that it is impossible to count all real numbers like we've just counted the rational numbers or just counted the integers. This is called the cardinality of the continuum, it is uncountable. What I'm going to do now is form a new real number that I guarantee is not on this list. Okay, so here's how we do this. What I'm gonna do is I'm gonna look at the diagonal elements. So I'll highlight them. This continues forever, and now I'm going to form a new real number by changing all of these.\nExplainee: If you just like added one to them, then that would be something that doesn't exist in any of the other ones.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","389":"Explainer: Yes. You see the idea right away. So I'm gonna form a new real number whose first digit is different from this one. And you've already convinced yourself that this number is not on this list anywhere. Why is that?\nExplainee: Because at every point there's at least one change from a number in there.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","390":"Explainer: Great. That's exactly right. So what we've proven is that this number is missing, and therefore it is impossible to define a bijection between the natural numbers and the real numbers.\nExplainee: Oh wow.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","391":"Explainer: So we've started to explore some of the counterintuitive properties of infinity. On the one hand there are infinite sets that feel very different like the natural numbers, the integers, the rational numbers that nevertheless have the same size or the same infinite cardinality. While there are other infinities that are larger. So there's more than one size of infinity, not all infinities are created equal.\nExplainee: I was wondering what the kind of practical implications are, what you can do with this sort of knowledge.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","392":"Explainer: is it some sort of conjecture circuit that is a really good guess there's parts of that that are definitely about conducting this is the inside of a quantum computer\nExplainee: Oh wow.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","393":"Explainer: so that's pretty good so you mentioned superposition but you can also use other quantum properties like entanglement have you heard of entanglement\nExplainee: I have not.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","394":"Explainer: so you can have constructive interference and you can have destructive interference we have constructive interference you have amplitudes wave amplitudes that add until the signal gets larger and if you have destructive interference the amplitudes cancel by using a property like interference we can control quantum states and amplify the kinds of signals that are towards the right answer and then cancel the types of signals that are leading to the wrong answer so given that you know that we're trying to use superposition entanglement and interference for computation how do you think we build these computers\nExplainee: They read like ambient wavelengths and then produce like the opposite one to cancel out.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","395":"Explainer: so step one is you need to be able to have an object or physical device we call it a qubit or quantum bit that can actually handle those things can actually be put into superpositions of states you know two cubit states that you can physically entangle with each other that's not really trivial right and things in our classical world you can't really entangle things in our classical world so easily we need to use devices where they can they can support a quantum state and we can manipulate that quantum state atoms ions and in our case superconducting qubits we make qubits out of superconducting materials\nExplainee: I have no idea.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","396":"Explainer: it's a perfect question i mean it's very early for quantum computing but we're building assembly languages we're building layers of abstraction that are going to get you to a point as a programmer where you can interchangeably be programming something the way that you already do and then make calls to a quantum computer so that you can bring it in when it makes sense we're not envisioning quantum computers completely replacing classical computers anytime soon we think that quantum computing is going to be used to accelerate the kinds of things that are really hard for for classical machines\nExplainee: But as like a programmer, how would quantum computing affect a different way of writing a program?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","397":"Explainer: I wanted to ask you if you have ever heard of a black hole?\nExplainee: Jude.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","398":"Explainer: Here, let me show you something. I can ask how heavy it is.\nExplainee: It's not weight, but it's how much of it is in it.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","399":"Explainer: I can also ask how big it is, which is a question about its volume. If I make it smaller, then what's happening is it's becoming more dense. So imagine I crushed this really, really small. It would weigh the same, it would have the same mass, but it would be much more dense.\nExplainee: Yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","400":"Explainer: If a star is heavy enough to explode into supernova what's left begins to collapse under its own weight. And if that's heavy enough, the core will not be able to stop collapsing, 'cause it no longer has the thermonuclear fuel, it's run outta fuel. And if it's run outta fuel, it's no longer shining and pushing outward. And without that it itself begins to go dark and there's nothing fighting the collapse anymore. And that's when you form a black hole.\nExplainee: How does it go that small?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","401":"Explainer: So it goes so fast that it goes completely dark. Any light that veers too close will fall in, will not be able to make it back out again. If a light is shining from the sun near a black hole, the black hole's not touching it. Why does the light get pulled in? Why does that happen?\nExplainee: So it goes so fast that there's it's all dark?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","402":"Explainer: It is taking other stuff, but the funny question was like, if I wanted to move your chair, you'd think it was really strange if I didn't have to come near you and actually grab the chair and move it. One of the things Einstein thought about is he imagined that what the black hole is doing is it's changing the shape of space around it. What do you think of that idea?\nExplainee: Because the black hole is taking other stuff?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","403":"Explainer: Does infinity come up in your mathematics that you're studying?\nExplainee: One place infinity comes up is in algebraic geometry. Normally we think okay, well if you have two lines like this, you'd keep drawing them, they intersect right here. But in projective space, two parallel lines will also intersect at the point at infinity. Infinity is like this perfect concept for what we can add to a space that allows lines to have this more uniform property. What's your research in?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","404":"Explainer: And a choice function does what exactly?\nExplainee: Yeah, that's a good question.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","405":"Explainer: So the way I think about it is if you have an infinite or an arbitrary family of sets and you know for sure that none of these sets are empty, then a choice function would allow you to select an element from each set sort of all at once. When you've used the axiom of choice in proofs, do you know which incarnation of this you've used?\nExplainee: Yeah, I've used it like that. I've also used it in Zorn's lemma and in the well ordering principle.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","406":"Explainer: That you don't want the complexity of managing them to go up linearly with that. You'd like it to still stay pretty flat as you start adding.\nExplainee: Right, exactly. I mean, the good thing about IoT devices is that they tend to transmit very, very small amounts of data.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","407":"Explainer: We're used to ethernet cables that can handle many hundreds of gigabits per second over a wired device. What are the typical data rates for IoT devices? I mean, not hundreds of gigabits.\nExplainee: No, I mean I would imagine upper bound, KB per second, lower bound, you could see bytes per second just on average. But I mean, say that you have a temperature sensor running off of your Arduino that's reporting the temperature in your house every minute. That's going to be far less than kilobytes per second on average.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","408":"Explainer: Do you think they'll share it?\nExplainee: Not without some persuasion, but I agree that these data have massive, massive research value. Something I'm interested in with my research is collaborating with people who manage these distributed sensor devices, and then taking advantage of those datasets and comparing them to, say you were interested in doing a research project on how daily rush hour traffic impacts the acoustic landscape of New York City. Figuring out, look, this street next to this school is causing visible ratings above what we mandate. And so there needs to be an intervention here.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","409":"Explainer: [Amit] Right.\nExplainee: So what's your take on why knowledge is, rather than information, or zero-data proof. Clearly, there's data there. So can't be zero-data.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","410":"Explainer: being something that you can already predict. Right.\nExplainee: Mm-hmm.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","411":"Explainer: Right.\nExplainee: So that data then immediately imply, a knowledge. But people can't, sometimes.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","412":"Explainer: Yeah. This concept of zero-knowledge programs would allow you to carry out completely arbitrary computations\nExplainee: Mm-hmm.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","413":"Explainer: Indeed.\nExplainee: general knowledge of proof in the ledger.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","414":"Explainer: And I think that's a sign. That's a sign that our baby has grown up and, you know, it's time for it to be developed.\nExplainee: I think, profoundly, the students often also ask me, what are the future direction, both in terms of crypto, zero-knowledge proof, in the real world and how mathematical you see in computing.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","415":"Explainer: Does the Large Magellanic Cloud have a big black hole?\nExplainee: I'm a second year. So I'm measuring star formation histories in the Small and Large Magellanic Clouds.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","416":"Explainer: Yeah, and probably nobody is. Have you heard a lot in your studies about these super massive black holes that we think lurk in the centers of very nearly every galaxy?\nExplainee: So, I think the prevailing wisdom for a while was no, but my answer honestly is I'm not sure.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","417":"Explainer: [Janna] Yeah.\nExplainee: We spend all of our time, when we learn about black holes in school, predominantly through star collapse.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","418":"Explainer: Yes, they're all friends.\nExplainee: Gravitationally, all friends.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","419":"Explainer: But when we do merge with Andromeda, presumably our black holes will merge and Andromeda indeed has a very big black hole as well at its center. And then we'll have this just gigantic-\nExplainee: And Andromeda is one of the few galaxies that is traveling towards us and do for a merger event at some point. So given a sufficiently low velocity, we would just have two big galaxies that, for the most part, pass through each other, pass by each other. But given a sufficiently high velocity, we will have some crazy black hole interactions and some crazy star interactions.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","420":"Explainer: Yeah, and it's very possible that as you said, the collision won't be so severe that it'll be very disruptive. So our entire solar system could stay intact and here we would go with the sun and all the other planets in orbit around a new black hole.\nExplainee: Supermassive black hole.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","421":"Explainer: It's a great question. I once did a calculation of using a black hole made out of the moon and the strongest magnet we could find on Earth to see if I could make an electronic battery. And honestly, you only get about enough energy to power New York City. But we have to find one in our neighborhood first.\nExplainee: You know, I know that at a certain point for our civilization to become sufficiently advanced, to travel the cosmos beyond, you know, the moon or Mars, we may have to be able to harness the power of our sun. Would it be similarly possible to harness the power of a black hole like you were mentioning, to travel?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","422":"Explainer: and actually machine learning is one research direction where we're really hoping that we're going to find um key parts of the machine learning computation that can be sped up using quantum computing\nExplainee: Sure, yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","423":"Explainer: if you think about even just classical information like bits right at the end of the day when you store a bit in your hard drive there's a magnetic domain and you have a magnetic polarization right\nExplainee: So in a classical computer, you know, you have all sorts of logical gates that perform operations and they change an input to some sort of output but I guess it's not immediately obvious how you do that with quantum computers.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","424":"Explainer: the key is to come up with algorithms where the result is deterministic\nExplainee: Okay.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","425":"Explainer: What are some of the challenges that you've run into when trying to work with robots and do these tasks?\nExplainee: So, I was really interested in the problem of scooping peas on a plate. They're relatively homogenous, but when it came to more complex foods, like broccoli, or deformable foods, like tofu, that can crumble, that gets a lot more complex to simulate.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","426":"Explainer: How can we get robots to learn more efficiently or learn faster?\nExplainee: From my experience, it's a matter of how much support you give the, like, robot when it's learning. One could be like a narrower task range. Another is maybe like also biasing the types of samples that you're collecting can bias towards interactions that are gonna be useful where the hands actually interact with each other, rather than just off doing their own things. What have you found to be like your go-tos between the different styles?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","427":"Explainer: Yeah. So you may not transfer the exact strategy or the exact policy that the robot takes, but you should be able to learn some general heuristics about performing manipulation.\nExplainee: There's this gap between the simulators that we have now and what we actually experience in reality. So what do you think are promising directions to try out for actually making our simulations match reality more closely?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","428":"Explainer: Have you heard of fractals before?\nExplainee: No, absolutely not.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","429":"Explainer: So somehow they have to explain to the computer what a tree looks like so that the computer can draw the tree for them.\nExplainee: Yes.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","430":"Explainer: It almost looks like that branch that you broke off is itself another tree. So our rule is that every branch splits into two smaller branches.\nExplainee: Okay.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","431":"Explainer: So your tree is totally beautiful, but it took a long time to make, right. How would you feel if I said, now you have to make a thousand of those trees.\nExplainee: I'd be like, oh my that's a lot of work.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","432":"Explainer: On a computer if you wanna learn to draw fractals, then you might need to learn a little bit about programming. [Keenan] Programming. Yeah.\nExplainee:  Programming.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","433":"Explainer: So hey, Jen, it's great to see you again.\nExplainee: Good to see you, Jim.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","434":"Explainer: And certainly, we've heard about some countries that impose firewalls that don't let certain kinds of traffic out, or certain kinds of traffic in. So there's no global body that is regulating that?\nExplainee: Not really because each country really can have it's own laws and its own norms. And so they can decide, like the Great Firewall of China can decide, they don't wanna let certain content be accessed by the citizens inside that country. So if a country decides they don't wanna answer a request for a particular domain name, they say, Hey, I don't want to let someone know the IP address of this website. They can decide not to let those answers be delivered inside their country. And so encryption plays a role in helping people keep their privacy or prevent surveillance, but it's not perfect. It's often possible, still, to know a fair amount about what people are doing, even if you can't look inside the envelope at the letter that's written.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","435":"Explainer: So you can infer or guess a lot of things.\nExplainee: Exactly.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","436":"Explainer: So you want the computation close to where the endpoint is.\nExplainee: Exactly, and I think that what's now exciting about that is all three of these technologies, wireless, networking and cloud, which are normally three different communities, three different sets of technologies, three different sets of standards or practices, now have to work together in close harmony to be able to service applications that are really critical and that that might be interacting with the physical world in ways where safety is a potential concern.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","437":"Explainer: You know, we've had cellular networks now for 20, 30 years. So when we hear about 5G, what's trumpeted the most is the fact that oh, super high bandwidth, right? But I sense that the exciting things are more than just the network being faster.\nExplainee: I agree. It's both the high bandwidth, it's the low delay so that you can have these applications that interact with the physical world and need answers in real-time. It's about having the compute really close so that you can integrate computation and communication. It's about having more coverage.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","438":"Explainer: What is your impression of what a black hole is?\nExplainee: I'm a senior at NYU. I'm studying physics and environmental studies.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","439":"Explainer: It turns out that there are only three quantities that define a black hole, its electric charge, its mass, and its spin. So the most general black hole can also spin and it can also be electrically charged. Whether or not they are has to do with how they formed. If a star collapses, it will likely be spinning when it collapses and the remnant black hole that formsbwill likely be spinning. A black hole of a certain mass, charge, and spin is indistinguishable from any other black hole with those same properties. So in some sense, they're like fundamental particles, which makes them absolutely exceptional for any other astrophysical object. Have you heard the stories about what happens inside a black hole?\nExplainee: I've heard of Schwarzschild black holes, which is a black hole that is static, a Kerr black hole or a Kerr-Newman black hole, which is a black hole that rotates, but what makes a black hole static versus rotating? And what's more common?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","440":"Explainer: So the singularity is definitely predicted in Einstein's general theory of relativity and that's purely a theory of spacetime. And in the theory of spacetime, there is no question that a singularity would form when the star collapses catastrophically inside the black hole. Now, even when people talked about singularities back in the '60s, they thought, you know, quantum mechanics is part of the story of the whole of physics. It's not just gravity. And if we understand quantum gravity we'll realize that singularity probably doesn't ever actually form.\nExplainee: I sort of know what a singularity is. I think of it as something where everything is compacted into one single point, it's a place where the laws of physics don't exactly work out. What did you mean when you said that you don't think the singularity really exists?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","441":"Explainer: I would say to some extent we don't know for sure. What we have found is that the mathematics is so unbelievably powerful that we're able to disprove wrong ideas just in pen and paper. Just very recently, within the past couple of years, the first ever human-procured image of a black hole showed us what we expected to see of the event horizon. So Jayda, after our conversation today, what would you say a black hole is?\nExplainee: So since we obviously have never been to a black hole, how do we know for sure, like, what happens after you cross the event horizon or what happens inside a black hole? Is it just like, inferred from the math?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","442":"Explainer: Now, to be clear, nobody disputes that black holes will quantum radiate, that Hawking radiation is a solid prediction. The black holes should in fact evaporate, that's not disputed, right?\nExplainee: That's right. It would be wonderful if we could have some experimental of evidence for this, if we could really build a black hole in the lab and test to see whether it behaves this way. But I think there is hope that we'll be able to detect some of these effects either indirectly, by looking at black holes out in the universe, or also maybe indirectly in the laboratory by looking at systems which aren't black holes, but which radiate in kind of similar ways.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","443":"Explainer: Do you think there's ever a hope that the kind of information that you think about, the quantum gravity aspects of the universe that you think about, whether it will pan out or not, will ever be viably observed in these astronomical pursuits of the event horizon?\nExplainee: It's a real challenge, but astronomical observations have gotten so fantastically precise. And there is some hope that if you looked at things like two black holes merging, each black hole comes in with its own event horizon, but then when the black holes merge, there's a very complicated process where these two event horizons merge and oscillate and vibrate, and then settle down into a single event horizon for the final black hole. There is some hope that if we can make sufficiently detailed observations of this process, if we could really see the way the event horizon is behaving as it settles down to this final state, that maybe that could reveal some of these quantum effects that we've been talking about.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","444":"Explainer: Indeed.\nExplainee: But once you flip that on its head and you're no longer trying to do that, suddenly all of the bad properties of randomness become good.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","445":"Explainer: No doubt. And especially with cloud computing, exploiting the power of the cloud to enable zero-knowledge proofs, and to make use of zero-knowledge proofs, would be amazing.\nExplainee: Yeah. Absolutely.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","446":"Explainer: What do you know about memory?\nExplainee: I know when you see something you could like kind of like picture it, like in your head you can imagine it. I remember yesterday I got like orange juice, but let's say like a year or two, you might think like, oh, that day I got water.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","447":"Explainer: There you go, there is your decision. Okay, you can take those. It took you some time there. You looked like you were really working hard at that problem. And that's interesting because actually we know that from research that when people have to make a decision between two things they like equally, some people like economists think oh those are the easiest decisions because they're both good options. But as psychologists and neuroscientists we know it's the opposite. One of the reasons is because there's no simple answer of like I know that one's better I'm just gonna go with it. And so we think that that's the kind of decision where memory is especially important because you have to kind of come up with more information.\nExplainee: Exactly, and then also like after it was like, maybe like I would've, enjoyed this more than that and like maybe I should've chose the other one. And you don't know.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","448":"Explainer: Everything you just said is exactly what we know from research. All the thoughts running through your mind, were really at kind of about a prediction into the future, right? You're like, how, how will this taste if, when it's in my mouth or how will I feel about my decision down the road? You know we think of memory as something in the past, but it's an example of how you use your memories of these two candies to predict what's gonna happen in the future so that you can make a decision in the present. But you did it, you made your way through that torture. And now you've got to keep the candy.\nExplainee: Am I always gonna like choose pixie sticks or sour patch kids? What's gonna like change that?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","449":"Explainer: What's your conception about what the internet is?\nExplainee: The internet? For me, it's just something to use when I need like to search up something or watch videos.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","450":"Explainer: Got a favorite movie?\nExplainee: Matilda.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","451":"Explainer: Let's say we want to get a video from here, over to here. How do you think that video would sort of travel through this network?\nExplainee: Maybe it could go to here, to here, to here, to here.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","452":"Explainer: That's right. So that's pretty cool. There are actually lots of different ways to actually go through the internet to get from what we call a source, the place that's sending the information, to the receiver, the place that's actually gathering the information together. And that's something we actually call routing.\nExplainee: Huh, but wouldn't it just be easier for it to go from here to here, instead of going from here to here, to here to here?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","453":"Explainer: Yeah. So that's a really good observation. In most pieces of the internet, that's exactly what would happen. We want to take what's called a shortest path. But still, there are multiple paths. And why do you think that might be valuable?\nExplainee: Maybe one way is messed up or broken. So you go the other way.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","454":"Explainer: Lettuce.\nExplainee: Lettuce who?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","455":"Explainer: It'd be great to just start by talking about your work at the broadest level. To my mind your work has really revolutionized the field of cognitive neuroscience more broadly.\nExplainee: I've been really interested in how past understandings of the brain have really focused on, on pinpointing exactly what each piece of the brain does. But I think that there's also a broader conversation happening in the brain, which is between one region and another. So it's actually the pattern of connections between these regions that would allow for the flow of information. But I think the tools that have become widely available now from the physics community and mathematics and computer science are under the umbrella of, of network science. So that is a science of networks, a science of understanding how bits of a system are interconnected with one another. Not just comparing two groups of people or two kinds of two species, but we can ask even within a single person, how does the pattern of connectivity in my brain change as we talk with one another? How does the information flow change? I think a lot about traffic on roadway networks as a good example of this. Which is, you know, we can understand where the roads are and perhaps the roads are relatively fixed. They change over long timescales and it's similar to the brain. We really only create large scale connections over long timescales. But we can alter the traffic on the roadways really easily. And that's similar to what we do in the brain is that we change the way that information is flowing to allow us to respond to our environment.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","456":"Explainer: It's a great analogy. You know I remember when I first learned of your work, for me as somebody who studies learning and memory, which are processes that are all about rapid updating that to me was really mind blowing that we can now start asking questions about dynamics of circuits on a timescale that's much closer to the timescale of human thought than anything we had before.\nExplainee: The field is definitely opening up in the kinds of questions that can be asked now with these approaches. And I think what you're pointing out is that conceptually it's where we wanted to go anyway. So if there's so much orchestration that happens and a symphony is not a single piece, it's not a single pattern of, of harmony between instruments and, and similar to the brain, symphony of your brain is not a single pattern. It's a very dynamically changing pattern.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","457":"Explainer: In the field we often talk of have having a mental model that we use to make predictions about what's about to happen and really use that to mean kind of a general understanding of what's going on. What does that look like in terms that come from your world of like the configuration of, of a circuit?\nExplainee: I think this is the most exciting area of memory research right now I think, which is how people build and remember, you know, and keep with them models of the world over long periods of time. When I think about a mental model, I think about ideas, potential outcomes, potential events, potential actions, and how they all depend on one another. So when we predict what will happen next it would be, I am currently sitting at this piece of the network and I know that there are, there are these possible outcomes. And so I have to get ready for those, you know, four possible outcomes. But that brings this interesting question to the fore, I think which is how does a network system in our mind and our brain create a network model of the world outside? It's almost like there's a reflection in the structure of what's inside in the hardware and what we're building in a very abstract way. And I think that relates to some interesting work that's coming out about the hippocampus too.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","458":"Explainer: Getting way out there, but, but it is a way in which if you have the right model, it should be an efficient one. I'm wondering what you, what you think about what all this means for kind of a redefinition of what memory is, in many ways a revision or expansion of that notion. Would you be willing to try to help me think about how to define it?\nExplainee: I think it's information certainly that, that is stored in the brain and that can then affect our behavior. I think getting your behavior in there somewhere seems, seems important. But also is it just a record of the past or is it, you know, our perceptions of, of what happened in the past, or how we've changed how we think about that past event or have we deleted that event completely and then gathered this higher level structure or mental model that then allows us to behave differently in the future? So it's more alive, it's more changing. It's more, I think it's bubbling out and gathering, gathering and growing and becoming more flexible, but it's also sort of bubbling in, in the sense of deleting and removing and forgetting. So yes, I think that what we need to add perhaps is that changeability and perhaps the behavioral relevance of that changeability. I don't know, what do you think?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","459":"Explainer: So a lot of times stars are born together in two star systems and when they die, if they're heavy enough, they will collapse under their own weight and form a black hole. So here you have a black hole and a big fluffy star. And what will happen is it'll start to tear apart its neighboring star. Literally parts of the star will begin to spill onto the black hole and splatter on the black hole. But let's say both those stars formed black holes. And what these black holes do is they are like mallets on a drum. They create literally waves in the shape of spacetime as they're moving. So imagine mallets on a drum, how the drum ripples. Depending on how the mallets are moving you hear different sounds. So effectively these black holes, as they get very close together in the final stages of their life together, they're orbiting each other at hundreds of times a second. It's this really crazy event, but it's happening in complete darkness. Eventually they bobble together and they merge and then they wring out, the spacetime's going crazy around them, it's this storm in spacetime, and they settle down to a quiet black hole. Then those waves that they created travel through the universe, basically undisturbed. For a long time people thought, well, even if black holes are out there, they're impossible to observe. And then they got very clever. You might wonder how we could possibly hear black holes, that sounds crazy. So I'm gonna show you, but I'm gonna need your help. This demo involves an electric guitar. Do you play at all?\nExplainee: A little bit?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","460":"Explainer: Okay, you wanna do the demo for me? So the LIGO instrument electronically records the ringing of the shape of space with its very complicated instrument. It stands for Laser Interferometric Gravitational-Waves Observatory and the design was incredibly difficult and they didn't know if they would succeed. I think of the instrument as like the body of the electric guitar. And then they take the readout of the motions of the waves that they're recording, just like that guitar is recording the motions of the waves on the string. Now just play it like a little bit. And you can't hear anything, right? You're not meant to hear an electric guitar when it's not plugged in. What's happening is the guitar strings are ringing, but so quietly that we can't actually hear the sound. And this is like the gravitational waves, which are ringing the drum of spacetime, but so quietly that they're not move the air and we're not hearing them. So now play and I'm gonna turn the volume up a little bit. While I can't actually hear the ringing of the strings themselves, I can hear the data of the shape of the string recorded and played through this amplifier. And that's kind of the idea behind the LIGO instrument.\nExplainee: How do you know that it's like the black hole that's making this sound and nothing else?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","461":"Explainer: It's a great question. If I didn't see you playing the guitar, I would recognize the sound of a guitar. And even if I had never heard of a guitar before I could figure out the frequencies that the string was playing, I could tell how strongly it had been plucked, and I could tell the length of it and where it was pinned down from the harmonics of the string. And I can tell the different lengths of the strings from the notes that they play. So I can actually reconstruct the instrument that's playing it. And it's very similar to LIGO, we can listen to the notes, the amplitude, the harmonics, and we can deduce the size and shape of the objects doing that. And they're very massive and they're very small and they have all the markings of a black hole.\nExplainee: Is there anything that like gets affected on Earth because of those waves?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","462":"Explainer: So great to see you, Michael. Thanks for coming.\nExplainee: It's my pleasure.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","463":"Explainer: Why do you think it's so hard to build these things into AI systems and robots?\nExplainee: I guess if you think about a quintessentially human task, like playing chess or solving arithmetic problem, things that other creatures just don't do, when you're a human being, you have to learn that in cultural time. And so there's a limited amount of data you have. But if you're talking about seeing the world interacting with the world, using your effectors properly, that's the combination of this massive amount of evolutionary time. When you look at that, it's like the 56 games of chess I played in chess club that doesn't look like a lot of training data. You work so hard to make a robot, do one particular thing or one class of task, and then seems like people must always come up to you and say, 'So, okay, but what about my other task? Okay. You can fold the sock or stack a cup. How about my dishes?' Is that frustrating? Is that a challenge? Is it interesting?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","464":"Explainer: I think it's interesting. And also a huge challenge. I think that it's interesting that if a person sees a robot doing something that seems very capable, they assume that the robot can do all sorts of other capable things. It's a huge challenge, because that's actually not the case.\nExplainee: When we think about babies on their social cognition, we actually start from the idea that they have a notion of what an agent is. An agent is something that's self-propelled, that has its own internal states, like goals and beliefs. And so, it's very natural to imagine that when you see a seemingly, they call it propulsive, action by a robot, you're thinking, 'Hey, this thing has a desire. It has a goal. It's accomplishing it with its. So what if I give it a different goal? Why couldn't it do that?' They call it promiscuous generalization about agents, right? I think that the electrical outlet looks like a face. I think that my computer's mad at me. And so I think it, the challenge actually is to stop people from doing that, and to recognize limitations where there are some. Or we bring to bear our knowledge, sometimes incredibly quickly, to parse an uncertain image. So our experiences go all the way down to our very first impressions of the sensory signal.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","465":"Explainer: I like that description, because it conveys how much complexity there is to these really basic tasks that we're doing. Is there a definition for the simple tasks that we do versus things that are more complex, like playing chess?\nExplainee: I guess I like to think about this hierarchical cascade, where, at first, vision starts with the sensory signal and parses it into gradually more complex units. I think it does make sense to talk about lower level, meaning closer to sensation and perception and action, and higher level meaning more deliberative, more mediated by memory and language and judgment.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","466":"Explainer: That notion of hierarchy is really interesting, because it is these higher level things, like playing chess, for example, that are easier for AI systems. And the reason why they're easier is that we're providing the abstraction for the system already, then when we give the game of chess to an AI system, we abstract away all the challenges of like picking up pieces and moving them, and we say, 'Okay, there's this board of however many boxes on it.' And you just need to figure out within that very narrow, small world, what to do. But handling and learning what those abstractions should be and handling everything from low level sensory inputs to that higher level processing is really, really hard.\nExplainee: Our impression that it's purely discrete and symbolic might be, just that might be an impression, because we talk about it in a language. And actually, the fact that it's connected up to all these perception and sensation and action systems means that it's probably grounded in a more continuous set of representations. I wonder, is there gonna be a point where what you really want to know is what are the experiences that a human has? [indistinct] human speech own project. His idea was, 'Well, I need the exact data that my son gets in order to train my robot to be like my son.' Or do you think that we're gonna end up in a world that's more like the large language models and that'll have to do?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","467":"Explainer: So what are you studying these days?\nExplainee: Well, I'm preparing my dissertation. The general topic is going to be how we perceive different types of social stimuli, like different people's faces and make judgements about them and how the way that we report on what we are experiencing tells us about what's actually going on inside our heads.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","468":"Explainer: Right, like it reminds me so much of, you know, what we in the field would refer to as statistical learning. On one hand we might have like a one-shot memory, a memory of something that we saw yesterday, like what we did or what we ate or where we were. But a lot of our memories and our knowledge instead are based on many, many, many experiences.\nExplainee: Oh, absolutely. I think this sort of reminds me of another project that I'm doing. It's fairly easy to get different participants to experience consistent negative emotions to the same stimuli, but with positive emotions it's so much harder to study. I might not react the same to like this like cute cat video than someone else. And I definitely believe that people's memory that they're bringing up unconsciously when they're experiencing something to make an emotional judgment informs especially our experience with positive emotion possibly more than negative emotion.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","469":"Explainer: Some of those examples really remind me also some of the questions about kind of abnormalities in, in memory or trauma or disruptions in memory and how they also play out in terms of not just what people remember but what they do with those memories right?\nExplainee: As far as the way that my research plays into it is like the first step in making a judgment about what to do based on an experience we're calling from memory is deciding what your emotional response was.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","470":"Explainer: I think what we're still kind of trying to understand as a field is the more kind of detailed and bigger picture of where does this model live? How does it get updated based on experiences? Why does that sometimes happen and sometimes not? There are actually people who are born without a hippocampus. They have disruptions to episodic memories. They have trouble after this conversation remembering what the conversation was about, but they do have pretty good semantic information. They have a good sense of knowledge about the world. And that's interesting for two reasons. One, it shows this association between the role of the hippocampus and these two forms of memory, episodic memories and semantic memory. The other reason it's interesting is that people often assume that we get to semantic memory through episodic memory, that we encounter one dog and then another dog, and then another dog and then we learned the concept, the semantic notion of a dog. And these people, their profile suggests that you can learn semantic information. You can learn general knowledge about the world, even without ever having the capacity to build those individual memories.\nExplainee: In people with intact brains, you might use a particular process, but if that brain region that subserves that process is damaged, that it's not that you can't do it anymore you just now do it a different way.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","471":"Explainer: Typically you would think that things that are easy for humans, are also easy for robots and computers to do.\nExplainee: Right.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","472":"Explainer: And things that are hard for humans should also be hard for robots and humans to do. But it turns out that it's actually the opposite. I wanna try a little demo.\nExplainee: Okay.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","473":"Explainer: So I have a penny in my hand and I'd like you to pick it up with your right hand and put it into your left hand. So that was pretty easy, right?\nExplainee: Yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","474":"Explainer: We're gonna make this a little bit harder now. So, can you put these on? And we'll try to do the same thing again with your eyes closed. There you go. Let's try that one more time, and see if you can do any better. So close your eyes.\nExplainee: Oh, there we go.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","475":"Explainer: So when a robot tries to do something, like pick up an object, not only do you need to program exactly like what the motors should do, the robot also needs to be able to see where the object is. Then this is what's called a perception action loop in robotics. So if the object moves, the robot can then adapt what it's doing and change what it's doing to successfully pick up the object. It's really important for robots to be able to leverage, not just like the past hour of experience, but also ideally many years of experience, in order to do the kinds of things that you did.\nExplainee: It's kind of hard for me to understand why like robots can do like all these crazy calculations, but they can't do like all the simple stuff, so.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","476":"Explainer: Yeah. It's really unintuitive. In order to survive, we need to pick up objects and everything. Basically many, many, like billions of years of evolution actually created humans and the ability to manipulate objects like that. So, it actually turns out that things that are really basic for us are actually just really complex tasks in general.\nExplainee: So do robots know, like, they messed up? They know.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","477":"Explainer: That's a great question. So in reinforcement learning, the robot tries the task, and then it gets some sort of reinforcement, some sort of feedback. It's similar to how you might train a dog.\nExplainee: Yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","478":"Explainer: We give robots a camera and the camera produces this array of numbers. Basically, each pixel has three different numbers, one for R, for G and for B. And so the robot sees this really massive set of numbers. And it has to be able to figure out, from that massive set of numbers, what is in the world. There is a number of different ways to have the robot see, but we use a technique called neural networks, that tries to take out in those big numbers and form representations of the objects in the world, and where those objects are.\nExplainee: Can a robot ever go off the program?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","479":"Explainer: It depends on how you program the robot. If you program the robot to follow exact motions and follow a very specific program, then it won't go off that program. It will always do those actions. But if something unexpected happens, that the program wasn't designed to handle, then the robot might go off court.\nExplainee: Do you think robots will take over the world? Just being honest.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","480":"Explainer: Yeah for sure.\nExplainee: Just because I was so excited, you know? So that the thing is that it took me maybe 30 minutes. A kid at home who's like 13 and 14 who just starts playing around with a simple computer program can make incredibly beautiful fractals.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","481":"Explainer: Yeah.\nExplainee: And then you get it all.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","482":"Explainer: [Keenan] Right?\nExplainee: And when everybody understands scaling.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","483":"Explainer: Absolutely.\nExplainee: Well, it's also, it's not even possible to explore, to store an entire world in your computer.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","484":"Explainer: So- He made a lot of happy little trees.\nExplainee: I think in that case, it came down to the fact that Ken in particular had a mission to make accessible tools for people without sacrificing the power and the richness of making beautiful things. I mean, in a sense he was kind of the computer graphic, Bob Ross. You know? So- \nExplainer: {missing part}\n","485":"Explainer: So what do you know about infinity?\nExplainee: I think it means that it's really just something that's infinite, that never ends.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","486":"Explainer: That's a great way to think about it. Infinity is something that never ends, where finite, the opposite of infinity, refers to a process or a quantity that we could actually count all the way through, at least in theory if given enough time.

Would they fit in this room?\nExplainee: No.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","488":"Explainer: That's a wonderful question, a very rich question.

It's just not that easy, and so that's why these kinds of interventions can be really unreliable when it comes to improving the quality of your sleep.","4":"Is it that you're skipping certain stages of sleep, or is it that you're just not able to fall asleep as quickly?","5":"and you'd also want to make sure that you're not introducing any kind of sleep deprivation as a variable in the study, right, so you'd want to make sure that participants are well-rested before they come in, and then you'd also want to make sure that they're not sleep-deprived during the study itself, so you'd probably have some kind of monitoring in place to make sure that they're not falling asleep during the study, or at least, you'd want to be aware of that, and maybe even have some kind of plan in place to, you know, if they do start to fall asleep, to gently wake them up and keep them awake, or to have them take a break, or something like that.","6":"Hi, I'm here to explain the concept of relativity to you.","7":"Do you feel like you're always on the verge of something new, and that's what gives you the courage to make a choice?","8":"So, like, the major seven chord has a major third and a perfect fifth, but with a sharp fifth, it's like, a major third and a major seventh and a sharp fifth.","9":"I still remember that day clearly.","10":"I know, I know.","11":"it's like a force, a gravitational pull","12":"It's really popular in churches and funerals.","13":"What's it about?","14":"I think the melody is more catchy and the rhythm is more interesting.","15":"That's right, latency is often discussed in the context of digital signals or data transmission, referring to the time it takes for a signal to travel from one point to another.","16":"and that's what's gonna make it feel even more like you're actually inside the game.","17":"because now you can just make a video game out of it, and then you don't have to worry about the practicalities of making it happen in real life.","18":"That's a good start, but it's a bit more complex than that. Machine learning is a type of artificial intelligence that allows machines to learn from data without being explicitly programmed.","19":"I love her music and style, it's really unique.","20":"That's probably why Spotify thought you'd like it, since you've listened to her songs before.","21":"The machine could understand things like volume and tempo, but it might struggle with more subjective qualities like the pitch or timbre of the music.","22":"I think it would be really interesting to see how it applies to other areas, like healthcare or education, where you'd want to have a machine that can learn from a lot of data and make predictions or recommendations that are more accurate than what a human could do on their own.","23":"I think we've made significant progress in teaching machines to perform complex tasks, but there's still a long way to go before we can say they can do things that we can't. On the other hand, I believe there are certain aspects of human experience, like creativity and empathy, that might be uniquely tied to biological processes and could be difficult for machines to replicate.","24":"So, what exactly does it mean for space-time to break down in the case of a black hole?","25":"The inside of a black hole is not really a place, but a path, or a journey, or a sequence of events.","26":"And the reason we're interested in that is that we don't have a very good understanding of the equation of state of neutron star matter, which is a fancy way of saying that we don't know how dense neutron star matter is.","27":"I mean, it's not surprising, given how easily observable it is, and how it has been a source of fascination for cultures all around the world for thousands of years.","28":"But if it's computer science, you end up as a software engineer.","29":"means you can move through time as well as space.","30":"That's the really tricky part. Because when you move at high speeds, time starts to move differently for you relative to someone who is standing still. So, for example, if you were to travel to a star at 90% of the speed of light, time would actually move slower for you than for someone who is standing still on Earth. And when you get back, you would have aged less than they did. It's a pretty weird effect.","31":"So that's time travel, right? I mean, if I can meet you there, that's time travel, it's just a different way of doing it.","32":"And that's why he's saying time is relative, and it depends on how you're moving through space, right?","33":null,"34":"I think I understand now.","35":"Exactly, if you had a sheet, like a trampoline, and you put a heavy object, like a bowling ball, on it, it would warp, it would curve down, and if you dropped something else, like a marble, on the other side, it would roll towards the bowling ball, because the sheet, or the spacetime, is curved, so the marble follows the curvature of the spacetime, and that's basically what's happening with gravity, the planets, the stars, the galaxies, they're all warping the spacetime around them, and that's why things move the way they do.","36":"That's a good start, but it's not quite that simple. Perspective is part of it, but it's more about the geometry of spacetime. When you're on the train, you're not just perceiving things differently, you're actually moving through spacetime in a way that affects the geometry of the space around you. And that's what leads to the strange effects we see in relativity, like time dilation and length contraction.","37":"That's how we create harmony in music.","38":"That's what I was thinking.","39":"and that's where the math comes in, you have to do a lot of calculations to figure out what's going on with these extra dimensions.","40":"What do you think about the anthropic principle, and its relation to string theory? Do you think it can help us understand how we end up with a universe that has the properties that we observe?","41":"and then you could take that tube and wrap it up to get a compactified dimension.","42":"I assume we're starting with some kind of initial condition or symmetry that makes the large dimensions more plausible.","43":"And then, you know, the idea is that this P-brane can be a brane in any of these higher dimensions. And so, when it's a 0-brane, it's just a point in space, when it's a 1-brane, it's a string, when it's a 2-brane, it's a membrane, and so on.","44":"So, that's not exactly what's happening here, but it's related. In this case, the black branes are actually in de Sitter space, not anti-de Sitter, and they're stable, which is a big difference.","45":"And that's where the idea of the 'cylinder universe' comes in, where you have a four-dimensional universe that's compactified on a circle, and the radius of that circle is determined by the balance between the cosmological constant and the electromagnetic field.","46":"I think so, yes, because the compactified sphere is a very symmetric solution, so it's likely to have low action.","47":"you're thinking of The Matrix, not quantum physics","48":"about the causal relationship between the two concepts.","49":"The Dialogues: Conversations About the Nature of Universe is a graphic novel that provides a more detailed explanation of the concept of spacetime emerging from quantum mechanics.","50":null,"51":"The earth's gravity is pulling us down.","52":"How can you say you can't see me waving my hand when you're moving your head to look at me? That's the point, you're reacting to the movement without actually seeing it.","53":"What do you want to know about lasers?","54":"Exactly, so the continuous wave laser is like a steady stream of water, whereas the chirped pulse amplifier is like a massive wave that crashes down, and that's what makes it so powerful.","55":"Well, we can't go much further than this point, as the laws of physics start to break down.","56":"If we were to destroy the tumor cell, it would be more like using some sort of high-intensity laser to heat up the cell to the point where it bursts, rather than ionizing it.","57":null,"58":"I think that's a really interesting approach, and it's great to see that you were able to create a sense of immersion and wonder with such a low-tech aesthetic. It's a good reminder that sometimes less can be more, and that the goal of a game or interactive experience shouldn't always be to push the boundaries of what's technically possible, but to create a sense of magic and wonder that draws the player in.","59":"I think that's a really good point, but at some point, we have to start thinking about the real-world limitations of our technology, like the need for a stable power source, a comfortable form factor, and a user interface that doesn't overwhelm people. We can't just focus on the novelty of it all and forget about the practicalities.","60":"I think that's a really important point, because the last thing we want to do is just unleash this technology without thinking about how it's going to impact our relationships, our communities, our sense of self. We need to figure out how to integrate these advancements with our values, with our ethics, with our sense of what it means to be human. And that's a much harder problem than just building the technology itself.","61":"Do you have a favorite area within those fields?","62":"filled-in-dialogue","63":"Just take that, and hold it straight up and down, like that. And I'll give you another one that's at right angles to this one. You see how it's at right angles to this one?","64":null,"65":"That would give us two numbers, and then we could use those to plot a point on a graph.","66":"That's a good start, but we're looking for spatial dimensions, so how about a direction in space that you can't move in?","67":"What's the difference between putting coordinates on the sky and putting them on the ground?","68":"What do you call those?","69":"There are three, latitude, longitude, and altitude.","70":"with the development of quantum mechanics and relativity.","71":"Well, for the X-ray binaries, we've been using X-ray telescopes like Chandra and XMM-Newton to observe the X-ray emission from the binary systems, and also using optical telescopes like Hubble to study the optical counterparts.","72":"That's a good start, but gravity isn't just what keeps us on the chairs. It's also what keeps planets in orbit around stars and what causes objects to fall towards the ground when dropped.","73":"That's right. The Moon's gravity causes the tides to bulge out in two areas: one on the side of the Earth facing the Moon and the other on the opposite side of the Earth.","74":"If gravity were too strong, we'd be stuck to the ground, and it would be impossible to jump up or even get up from a chair. We'd be like the Moon, stuck to the Earth.","75":"Do you want to stand up and I'll measure your height?","76":"What's wrong?","77":"That's really cool, but doesn't that contradict the fact that astronauts in space experience weightlessness?","78":"Well, actually, the ancient Greeks were some of the first people to think about gravity. There was a philosopher named Aristotle who said that heavy objects tend to move towards the center of the Earth, but he didn't really have a clear idea of how that worked. Later on, a scientist named Galileo Galilei did some experiments that showed that objects fall towards the ground at a constant rate, which was a big step towards understanding gravity. And then Isaac Newton came along and developed his law of universal gravitation, which basically says that every object in the universe attracts every other object with a force proportional to their mass and the distance between them. That was a really big breakthrough and it's still the foundation of our understanding of gravity today.","79":"What's so funny?","80":"Do you think that's really applicable to our specific situation?","81":"Actually, what's interesting is that your body is really good at adapting to the natural light-dark cycle, so even though you have long days, your master clock is still going to be regulated by the timing of sunrise and sunset, and it's going to adjust to that rhythm. So, you might actually be sleeping at the same time, it's just that your day is longer, and your body is just going to be more active during that longer day. So, it's not necessarily that you're sleeping less, it's just that your day is longer, and your body is just more active during that time.","82":"No, a laser is a very thin beam of light, not a light bulb. It's made of a special material called a gain medium, like a gas or a crystal, and a pump source, which is usually a light or electrical source, to excite the atoms or molecules in the gain medium, causing them to emit light at a specific wavelength.","83":"That's right, because if you hit the sharp end, it would just bend and go flying in all directions, so it's much better to hit the flat end and let the pointy end go in straight and true.","84":"a certain amount of power to actually burn through the wood.","85":"Yeah, it's kind of like a magnifying glass, it's like the light is being concentrated onto a smaller area, so it's like the heat from the sun being focused onto a single point.","86":"So, this means that when light moves, it's not just moving in space, it's also moving through time, which is why we can see things that are happening in the past or in the future, depending on how far away they are from us.","87":"Yeah, and that's what makes them so dangerous.","88":"the light will focus onto the lens","89":"I mean, I had thought that I had a clear idea of what I wanted to do, but it turned out that I was way off.","90":"Do you find it hard to fall asleep?","91":"There's different stages of sleep that we go through, and each one of those stages has different characteristics.","92":"No, because the way we measure that is by looking at the brain waves, like, the brain activity, and that's what helps us determine whether they're in REM or non-REM sleep, and that's what helps us tell how much sleep they're getting and what their sleep schedule is.","93":"So, that's one of the reasons why you might feel like you're not getting the restorative sleep you need, even if you're sleeping for a full eight hours. It's not just about the quantity of sleep, but also the quality, and that's influenced by all these different factors.","94":"But it's not uncommon for some animals to sleep for a long time.","95":"What did you think of it?","96":"Can you tell me a bit about what you know about quantum dots?","97":"These semiconductors are actually 0D nanoparticles. They don't have a fixed shape and they don't have any dimensions in the classical sense. They're just clusters of atoms.","98":"We're in a very early stage. I think the most promising of these applications, the display one, is probably 5-10 years away, but the quantum dot imaging and therapeutic work is much further away. It's still very much in the early stages of research.","99":"a type of material.","100":"One of the ways we control the diameter is by using a catalyst, which is typically a metal, to help guide the growth of the nanotube. The size of the catalyst particle determines the diameter of the nanotube. So, if we use a smaller catalyst particle, we get a smaller nanotube. It's a bit like using a template to draw a picture - the catalyst particle acts as a template to guide the growth of the nanotube. We also use things like temperature and pressure to control the growth process.","101":"No, those are actually just some ambient lighting we have in the room. But we do have some quantum dot displays around here somewhere. Would you like to see one?","102":"It's a way of teaching computers to make decisions based on data, so they can do things like recognize pictures or understand what people are saying.","103":"The picture shows a cat because the animal is a feline, which are known to be skinny, have tall legs, and pointy ears.","104":"What specific features of humans make it impossible for them to be mistaken for cats or dogs?","105":"So, you're saying the review covers everything you need to know?","106":"You wanted to learn more about science.","107":"But I didn't know that they were so small.","108":"And that's a pretty good example, because you're not necessarily trying to solve the math problem, you're trying to find out what the math problem is, right?","109":"That sounds like a really interesting project. Can you tell me more about how you're planning to implement it?","110":"I think you're right, and I've been noticing that too. It's like, the industry is finally catching up with the research, and it's getting to the point where we have to start thinking about the actual security of the hardware rather than just relying on the data sheet claims.","111":"collapse under their own gravity, and the gravity gets so strong that nothing can escape, not even light.","112":"Actually, there's a movie called Interstellar, where they consulted with physicists to make sure that their depiction of black holes and gravitational forces was accurate. It's not perfect, but it's one of the few movies that tries to get it right.","113":"Yes, that's right. Black holes are notoriously difficult to detect, and most of what we know about them comes from observing the effects they have on the surrounding space. For example, if a star gets too close to a black hole, it can get heated up and start emitting a lot of light, which we can observe. Or if a black hole is rotating rapidly, it can create a kind of 'frame-dragging' effect, where the space around it gets twisted and distorted. So while we can't directly observe a black hole, we can infer its presence by looking at the effects it has on its surroundings.","114":"I think that's a great point. We need to make sure that the data collection process is transparent, and that the data itself is representative of the population we're trying to model. And then, of course, there's the issue of fairness and equity, making sure that the model isn't perpetuating existing biases. It's a complex problem, but one that we need to tackle head-on.","115":"And I think that's a really important thing to consider when you're building these systems, is that the people who are most impacted by these biases are often not the ones who are building them.","116":"I think we're seeing a lot of adoption in the tech industry, particularly in companies that are working on data-driven products. They're already thinking about how they can document their processes and share knowledge across teams. In contrast, I think the finance industry is still a bit behind, partly because of the sensitive nature of their data, but also because they have a lot of legacy systems that are hard to integrate with new documentation tools.","117":"I am very optimistic, and I think that's because I think there are a lot of people who are very optimistic. I think there are a lot of people who are working very hard to address these issues. I think there are a lot of people who are working very hard to make sure that AI is being used in a way that is beneficial to society. And I think that's a very powerful force, and I think it's going to drive a lot of progress over the next five to 10 years. So, I'm very optimistic, and I think that's because I think that's a very powerful force.","118":"These patterns are created by repeating units of shape, and they're really beautiful, especially when you see them in 3D.","119":"And what if you make the fold on the other side of the dot, like that?","120":"Yes, that's right. In origami, every mountain can be turned into a valley, and every valley can be turned into a mountain, so you can always flip the design.","121":"So that's the reason why you see three mountains and a valley or three valleys and a mountain in every origami shape that folds flat.","122":"that's the reason it's called a twist, a twist is a fold that turns the paper 90 degrees and then another 90 degrees","123":"Can you explain what you're thinking?","124":"and that's actually what's been found in studies of the brain, that certain patterns of activity, or certain pathways in the brain, are associated with certain types of experiences or certain types of thought processes.","125":"But that doesn't necessarily mean it can't think, because the binary system is just a way of representing the yes or no, the on or off, the firing or not firing, the connections or not connections, so that's not a fundamental difference between the computer and the brain.","126":"We use a variety of telescopes, including the Hubble Space Telescope, the Spitzer Space Telescope, and the Atacama Large Millimeter\/submillimeter Array (ALMA). We also use ground-based telescopes like the Subaru Telescope and the Keck Observatory. For infrared observations, we often use the Spitzer Space Telescope and the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE). For optical observations, we use a range of telescopes, including the Hubble Space Telescope and the Subaru Telescope. We also use instruments like spectrographs to analyze the light coming from the objects we observe. These instruments help us to measure the properties of the objects, such as their composition, temperature, and motion.","127":"Yes, I can estimate the size of the accretion disk, and the dust distribution, and that's one of the key things that I'm trying to do with this data, is to get a better understanding of the spatial structure of these systems.","128":"You see it as a kind of ring, a ring structure, because the dust is heated up, and then it radiates in the infrared, and so you can see this ring structure, and you can see the dust, it's a kind of, a kind of, a kind of, an annulus, and you can see it's, it's, it's the structure, it's the dust that's, that's heated up, and then it's, it's, it's radiating, and so you can see it as a kind of, a kind of, a ring, a ring structure.","129":"Does that mean that the formation of stellar mass black holes is somehow suppressed, or are we just not looking in the right places?","130":"I see what you mean, so the black hole would be incredibly dense, right?","131":"One thing that's a bit tricky with deep learning is that it can be a bit hard to understand what's going on under the hood, so how do you balance the need for interpretability with the benefits that deep learning can bring to the table?","132":"That's why you see a lot of these models just perpetuating existing biases and not really adding much value beyond what's already present in the data.","133":"I see what you mean, but don't you think that approach only really works if the creator is actually aware of the potential biases and is actively looking for them, and that's not always the case?","134":"So, in terms of quantum gravity, there are a few approaches, but the one that's most popular is string theory, which is an attempt to merge quantum mechanics with general relativity, but it's a highly speculative and mathematically complex theory.","135":"because if you have two states that are not in the same world, it's not like you can just add them together, that wouldn't make sense.","136":"You're saying that in the very early universe, the wave function of the universe was a superposition of all possible configurations, including the one where there's a galaxy in one place and not in another. And then somehow that superposition collapsed into the one that we see today.","137":"So, the black hole is slowly losing mass over time.","138":"like using a hammer to drive a nail.","139":"I mean, we can't even get a complete catalog of all the stars in the observable universe, so...","140":"But it's a very different way of thinking about it because instead of gravity being this fundamental force of nature that's mediated by these particles, it's more like the geometry of space-time itself is emergent from the collective behavior of these particles.","141":"What's the best way to do it?","142":"to learn about how to use the new software.","143":"This is a very simple model, it's just a series of folds.","144":"Now, can you try to do it on your own?","145":"So, what's a cootie catcher?","146":"You can put your thumb in the beak and make it talk.","147":"So, how do you see blockchain being used to manage this distributed power grid? What kind of mechanisms or protocols would be necessary to make it work?","148":"We need to do more rigorous testing and validation before we can claim it's a science.","149":"because it prioritizes the interests of the corporation over the interests of the people.","150":"So, it's the same with autonomous vehicles, we have a very high standard, and then we have our current state, which is not perfect.","151":null,"152":"They use something called a firewall.","153":"They would actually create a patch, which is essentially a fix to the lock, so that people can't get in anymore.","154":"And that's why they're trying to make sure that the lock is not traceable to the original owner, so that's why they're sending a new lock.","155":"I started with simple tasks like cracking passwords and basic network scanning.","156":"And I didn't think about that at the time, but now I can see that there are lots of reasons why the creator might have wanted it that way.","157":"I think so.","158":"Like, think of the tiny machines that clean your floors or the filters in your air purifiers. They're tiny, but they're real and they're doing real work. Nanotechnology is kind of like that, but on a much smaller scale.","159":"Is this a transistor?","160":"Well, we have machines that can make them, like, exactly. It's called photolithography, and it's a process where we shine a light through a pattern onto a material, and it etches the pattern into the material. And then we repeat that process over and over again, until we get the desired shape. It's kind of like printing a circuit board, but instead of ink, we're using light to create the circuit.","161":"like something I'd really want in return.","162":"I've heard of some hackers being really smart and finding vulnerabilities in software that nobody else knows about.","163":"The camera is also an input device, it's taking a picture of you and it's sending it to me.","164":"That can vary depending on the specific setup, but in general, it can take anywhere from a few seconds to a few minutes.","165":"no","166":"You could actually put the whole experiment on a scale, and the scale would not show any difference between the two scenarios.","167":"I know, it's like your brain is trying to catch up with what's happening, and for a second, you're like, am I moving or is the other train moving?","168":"and the main character is a chicken who's also a time traveler.","169":"It helps your brain recharge, like a phone.","170":"I mean, have you seen their new collection? It's really something.","171":"Instead of sleeping like humans do, where we go into a deep sleep and our brainwaves slow down, giraffes have a unique way of resting where they can quickly fall asleep and wake up without going into a deep sleep. This allows them to rest for short periods while still being alert and ready to run away from predators.","172":"How long have you been feeling tired?","173":"They have a specialized respiratory system that allows them to hold their breath for a long time, so they can rest while still keeping their blowhole above water.","174":"but think about how it would affect the world","175":"Dolphins are highly intelligent and social animals that live in groups in the ocean.","176":"They sleep with only half their brain at a time, so the other half can stay awake and keep an eye out for predators or help them come up to the surface to breathe.","177":"So, you haven't heard of nanotechnology before? It's a field of science that deals with materials on a very small scale, like a billionth of a meter.","178":"An ant is actually much bigger than a nanometer, it's about 1 to 2 millimeters long. A nanometer is a billionth of a meter, so it's incredibly small. If you were to imagine a line that's one meter long, a nanometer would be a billionth of that line. ","179":"And because atoms are that small, when we're talking about things that are a nanometer apart, we're talking about distances that are comparable to the size of atoms. So, when we're working with things that are a nanometer in size, we're essentially working with individual atoms or groups of atoms.","180":"I can already imagine what kind of amazing things we could build with that kind of technology!","181":"Well, because we want to see how things work at a really tiny scale. It's actually really cool!","182":"So, let's start with the basics. What do you think a volcano is?","183":"I think that's a great point. I mean, think about how far we've come in the last decade. We've gone from being able to show people a static image to being able to show them a fully immersive experience. But you're right, we still have a long way to go before we can truly capture the complexity and nuance of reality.","184":"I think that's a good point about the audio and the power of suggestion. But with haptics, I think it's a bit different. You can't just fake it, you have to actually simulate the physical sensations, and that's much harder to do. But I do think that some of the newer technologies, like the ones that use electromagnetic fields to create resistance or vibrations, might be promising. We'll see.","185":"Exactly, if the audio isn't good, it's hard to get them to come back to it.","186":"How do you think these different descriptions relate to each other?","187":"Like, if you're standing next to a huge mountain, you'd feel a lot more gravitational pull than if you were on the other side of the world?","188":"Yes, in free fall. And in that case, you and the elevator are both falling at the same rate, so you don't feel any gravitational force. You're not feeling the force of the Earth's gravity because you're already falling along with it. That's the key insight: gravity is not a force that pushes you towards the Earth, but rather a curvature of space-time that affects the motion of objects.","189":"So, what do you think about the implications of this idea?","190":null,"191":"You looked really surprised!","192":"that it's all so interconnected?","193":"I think we can say that the idea of an extra dimension is a way of thinking about how the universe is structured, but it's not a direct answer to your question. The concept of an extra dimension is more related to how we perceive and understand space and time.","194":"So, Bela is a type of software that helps musicians and sound engineers control and process audio signals in real-time. It's like a digital audio workstation, but it's specifically designed for live performances and installations.","195":"And that's what makes it so interesting, because it's not just a theory of gravity, it's a theory of everything, a unified theory that includes quantum mechanics and gravity.","196":"It's a plant.","197":"Now, if you extend that concept to two dimensions, you have a surface that can vibrate, which is kind of like a drumhead, right?","198":"The Grand Unified Theory is a very general idea that all of the forces in physics should be unified into one single force. String theory is one attempt to do that, but it's not the only one. There are many other approaches that are trying to unify the forces, and string theory is just one of them. It's a very ambitious idea, and it's a very active area of research, but it's not the only game in town.","199":"But that's not all, it also unifies the other fundamental forces like the strong and weak nuclear forces.","200":"And that's how it creates a permanent record, or a permanent ledger, that's tamper-proof.","201":"And that changes the game, because machines can act in ways that are not even predictable by their creators.","202":"But how do you think we can address those trust issues? Is it through increased regulation, or do you think there are other ways to build trust in the blockchain space?","203":"I think one of the biggest challenges will be scaling it in a way that it's not just for financial transactions, but also for other industries like healthcare, supply chain management, and identity verification.","204":"One of the challenges we've seen with incorporating these nanomaterials is scaling up their production while maintaining their properties. How do you think we can address this scalability issue to make these advancements more practical for widespread use?","205":"How do you scale up the production of these materials to a point where it's economically viable for large-scale battery manufacturing, and what are some of the integration challenges you face when combining these materials with other battery components?","206":null,"207":"Yeah, because the wheel has to be able to withstand the harsh conditions of space, so it can't just be any ordinary wheel, it has to be able to handle the extreme temperatures and the pressure of being in space.","208":"It's actually been used in a couple of aerospace applications already, where you need something that's incredibly strong but also incredibly lightweight. It's also been used in some medical devices because it's biocompatible and can be sterilized.","209":"There's a lot of interest in developing materials that can do multiple functions, like self-healing materials, or materials that can change color in response to environmental changes, like temperature or pH. There are a lot of researchers working on that right now, and I think that's really exciting because it could lead to some really innovative applications.","210":"I've heard it's like a digital ledger or something, but I don't really know how it works.","211":"So, think of it like a big, digital ledger that keeps track of all the transactions that happen on the network. It's maintained by a bunch of computers around the world, and it's what allows us to trust that the transaction is happening without needing a middleman. It's not just limited to money, either - it can be used to trade all sorts of things, like digital assets or even real-world goods.","212":"Exactly, because it's a decentralized system, there's no central authority to act as a middleman, so the middlemen are being cut out of the process.","213":"How have you been?","214":"Can you walk me through how this association might translate into real-world risk for individuals over time, or are there any potential interventions that could mitigate this increased risk?","215":"I was wondering if there's any evidence that sleep disturbances might be a contributing factor to the development of these neurodegenerative diseases, rather than just a consequence.","216":"That's really interesting, so are you saying that both of these, the beta-amyloid and the tauopathies, are related to sleep changes in these mouse models?","217":"The idea that sleep is closely tied to our circadian rhythms and that understanding the interplay between the two could reveal new insights into the mechanisms of neurodegeneration and how to prevent it. This could be a game-changer in terms of our understanding of sleep and its role in maintaining brain health.","218":"This paper crane is a traditional Japanese art form that can be folded from a single sheet of paper, and it's often given as a gift to bring good luck.","219":"What kind of point would a paper airplane be? It's not a point, it's a shape.","220":"So, the fifth circle is actually a small flap on the wing that helps with balance and steering when the bird is in flight.","221":"What kind of origami do you want to design?","222":"And so, I'm curious, how do you envision this process working, in terms of how the viruses would be engineered, and how the materials would be synthesized?","223":"because the rocket itself is not designed to expand in space.","224":"Can you explain why you're using rectangles instead of squares?","225":"So, that's one of the key things that makes this mechanism interesting. It's the way that the motion changes as we go from small angles to large angles.","226":"Yes, exactly. And the way it's designed, the solar panels can deploy and then the mechanism can lock into place, so it doesn't need to be powered anymore.","227":"So, it's because they're not thin enough?","228":"You're weighing the importance of symmetry of motion against the efficiency of packing, and the right choice depends on your priorities.","229":null,"230":"That's a good way to think about it. But what makes it feel like you're actually there?","231":"Exactly, like in Minecraft!","232":"Do you remember how the 3-D effect worked?","233":"So, what do you think about the recent policy change?","234":"The circle of fifths is a tool that helps you find the relationships between chords and keys, and it's really useful for understanding how harmony works.","235":"I think that's what we were discussing","236":"and I'll show you how it goes.","237":"Can you see the note on the line?","238":"I'm actually studying physics right now.","239":"Do you think anything that happens around you, like a ball rolling or a light turning on, is governed by some kind of rule or law?","240":"What do you mean by that?","241":"How far along the line would you be pointing to?","242":"What kind of number is it?","243":"But in one dimension, we can just use a line, and it's easy to tell where we are.","244":"I'm more familiar with the topic, so I can provide a clearer explanation.","245":"I think it's time we reviewed the latest research on the topic.","246":"and it would probably change our understanding of the universe and the laws of physics.","247":"That's a great example! In the case of Gmail, the machine learning models are likely being trained on a vast amount of labeled data, such as spam vs. non-spam emails, to improve their accuracy over time. This is an example of supervised learning, where the model is explicitly taught to recognize certain patterns or behaviors based on the labeled data it's trained on.","248":"and maybe the content of the email itself.","249":"Yes, there are methods where the machine itself can learn features from the data without needing human intervention. Techniques like PCA or t-SNE can reduce the dimensionality of the data and help the machine learn more abstract features.","250":"No, reinforcement learning is more about experimenting with the environment and learning from the feedback, rather than just throwing everything at the problem.","251":"Well, a deep learning algorithm is probably the better choice when you want to learn a mapping between inputs and outputs, like an image classification problem.","252":"That's a good example, and I think that's a classic problem with just doing linear regression or just doing deep learning, where you get a good prediction, but you don't get any insight into what's driving that prediction. And that's a problem because, as you said, if you don't know why someone is quitting, then you can't do anything about it. You can't take any action to prevent them from quitting. So, it's not just about getting a good prediction, it's about getting a good understanding of what's driving that prediction.","253":"One way is to add more data, another way is to use different architectures, and another way is to actually do more interpretability, and then there are also different methods like adversarial training that can help improve the robustness of the model.","254":"And you'd also have to consider the actual function of the neurons and the behavior of the neurons in different states, right?","255":"I see what you mean, but the idea is that the brain can reorganize itself and form new connections, even if the associations are different.","256":"no","257":"Hello, I've been looking forward to our meeting.","258":"The energy density of the beam will be enormous.","259":"or we can do it the honest way by using Lorentz transformation.","260":"\u2014and be able to make them add up coherently.","261":"I'm not sure what you're getting at. Can you elaborate on the market for lasers and how that's driving progress?","262":"I was going to say that we're really starting to get into some pretty advanced areas, like high-powered lasers that can be used for industrial applications, and also for some of the more exotic things like laser propulsion, which is a potential way to get to space faster.","263":"What happened in that breach?","264":"Exactly, and it's not just the equipment itself, it's also the way that these systems are connected to the network. They're often connected for convenience, but they're not necessarily connected in a secure way, which is another point that the penetration testers found in this case. They found that the deli scale was connected to the network using a default password that hadn't been changed. That's just a huge vulnerability, because if you know the default password, you can just walk in and take control of the system.","265":"A buffer overflow is a common type of vulnerability that can be found in a lot of different types of software, where if you can cause the program to write more data to a buffer than it's allocated to hold, then you can potentially execute arbitrary code, which means you can do anything you want on the system, which is obviously a huge security risk.","266":"if you dereference a null pointer.","267":"I got interested in computer science because I'm really into global affairs, global politics, and you often hear in the news about the rising power of China, the rising power of Iran. I enjoy how interdisciplinary computer science is. Like, nowadays there's so much going on in the world of computers and that's what fascinated me.","268":"It's almost as if there's a disconnect between the state department's goal of promoting free speech and the NSA's goal of surveillance. It raises questions about the motivations behind the NSA's actions and whether they're in line with the values of the US government.","269":"Have you ever seen a laser in action?","270":"Have you ever played with a cat toy before?","271":"So, in a way, the laser is like a very focused flashlight, and that's what makes the dot so small.","272":"Isn't it just mind-blowing?","273":"because it's going to follow the path of the least resistance, it's going to bend around the corner and come out the other side and that's really cool because you can use that to see things that you can't see otherwise.","274":"It's a picture of a lion.","275":"Does that happen every time?","276":"That's like a laser, right? It's a big flash of light that you see for a second. I guess it's kind of like a tiny laser beam that hits your eye.","277":"What specific aspects of the Rowhammer paper caught your attention, and do you think you could adapt the techniques to other types of side channel attacks?","278":"And that's the thing, the Rowhammer attack is a great example of a side channel attack, because it's not a problem with the algorithm, it's a problem with the physical implementation of the memory, and that's something that's really hard to predict.","279":"But with the right equipment, you can minimize the challenges and get a stable connection.","280":"I think that's a pretty common stance, but what about the case where the vulnerability is in a legacy system that's still in use, but it's not really possible to upgrade it? Should the vulnerability still be disclosed, even if it's not possible to fix it?","281":"The explainer thinks that's a huge issue and a huge overreach by the government.","282":"I don't think so either, it's more of a nuisance, right? I mean, it's not like it's causing any real damage.","283":"You can buy and sell anything from just about anywhere, so I thought it would be a good idea to try it out.","284":null,"285":"We could use something like a blockchain to record all the trades, so that once something is recorded, it can't be altered, and then we can use smart contracts to automate the process of making sure that the trades happen as agreed upon.","286":"Well, that's a good question. There are a lot of different ways to make sure that it's secure. One of the main ways is through cryptography, so all of the transactions are encrypted, so even if someone were to get a hold of them, they wouldn't be able to read them. And also, each person has a unique key, a public key, that they use to validate the transactions, and that helps prevent people from just, you know, faking their way in and adding fake transactions to the list.","287":"You're really knowledgeable about this topic, aren't you?","288":"I'm really interested in the application of physics and engineering principles to medical devices and technology.","289":"I'm not sure, what is it?","290":"Yes, it is the same premise. The idea is that the laser pulse is so intense that it can eject the electrons from the atoms. The key difference is how we get to that point. With other lasers, the pulse is already very short, so it's already a hammer. But with chirped pulse amplification, we have to stretch the pulse out first, and then compress it back together again. So, it's like a laser hammer, but with a bit of a delay in between.","291":"It's a device that helps us to synchronize the different colors of light so that they can combine to create a short pulse.","292":"That's the way the harmonics combine, and that's why you hear the overtone series.","293":"Let's see, if we have a C major chord, and we invert it, we get an A minor chord, but if we invert the F major chord, we get a B\u266d major chord.","294":null,"295":"I was thinking that we could explore some dissonance and tension by using some minor chords and some suspended chords, to create a sense of uncertainty and unease.","296":"You changed the lyrics, and I think that's why it doesn't feel as happy as it originally did.","297":"It refers to the brain's neural connections.","298":"If we took all of your memories, your experiences, and put them into a computer, would that computer then be you, or would it just be a simulation of you?","299":"But isn't that just a matter of how we experience it, not the underlying reality?","300":"It seems like a lot to handle.","301":"What was it about that experience that made such a strong impression on you, do you think?","302":"Well, one of the things that I've been studying is how memories get consolidated from short-term to long-term, and how that process is influenced by different types of neural activity, including sleep and exercise.","303":"I'd define implicit memory as the kind of memory that's involved in skill acquisition and performance, like riding a bike or playing a musical instrument. It's not necessarily something you can consciously access, but it's still there, influencing your behavior. Explicit memory, on the other hand, would be the memory that you can consciously recall, like remembering what you had for breakfast this morning or the name of your first grade teacher.","304":"Yes, we are seeing some differences. For example, when we look at skill learning tasks, we tend to see more activity in the striatum, which is consistent with the idea that the striatum is involved in implicit memory. On the other hand, when we look at episodic memory tasks, we tend to see more activity in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex, which is consistent with the idea that these regions are involved in explicit memory. However, it's worth noting that there is some overlap between the two, and we're seeing activity in all three regions during both implicit and explicit memory tasks.","305":"That's a great way to look at it. The beauty of math is that it's often counterintuitive, and you need to think in a different way to solve the problems.","306":"So, basically, if you're using a password manager, it's like a vault that stores all your passwords, and the only way to get in is with the master password.","307":"And it would be super secure, because they wouldn't have any of your information, so they wouldn't be able to hack into your account.","308":"So, like, the number line goes on forever in both directions?","309":"It means that when you add infinity to itself, you still get infinity. It's not like adding 10 to itself, which gives you 20. When you add infinity to itself, you still get infinity. And that's a bit strange because it means that infinity is not like any other number.","310":"No, because we already established that one plus infinity is equal to infinity. So, the second guest would just be another one, another one plus infinity, which is just infinity again.","311":"No, we have to make room for them in our hotel, but we can't have them in the same rooms as our current guests.","312":"You're doubling the space each time.","313":"Well, in a lot of ways, it's not like we have a single, unified notion of infinity in mathematics. Different areas of mathematics use different ideas of infinity, and they often don't line up with each other.","314":"So, it's a relatively new concept.","315":"Exactly! Coordinates would be a great way to describe the position of a robot in a 3D space.","316":"Motion is actually kind of the easy part, I think. It's more like understanding the context and being able to generalize to new situations.","317":"One thing that's really helped is just using simulations. We can create virtual environments where a robot can learn to perform tasks in a way that's safe and efficient. But even with simulations, there's still a lot of work to be done in terms of translating what we learn in simulation to the real world. And then there's also the challenge of collecting data from real-world robots, which can be expensive and time-consuming. So, it's a bit of a chicken and egg problem, where we need more data to train better models, but we also need better models to collect more accurate data.","318":"One common algorithm is reinforcement learning, where the robot learns from trial and error, and another one is imitation learning, where the robot learns by observing and imitating a human demonstrator.","319":"You could say that a set is a fractal if it is invariant under certain types of scaling transformations.","320":"So, fractal dimension is a way to measure how much space a fractal fills up compared to a regular shape with the same area. It's like a way to quantify how intricate or detailed a fractal is. For example, a line has a dimension of 1, because it's one-dimensional, and a square has a dimension of 2, because it's two-dimensional. But a fractal, like the Mandelbrot set, has a dimension that's not a whole number, like 1.5 or 2.3. This means it's somewhere in between a line and a square in terms of how much space it takes up.","321":"because it's the smallest number that gives us a stable pattern.","322":"dimension four","323":"It's because when you use smaller units, you're counting more boxes along the curve, so you're capturing more of the tiny details that make the coastline so irregular, which means your estimate of the length is going to be longer.","324":"Another interesting application of fractals is in modeling real-world phenomena such as coastlines and river networks, which exhibit self-similarity at different scales.","325":"it's a gradient noise that can be used to create natural-looking patterns.","326":"the box.","327":"an ASCII character","328":"What are they used for?","329":"No, you won't be able to understand why the statement is true. You won't have access to the information that's being used to prove the statement. All you'll know is that the statement is true, without any idea how it's being proven. In other words, you'll have zero knowledge of the underlying proof, hence the name zero-knowledge proof.","330":"So, what we're gonna do is we're gonna use this map three-coloring problem to create a zero-knowledge proof that you can use to prove that you have at least 0.3 Bitcoins without actually revealing how you got that amount.","331":"We can use the idea of homomorphic encryption to encrypt the statement, and then use a zero-knowledge proof protocol like zk-SNARKs to prove that the encrypted statement satisfies the condition of being three-colorable without revealing the actual address of the account or the amount of Bitcoins.","332":"I'm not sure, it looks a bit off to me.","333":"because they already know you and your situation, so it's more efficient.","334":"Well, the broader implications of zero-knowledge proofs are that they can be used to prove that something is true without revealing any information about the thing itself. So, it's not just about implementation, it's more about structurally proving certain properties about a system or a protocol without revealing any sensitive information.","335":"the implementations of the thing.","336":"How do you plan to approach that, though?","337":"I think you're getting at the question of whether mathematical objects are abstract or concrete. Some philosophers think that numbers are just concepts, while others think they're real things that exist independently of our thoughts about them.","338":"What was the best part of the pool?","339":"because I have a bunch of towels in my beach bag and they all look the same to me after a while.","340":"Your response here","341":"like the hippocampus or something.","342":"Exactly! So, when you accidentally cut yourself, the amygdala is activated because it's a scary experience, and it sends a signal to the hippocampus to make sure that memory is really strong and memorable, so you can avoid similar situations in the future.","343":"And when we do, we're gonna get a longer measurement of the length of the coastline, because we're getting more detail in the shape of the coastline.","344":"I mean, it's like, it's a shape, but it's not just a shape, it's a shape that has lots of little details that make it hard to define, you know?","345":"How do you do?","346":"That's what makes it so versatile.","347":"like, a grain of sand or something","348":"and we're doing it using a technology called terahertz scanning.","349":"Well, I think one of the main differences is that in imaging large biological objects, the timescales and the spatial scales are just so much larger than what we deal with in quantum systems. And also, the kinds of phenomena we observe are very different. In imaging, we're mostly dealing with macroscopic properties of materials, whereas in quantum systems, we're dealing with the intrinsic properties of individual particles. So, it's a very different regime of physics.","350":"Yes, the magnetic field from the NV center is very strong, so you have to be within a few nanometers to detect it.","351":"We had to adjust our filter settings to get rid of the FM stations, but it was a good learning experience to understand how our system interacts with its environment.","352":null,"353":"I was thinking maybe we could explore that idea further, but I'm not sure if it's feasible given the current state of quantum computing technology.","354":"The number of scientists is increasing rapidly, and this will lead to more research and innovation.","355":"That's really cool, can you tell me more about how you applied your knowledge of condensed matter theory to quantum optics?","356":"Exactly, it's not just about adding more qubits, it's about understanding how to use them in a way that compensates for their inherent imperfections. We need to think about how to design the quantum architecture to mitigate the effects of noise and measurement errors.","357":"But don't you think that's a problem? That the public has unrealistic expectations about what quantum computers can do right now?","358":"and then the shape's texture starts to pixelate and eventually turns into a block texture.","359":"Yeah, and that's exactly what happens with fractals. The algorithm for drawing a fractal uses a recursive function to keep adding more detail as you zoom in. It's like a never-ending loop of detail that gets smaller and smaller, but never actually ends. And that's what makes fractals so useful for computer graphics, because they can generate an infinite amount of detail without ever running out of memory or slowing down the computer.","360":"They're a way of representing 3D models in a very efficient and flexible way, allowing for detailed and smooth surfaces. They're often used in computer-aided design, video games, and film. You might have seen them in movies or games without even realizing it.","361":"I'm showing you this because it's a way to visualize the process of subdividing a mesh, which is what subdivision surface is.","362":"It takes a long time.","363":"I think one of the biggest challenges right now is balancing the level of detail and accuracy in subdivision surfaces, while also keeping the computational cost reasonable. There's a lot of research being done on adaptive and dynamic subdivision methods that can handle complex scenarios, but it's still an active area of research.","364":"It was a network developed by the US Department of Defense in the 1960s, and it's often credited as one of the precursors to the modern internet.","365":"Packet switching enables a more efficient and flexible use of network resources. It allows data to be broken into packets, each with a header containing the destination address, and then transmitted independently over the network. This means that packets can take different routes to their destination, reducing congestion and increasing the overall throughput of the network. It also enables the creation of a network that is more scalable and fault-tolerant, as the failure of one link does not affect the entire network.","366":"That's right, if a packet gets lost, the sender can just send another one, and the receiver can still get the response.","367":"The seven keys to the internet are actually the seven layers of the OSI model, which are the Physical, Data Link, Network, Transport, Session, Presentation, and Application layers. Each layer plays a specific role in how data is transmitted over the internet.","368":"So, in a way, it's a decentralized system?","369":"Well, Wi-Fi speed is improving rapidly, but a tenfold increase is a significant jump. I'd say we're already seeing some advancements in Wi-Fi 6 and 6E, which offer faster speeds and better performance. However, a tenfold increase might take some time, possibly with the advent of new technologies like Li-Fi or even a new wireless standard. But it's hard to predict exactly when that will happen. Let's talk about the current Wi-Fi landscape and the factors that are driving these improvements.","370":"Maybe they're abandoned in a remote area","371":"That's a good start, but quantum sensing is more about using quantum effects to enhance sensing capabilities, rather than just computing.","372":"Yes, we are. The platform is a great example of how we can study the behavior of electron spins in a more accessible and controllable environment.","373":"Well, creating a diamond is a process that takes a lot of time and energy. We're talking about billions of years in nature. But in a lab, it's a matter of weeks or months. And as for the sensor, it depends on the type of sensor. Some sensors can be made in a matter of hours, while others can take weeks or even months to manufacture.","374":"And that's a state where a quantum bit can exist in both 0 and 1 at the same time, right?","375":"Exactly, so when you take this quantum system out into the world, the environment interacts with it, causing it to lose its quantum properties. But this interaction is what we're actually measuring. So, in a way, the quantum system is acting as a very sensitive probe of its environment, allowing us to sense things that would be difficult or impossible to measure classically.","376":"When two particles are entangled, what happens to one particle affects the other, even if they're separated by large distances. So if you entangle two quantum bits, and then you measure one of them, the state of the other one is immediately affected, which can make the sensor more sensitive to certain changes in the environment.","377":"Yes, because it uses quantum mechanics to measure time precisely.","378":"And if you could make those clocks even more precise, you could also potentially use them for other applications, such as more accurate weather forecasting or even better synchronization of global timekeeping.","379":"Well, that's where the internet service providers come in. They're like the highway authorities who build and maintain the roads. They connect your local network to the city network, and from there, it can connect to the whole country and even the world.","380":"Yes, that's right.","381":"They have special devices called repeaters that boost the signal, so the signal doesn't get too weak. They also have amplifiers that can increase the signal strength. And, they have special types of fiber optic cables that can carry more data at higher speeds. So, they can send data wirelessly across the globe.","382":"The reason you can access so many different movies or TV shows is because they're stored on servers that are connected to the internet. These servers are like huge libraries of content that can be accessed from anywhere with an internet connection. When you want to watch something, your device sends a request to the server, and it sends the content back to you over the internet.","383":"We can do that by defining a function that maps every element of the set to a unique element in another set. That way, we can say that the two sets have the same size, even if they're infinite, as long as we have a bijective function between them.","384":"You'd expect that because the integers include all the natural numbers, plus zero, plus all the negative numbers. So, for example, the number -1 is an integer, but it's not a natural number.","385":"and then we match -2 with two, -3 with three, and so on.","386":"And when I do that, I'm getting a natural number that corresponds to this slope.","387":"That's a good instinct, because the real numbers are actually much larger than the natural numbers, and even larger than the integers. In fact, the real numbers are so large that they're uncountable, which means there's no way to put them into a list and count them one by one.","388":"Exactly, if you add one to each of these, you'll get a new real number that isn't on the list. But I want to do something a little more sophisticated than that. I'm going to change each of these digits to a different digit, but not necessarily one more than it was before.","389":"We're looking at each digit of the given number and changing it to the next possible digit, which isn't in the list, ensuring at every step we have a number that isn't on the list.","390":"This has huge implications for set theory and the foundations of mathematics, as it shows that certain mappings between infinite sets are impossible, even if they seem intuitive.","391":"Well, one of the main areas where this knowledge has been useful is in the field of computer science, particularly in the study of algorithms. For example, there are certain algorithms that can only be proven to work in a finite amount of time if we use the concept of infinite sets and the cardinalities of different infinite sets. So, in a way, the study of infinity has given us tools to solve certain problems that we couldn't solve otherwise.","392":"What exactly is this thing that we're looking at?","393":"entanglement is when two or more particles are connected in such a way that the state of one particle is dependent on the state of the other even if they are separated by large distances","394":"missing turn of dialogue","395":"Explainer: so the qubits are made out of superconducting materials and that's what allows them to be in superposition and be entangled with each other","396":"Well, you would have to consider the principles of superposition and entanglement, and how they affect the way you structure your code, and the way you think about the problems you're trying to solve. You would have to think about how to break down complex problems into smaller, more manageable pieces that can be solved by a quantum computer, and how to write code that can take advantage of the unique properties of quantum computing.","397":"Yes, I think so. It's a region in space where the gravitational pull is so strong that nothing can escape, right?","398":"So, it's like how much sugar is in a certain amount of water.","399":"How does that affect its density?","400":"The gravity of the star is so strong that it warps the space around it, and that's what we call gravity. And if it's heavy enough, that gravity becomes so strong that it warps the space around it so much that it creates a singularity. And a singularity is a point in space where the gravity is so strong that not even light can escape. And that's what we call a black hole.","401":"Because of the strong gravity of the black hole, it warps the space around it, and the light gets pulled in because it follows the curvature of space-time.","402":"into space, so the chair would be pulled towards the black hole and you wouldn't have to physically move it, the space would be curved in such a way that it would move on its own.","403":"How do you think the concept of infinity influences the development of algebraic geometry, especially in projective spaces?","404":"It selects one element from a non-empty set.","405":"So I've also used it in the ultrafilter lemma, in the Hahn-Banach theorem, and in other places where it's useful to have a way to choose elements from a family of sets.","406":"So, the complexity is going to be more related to the number of devices you're managing, rather than the amount of data they're transmitting.","407":"That's right, it's probably more like bytes per second, so like 10 bytes or something like that, because it's just sending a single number, and then you have to add the header and the checksum, and it's not like it's sending a whole lot of data.","408":"I think that's a great idea. We could use this data to identify the sources of noise pollution in the city and work with the city to implement noise reduction measures. Have you considered collaborating with the local government or environmental organizations to make this happen?","409":"Well, that's a good point, but I think the reason we say knowledge is non-zero data is that we're not just talking about the data itself, but the process of how we got to that data, and what we did with it. We're not just talking about the raw data, but the reasoning, the inference, the conclusions we drew from it.","410":"For example, if you flip a coin, you can predict the outcome with a certain degree of probability.","411":"be aware of that knowledge.","412":"on a remote server without the server ever learning any information about the inputs or outputs of the computation.","413":"You can think of it as a permanent record of all transactions made on the network.","414":"Ah, I see what you mean. The sign I was referring to is the rapid advancement in quantum computing. It's a sign that our current methods of cryptography are about to be outdated, and we need to develop new, quantum-resistant methods of encryption.","415":"That's a great project. What have you found so far?","416":"I'm not sure about the prevailing wisdom because I'm not sure if it was ever true.","417":"That's true, but what's often overlooked is the role of black holes in the early universe. They're thought to have formed during the first few hundred million years after the Big Bang, and they played a crucial role in shaping the large-scale structure of the universe.","418":"That's what they say.","419":"And if it's the latter, with a high enough velocity, it could be catastrophic for the structures of both galaxies, potentially even sending shockwaves through the universe that we could detect.","420":"That's right, a supermassive black hole at the center of the Milky Way galaxy.","421":"Well, harnessing the power of a black hole is not a feasible way to travel, but it's not because of the power it has, it's because the power it has is not usable. The power of a black hole is mostly in the form of radiation, which we can't use to travel, and even if we could, the radiation would be so intense that it would destroy any spacecraft that tried to get close. We need to find other ways to harness the power of the sun.","422":"because we're really interested in doing things like quantum supervised learning and quantum reinforcement learning, and that would allow us to potentially solve some really hard problems in machine learning","423":"Well, one way to think about it is that in a quantum computer, you're not just changing the magnetic polarization of a bit, you're actually manipulating the quantum state of a qubit, which is a two-level quantum system. So instead of just having a 0 or a 1, you have a superposition of both 0 and 1, which means that a qubit can exist in multiple states simultaneously, and that's what allows quantum computers to perform certain types of operations that classical computers can't.","424":"Deterministic means that if you give the algorithm the same input, it will always produce the same output. So, if we can design an algorithm that meets this condition, we can ensure that the result is predictable and reliable.","425":"How does the robot's mechanical design impact its ability to handle different types of food?","426":"Well, for our team, we've found that a combination of these strategies can be effective. For example, we've implemented a system that provides task-specific support, such as demonstrations and guidance, to help the robot learn more efficiently. We've also experimented with sampling strategies that focus on interactions between the robot's hands, as you mentioned, to improve learning outcomes. However, we're still exploring the optimal balance between these approaches and how they interact with each other.","427":"The promising directions include, for example, better modeling of friction and other physical interactions, as well as more accurate representations of the environment and the objects within it.","428":"Fractals are geometric shapes that repeat themselves at different scales. They can be found in nature, art, and even some mathematical equations.","429":"How do they do that?","430":"And that means that if we look at the big tree, it should have two smaller branches coming out of it.","431":"I guess I would have to find a way to make it faster or find a way to make the tree smaller.","432":"I mean, it's not like you gotta be a pro or anything, but you gotta know the basics of it.","433":"How's life been treating you?","434":"But what about the case where encryption is bypassed or hacked? How do we protect users in those situations?","435":"Like, what someone is trying to say even if they don't say it directly.","436":"It means we can have applications that are more robust, more secure, and more reliable, which is exactly what we need for safety-critical applications.","437":"That's right, and the other thing that's really exciting is the ability to have a lot of devices connected to the network, and not just smartphones. It's about having the network be able to support a lot of IoT devices, sensors, and machines, and having a network that can actually handle that level of complexity.","438":"So, I've taken some classes on general relativity, but I don't think I've ever really grasped the concept of a black hole.","439":"Well, the formation of a static versus rotating black hole depends on how the star collapses. If it collapses in a very symmetrical way, it's likely to form a static black hole. But if it collapses in a more asymmetrical way, it's likely to form a rotating black hole. As for which one is more common, it's actually thought that rotating black holes are more common. The reason for this is that the universe is a pretty messy place, and stars are often formed in regions where there are other stars and gas and dust, which can cause them to collapse in an asymmetrical way. So, in general, we expect rotating black holes to be more common than static ones.","440":"Well, in quantum gravity, we're talking about a situation where the laws of physics are both general relativity and quantum mechanics. And one of the things that quantum mechanics says is that space is made up of tiny grains, like a grainy texture. So if you were to try to collapse a star down to a singularity, the grainy texture of space would resist it, and it would never actually form a point singularity. It would be more like a fuzzy, grainy, kind of thing.","441":"We can't directly observe what happens inside a black hole, but we can use the math to make predictions about what should happen, and then we can test those predictions by observing the effects of the black hole on the surrounding environment.","442":"Some of the ways we might be able to detect Hawking radiation indirectly include looking at the properties of black holes in the universe, such as their mass loss over time, or studying the behavior of certain types of particles that are thought to be related to Hawking radiation in laboratory experiments.","443":"text","444":null,"445":"This would enable more secure and private data sharing, without compromising the security of the cloud infrastructure.","446":"That's a good start. But what happens when you see a picture of a cat. Do you remember the actual cat or just the picture?","447":"Yeah, it's like the regret of maybe having made the wrong choice. That's a big part of it, isn't it?","448":"Will I grow out of this? Will I get bored of these flavors or will my taste buds change somehow?","449":"So you don't really think about what's behind the scenes, like how the data gets transmitted and stored?","450":"What's it about?","451":"and then maybe to a router, and then to a router, and then to a router, and then to the final destination.","452":"Actually, that's not as simple as it sounds. If we just let the information travel directly from the source to the receiver, we'd have a lot of problems. For one, it would be hard to manage and control the flow of information. Also, what if the direct path is congested or down for some reason? The receiver wouldn't get the information they need. Routing allows us to find the best path for the information to take, even if it's not the most direct one. It's a bit like finding the best route to take when driving somewhere - you might not always take the most direct route, but it's often the fastest and most efficient way to get where you're going.","453":"And if one path is faster or more efficient than the other.","454":"Lettuce is a type of leafy green vegetable commonly used in salads.","455":"And I think that's really the core of what my work has been trying to do, which is to apply some of these network science concepts to the study of the brain, and to see how the brain's connectivity and the flow of information through the brain changes over time, and how that relates to different cognitive processes and behaviors.","456":"Just as a symphony is not just a single harmony, the brain's activity is not just a single pattern, it's a dynamic combination of many different patterns.","457":"That's really interesting, because it sounds like you're suggesting that there's a kind of isomorphism between the way that we build mental models and the way that neural networks process information. Is that a fair interpretation?","458":"I think that's a great way to put it. The idea that memory is not just a static record but a dynamic process that's constantly evolving and adapting to new information and experiences. I like the idea of adding changeability and behavioral relevance to the definition. It makes me think of the concept of schema theory, where our memories are organized into mental frameworks or schemas that can be updated and modified as we encounter new information. It also makes me think of the idea of memory as a process of consolidation, where our experiences are initially stored in short-term memory and then gradually transferred to long-term memory, where they can be retrieved and used to inform our behavior. Do you think these ideas are related to what you were suggesting?","459":"I play a bit of bass, but I've never tried to play an electric guitar before.","460":"The explainee needs to know that the characteristics of the sound, such as its frequency and pattern, are consistent with the predicted signal from a black hole merger.","461":"Yes, there are effects, but they're incredibly small. The amplitude of the gravitational waves that we're detecting from LIGO are about a billion times smaller than the amplitude of the sound waves from the guitar. So it's not like you'd feel anything or hear anything. But the effects are there, and that's what we're trying to detect.","462":"What can you explain today?","463":"Yes, it's both, because it shows me that the system is trying to generalize, but it's not quite there yet.","464":"So, how do you think we can design robots or communicate their capabilities in a way that reduces this tendency for people to generalize?","465":"Can you give me an example of what you mean by 'lower level' and 'higher level'? For instance, if I'm looking at a chessboard, what would be a lower level task and what would be a higher level task?","466":"I think that's a really good point, and I think that's something that we're still trying to figure out. We're trying to figure out what kind of representations are necessary for a system to be able to understand and replicate human behavior, and whether or not it's more effective to try to get at that through a more grounded, continuous representation, or if it's more effective to try to get at it through a more symbolic, discrete representation. And I think that's something that we'll continue to explore and see where it takes us.","467":"That sounds really interesting. Can you tell me more about what specific aspects of social stimuli you're planning to focus on in your research?","468":"I think that's really interesting because it suggests that people's emotional experiences are not just a reflection of the stimulus itself, but also of their individual past experiences and memories that they're drawing upon when they're experiencing that emotion.","469":"is and what that emotional response means for how we weigh the importance of that experience in making a decision.","470":"The idea is that there are multiple routes to the same destination, and if one route is blocked, the brain can find another one to get there.","471":"But that's not always the case.","472":"We'll get to that in a minute. So, let's just get a robot to move around and see how it does with some obstacles.","473":"Now, I'd like you to take the penny out of your left hand and put it into your right hand again.","474":"Okay, now go ahead and try to touch the buttons again with your eyes closed.","475":"I think what's happening is that the complex calculations are often about processing data, but the simple tasks are more about common sense or real-world experience, which is still a challenging area for robots to master.","476":"No, they don't. They just don't have that same level of self-awareness. They can just kind of, you know, malfunction in different ways, but they don't know that they're malfunctioning in the same way that a human would.","477":"like, if the dog does the trick, you give it a treat, right?","478":"In a sense, yes. We have to be very careful about how we design our neural networks, so that they can learn and adapt, but still stay on task. One of the challenges is that as the robot is learning and adapting, it can start to see things that we didn't program it to see. So, for example, it might start to recognize a new type of object, or it might start to see things in a way that we didn't anticipate. But, we have to make sure that it's still following the rules that we set for it, and not going off on a tangent.","479":"I don't think so.","480":"What's so impressive about that to you?","481":"You can use it.","482":"that's when the real fun begins.","483":"That's a good point, but we have been able to simulate entire worlds in computer models.","484":"And that's what they did with the tree, right? They made it so that anyone could make a happy little tree, even if they didn't know how to do all the fancy stuff.","485":"Is that a definition or a description of infinity?","486":null,"487":"Because even if you lined them up side by side, the total length of all the jars would still be infinite, so there would be no end to the jars, and they would never actually fit in the room.","488":"You think it's unlimited, so maybe the question is about the nature of something being unlimited, and what that implies.","489":"of people walking into the frame.","490":"What does it mean?","491":"What does it mean for the penny to be in a state of superposition?","492":"I know, right? I was watching it and I thought it was going to fall apart at any moment.","493":"and that's basically what happens with quantum superposition, it's like your hair is in multiple states at the same time, but when you observe it, it collapses into one of those states.","494":"and it's not just limited to pennies, this phenomenon has been observed with particles like photons and electrons, and it challenges our classical understanding of space and time.","495":"Like, temperature or pressure or something.","496":"It's a big magnet and some radio waves, right?","497":"Now let's look at the cell membrane and the nucleus.

okay, everyone has biases. I'm happy to hear your thoughts on the cerebellum, though. Can you share your perspective on how it relates to the brain's sub-critical areas?","1":"I'd love to dive deeper into that. For example, what specific brain regions and processes are involved in the transition from wakefulness to sleep, and how do they interact with each other?","2":"It's a bit of a mixed bag, and it really depends on the individual, but generally speaking, amphetamines can disrupt sleep architecture, so you might see more REM sleep, but it's not necessarily better quality sleep. Modafinil, on the other hand, seems to have more promising results in improving sleep quality, but even with that, it's still not a guarantee, and it's also not a cure-all for sleep disorders. What's interesting is that research is still ongoing to better understand the effects of these interventions on sleep, and it's likely that we'll see more nuanced results as we learn more about how these drugs interact with our brain's sleep-wake cycle.","3":"The issue is that amphetamines can desensitize the body's natural response to sleep pressure, making it harder for the body to wind down and fall asleep, even after the stimulant wears off. This is because the body's homeostatic sleep drive, which is regulated by the accumulation of adenosine, is suppressed, and the body's circadian rhythm is disrupted. As a result, people who take amphetamines regularly may experience rebound insomnia, where they have trouble falling asleep or staying asleep, even when the stimulant is no longer present. This can lead to a vicious cycle of sleep deprivation, where the body becomes increasingly dependent on the stimulant to feel rested, rather than allowing it to regulate its own sleep-wake cycle naturally.","4":"I think we're getting into some nuances here. To clarify, amphetamines can disrupt the sleep-wake cycle, but I'm not sure if it's about skipping certain stages or not being able to fall asleep as quickly. Can we take a step back and look at the bigger picture? What are the key differences between the effects of amphetamines and other substances on the sleep cycle?","5":"So, you'd want to make sure participants are well-rested before the study and that you're not inadvertently causing sleep deprivation. You might have a plan in place to keep an eye on them during the study and gently wake them up if they start to doze off, or even give them a break if needed. ","6":"Hi, I'm here to take you on a fascinating journey through the mind-bending world of relativity, where time and space become relative, and the laws of physics are turned upside down. Are you ready to have your perceptions challenged and your understanding of the universe expanded?","7":"I think it's more like a culmination of all those moments, and then suddenly, you see a path that feels right, and that's what gives you the courage to make a choice.","8":"So, like, the major seven chord has a major third and a perfect fifth, but with a sharp fifth, it's like, it's enharmonically equivalent to a major third and a major seventh and a diminished fifth.","9":"I still remember that day like it was yesterday, and I'm not just saying that because it was the most surreal experience of my life.","10":"But what if being right isn't the point? Maybe we're missing the bigger picture.","11":"it's like a magnetic attraction","12":"I love that song! It's such an iconic hymn with a rich history. Did you know it was originally written as a poem by John Newton in 1772 and later set to the tune we know today?","13":"I can tell you a little bit about it. It's a classic hymn that's been around for a long time. It's a story about redemption and forgiveness, and it's often sung at funerals or other somber occasions.","14":"I think the melody is really memorable and the rhythm is more dynamic \u2013 it's like it comes alive!","15":null,"16":"I'm not sure I agree with that. It seems like you're saying that higher pixel density is the key to immersion, but I think there are other factors at play here. Can you elaborate on what you mean by'more immersive'?","17":"because now you can just imagine and create a world where it can happen, without the constraints of reality.","18":"That's a good start, but it's a bit more nuanced than that. Machine learning is a type of artificial intelligence that enables machines to learn from data, making predictions or decisions based on patterns and relationships within that data, rather than being explicitly programmed.","19":"I've been listening to her album 'Cry Baby' a lot lately, and I'm really interested in her use of dark, atmospheric soundscapes to explore themes of youth, identity, and trauma in her music.","20":"I'm guessing Spotify made that connection because you've shown a taste for Melanie Martinez's distinctive vocal style, which often features that filtered, deep sound.","21":"I think the machine can understand and generate a wide range of musical qualities, like pitch, timbre, and rhythm, but it might struggle with more abstract or high-level qualities like the way a piece of music makes you feel or the overall atmosphere it creates.","22":"I think it would be really interesting to see how it applies to other areas, like healthcare or education, where a machine could learn from a lot of data and help humans make better decisions, rather than trying to replace them.","23":"I think we've made significant progress in teaching machines to perform complex tasks, but there's still a lot to be learned about how to replicate human-like creativity and empathy. While machines can process and analyze vast amounts of data, they often struggle to understand the nuances of human emotions and experiences, which are deeply rooted in our biology and social interactions. This is an area where I think humans have a unique advantage, and it's something we should focus on exploring further.","24":"That's a great question! So, when space-time breaks down around a black hole, it means that the gravity is so strong that it warps the fabric of space and time in extreme ways. It's almost like the black hole is creating its own kind of bubble in the universe, where the laws of physics as we know them don't apply. Does that make sense?","25":"I think I might have misspoken earlier. When we talk about what's inside a black hole, we're really talking about the point of no return, the event horizon, and what happens to matter and energy as it crosses that boundary. It's not that there's a physical location inside the black hole, but rather a transition that occurs as you approach the singularity at the center.","26":"Exactly, and that's one of the reasons why detecting gravitational waves from neutron star orbits is so exciting - it could give us a unique window into the properties of neutron star matter, which is still not well understood.","27":"That's why we have such a rich understanding of it, with thousands of papers and studies published on the subject.","28":"But if it's computer science, you could end up in a wide range of roles, from software engineering to data science, artificial intelligence, and cybersecurity, depending on your interests and skills.","29":"That's a mind-blowing concept - if you can move through time, does that mean you can change the past or the future?","30":"I'm not sure I understand what you mean by 'time moving differently.' Can you give me an example of how that would work in a more concrete way?","31":"So, to break it down, time travel isn't just about moving through time, it's about navigating through the fabric of spacetime, which means you can take different paths, like the rocket ship example, to reach a point in the past or future, effectively allowing you to meet someone at a different point in their timeline.","32":"So, what does that mean for us, though? Does it change how we think about our own experiences of time?","33":"That's really interesting. Can you tell me more about how time dilation works, and what kind of effects it has on people who experience it?","34":"So, to make sure I get it right, can you summarize what you just said about the difference?","35":"The revised turn of the model, with any necessary corrections, in a string.","36":"That's a good start, but it's not quite that simple. Perspective is part of it, but the key point is that the geometry of spacetime is relative, and it's not just about how we perceive things differently. When you're on the train, you're not just moving through spacetime, you're also changing the geometry of the space around you, which is what leads to the strange effects we see in relativity, like time dilation and length contraction. This is because the curvature of spacetime is affected by mass and energy, so even if you're not perceiving it, the geometry of spacetime is actually changing as you move.","37":"What I mean by harmony in music is when a combination of multiple melodies or pitches come together to create a sense of tension and resolution, which can evoke emotions in the listener. It's a way of adding depth and complexity to a musical composition, making it more engaging and relatable. Can you tell me what you think about the role of harmony in music?","38":"I was thinking we could explore the intersection of those two ideas and see if we can distill something really unique and innovative from it.","39":"I'm not sure I follow, could you clarify how the math relates to the extra dimensions? I thought it was more about the curvature of spacetime in those dimensions, not necessarily about calculations?","40":"I think the anthropic principle is really interesting. It's the idea that the universe is the way it is because we're here to observe it. In the context of string theory, this could mean that our universe is just one of many possibilities, and the properties we see are what we'd expect if we're just a small part of a much bigger picture. Does that make sense?","41":"We propose a new approach to compactifying extra dimensions, which involves creating a localized region where the dimensions can spontaneously contract, effectively creating a compactified space within a larger space.","42":"I think that's a great point, and it's actually something we explore in the paper. We start with a specific type of symmetry that allows us to justify the large dimensions, but it's not just a straightforward assumption - we have to derive it from the underlying physics.","43":"So, basically, a P-brane can exist in any of these extra dimensions, and depending on the number of dimensions, it takes on different forms \u2013 a 0-brane is just a point, a 1-brane is like a string, a 2-brane is a membrane, and so on.","44":"So, it's kind of similar, but not exactly the same. We're looking at black branes in de Sitter space, which is a different story. And the key thing here is that these branes are stable, which is a big deal.","45":"And that's where the 'cylinder universe' idea comes in, where the four dimensions are wrapped around a circle, with the size of the circle being set by the balance between the cosmological constant and the electromagnetic field.","46":"I'm not sure if I should say that, but it seems like the compactified sphere is a kind of 'default' solution that minimizes the action, given its high symmetry. ","47":"I see what you're getting at! You're thinking of Neo dodging bullets in The Matrix, not quantum mechanics.","48":"what specific aspects of the relationship are being debated?","49":"I'm glad you're interested in learning more about how spacetime emerges from quantum mechanics. In The Dialogues, I explore the idea that spacetime isn't a fixed background, but rather it's an emergent property that arises from the collective behavior of particles. I delve into the concepts of quantum entanglement and non-locality, and how they relate to our understanding of spacetime. The graphic novel is designed to be an accessible and engaging way to explore these complex ideas, and I hope it will inspire readers to think more deeply about the nature of reality.","50":"Gravity. It's what keeps us on the earth. What do you think is the most interesting thing about gravity?","51":"The earth's gravity is what keeps us on the ground and prevents us from floating off into space, isn't that right?","52":"How can you say you can't see me waving my hand when you're moving your head to look at me? That's the point, you're reacting to the movement without actually seeing it.","53":"What's the most fascinating or surprising thing you've learned about lasers, even if it's just a little bit?","54":"Exactly, so the continuous wave laser is like a steady stream of water, but it's more like a gentle brook that's perfect for irrigation, whereas the chirped pulse amplifier is like a massive wave that crashes down, and that's what makes it so powerful for applications like cutting or material processing.","55":"Well, that's a fascinating question! If we were to push beyond this point, the laws of physics as we know them would start to get really weird. For instance, time dilation would become extreme, and space would become so curved that our understanding of gravity would be severely challenged. It's like trying to imagine a world where the rules of reality are no longer applicable. What do you think would happen if we could somehow navigate through that kind of environment?","56":"If we were to destroy the tumor cell, it would be more like using a highly focused, high-intensity laser to selectively target and heat up the cell to the point where it bursts, minimizing damage to the surrounding tissue.","57":"I'd be happy to help you find a reliable water filter for your backpacking trip. Can you tell me a bit more about your water needs? Are you planning to filter water from lakes, rivers, or streams, and how many people will be using the filter?","58":"I think that's a great example of how simplicity can be a powerful tool in game development. By embracing a low-poly aesthetic, you were able to create a sense of wonder and immersion that's often missing in more technically complex games. It's a great reminder that sometimes, it's not about pushing the boundaries of what's possible, but about creating an experience that draws the player in and makes them feel like they're a part of something special.","59":"I think that's a really good point, but we also need to consider the real-world limitations of our technology, like the need for a stable power source and a user interface that's easy to use. We can't just focus on the novelty of it all and forget about what will make it accessible to a wider audience.","60":"I think that's a really important point, because if we just unleash this tech without thinking about its impact, we could end up with some unintended consequences. We need to figure out how to integrate these advancements with our values, our ethics, and our understanding of what it means to be human \u2013 and that's a much harder problem than just building the tech itself.","61":"What specific aspects of biology, such as genetics or ecology, and computer science, like AI or data science, interest you the most?","62":"I think we're talking about spatial dimensions, like the three dimensions we experience in the world, right? We have length, width, and height.","63":"Just imagine this one going straight up and down, like a big ol' stick. Now I'll give you another one that's like a T shape with this one \u2013 see how it's all square?","64":"Actually, yes, there are. For example, in astronomy, they use a system called ecliptic coordinates. And in computer graphics, they use a system called spherical coordinates. Are you familiar with any of these?","65":"So, if we have those two numbers, we can plot a point on a graph. Let me correct that - we can actually visualize it on a graph, which is basically a map of all possible points with their coordinates.","66":"That's a good start, but we're looking for spatial dimensions, so how about a direction in space that you can't move in, like a direction perpendicular to the floor or a direction around the Earth?","67":"Well, when we put coordinates on the ground, like latitude and longitude, we're describing a specific point on the Earth's surface. It's like giving a address to a house. But when we put coordinates on the sky, like right ascension and declination, we're describing the position of a star or a planet in the celestial sphere. It's like giving a map to a specific location in the universe.","68":"Segments of an orange.","69":"latitude, longitude, and altitude, but these are not enough to pinpoint a location on Earth because of the Earth's rotation and the movement around the sun, so we also need to consider the additional dimensions of time and the position of the Earth in its orbit.","70":"It's kind of mind-blowing, isn't it? I mean, we used to think we understood how the universe works, but now we're faced with these mind-bending ideas that challenge everything we thought we knew.","71":"We've been utilizing X-ray telescopes like Chandra and XMM-Newton to observe the X-ray emission from X-ray binaries, and also employing optical telescopes like Hubble to study the optical counterparts, which helps us better understand the behavior of matter as it approaches the event horizon of the black hole.","72":"That's a good start, but gravity is actually a fundamental force that governs the motion of objects in the universe, from the falling of a leaf to the orbit of planets around stars. ","73":"Exactly, and it's also why we have high and low tides, right? The side of the Earth facing the Moon experiences a stronger gravitational pull, causing the water to bulge out, while the opposite side of the Earth experiences a weaker pull, resulting in a second bulge. This creates the rise and fall of the sea level we see as tides.","74":"If gravity were much stronger, it would be extremely difficult for us to move around, let alone jump or get up from a chair. We'd struggle to even lift our legs off the ground, making everyday activities like walking or running nearly impossible.","75":"I'd love to, but I'm a bit worried about bumping into anything. Can you give me a clear space to stand up in?","76":"You're really excited about something. What's going on?","77":"I was thinking that, but then I read that the spine actually expands in the weightlessness of space, so it's not a contradiction at all.","78":"Well, it's fascinating that the concept of gravity has been explored for thousands of years. The ancient Greeks, particularly Aristotle, were among the first to propose that heavy objects tend to move towards the Earth's center. However, it wasn't until Galileo Galilei conducted his experiments that we began to grasp the idea of objects falling towards the ground at a constant rate. And then, of course, Sir Isaac Newton's law of universal gravitation revolutionized our understanding of gravity, showing that every object in the universe attracts every other object with a force proportional to their mass and the distance between them. His groundbreaking work laid the foundation for our modern understanding of gravity, and it's still widely accepted today.","79":"I was just thinking, what if the heavy object was something really unexpected, like a giant inflatable unicorn? Would that change your reaction?","80":"I was thinking more along the lines of the unique circumstances of our project, and how they might affect the ideal number of team members.","81":"Actually, what's interesting is that your body is still going to follow the natural light-dark cycle, even with long days. So, you'll still be releasing melatonin when the sun goes down, which will help you sleep. It's not necessarily about the length of your day, but more about the timing of the light and darkness.","82":"I think you might be confusing a laser with a light bulb. A laser is actually a very focused beam of light, not a bulb. It's made up of a few key components: a gain medium, like a gas or crystal, that amplifies the light, and a pump source, like a light or electrical source, that excites the atoms or molecules in the gain medium, making them emit light at a specific wavelength.","83":"Exactly, and that's what happens with my laser too, but instead of a hammer and a nail, I'm using a beam of light and a surface. If the beam hits the surface at an angle, it will bounce off in all directions, but if it hits it straight on, it will penetrate deeper and stay on course, just like the nail when you hit the flat end of the hammer.","84":null,"85":"Exactly, it's like a magnifying glass, but instead of just focusing the sun's heat, it's focusing the laser's energy onto a tiny spot, so the cutting process can happen more efficiently.","86":"That's a great point, and it's also why we can't move faster than the speed of light, because if we could, we'd be moving through time as well, which would mean we'd be aging differently than everyone else.","87":"Yeah, and that's what makes them so hazardous to be around.","88":"and then we can see the light being concentrated onto the lens, right?","89":"I realized that my initial idea was not as clear-cut as I thought, and I had to re-evaluate my goals.","90":"Actually, I've been having trouble staying asleep lately. It's been a real challenge to get a good night's rest.","91":"There are different stages of sleep that we go through, and each stage has distinct characteristics, like slow-wave sleep, REM sleep, and other stages that are crucial for physical and mental restoration. Let me break it down for you: slow-wave sleep is when our brain waves slow down, and it's essential for muscle recovery and memory consolidation. REM sleep is when we dream and our brain is active, and it's vital for learning and memory formation. We'll go over each stage in more detail, so you can understand the different aspects of sleep and how they impact our daily lives.","92":"Actually, I think I might have confused things a bit. What we can tell from REM sleep is more about the quality of sleep, like how well-rested someone feels, rather than the quantity of sleep. And as for sleep schedule, we actually look at other factors like sleep latency, the time it takes to fall asleep, and wake after sleep onset, to get a better idea of someone's sleep schedule. Does that make sense?","93":"That's a good point, and it's also worth noting that our sleep patterns can be influenced by our daily routines, such as our exposure to screens and caffeine before bedtime, which can suppress melatonin production and make it harder to fall into a deep sleep. So, it's not just about the time we spend sleeping, but also about creating a sleep-conducive environment and sticking to a consistent sleep schedule.","94":"Actually, some animals, like bears and chipmunks, can sleep for up to five months during hibernation. But even outside of hibernation, some species, like dolphins and whales, can sleep with only half their brain at a time, allowing them to rest while still being alert to their surroundings. Isn't that fascinating?","95":"I thought it was challenging, but the professor's explanations really helped me understand the abstract concepts, especially when we covered the many-worlds interpretation.","96":"What's your take on quantum dots? I'd love to hear about what you know and how you think they relate to nanoscale devices.","97":"Actually, that's not quite right. The dimensionality of a nanoparticle is determined by the number of dimensions it has, not by its shape. So, a 0D nanoparticle would have no dimensions at all, not even a surface area. These semiconductors, on the other hand, are 0D because they're clusters of atoms, but they do have a surface area and a well-defined shape, even if it's just a cluster of a few atoms.","98":"I'd say we're in a very early stage of development, and it's difficult to predict exactly when these technologies will be ready for industrial use. The display technology might be closer to commercialization, but the quantum dot imaging and therapeutic applications are still largely in the research phase and will likely require significant advancements before they can be used on an industrial level.","99":"a super-strong, super-lightweight material that's being researched for all sorts of cool applications, from super-fast electronics to super-sturdy buildings!","100":"One of the ways we control the diameter is by using a catalyst to help guide the growth of the nanotube. It's kind of like using a cookie cutter - the catalyst acts as a mold to shape the nanotube. We can also tweak the temperature and pressure to get the desired size.","101":"Actually, the lights behind me are a type of display that uses quantum dots, but they're not directly related to the materials we're discussing. We do have some quantum dot displays around here that might be of interest to you, though. Would you like to take a look?","102":"It's a type of artificial intelligence that enables computers to learn from data and make predictions or decisions based on that learning, such as image recognition or natural language processing.","103":"I think the picture is definitely a cat, because felines are generally slender, have longer legs, and those distinctive pointy ears are a dead giveaway.","104":"What makes humans uniquely identifiable, aside from their ability to wear watches, and what would be the most striking feature to distinguish us from our feline and canine counterparts?","105":"That's right. The review is a comprehensive guide that includes all the topics, concepts, and formulas that will be covered on the test. It's meant to help you prepare and make sure you're familiar with everything you need to know to pass.","106":"Actually, I was curious about the latest breakthroughs in quantum physics, and I heard that you're an expert in the field. Can you tell me more about the recent advancements?","107":"I mean, it's hard to wrap your head around, but cells are like the LEGO bricks of our bodies. They're so small that you need a microscope to see them, and yet they're the building blocks of everything from our skin to our muscles to our organs. Isn't that wild?","108":"That's a great example of how fault injection can be used to recover secrets from a device, by attacking the authentication check rather than trying to solve the complex math problem itself.","109":"I see what you mean about making it more obvious. I've been trying to think of ways to visualize fault injection in a more tangible way, but I'm not sure what that would look like. Can you help me think of some ideas for how to do that?","110":"I think you're right, and I've been noticing that too. It seems like the industry is finally bridging the gap between research and implementation, and it's getting to the point where we need to focus on the actual security of the hardware rather than just relying on marketing claims.","111":"and the gravity becomes so strong that nothing can escape once you cross the event horizon.","112":"Actually, there's a movie called Interstellar that consulted with physicists to make sure their depiction of wormholes and gravitational forces was accurate. However, even in Interstellar, some artistic liberties were taken, such as the portrayal of time dilation. But it's a good example of a movie that tries to balance scientific accuracy with storytelling needs. What do you think about the trade-off between scientific accuracy and entertainment value in science fiction movies?","113":"Yeah, detecting black holes is tough, and most of what we know comes from how they affect the space around them. For example, if a star gets too close, it heats up and gives off a lot of light that we can see. Or if a black hole is spinning fast, it warps the space around it in a way that we can observe. So, even though we can't see a black hole itself, we can tell it's there by looking at what's happening around it.","114":"I think that's a crucial point. We should strive for a data collection process that's open and honest, and make sure the data accurately reflects the world we're trying to understand. It's not just about avoiding biases, but also about being mindful of how our models might be used to reinforce existing inequalities. That's a tough challenge, but one we can't afford to ignore.","115":"I think what's really key is that the people who are most impacted by these biases are often the ones who are least represented in the development process, and that's why it's crucial to have diverse teams and inclusive design principles to mitigate these issues.","116":"I think we're seeing a lot of adoption in the tech industry, particularly in companies that are working on data-driven products. They're already thinking about how they can document their processes and share knowledge across teams. In contrast, the finance industry is still playing catch-up, partly due to the sensitive nature of their data, but also because they have a lot of legacy systems that can be difficult to integrate with new documentation tools.","117":"I'm optimistic, but I think it's also because I'm seeing a lot of people who are really trying to make a difference, like the students you're talking about who are working with data that's meaningful to them. They're not just focused on the tech, but on how it can be used to solve real-world problems. And that's what gives me hope - that we're not just talking about AI for AI's sake, but about using it to make a positive impact.","118":"I love how tessellations can create a sense of movement and flow, even though they're static. Can you tell me more about how you design these patterns, do you have a favorite technique or approach?","119":"And what if you make the fold on the other side of the dot, like this, and then see how it interacts with the existing fold on the right-hand side?","120":"That's right. In origami, you can always reverse the folds by changing mountains to valleys or vice versa.","121":"I mean, think about it, when you fold an origami shape, it can either have three mountains and a valley, or three valleys and a mountain, but what I was getting at earlier is that these two patterns are actually the same thing, just seen from different sides.","122":"That's the twist, a fundamental fold that turns the paper 90 degrees, and then another 90 degrees, creating a distinctive rotation that's essential to building tessellations.","123":"I'm thinking that the idea you presented earlier about using a hybrid approach for the project might not be the most effective way to achieve our goals, especially considering the time constraints and the resources we have available. I'd like to discuss some alternative solutions that might better fit our needs.","124":"That's what I'm trying to say, that by studying these patterns in the brain, we can gain a better understanding of how our experiences and thoughts are connected, and what's happening in the brain when we have certain experiences or thoughts.","125":"But that doesn't necessarily mean the computer can't think. It's just that the way it communicates with itself is different from how our brains work. It's like the difference between a light switch and a map. A light switch only has two options - on or off - but a map can show you lots of different paths and possibilities. So, just because the computer uses a binary system doesn't mean it can't mimic the brain's way of thinking.","126":"We use a variety of telescopes, including Hubble, Spitzer, and ALMA. We also use ground-based telescopes like Subaru and Keck. For infrared, we often use Spitzer and WISE. For optical, we use Hubble and Subaru. We also use instruments like spectrographs to analyze the light, which helps us understand the objects' properties, like what they're made of, how hot they are, and how they're moving.","127":"Actually, yes, one of the goals of this project is to constrain the size and shape of the accretion disk and the surrounding dust distribution, which is really challenging because these systems are so distant and the resolution of our telescopes is limited. By combining data from different wavelengths, we can infer the spatial structure of these systems and gain insights into how matter is distributed around supermassive black holes.","128":"You can see it as a ring structure, kind of like a doughnut shape, where the dust is heated up and then radiates in the infrared, so it's like a big doughnut of dust that's lit up and visible to us.","129":"Does that imply that the formation of stellar mass black holes is somehow suppressed, or are we just not looking in the right locations yet?","130":"So, what would that mean for the surrounding space, with a black hole that dense?","131":"I think one of the key challenges with deep learning is that it's like trying to read a black box \u2013 we can see what comes out, but it's hard to figure out how it got there. So, it's all about finding that sweet spot where we can harness the power of deep learning without losing sight of what's going on beneath the surface.","132":"That's why you see a lot of these models just perpetuating existing biases and not really adding much value beyond what's already present in the data. However, it's also because the models are not being designed with a clear understanding of the context and the goals of the task, which makes it difficult to identify and mitigate these issues.","133":"I see what you mean, but don't you think that approach only really works if the creator is actually aware of the potential biases and is actively looking for them, and that's not always the case? In fact, one of the challenges with detecting bias in models like these is that the creators may not even be aware of the biases that are present, or they may be unaware of the context in which the model will be used, which can make it difficult to anticipate and mitigate those biases.","134":"One of the approaches to merging quantum mechanics with general relativity is string theory, which proposes that the fundamental units of the universe are one-dimensional strings rather than particles.","135":"because if you have two states that are not in the same world, it's not like you can just add them together, that wouldn't make sense, but what if we consider states in the same world, can we add them together then?","136":"You're suggesting that the early universe was in a superposition of states, where the density perturbations that seeded galaxies and stars could have occurred in different locations. This is a fascinating idea, but how do you think the act of observation or measurement might have influenced this superposition, causing it to collapse into the specific configuration we observe today?","137":"That's right, and as it loses mass, the black hole's event horizon will actually move further away from the singularity, which is the point of infinite density at the center of the black hole. This is a key aspect of Hawking's radiation, and it's what really changes our understanding of black holes and their behavior over time.","138":"Just as a hammer is specifically designed to drive nails and would be quite inefficient at trying to turn a screw, using a tool for its intended purpose allows it to work efficiently and effectively, making the task at hand much easier.","139":"I mean, we're still trying to map the stars in the observable universe, aren't we?","140":"But it's a fundamentally different perspective because instead of gravity being a fundamental force of nature, mediated by particles, it's more like the geometry of space-time itself arises from the collective behavior of these particles, which blurs the line between the 'illusion' and the'reality'.","141":"Let's break it down step by step. I can give you a general overview of the process, and then we can go into more detail on the specific steps involved. Would you like to start with the basics or dive straight into the technical aspects?","142":"So, you're all set to dive into the new software? I'm curious, what are you hoping to learn first?","143":"That's what I love about origami, it's not just about the final product, but the process of creating it, and how it brings people together.","144":"Explainer: Great job making your first origami crane! Now, let's practice folding one on our own. Can you try to recreate the petal fold and the steps we just went through, and I'll be happy to guide you through any mistakes or difficulties you might encounter. I'll also give you some tips on how to make your crane more stable and balanced. Are you ready to give it a try?","145":"Actually, I've heard of those before. They're like a paper fortune teller, right? I've made a few of those in school. But I've never actually learned how to make one from scratch. Can you show me the basic folds?","146":"You can put your thumb in the beak and make it sound like a crow by moving your thumb in and out.","147":"So, how do you think blockchain can help manage a distributed power grid? What kind of systems or processes would be needed to make it work?","148":"What kind of testing and validation are you envisioning, and how will that impact our understanding of the underlying mechanisms?","149":"because it treats the people as customers, not as individuals with their own agency and autonomy.","150":"I mean, we're always striving for perfection, but we have to start somewhere, right?","151":"Can you tell me more about what kind of information hackers might be looking for when they target someone's account?","152":"They use a combination of firewalls and intrusion detection systems to prevent unauthorized access.","153":"They'd actually create a fix for the vulnerability, so that people can't get in anymore. It's like, if your front door lock had a flaw, they'd find a way to seal it up so it's secure again.","154":"I see what you're getting at. They're trying to protect the original owner by making the new lock untraceable, but I can see how that might raise concerns about the person who gets the new lock being at risk of getting in trouble. It's a delicate balance between security and responsibility, isn't it?","155":"I started with simple tasks like trying to guess passwords and poking around on my dad's old dial-up internet connection. It was like being a digital archaeologist, uncovering secrets and exploring the unknown.","156":"Yeah, I realize now that I wasn't thinking about the potential consequences of altering the game's code, and that's something I should have considered before trying to hack it.","157":"I think so. I mean, it's not just about whether I like the idea or not, but whether others might see value in it and be interested in exploring it further.","158":"I think of those microscopic robots that could revolutionize manufacturing, but are still grounded in reality, like the nanoparticles that help make your water bottles more resistant to scratches.","159":"I was thinking it might be a transistor, but what makes you think it looks like one? Did you use a special technique to create it or was it just a random selection?","160":"That's a great question! It's actually a really cool process. Imagine you're a master artist, but instead of painting with colors, you're using light to draw the tiny patterns that make up the transistors. We use a machine called a photolithography tool, which is like a super-precise camera that shoots light through a patterned mask onto the wafer. The light is so precise that it can create patterns that are only a few atoms wide! It's like drawing with a pencil that's a billion times finer than the finest pen you've ever used.","161":"like something I'd really want in return, and I'd try to figure out what that thing is and why it's so appealing to me.","162":"I've heard that some people have discovered ways to find weaknesses in computer systems that the developers didn't even know about. It's like a puzzle to figure out how to fix it before it gets exploited.","163":"The camera is also an input device, it's taking a picture of you, and it's sending that image to me. I guess you could also say it's a way for you to share your view with me, like if you're looking at something really cool, you can show it to me!","164":"Well, that depends on the specifics of the cold boot attack, but essentially, the goal is to access the computer's memory before it's been fully powered down, which can be a matter of seconds. If the attacker is successful, they can extract sensitive information like passwords and encryption keys.","165":"That's a great question. The International Space Station is actually in a state of continuous free-fall, but it's also constantly falling towards the Earth at the same time. So, in a sense, you could say it's 'floating' in space, but it's not really floating \u2013 it's more like it's being constantly accelerated towards the Earth by gravity, but its velocity is just enough to counteract that acceleration, so it stays in orbit.","166":"That's wild, the idea that our perception of gravity is just a matter of acceleration, not the Earth's mass or anything else.","167":"Exactly, it's like a little lag between what you see and what your body feels, and it's really disorienting for a second.","168":"and then things start to get really wild.","169":"It helps your brain recharge, just like how a phone gets its battery life back when you charge it. It's pretty cool how our bodies have a similar mechanism to keep us going!","170":"I just got back from their flagship store and I'm still reeling from the designs - the way they've incorporated sustainable materials and bold patterns is truly innovative!","171":"Giraffes have a distinct approach to recharging, where they can rapidly drift off to sleep and then spring back to alertness, all within a short span, which is crucial for their survival given their vulnerability to predators like lions.","172":"To be honest, I've been feeling drained for a while now, but I think it's been getting worse since I started this new project at work. It's a big undertaking, and I'm not sure if I'm fully equipped to handle it.","173":"That's really cool, I was wondering, how do they manage to keep their blowhole above water when they're resting?","174":"but what if it came with a price we're not even considering, like a hidden cost to our planet or our society?","175":"I've always been fascinated by their ability to communicate with each other - what's the most interesting thing you know about dolphin language?","176":"They sleep with only half their brain at a time, so the other half remains alert and can help them surface for air, ensuring they stay safe while they rest.","177":null,"178":"Let me put it in perspective: if you were to zoom in on a one-meter line to the point where it's a billion times smaller, that's roughly the size of a nanometer. An ant, on the other hand, is about 1 to 2 millimeters long, which is much, much bigger.","179":"That's a great analogy with the StoryBots! Atoms are indeed the building blocks of everything around us, from the air we breathe to the Earth itself. What's fascinating is that when we're working at the nanoscale, we're essentially dealing with the very fabric of matter, where individual atoms or groups of atoms come into play. This is what makes nanotechnology so powerful \u2013 it allows us to manipulate and engineer materials at the atomic level, which has far-reaching implications for fields like medicine, energy, and electronics.","180":"I can already imagine the kind of incredible structures we could create with that level of precision and control - what do you think we could build first, a new kind of material or a working machine?","181":"We study really tiny things because they're the building blocks of everything else, and understanding how they work helps us create new technologies and make the world a better place!","182":"How about we think of it as a mountain that's been awakened, with a fiery heart that's been stirring beneath its surface for thousands of years? It's like a giant, slumbering beast that's waiting to unleash its fury on the world.","183":"I think that's a great point. We've made huge strides in the past decade, going from static images to fully immersive experiences. But you're right, we're still a long way from truly replicating the real thing.","184":"I think that's a good point about the audio and the power of suggestion, and it's interesting to see how that can be used to create a more immersive experience. But with haptics, I think it's a bit more challenging because we need to actually simulate the physical sensations, not just trick the user's brain into thinking they're experiencing something. The technologies you mentioned, like electromagnetic fields, are promising, but we still have a long way to go before we can create a truly realistic haptic experience. I'm not sure if it's a matter of just scaling up existing tech or if we need to fundamentally rethink how we approach haptics in VR.","185":"And if the audio isn't up to par, it can be a major barrier to getting them to fully engage with the VR experience.","186":"I think the force and field descriptions are complementary, rather than mutually exclusive. The force description is more intuitive, as it explains how gravity pulls objects towards each other. On the other hand, the field description provides a more nuanced understanding of gravity as a distributed phenomenon that permeates space and time. The discovery of gravitational waves, for instance, suggests that gravity is not just a static field, but also a dynamic and propagating force. This integration of different perspectives helps to deepen our understanding of gravity and its role in the universe.","187":"I'm not sure that's the best example, though. The gravitational pull of a mountain is actually really weak compared to the Earth's gravity. Maybe a better way to think about it is to consider the gravitational pull of the Moon or the Sun on the Earth.","188":"Exactly, and that's a crucial point. Imagine you're in that elevator, and the cable is cut. You're both falling together, and what you feel is actually the normal force from the floor of the elevator, not the gravitational force. The Earth's gravity is warping space-time, and you're following that curvature, so you don't feel the force. It's only when you're standing still on the surface that you feel the weight of the Earth's gravity, because you're not following the curvature of space-time as closely.","189":"I think it's fascinating to consider how this concept could revolutionize the way we approach [specific area of interest], and what potential benefits or drawbacks it might have for people like us who are passionate about [related topic].","190":"That's interesting, what do you think would happen to the object's velocity and trajectory as it approached the Earth's surface?","191":"I guess I was!","192":"I mean, it's wild to think about, right? We're talking about the entire universe, and yet, somehow, everything is linked together in ways we're still trying to understand.","193":"Let's focus on your question first. What specifically were you trying to understand about the concept of an extra dimension?","194":"So, Bela is a tool that allows musicians and sound engineers to manipulate audio signals in real-time, which is really useful for live shows and interactive installations. I've worked with it before, and it's amazing how much control you have over the sound.","195":"I think that's a bit of an oversimplification, though. String theory is still just a theory, and it's not yet clear if it will actually unify quantum mechanics and gravity.","196":"Actually, I think it's a type of succulent. I've seen them in some of the greenhouses around here.","197":"Now, if you extend that concept to two dimensions, you have a membrane that can vibrate, which is actually a pretty good analogy for a drumhead.","198":"String theory is one attempt to unify the forces, but it's part of a broader effort to develop the Grand Unified Theory. This idea has been around for a while, and many physicists have contributed to it. While string theory is a promising approach, it's not the only one, and researchers are exploring other ways to achieve this unification.","199":"And, if I'm not mistaken, it also incorporates the Higgs boson, which is a crucial component in explaining the origin of mass, right?","200":"That's right, and that's what makes blockchain so secure \u2013 it creates a permanent, unalterable record of all transactions, which is why it's often referred to as a 'distributed ledger'.","201":"And that's a game-changer, because machines can exhibit behaviors that even their designers can't anticipate or control.","202":"I think we can address those trust issues by focusing on transparency and education. If people understand how blockchain works and the security measures in place, they'll be more likely to trust it. We also need to improve the user experience and make it easier for people to use and understand.","203":"I think one of the biggest challenges will be scaling it in a way that it's accessible and user-friendly, not just for financial transactions, but also for other industries like healthcare, supply chain management, and identity verification, while also addressing the concerns around data privacy and security.","204":"One of the challenges we've seen with incorporating these nanomaterials is scaling up their production while maintaining their properties. To address this scalability issue, we're exploring more efficient manufacturing processes, such as roll-to-roll processing, and optimizing our synthesis methods to ensure consistent quality across large-scale production. Additionally, we're working on developing more robust testing protocols to validate the performance of these nanomaterials in a real-world setting, which will help us identify potential bottlenecks and areas for improvement.","205":"One of the main challenges we face is scaling up the production of these materials while maintaining their unique properties. We're exploring various methods, such as roll-to-roll processing and 3D printing, to increase the yield and reduce costs. However, integrating these materials with other battery components, like electrodes and electrolytes, requires careful consideration of their interfaces and interactions. We're working on developing new manufacturing protocols that can accommodate the nanoscale materials' specific needs, while also ensuring compatibility with existing battery production lines.","206":"I think origami's ability to create intricate, 3D shapes from a flat surface makes it a great fit for applications like this, where we need to transform a compact design into a functional product. The fact that origami can be both aesthetically pleasing and structurally sound is also a big plus.","207":"Actually, I was thinking more about the size of the wheel in terms of its ability to navigate different terrain on Mars. Can you tell me more about that?","208":"That's fascinating! What kind of medical devices have been using this material, and how has it improved patient outcomes?","209":"I'm really fascinated by the prospect of materials that can adapt and respond to their environment in dynamic ways. For instance, researchers are exploring self-healing materials that can repair themselves after damage, or materials that can change color or texture in response to temperature, pH, or other external factors. These breakthroughs have the potential to revolutionize various industries, from construction to fashion, and could lead to some truly game-changing innovations.","210":"I see, so you've heard of the term but aren't sure what it means. Let me try to break it down for you - a blockchain is essentially a decentralized, digital system for storing and sharing data, but I'm not sure I fully understand it myself, so bear with me as I try to explain it.","211":"So, think of it like a digital book that keeps track of all the transactions on the network. It's like a shared notebook that's maintained by lots of computers around the world, and it helps us trust that the transaction is happening without needing a middleman. This way, we can trade things like money, or even digital art or collectibles, without needing a company in the middle.","212":"That's right, so by cutting out the middlemen, the system becomes more efficient and cost-effective.","213":"I've been doing well, thanks for asking. I just got back from a fascinating trip to Japan, where I explored the vibrant streets of Tokyo and relaxed in the serene landscapes of the Japanese countryside. I even tried some delicious local cuisine, including sushi and ramen. It's always great to experience new cultures and broaden my horizons.","214":"Actually, let's dive deeper into how this association might play out in real-world terms. Can you help me understand what kind of timeframe we're talking about for the increased risk of Alzheimer's in individuals with sleep apnea? For instance, are we looking at a 26% increased risk over the next 5-10 years, or is it a longer-term effect?","215":"Actually, I was thinking more about the potential directionality of the relationship between sleep disturbances and neurodegenerative diseases. Is there evidence that sleep disturbances could be a contributing factor, rather than just a consequence of the disease?","216":"That's interesting, so you're saying that both beta-amyloid and tauopathies are linked to sleep changes in these mouse models, correct?","217":"I think the key here is understanding how sleep affects our brain and body, and how that's connected to our natural rhythms. If we can figure that out, it could lead to some major breakthroughs in preventing neurodegenerative diseases.","218":"This paper crane is a traditional Japanese art form that can be folded from a single sheet of paper, and it's often given as a gift to bring good luck, similar to the origami art we were discussing earlier.","219":"That's a creative idea, but a paper airplane is more of an object with shape and size, whereas a point is a very small and specific location. Let me try to help you think of a point - can you imagine a tiny dot on this sheet of paper, with no size or shape, just a single location?","220":"Actually, I think I was mistaken about the fifth circle. I was referring to the fifth feather on the wing, not a flap. It's true that it helps with balance, but I'm not sure about the steering part. Can you show me how it affects the flight of the crane?","221":"I was thinking maybe something simple like a paper crane, but I've also been wanting to try my hand at a more complex design like a dragon. What do you think?","222":"And so, I'm curious, how do you see this process unfolding, in terms of engineering the viruses and synthesizing the materials, and what role would nanotechnology play in bringing these two elements together?","223":"if the rocket's payload is not properly deployed, it can cause a chain reaction of malfunctions, affecting the entire mission's success.","224":"I'm using rectangles because it's easier to show how the folds work and how the paper becomes stiff. If I used squares, it would be harder to demonstrate the way the paper bends and folds.","225":"What I mean is that the motion isn't smooth the whole way, it's got this weird inflection point around 90 degrees where the speeds flip, and that's what makes it so cool.","226":"Yes, exactly. And the solar panels can unfold and then the mechanism locks into place, so it doesn't need to be powered anymore. That way, it's always generating power once it's deployed.","227":"So, it's because the thickness of the material affects the rate at which they diffuse?","228":"You're weighing the importance of symmetrical motion against the efficiency of packing, and the choice between these two designs depends on whether you prioritize ease of movement or compactness for your solar array.","229":"What makes this material or structure so unique, that it can change color when twisted quickly?","230":"That's a good way to think about it. But what makes it feel so immersive and realistic is the combination of advanced technologies like 360-degree video, spatial audio, and haptic feedback, which work together to create a highly engaging and interactive experience.","231":"I mean, what if we took it to the next level and made you feel like you're actually inside the game, like you're a character in a world that's completely immersive?","232":"How does the 3-D effect in movies make you question what's real and what's not, in terms of the environment around you?","233":"I've been following the discussions on the policy change. What specifically are you hoping to see come out of it, or what concerns do you have about its implementation?","234":null,"235":"I'm not sure I follow, can you remind me what we were talking about?","236":"Let me start playing it on the guitar, and I'll show you how the melody goes.","237":"What does the note on the line look like?","238":"That's really cool! I've always been fascinated by the mysteries of the universe, especially black holes and dark matter. What sparked your interest in physics, and what area of it are you currently exploring?","239":null,"240":"What do you mean by 'one dimensional'? Are you thinking of something specific, like a line or a shape, or is it a more abstract concept?","241":"How far along the line would you be pointing to, in terms of where you are on it?","242":"Can you tell me a bit more about the number that goes along with this unit? I'm curious to understand its significance.","243":"Actually, using points to describe a sphere in three dimensions is a good example of how we need multiple numbers to locate a point. But in one dimension, we can use a single point on a line to locate where we are, making it much simpler.","244":"I'm more conversant with the subject matter, which would allow me to break it down in a more straightforward and easy-to-understand way.","245":"I've been reading through some recent studies, and I think there's a new perspective on the topic that could significantly impact our understanding. What are your thoughts on the potential implications of this new research?","246":"and it would likely revolutionize our understanding of the cosmos and the fundamental laws of physics.","247":"That's a great example! In the case of Gmail, the machine learning models are likely being trained on a vast amount of labeled data, such as spam vs. non-spam emails, to improve their accuracy over time. This is an example of supervised learning, where the model is explicitly taught to recognize certain patterns or behaviors based on the labeled data it's trained on. I'm curious, though - how do you think the use of machine learning in email clients like Gmail has impacted the way we interact with our inboxes?","248":"the sender's and recipient's past interactions, the email's content, and any red flags that pop up.","249":"Yes, there are methods where the machine itself can learn features from the data without needing human intervention, such as dimensionality reduction techniques like PCA or t-SNE, but even more importantly, modern machine learning models have the capability to automatically learn relevant features through techniques like neural networks, where the model itself discovers the most informative features directly from the data, without requiring explicit human feature engineering.","250":"I think reinforcement learning is more about interacting with the environment and learning from the feedback, rather than just throwing a bunch of techniques at the problem. It's about finding the right approach through experimentation and learning from the consequences of our actions.","251":"So, to make sure I get it, you're saying that a deep learning algorithm is better suited for tasks that involve a clear input-output relationship, whereas reinforcement learning is more about learning through trial and error, right?","252":"I think that's a great example of how having a good predictive model isn't the same as having a good understanding of the underlying issues. If you can't explain why someone is quitting, you're stuck. You can't take any meaningful action to keep them from leaving. It's a bit like trying to fix a car without knowing what's broken. You might be able to make a good guess about what's wrong, but you'll never really know for sure until you take a closer look.","253":"One way to improve machine learning algorithms is to add more data, use different architectures, and implement techniques like interpretability and adversarial training to enhance the model's robustness and explainability.","254":"I mean, the wiring diagram is just the first step, but it doesn\u2019t tell us how the neurons actually work or how they behave when they're active or quiet, right?","255":"I see what you mean, and it's true that the sheer volume of information can make it seem like a daunting task. However, the idea of neuroplasticity suggests that the brain has a remarkable ability to adapt and reorganize itself in response to new experiences and learning. It's not about replacing existing associations entirely, but rather about creating new pathways and connections that can complement and even challenge our existing understanding.","256":"I was actually thinking about the idea of embodied cognition, where the brain and body are deeply intertwined, and the learning process is not just in the brain, but also in the body. So, I was wondering if you've explored this idea in your research on motor learning.","257":"Hello, I've been looking forward to our meeting and I must say, your new hair color really suits you!","258":null,"259":"That's right, so which method do you think would be more useful for our purposes?","260":"\u2014and ensure they remain in phase, so their collective energy builds up coherently.","261":"I'm not sure what you're getting at, could you clarify how the market for lasers is influencing the development of technologies like adaptive optics and wavelength control that we need for our beam control system?","262":"I think one of the most exciting areas we're exploring is using high-powered lasers for industrial applications, like precision cutting and manufacturing, and also for some of the more innovative ideas, like using lasers to propel objects in space, which could revolutionize space travel.","263":"That was a massive breach in 2013, where hackers stole sensitive information from Target's point of sale systems, including credit card numbers, names, and addresses. It's considered one of the largest data breaches in history, affecting over 40 million customers.","264":"Exactly, and it's not just the equipment itself, but also how these systems are often connected to the network for convenience, without proper security in mind. The penetration testers found that the deli scale was connected to the network using a default password that hadn't been changed, which is a huge vulnerability. If a hacker knows the default password, they can easily gain control of the system.","265":"A buffer overflow is a type of vulnerability that can occur in software when it's forced to store more data in a buffer than it's designed to hold. This can potentially allow an attacker to execute malicious code, which is a significant security risk.","266":"That's a classic example of a null pointer dereference, which can lead to a segmentation fault. It's a common mistake in C and C++ programming, where a pointer is used without being initialized or after it has been freed. Can you tell me more about the context in which you encountered this issue?","267":"I got interested in computer science because I've always been drawn to the intersection of technology and society. I think it's fascinating how computer science can impact and be impacted by global events, and how it's a field that's constantly evolving to address new challenges and threats.","268":"It's fascinating to see this internal conflict between the state department's efforts to promote free speech and the NSA's goals of surveillance, which raises questions about the potential risks of creating technology that can be used for both purposes. This highlights the complexities of balancing national security interests with the promotion of democratic values and freedom of expression, and underscores the need for more nuanced discussions around the ethics of internet freedom and censorship.","269":"I've seen some pretty cool laser demonstrations at science museums, but I've never really gotten to see one up close. What kind of lasers do you study?","270":"I've played with feather wands and catnip mice, but I've never really seen the appeal of laser pointers. I find them too intense for my taste.","271":"Exactly, a laser is like a super-focused flashlight beam, which is why it creates such a tiny, precise dot. Does that make sense?","272":"That's what I love about it - it's like a symphony of contrasts, isn't it?","273":"because it's going to follow the path of the least resistance, it's going to bend around the corner and come out the other side, kind of like how light behaves when it passes through a prism, and that's really cool because you can use that to see things that you can't see otherwise, like a hidden object around the corner.","274":"It's a picture of a lion, and it's kind of amazing how they can capture such a majestic creature on a tiny canvas, isn't it?","275":"Can you think of a specific time when that red light happened, and what was going on around you?","276":"That's not exactly the same thing, is it? Shooting stars are usually just a brief flash of light, but a laser light show is a deliberate display of light that can last for several minutes. What was it like to see a shooting star? Was it just a quick flash, or did you see it for a bit longer?","277":"Actually, I was more intrigued by the concept of exploiting DRAM's vulnerability to infer sensitive information, rather than the specific technique of inducing bit flips. I think there are other side channel attacks that could leverage similar principles, such as power side channels or timing attacks, but I'm not sure if the Rowhammer paper's insights directly translate to those areas.","278":"And that's the thing, the Rowhammer attack is a great example of a side channel attack, because it's not a problem with the algorithm itself, but rather with the physical properties of the memory, such as the capacitors and the electrostrictive effect, which can be exploited to extract sensitive information, making it a classic example of a side channel vulnerability that arises from the unintended consequences of the system's design and implementation.","279":"But with a good wireless router and a clear line of sight, you can get a strong and reliable connection.","280":"I think that's a tricky question. On one hand, if it's not possible to upgrade the system, keeping the vulnerability private could put people at risk. On the other hand, disclosing it could cause a lot of disruption if the system is still in use, especially if it's a critical one. It's a tough call, but I think the general consensus is that if it's not possible to fix it, disclosure might be necessary, but it should be done in a way that minimizes the impact on the users.","281":null,"282":"...","283":"I've always been drawn to the idea of buying and selling locally, so when I stumbled upon eBay, I thought it was the perfect platform to explore that concept.","284":"I'm curious, what do you think is the role of banks in facilitating or hindering economic growth?","285":"We could use blockchain technology to create a transparent and tamper-proof record of all trades, allowing us to automate the process of ensuring that trades are executed as agreed upon through the use of smart contracts. This would eliminate the need for intermediaries and provide a more efficient and secure way of facilitating trades.","286":"One way to keep it secure is through encryption, so even if someone gets their hands on the transactions, they can't make sense of them. And each person has their own special key, which they use to verify the transactions. That way, nobody can just pretend to be someone else and add fake transactions to the list.","287":"I can see you've put a lot of thought into this. I'm curious, what sparked your interest in this topic?","288":"I'm actually more fascinated by the intersection of physics and engineering with medical fields, particularly in terms of developing innovative solutions for diagnosing and treating diseases.","289":"Actually, I think I know of it! Isn't it a technique that allows you to amplify laser pulses while maintaining a short duration, which was a major breakthrough in laser technology back in the day?","290":"Yes, the premise is the same, but the process is a bit different. With other lasers, the pulse is already short, so it's like a hammer right from the start. But with chirped pulse amplification, we first stretch out the pulse to make it longer, and then we compress it back together again to make it short and intense. So, it's still a laser hammer, but we have to go through a few extra steps to get there.","291":"It's a component, like a mode locker, that helps us synchronize the different colors of light so that they can combine to create a short pulse, kind of like the conductor of an orchestra, making sure all the musicians play in harmony.","292":"That's right, and it's not just the harmonics combining, it's also the way the singers' voices blend together to produce those overtones.","293":"If we invert the F major chord, we get a B-flat major chord, which can create an interesting contrast with the A minor chord we got from inverting the C major chord.","294":"So, you're a musician, right? You seem to be familiar with chord progressions. What kind of music do you like to play or listen to?","295":null,"296":"You changed the melody and the harmony, and I think that's why it doesn't feel as happy as it originally did.","297":"It's like a map of the brain, showing all the different roads that neurons take to communicate with each other.","298":"If we took all of your memories, your experiences, and put them into a computer, would that computer then be a copy of you, or just a copy of your consciousness?","299":"I'm not sure, what do you mean by 'underlying reality'? Are you suggesting that our subjective experience is just a product of the neural activity, or that there's something more fundamental at play?","300":"I can see why you'd think that - the sheer scale of it is daunting, but what's really interesting is how it's actually a culmination of years of research and development in the field, which is why it's so groundbreaking.","301":"I think what made such a strong impression on me was the combination of my aunt's determination and the sense of responsibility that came with her request. She wasn't just asking me to play with a science kit, she was asking me to help her fight a disease that had taken over her life. That feeling of being part of something bigger than myself, and having the power to make a difference, has stayed with me to this day.","302":"I've been looking into how memories get stored in the brain, and it's really interesting to see how different factors like sleep and physical activity can affect that process.","303":"I see what you mean by questioning the distinction between implicit and explicit memory. In my research, I've found that implicit memory can be thought of as the automatic and unintentional recall of past experiences, such as habits, conditioned responses, or skills that we've learned through repetition. For example, riding a bike or playing a musical instrument are great examples of implicit memory in action. On the other hand, explicit memory refers to the conscious recollection of factual information, such as events, people, and places. However, I'd like to clarify that the distinction between implicit and explicit memory is not always clear-cut, and there's evidence to suggest that they can interact and influence each other in complex ways. Can you tell me more about what led you to question this distinction?","304":"Yeah, we're seeing some differences. For example, when we look at tasks that involve learning new skills, we tend to see more activity in the part of the brain that helps us learn habits and routines. On the other hand, when we look at tasks that involve forming new memories, we tend to see more activity in the parts of the brain that help us remember specific events and experiences. But here's the cool thing: we're also seeing some overlap between the two. It's like the different parts of the brain are working together to help us learn and remember.","305":"That's a great way to look at it. Math can be really counterintuitive, requiring us to think outside the box and approach problems from different angles.","306":"I see what you mean about the password manager being like a vault, but it's more secure than that. It's like a secure safe that not only stores all your passwords but also generates and stores unique, strong passwords for each account, so you only need to remember one master password to access them all.","307":"That's the beauty of zero-knowledge proofs \u2013 they allow you to verify your identity without revealing any sensitive information. It's like having a secure conversation, where you can prove a statement without sharing the underlying details.","308":"That's one way to think about it. But it's not just numbers, is it? Infinity can be time, space, even ideas \u2013 anything that just keeps going and going.","309":"I think what I'm trying to say is that infinity behaves differently than other numbers when you apply mathematical operations to it. For example, if you add infinity to itself, you still get infinity, which is different from how other numbers work. Does that make sense?","310":"Think of it like this: no matter how many guests we add, the total is still infinity. So, if we add a second guest, it's still just one more guest, but the total is still infinity.","311":"But we can't just let them move in with our current guests, can we? I mean, we'd need to find out more about their plumbing issues and figure out how to accommodate them without disrupting our guests' stays.","312":"You're essentially doubling the space each move, which is really clever!","313":"What I mean is that infinity is one of those weird concepts that can be approached from multiple angles in math, and each area tends to have its own way of thinking about it, which can sometimes lead to some pretty interesting \u2013 and sometimes pretty mind-bending \u2013 contradictions.","314":"Actually, it's a fascinating area of research that combines machine learning and natural language processing to create more human-like conversations. What do you think about the idea of having conversations with AI systems that can understand context and nuances like humans do?","315":"That's a great point! I was thinking more along the lines of sensor data, like readings from cameras and lidar, which would help the robot understand its environment and navigate through it.","316":"I think you might be surprised, but actually, motion is a pretty well-solved problem in robotics. What's much harder is understanding the nuances of context and being able to adapt to new and unexpected situations, like when the environment or the task changes.","317":"I think we're still facing a bit of a catch-22. On one hand, we need more data to train our models, but on the other hand, we need better models to collect that data in the first place. Using simulations has been a game-changer, but we still have a long way to go in terms of translating what we learn in a virtual environment to the real world. It's a complex problem, but one that I think we're making progress on.","318":"One common algorithm is reinforcement learning, where the robot learns from trial and error, and another one is imitation learning, where the robot learns by observing a human demonstrator and adapting to the observed behavior.","319":"How would you see a recursive definition like that being applied to fractals, especially in the context of the Mandelbrot set?","320":"Yeah, fractal dimension is a way to wrap your head around just how crazy intricate these fractals can be. It's not just about how much space they take up, but how that space is distributed. Think of it like this: a line is one-dimensional, a square is two-dimensional, but a fractal like the Mandelbrot set is like...well, it's hard to pin down, but it's like it's somewhere in between. It's got all these tiny details that repeat over and over, so it's got a dimension that's not a whole number. It's a way to measure just how much complexity is packed into these shapes.","321":"because it's the smallest number that gives us a stable pattern, meaning that once we reach three, we can start to see a clear and consistent progression of numbers, which is not the case with smaller numbers like one and two.","322":"What do you mean by 'dimension four'? Are you referring to the Hausdorff dimension of the coastline?","323":"Exactly, and that's because when you zoom in, you're getting a more detailed picture of the coast, which is way more complicated than just a simple line or curve, so you're essentially counting more of the nooks and crannies that make up the coastline's crazy shape.","324":"And another area where fractals are really useful is in understanding and simulating natural systems that repeat themselves at different scales, like coastlines, mountains, and river networks.","325":"That's exactly what I mean - Ken Perlin's gradient noise algorithm, which generates organic-looking textures, was a groundbreaking innovation in computer graphics.","326":"let it go so it falls out of its hands.","327":"a letter","328":null,"329":"So, you won't be able to see or understand the evidence or the reasoning behind why the statement is true, you'll just know that it is true. It's like I'm saying it's true, and you trust me, but you don't know how I know it's true.","330":"So, let's use this map three-coloring problem to create a zero-knowledge proof that lets you show you have at least 0.3 Bitcoins without revealing how you got it.","331":"We can use homomorphic encryption to encrypt the statement, and then employ a zero-knowledge proof protocol like zk-SNARKs to prove that the encrypted statement satisfies the condition of being three-colorable without revealing the account information or the amount of Bitcoins, thereby ensuring the privacy and security of the user's data.","332":"I'm not sure, it looks a bit off to me, but can you tell me more about what you're thinking? What specifically doesn't look right to you?","333":"I mean, it's like having a personal assistant who's already up to speed on your life, right? It's a huge time-saver.","334":"Well, the broader implications of zero-knowledge proofs are that they enable secure verification of certain properties about a system or protocol without revealing any sensitive information. This can be useful for proving the correctness of a system without compromising its security.","335":"the thing is implemented in various ways.","336":"Well, I was thinking we could start by exploring some real-life examples of AI-generated content that students are already familiar with, like AI-generated music or images, and then use those as a springboard to discuss the potential applications and implications of this technology.","337":"I think you're raising a classic debate in the philosophy of mathematics, specifically about the nature of mathematical objects. Some people think they're purely abstract, existing only in our minds, while others believe they have an objective existence, independent of our thoughts or perceptions. This is a fascinating area of inquiry, and it's great that we're exploring it together.","338":"I think the best part of the pool was when I went down the slide. It was so fast and fun, and the pool noodles made it feel like a big obstacle course. Plus, after getting out of the pool, I could play in the nearby sandbox, which was really cool.","339":"I think what I'm trying to say is that my towel selection skills are a bit lacking when it comes to distinguishing between similar shades.","340":"That's a good point, and it's not just about making space for new things. Research has also shown that as we age, our brains undergo natural changes that can affect how we process and store memories. For example, the hippocampus, a key region for forming new memories, can shrink with age. This can lead to difficulties in encoding and retrieving certain types of information, especially those that are less emotionally charged or less relevant to our current lives. Additionally, the way we consolidate memories changes over time, with older adults often relying more on gist-based memory, which focuses on the general meaning or content of an event rather than the specific details.","341":"You're on the right track, but the hippocampus is just one part of the story. Can you tell me more about what happens to those memories after they're formed in the hippocampus? Do they get stored somewhere else in the brain, and if so, where?","342":"Exactly! So, when you accidentally cut yourself, the amygdala helps process the emotional impact of that scary experience. This makes the memory of the event stronger and more vivid, which can help you learn from it and avoid similar situations in the future.","343":"And when we do, we're gonna get a longer measurement of the length of the coastline, because we're zooming in on the details of the coastline's shape, which reveals more of its intricate features.","344":"It's like, a shape that's got its own unique personality, you know? It's got all these tiny little features that make it really hard to pin down, but that's also what makes it so cool and interesting.","345":"It's great to meet you! I've been exploring this city for a few days now, and I'm still discovering new hidden gems. What about you, what brings you here?","346":"That's what makes it so engaging and fun to work with, don't you think?","347":"something as small as a grain of sand, but also potentially larger objects like a tiny pebble or a fragment of a shell, depending on the surface and the angle of the magnification.","348":"and we're using a non-destructive technique called terahertz scanning, which allows us to gather detailed information about the internal structure of the ball without compromising its integrity.","349":"I think the key difference is that when we're imaging big biological objects, we're working on a much larger scale, both in terms of time and space, compared to quantum systems. And the kinds of things we're looking at are also really different. With big objects, we're mostly concerned with how they behave as a whole, whereas with tiny quantum particles, we're dealing with their individual properties. It's a fundamentally different world of physics.","350":"Actually, it's the proximity that allows you to sense the electron's spin state, which is what makes NV centers so sensitive. If you're too far away, the signal would be too weak to detect. So, being close is crucial for observing the single-electron behavior.","351":"Yeah, it's amazing how easily our system can pick up external signals. I mean, who would have thought that our 100 megahertz experiments would be disrupted by FM stations? It just goes to show how important it is to understand our system's sensitivity and to be able to filter out unwanted noise.","352":"I see what you mean about the defects in the materials affecting the sensor. That's a great point. So, you're saying that the quantum noise is actually a result of the interactions between the materials and the quantum system?","353":"I was thinking maybe we could explore that idea further, but I'm not sure if it's feasible given the current state of quantum computing technology and the significant resources it would require. We should also consider the potential applications and limitations of quantum computing in this context.","354":"What I find particularly exciting is that this surge in the number of scientists will not only lead to more research and innovation but also enable us to tackle some of the world's most pressing challenges, such as climate change, sustainable energy, and access to clean water, which will have a profound impact on humanity's future.","355":"That's fascinating, can you walk me through the specific challenges and breakthroughs you encountered when transitioning from condensed matter theory to quantum optics, and how your background in superconductors and magnets influenced your approach to quantum optics?","356":"The key challenge lies in developing a strategic approach to harness the power of qubits while navigating the constraints imposed by their noisy and error-prone nature. We must delve into the realm of quantum error correction and explore innovative architectures that can effectively mitigate these issues, thereby enabling the construction of a robust and reliable quantum computer.","357":"I think that's a major concern. If people expect too much, too soon, it could lead to a lot of disappointment and potentially even undermine trust in the technology. We need to be honest about what we can realistically achieve in the short term and focus on educating the public about the actual capabilities and limitations of quantum computing.","358":"That's right, and if you get even closer, the block's texture will start to distort and break apart, revealing the underlying block structure.","359":"Yeah, and that's exactly what happens with fractals. The algorithm for drawing a fractal uses a recursive function to keep adding more detail as you zoom in, which is a key property of fractals that allows them to exhibit self-similarity at different scales. This property makes fractals particularly well-suited for computer graphics, where we need to generate detailed images that can be zoomed in on without losing quality.","360":"I think they were actually covered in the advanced modeling class. But even if you didn't take that one, you might have used them in a project without realizing it. Can you think of any 3D models or scenes that you particularly liked or found impressive in your graphics class?","361":"I'm showing you this because it helps to illustrate the concept of how subdivision surface works, by making it more tangible and easier to understand.","362":"Well, it depends on the complexity of the scene and the desired level of detail. But to give you a rough idea, for a typical Pixar movie, it can take anywhere from several weeks to several months to render a single frame.","363":"I think one of the biggest challenges right now is finding ways to effectively integrate fractal geometry with subdivision surfaces, while also addressing the limitations of current algorithms in handling high-frequency details. For example, some subdivision methods can struggle with preserving the intricate patterns and structures that fractals are known for, which can lead to a loss of detail and accuracy. Researchers are exploring new approaches, such as using fractal-based subdivision schemes or combining fractals with other techniques like mesh refinement, to overcome these challenges. However, there's still a need for more work in this area to fully leverage the potential of fractals in computer science.","364":"I think it was a network developed by the US Department of Defense. Can you tell me more about what you're looking for in terms of its history?","365":"Packet switching revolutionized the way data is transmitted over a network by breaking it down into smaller packets, each with a header containing the destination address. This allows packets to take different routes to their destination, reducing congestion and increasing the overall throughput of the network. Moreover, packet switching enables the creation of a network that is highly scalable and fault-tolerant. If one link fails, the network can still function, as packets can be rerouted through alternative paths. This flexibility and redundancy are key benefits of packet switching, enabling the development of modern communication networks that can handle a vast amount of data and support a wide range of applications.","366":"Exactly, and that's why it's like a request-response protocol, where the sender can retry if the packet doesn't get through, and the receiver can still respond once it receives the packet.","367":"The seven keys to the internet are actually the seven layers of the OSI model, which are the Physical, Data Link, Network, Transport, Session, Presentation, and Application layers. Each layer has a unique function in facilitating data transfer over the internet, from the Physical layer handling the physical connections to the Application layer handling the actual data being sent.","368":"So, in a sense, it's a distributed system where no single entity has the power to dictate the direction or outcome, correct?","369":"Well, wireless internet speeds are advancing at a rapid pace, but a tenfold boost is a substantial leap. We're already witnessing some significant gains with newer wireless technologies, which are delivering faster data transfer rates and enhanced performance. However, predicting exactly when we'll see such a substantial increase is challenging. Let's explore the current wireless landscape and the key factors driving these improvements.","370":"Maybe they're lost in a dense forest, or left behind at a bus station, or even dumped in a dumpster somewhere along the way.","371":"That's a good start, but quantum sensing is more about leveraging quantum mechanics to amplify or manipulate sensing signals, rather than just relying on traditional methods.","372":"Absolutely, we're actually leveraging this platform to investigate the spin dynamics of electrons in a way that's both practical and theoretically sound.","373":"Well, creating a diamond is a pretty labor-intensive process that requires a ton of time and energy, whether we're talking about billions of years in nature or just a few weeks or months in a lab. As for the sensor, it's a bit of a mixed bag \u2013 some types can be whipped up in a matter of hours, while others take weeks or even months to manufacture.","374":null,"375":"Exactly, so when you take this quantum system out into the world, the environment starts to 'talk back' to it, essentially, and that's what we're measuring. It's as if the quantum system is acting like a super-sensitive antenna, picking up on even the slightest changes in its surroundings.","376":"By entangling two qubits, you create a shared quantum state, where the properties of one qubit are intricately linked to the properties of the other, even when they're physically separated. This allows you to leverage the entanglement to amplify the sensor's sensitivity to specific environmental changes, but it also introduces a delicate balance between sensitivity and stability.","377":"That's really cool! But how does it use quantum mechanics to achieve such high precision?","378":"That's really interesting, because if we can get atomic clocks to be even more precise, we might be able to use them to improve the accuracy of self-driving cars, for example, by providing them with more reliable location information.","379":"Well, that's where the internet service providers come in. They're like the highway authorities who build and maintain the roads, but in this case, they're providing a connection to the global network. They make sure your local network is connected to the wider internet, so you can access all the information and services you need.","380":"There are undersea cables that connect the East Coast of the United States to Australia, allowing for direct communication between the two regions. ","381":"They use special devices to boost the signal and send data wirelessly across the globe, kind of like how Wi-Fi works in our homes, but on a much bigger scale.","382":"So, it's kind of like a giant library that's available everywhere. When you want to watch something, your device sends a request and the content is delivered to you over the internet. That's why you can access so many different movies and shows from one place.","383":"That's a great question, and it's actually a challenge that mathematicians have grappled with for centuries. Comparing infinite sets seems counterintuitive, but the concept of a bijective function helps us do just that. By establishing a one-to-one correspondence between the elements of two sets, we can say that they have the same size, even if they're both infinite. This idea might seem abstract, but it's a powerful tool for reasoning about infinity and understanding the nature of mathematical sets.","384":"So, intuitively, you'd expect that because the integers include all the natural numbers, plus zero, plus all the negative numbers.","385":"and then we'd match -2 with the next natural number, -3 with the next one after that, and so on.","386":"And when I do that, I'm effectively encoding the slope as a natural number, which, as you've seen, has a one-to-one correspondence with the rational numbers, allowing me to harness the power of counting to reveal the cardinality of the set of rational numbers.","387":"What do you mean by uncountable, exactly?","388":"I'm going to change each of these digits to a different digit, but not necessarily one more than it was before, and I'll make sure to choose a digit that's different from the original one.","389":"We're basically looking at each digit one by one, and for each one, we're changing it to the next digit that isn't in the list, so we're guaranteed to have a new number that isn't on the list at each step.","390":"This finding has significant repercussions for set theory and the foundations of mathematics, as it highlights the limitations of certain mappings between infinite sets, which may initially seem plausible but are ultimately unachievable. It also underscores the importance of rigor and precision in mathematical reasoning, as the absence of a bijection between the natural numbers and the real numbers demonstrates the need for careful consideration of the underlying mathematical structures.","391":"Well, one of the main areas where this knowledge has been useful is in computer science, particularly in the field of algorithms. For instance, some algorithms can only be proven to work efficiently if we consider the properties of infinite sets. This has led to the development of more effective solutions to certain problems that were previously intractable.","392":"It looks like a superconducting circuit, which is a key component of a quantum computer. The materials used here are designed to conduct electricity with zero resistance, allowing for the precise control of quantum states.","393":"Entanglement is actually a phenomenon where the properties of two or more particles become correlated, even when they're separated by large distances. For example, if you measure the spin of one particle, you instantly affect the spin of the other, regardless of the distance between them.","394":"I'm not sure I understand what you mean by 'ambient wavelengths' - could you clarify what you're thinking of?","395":"So, to clarify, qubits are made from superconducting materials, which is what enables them to exist in multiple states at once and get entangled with each other. Think of it like a special kind of material that can do things that regular materials can't.","396":"You'd have to think about how to use quantum computers to speed up certain parts of your program, and how to write code that can take advantage of that.","397":"Yes, I believe it's a point in space where gravity is so intense that not even light can escape once it gets too close, isn't that what they call it?","398":"That's a good analogy, but I was thinking more along the lines of how much of it is dissolved in a given volume of liquid, like a solution.","399":"Does its increased density change how it interacts with other objects?","400":"Well, it's a bit counterintuitive, but even a small star can collapse into a black hole if it's massive enough. The key factor is not the size of the star, but its mass. If a star is massive enough, its gravity will be so strong that it warps the space around it, creating a singularity, and that's when a black hole forms. The size of the star doesn't matter as much as its mass.","401":"That's right, the strong gravity of the black hole warps the space around it, and the light gets bent towards it, kind of like how a heavy object can warp a trampoline, and anything on the trampoline will follow that curvature.","402":"Exactly, and that's a really cool way to think about it - that the space around the black hole is being warped, so instead of physically moving the chair, the chair would be drawn towards the black hole, following the curvature of space.","403":"I'm curious to know more about how the concept of infinity affects the geometric properties of projective spaces, such as how it enables the intersection of parallel lines and whether there are any implications for our understanding of space and its topological features.","404":"Think of it like choosing a restaurant for dinner - you have a list of options, and the choice function selects just one of them, giving you a specific place to go.","405":"I've used it in various contexts where it helps to make a selection from multiple sets, such as in Zorn's lemma and the well ordering principle. It's a useful tool to have in your toolkit.","406":"So, the complexity will mainly depend on how many devices you're handling, rather than how much data they're sending.","407":null,"408":"I think that's a fantastic approach. We could leverage this data to pinpoint the primary sources of noise pollution in the city and collaborate with city planners and environmental groups to develop targeted strategies for mitigating noise pollution. Perhaps we could also explore the potential for integrating noise-reducing technologies into urban design, such as green roofs or noise-absorbing materials. This could not only improve the quality of life for residents but also enhance the overall aesthetic appeal of the city.","409":"I think we're using the term 'non-zero data' to highlight the fact that knowledge involves not just the data itself, but the context, the analysis, and the insights we derive from it.","410":"I mean, think about it \u2013 you can anticipate the outcome of a coin toss with a certain level of certainty, but that's because the possible outcomes are well-defined and the coin's behavior is governed by known laws of physics.","411":"I get what you mean. People can't just tap into that knowledge all the time.","412":"without the server ever knowing what you're working on.","413":"That's a great way to put it. But what I'd like to know is, how does this permanent record ensure the integrity of the transactions on the network?","414":"I think you're pointing to the intersection of quantum computing and cryptography. The rapid advancements in quantum computing are indeed forcing us to rethink our current encryption methods, and exploring new ways to secure data in a post-quantum world.","415":"That's really cool. What have you discovered about the star formation patterns in the LMC so far?","416":"I'm not sure about the prevailing wisdom, but I think it's interesting that we used to think that, and I'd love to hear more about what's changed in recent studies.","417":"That's true, but I think you're getting at the fact that most of our understanding of black holes comes from their formation through star collapse. Can you tell me more about what you're interested in learning about black holes, specifically?","418":"They claim to be close, but it's hard to tell when they're all stuck in their own orbits.","419":"But if the velocity is high enough, it could lead to a chaotic and potentially catastrophic collision, causing massive disruptions to both galaxies, including the merger of the two black holes, and potentially even sending shockwaves that could be detected throughout the universe.","420":"That's right, a supermassive black hole is located at the center of the Milky Way galaxy, which is actually the one that our solar system is a part of.","421":"I don't think harnessing a black hole's energy is a viable option for space travel. The problem is that most of its power comes in the form of intense radiation, which is basically useless to us. And even if we could somehow harness it, the radiation would be so strong it would incinerate any spacecraft that tried to get close. We need to look for other ways to tap into the sun's energy if we want to explore the cosmos beyond our neighborhood.","422":"because we're really interested in exploring how quantum computing can enhance machine learning algorithms, particularly in areas like quantum supervised learning and quantum reinforcement learning, which could help us tackle complex challenges in the field.","423":"You see, in a quantum computer, you're not just flipping a switch like you do in a regular computer. You're actually working with something called a qubit, which can be in two states at the same time. That's what makes quantum computers so powerful.","424":"Deterministic means that if you give the algorithm the same input, it will always produce the same output. But the key challenge here is to design an algorithm that meets this condition, considering the complexity of the problem we're trying to solve.","425":"How does the robot's gripper and manipulation system affect its ability to pick up and handle different textures and shapes of food?","426":"I think we've found that a key factor is the quality of the feedback we provide to the robot during the learning process. By fine-tuning the feedback mechanisms, we've seen significant improvements in learning efficiency. But I'd love to hear more about your experiences with sampling strategies - what types of interactions have you found to be most useful for learning?","427":"I think you're getting at the idea that we need to bridge the gap between simulation and reality. One promising direction could be to incorporate more realistic physics engines and sensorimotor feedback into our simulators, so that the agents learn to interact with the environment in a way that's more similar to how they would in the real world.","428":"I'm excited to introduce you to this mind-blowing world! Fractals are like these incredible patterns that show up everywhere, from the branching of trees to the shape of mountains, and even in the intricate designs of some cultures' art. They have this amazing property of self-similarity, which means they look the same at different scales \u2013 it's like a never-ending puzzle that repeats itself in a mesmerizing way.","429":"Well, they use something called a neural network to create a computer program that can understand and replicate the structure and visual characteristics of a tree, kind of like how our brains work when we imagine a tree.","430":"That's a great observation! So, if we apply our rule, the big tree should have two smaller branches splitting off from it, right? And if that's the case, we might be able to use this to figure out what happened to the branch that broke off.","431":"I guess I would have to find a way to make it faster, or scale down the design to make the tree smaller and more efficient.","432":"I mean, it's not that hard to learn the basics of programming, and there are even some online resources and tutorials that can help you get started.","433":"I've been keeping busy with work, actually. I just got back from a conference in San Francisco where I gave a talk on sustainable architecture. It's an area I'm really passionate about, and I'm excited to implement some of the ideas I learned into our next project.","434":"But what about when encryption is compromised? How do we safeguard users in those cases?","435":"When someone's words don't quite match their tone, it's like they're saying one thing but really getting at something else.","436":"That's right, which can ultimately lead to more trustworthy and resilient systems that better serve our needs.","437":"I think what's really exciting is that 5G isn't just about speed, it's about the possibilities that come with it, like being able to connect a lot more devices and machines, and having a network that can handle that complexity in a seamless way.","438":"I've been trying to wrap my head around it too, especially since we're covering Hawking radiation in my cosmology class. It's really mind-bending to think that a black hole isn't just a void, but it has this intense gravitational pull that warps space and time around it.","439":"I think what I was trying to say is that the way a star collapses can affect whether it becomes a static or rotating black hole. If it collapses in a pretty symmetrical way, it's more likely to be static. But if it's a bit of a messy collapse, it's more likely to be rotating. And actually, I think rotating black holes are probably more common because, well, the universe is a pretty chaotic place and stars are often formed in areas with other stars and gas and dust, which can mess up the collapse. Does that make sense?","440":"Well, in quantum gravity, we're talking about a situation where the laws of physics are both general relativity and quantum mechanics. And one of the things that quantum mechanics says is that space isn't smooth \u2013 it's more like a bunch of tiny, grainy bits. So if you were to try to collapse a star down to a point, those grainy bits would get in the way, and it would never actually form a single point. It would be more like a fuzzy, grainy mess.","441":"Well, that's a great question, Jayda. We can't directly observe what happens inside a black hole, but the math gives us a framework to make educated guesses about what might happen. And then, by observing the effects of the black hole on the surrounding space, we can test those predictions and refine our understanding. Think of it like a scientific hypothesis: we use the math to propose what should happen, and then we test it against the data we collect from observations.","442":"One way we might be able to detect Hawking radiation indirectly is by looking at the properties of black holes in the universe, such as their mass loss over time, and comparing that to the predictions made by Hawking's theory. Another approach is to study the behavior of certain types of particles, such as Hawking radiation-like particles that are produced in high-energy collisions, or particles that are thought to be related to Hawking radiation in certain astrophysical environments, like neutron stars or supernovae remnants.","443":"That's a fascinating area of research. I was wondering, have you given any thought to how these observations could potentially be used to test the firewall paradox, or whether that's a separate line of inquiry?","444":"The interesting thing about that is that it starts to blur the line between what we typically think of as randomness and what we typically think of as determinism. Would you say that's a fair interpretation, or is there something else going on here?","445":"That's really exciting! Can you elaborate on how zero-knowledge proofs would work in this context, and what kind of implications this could have for data sharing and cloud security?","446":"That's a good start. But when you see a picture of a cat, do you recall the real-life cat or just the visual representation of it?","447":"And that's what I think happened here - you were weighing the pros and cons of each option, and the uncertainty of it all left you with a sense of 'what if?'","448":"Do you think you'll ever get tired of the same old flavors or will you always be a Pixie Sticks or Sour Patch Kids kind of person?","449":"So you don't think about the infrastructure that makes the internet work, like how data centers and servers handle the flow of information?","450":"I've always loved the magical and empowering story of Matilda, where a brilliant and kind young girl stands up to her cruel and neglectful parents and finds solace and acceptance in her teacher, Miss Honey.","451":"and then maybe through a series of routers, which would direct it to its final destination.","452":"I see what you mean, but it's not that straightforward. If we just sent the info directly from the source to the receiver, we'd run into a whole host of issues. For one, it'd be tough to keep track of everything and make sure it all gets where it needs to go. Plus, what if the direct route is clogged or down for some reason? The receiver would be stuck without the info they need. Routing is like having a GPS for data \u2013 it finds the best route to take, even if it's not the most direct one, to get the info where it needs to go efficiently.","453":"That's a great point! But what if the multiple paths also represent different trade-offs? For instance, one path might be faster, but it could be more energy-intensive or have higher latency. How do you think we should balance these competing priorities in network routing?","454":"I'm fascinated by the different types of lettuce - have you ever tried growing your own lettuce in a garden? I had a friend who swore by it and claimed it tasted so much better than store-bought lettuce.","455":"And I think that's really the core of what my work has been trying to do - figure out how the brain's connections and information flow change over time, and how that affects things like thinking and behavior.","456":"I think that's a great way to put it, and it highlights the importance of considering the brain as a complex system, where different components are working together in a dynamic and coordinated way, much like the different instruments in a symphony.","457":"That's a fascinating connection to make. I'd say that's a fair interpretation, but what I'm getting at is that the relationship between mental models and neural networks is more nuanced. In neural networks, we see how the architecture of the network influences the way it processes information, whereas in the mind, the mental model is more of an emergent property that arises from the interactions between different components. So, while there may be some similarities, I think it's more accurate to say that mental models are a product of the brain's ability to integrate and generalize information, rather than a direct isomorphism with the neural network architecture.","458":"I think that's a great way to put it. The idea that memory is not just a static record but a dynamic process that's constantly evolving and adapting to new information and experiences. I like the idea of adding changeability and behavioral relevance to the definition. It makes me think of the concept of schema theory, where our memories are organized into mental frameworks or schemas that can be updated and modified as we encounter new information. This process of updating and modifying our schemas can be thought of as a form of consolidation, where our experiences are gradually integrated into our existing knowledge and understanding. I also think it's interesting to consider how this dynamic process of memory formation and updating can be influenced by factors such as attention, emotion, and social context, which can all impact how we encode and retrieve memories. Do you think these ideas are related to what you were suggesting?","459":"Actually, I've been playing the electric guitar for years, and I've always been fascinated by the connection between music and astrophysics. I've even written a few songs inspired by black holes and the universe.","460":"The characteristics of the sound, such as its frequency and pattern, are consistent with the predictions of general relativity and the expected signal from a black hole merger, which was detected by LIGO in 2015.","461":"Actually, I was trying to downplay the effects of gravitational waves on Earth, but that might not be the most accurate statement. What I mean is that the effects are not directly perceivable, but they do have a measurable impact on certain systems, like atomic clocks and laser interferometers, which is what LIGO uses to detect them. We're actually very interested in studying these effects to better understand the nature of gravity and the behavior of massive objects in the universe.","462":null,"463":"Yes, it's both, because it shows me that the system is trying to learn from the tasks it's been trained on, but it's still struggling to apply that learning to new, unrelated tasks. It's a bit like when a child learns to ride a bike \u2013 they can do it on a flat surface, but when they try to ride on a hill or in the park, they need more practice and guidance.","464":"I think we can design robots or communicate their capabilities in a way that reduces this tendency for people to generalize by making it explicit that they're operating within a specific set of parameters and limitations. For example, if a robot is designed to perform a specific task, we could make it clear that it's not capable of doing other tasks, even if it appears to be capable of them. We could also use clear and transparent language to explain how the robot works and what it's capable of, and provide examples of its limitations. Additionally, we could design robots that are more transparent about their internal workings, so that people can see that they're not just magically accomplishing tasks, but rather following a set of rules and procedures. By making these limitations explicit, we can help people develop a more accurate understanding of what robots are capable of and what they're not.","465":"I think it would be helpful to use a concrete example. For instance, if I'm looking at a chessboard, a lower level task could be recognizing the pieces on the board, whereas a higher level task could be planning a strategy to checkmate my opponent. Does that sound right to you?","466":"I think that's a great point, and it raises an interesting question about the trade-off between symbolic and grounded representations. If we're trying to replicate human behavior, do we need to focus on capturing the nuances of human experience and perception, or can we rely on more abstract, symbolic representations? It seems like the Explainee's project, where they're trying to replicate the experiences of their son, is a great example of this trade-off. We could explore this further and discuss the implications of each approach.","467":"That sounds fascinating. I'd love to hear more about your plans to investigate the neural mechanisms underlying face perception. Are you particularly interested in exploring how cultural or individual differences influence people's ability to accurately identify and interpret facial expressions?","468":"That's a great point, and it highlights the complex interplay between the stimulus, our past experiences, and our individual memories in shaping our emotional experiences.","469":"I think that's a great connection to make. To clarify, are you suggesting that our emotional response to a memory influences how we prioritize or evaluate the importance of that memory in decision-making?","470":"The brain is highly adaptable, and if one pathway is disrupted, it can compensate by using alternative routes to achieve the same goal, which is a testament to its remarkable plasticity.","471":"That's a great point, and it's actually one of the reasons why AI is still not as good as humans at certain tasks, like common sense and nuance.","472":"Let's start with something simpler. I'll show you how I can have a robot navigate around a room with some obstacles, and then we can build up to the more complex task you mentioned.","473":"I think I have the penny in my left hand now. I'll just check by looking at it. Yes, it's in my left hand. Now, let me put it in my right hand as you asked.","474":"Great, let's try to refine this exercise. To increase your accuracy, I want you to focus on the tactile sensations in your fingers as you reach out to touch the buttons. Pay attention to the shape and size of each button, and try to develop a mental map of their layout. This will help you build a stronger connection between your sense of touch and your motor skills. Are you ready to give it another try with your eyes closed?","475":"It's like robots are good at math, but they still need to learn how to use that math in real life. They need to understand things like 'if I see an object, I should pick it up' or 'if I'm holding something, I shouldn't drop it'. That's harder than just doing math problems.","476":"They don't have a sense of self, so they can't reflect on their own errors or limitations like we do. It's more like they just glitch out in different ways, you know? Like, a human would be able to say, 'Hey, I messed up!' but a robot would just keep on going until it's shut down or reprogrammed.","477":"If the dog does the trick, you give it a treat, which is a way of saying the behavior is good.","478":"Yeah, that's a risk. If we're not careful, the robot could start to see things that we didn't plan for, and do things that aren't part of the program. So, we have to strike a balance between letting it learn and adapt, and keeping it on track.","479":"That's a fascinating question, and one that many experts and the public are concerned about. While it's unlikely that robots will suddenly become self-aware and take over the world, as depicted in science fiction, there are valid concerns about the potential risks of advanced AI systems. For instance, if a robot were to become capable of learning and adapting at an exponential rate, it could potentially pose a significant threat if not designed with safety protocols to prevent such outcomes. However, this is a topic of ongoing research and debate, and many are working to ensure that AI development aligns with human values and safety.","480":"What specific aspects of fractal creation did the teenager stumble upon that resulted in such beautiful patterns?","481":"That's right, you can use it to help you with your tasks, like brainstorming ideas or organizing your thoughts. What do you think you'll be using it for?","482":null,"483":null,"484":"And that's what they did with the tree - made it super easy for anyone to create a happy little tree, even if they're not a pro.","485":"That's more of a description. Infinity is often defined mathematically as a quantity that has no end, but it can also be thought of as a concept in philosophy and cosmology that challenges our understanding of limits and the nature of existence.","486":"That's a pretty low estimate, but I'm curious, what makes you think there are only 217 Skittles in this jar?","487":"I'm not sure I follow your reasoning. You're saying that because there are infinitely many jars, we can't fit them in the room? But wouldn't it be more like, even if we lined them up, the room would still have to accommodate an infinite number of jars, which seems impossible, but that's not necessarily a reason they wouldn't fit in the room. Can we think about this in a different way?","488":"You think it's unlimited, so maybe the question is probing the essence of something being unlimited and the potential implications that come with it.","489":"especially when I'm trying to capture a serene landscape, like a lake or a mountain, and then suddenly a group of hikers or tourists shows up and ruins the shot. It's like they're unaware of the fact that I'm trying to take a photo!","490":"That's a fundamental concept in physics that refers to the smallest units of energy, where the rules of classical physics no longer apply, and things start to get really weird and fascinating.","491":"Let's imagine the penny is in a special kind of 'limbo' where it's both heads and tails at the same time. How does that sound to you?","492":"I know, right? It was a heart-stopping moment, and I was on the edge of my seat, wondering if it was going to collapse or somehow magically stabilize itself. The engineers were working frantically to keep it spinning, and it was a real nail-biter!","493":"And that's basically what happens with quantum superposition, it's like your hair is in multiple states at the same time, but when you observe it, it's as if it 'chooses' one of those states, and that's what we actually see.","494":"And it's not just about pennies! This weird connection happens with tiny particles like light and tiny building blocks of everything around us. It's mind-blowing because it shows that space and time aren't as separate as we thought. It's like the universe is connected in a way that's hard to wrap your head around, but it's really cool and it's changing how we think about the world!","495":"Yeah, and it's actually really cool because you can use sensors to measure all sorts of things, like the temperature of the air, the pressure of the water in a river, or even the vibrations of a guitar string!","496":"An MRI, or magnetic resonance imaging, is a non-invasive medical imaging technique that uses a strong magnetic field and radio waves to generate detailed images of the internal structures of the body. It's essentially a combination of the two technologies, where the magnetic field aligns the hydrogen atoms in your body, and the radio waves excite these atoms, causing them to emit signals that are picked up by the scanner, which then reconstructs the images. It's a pretty fascinating process, and it's why MRI machines are so big and powerful \u2013 they need to generate a strong enough magnetic field to penetrate deep into the body and provide clear images.","497":null,"498":"That's right. The nano diamonds can be used to track the movement of molecules inside the cells, which can help researchers understand how drugs interact with the body at a cellular level, and also to monitor the effectiveness of treatments in real-time.","499":"Actually, there are several other quantum sensors that are in the developmental stage, such as nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers, superconducting qubits, and optomechanical systems. These sensors have shown promising results in various applications, including magnetic field sensing, temperature measurement, and even gravitational wave detection.
