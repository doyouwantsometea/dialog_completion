think that people forget that you can work with the notes you already have by just rearranging them, just the simple idea of inversion, inversion of the simple triad, of F major. \u266aI once was lost and now I'm found \u266a \u266a Was blind \u266a \u266a But now I see \u266a Now how home do I want to go here, you know? Is there another verse to come?","1":"Because I can delay the gratification of going home. First of all, just by using inversions, even before we add the notes to the chord. One thing that I was very joyful to discover is that every single melody note works with every single base note.","2":"F major, F minor, D flat major seven G flat diminished, G flat minor major seven, G minor seven, G soft, G seven, G seven sharp 11. And then, G seven with a flat 13","3":"That's it! (laughs) A flat soft, A flat major seven. A flat major seven sharp five, with a sharp 11. Essentially, what that demonstrates is that every note and every base note are compatible. So once we realize this its like, that's great! Now what should we do? What, how, what should we, what should we, how, what am I supposed to do? What to do, right. And sometimes the paralyzing thing when it comes to arranging, there are too many options, too many things are possible. So that's when it becomes super, super important to be aware of what you wanna try and say emotionally.","4":"Exactly, yeah. No, for sure. And, you know, F major can be something you arrive in from, if you arrive in F major from D flat, then it's like the sun's come up.","5":"So, there's a lot about context, I think. Once you have a language, it's about using it and applying it in those emotional ways. I think that's what makes the difference.","6":"I think G6 is Leningrad. I've tried to find a name. I don't actually know the name of this one. I guess there's also like the Stonewall, right? You can play.","7":"I play like a lot of openings poorly. That's my approach to chess. I just play things that I think will be fun. Then the game starts going, and I'm like, Why did I play this? I should learn real openings. Okay, I guess I'll... Yeah, this is nice and boring.","8":"Yes. Well, actually, it's not a good thing. I would've preferred that it might, you know, it might hang, but oh, we only have like 90 seconds. We have to make conversation and also play some semi-decent moves.","9":"You are the eight-time United States women's chess champion. You also have the highest title in all of chess grandmaster. I'm an eternal runner up. Like what is the championship mentality, and how have you succeeded at it so many times?","10":"in some way. But there are differences, right? If I asked you to move through space, you could do it freely, right? Can you get up? And let's see how easy it is to move through space. Can you move over to that location? And can you come back? Anything getting in your way? Easy to do?","11":"If I were to ask you to sit perfectly still in space, can you do that? I mean, hold perfectly still. That's good. But if I ask you to hold still in time, to not go to the next second or the next second, can you do that?","12":"He does have crazy hair, and I think I'm maybe heading in that direction actually.He showed us an approach to travel to the future. You want me to tell you how you do it?","13":"You build a spaceship. You go out into space really quickly. You turn around and you come back to planet Earth, and he showed us that when you're on that ship, your clock will tick off time more slowly. You will age more slowly. So that journey may only take you, say, a year, six months out and six months back, but you know what? When you step out of the ship, it'll be 100 years into the future or 1,000 years, a million years into the future. Would you do that if you could?","14":"Maybe, that's absolutely right. I think it's unlikely we'll learn how to travel to the past, but it's not been ruled out. That's kind of exciting that it's still at least an open possibility.","15":"Yeah. We do a lot of X-ray in addition to EM and this is actually, I'm not saying it's the only problem, but it's the only problem that needs to be solved right away, is that the data analysis, right? In fact, I think we calculated that there aren't enough humans ever to map a mouse brain where you collect every connection and et cetera so the problem is to get algorithms to trace, to recognize things in brains the way humans would recognize things in brains, or map things, trace things in brains. It's gonna cost a lot of money to imagine setting the gold standard for the wiring diagram even once and those are the kinds of ethical concerns that I'm worried about.","16":"It's a weird thing to be sitting in your own galaxy, but not be able to separate all these, four million solar mass black hole creating, next to, how massive, it's like two to three solar masses for the X-ray binaries?","17":"Which was one idea, but again, it's, I'll leave this to your theoreticians, I think there are problems with that, as well. I call it job security. That's right. (both laugh) We have a lot of things about black holes, both in terms of their formation, or even how they exist as they are, and how they're interacting with their environment that we're still not understanding.","18":"Let's bring one in. All right. The thing about relativity is that they really want you to think of spacetime as one four dimensional thing, right? It's kind of like space. It's not just three dimensions of space and one dimension of time.","19":"When people ask me can you travel through time? I say yes, yesterday I traveled 24 hours into the future and here I am, a day later. So that's just this. Okay, you're moving through time, like it or not. So what Einstein says is look, I can travel through spacetime in different ways, like I could hop in a rocket ship and fly out and then fly back, and then I could meet you there. So this is a different trajectory through spacetime, right?","20":"And it's almost exactly like the space story. The space story says there's a distance, distance is different along different curves. Einstein says there's something that measures the length of these curves, and we call it the proper time. It is literally the time that you would read on your wristwatch.","21":"Well kind of. What Einstein wants to get across is there's no such thing as fundamental, like there's the universe's time, this big letter T that might tell you how old the universe is, but then every individual has a clock with them, and they measure their own time depending on how they're moving through the universe.","22":"There is what we call a metric on spacetime, and when we talk about Euclidean space versus a curved space, versus a sphere or something, that's a different metric. And spacetime has its own metric which says the following thing, that the path between two events in spacetime that is a straight line, will always be the longest time.","23":"So when Einstein had this idea, oh gravity could be related to the curvature of spacetime, he did some equations, so he got it, that's a long story, we'll put that aside. What he figured out was that rather than gravity living on top of spacetime, it's a manifestation of the curvature of spacetime so when you have like the earth, the sun, the moon, they cause a gravitational field, they're actually warping the spacetime around them. They're giving it a different geometry.","24":"Yeah, that's right. And it goes exactly back to what we drew on the board where how those two people in the train and on the ground would divide spacetime up differently to space and time.","25":"A baby ant? Very good. So I have over here a meter stick, let me show it to you. And so that's a meter and if I divide it by 1000, I get a millimeter. So milli just means 1000. There's all these little lines on the ruler. And each of those little lines is one millimeter. So a baby ant is probably a couple of millimeters. So even the thing, that's the smallest thing you can think of, it's a million times bigger than a nanometer. Tiny, tiny, tiny.","26":"If I took this stick and I was to draw 1 billion lines, the distance between those two lines would be one nanometer. So that's really all it is. It's just a measure of size. But it's really, really, really tiny, smaller than anything that we can see with our eyes. The reason why, in nanotechnology, scientists, we care about things that are that small, is because there are objects called atoms. Have you ever heard of atoms before?","27":"That was a perfect explanation. But what if I told you that scientists invented a special type of microscope that not only lets you see atoms, but also lets you move them around and build things with them. Would you think that would be pretty cool?","28":"So it's called a scanning tunneling microscope. And not only can you see the atoms, but you can move them around. Atoms are kind of sticky. You can actually build things using this instrument with actual individual atoms. So if I gave you that machine, would you want to make something? Would you want to look at something very carefully?","29":"I study it because objects that are that small have really interesting properties. They behave completely different than objects that are big. And because of that, we can build really cool things with them. Like really fast computers, for example, or new types of batteries or new types of solar cells. And a lot of nanotechnology is kind of like playing with Legos. You take these small objects and you put them together to build something new. Something interesting that no one's built before. It's like Legos for scientists.","30":"We're gonna have to create entire new concepts of how they do trade and how they work with us, too. What kind of barriers or road blocks would you imagine are gonna happen in the blockchain space?","31":"Yeah. One of the problems that Bitcoin has faced is Bitcoins getting stolen or lost. But a lot of that actually comes from people trying to recentralize Bitcoin in different ways making themselves actually a pretty easy target.","32":"Yeah. To actually transition into the mainstream and make it useful for average people to use, we're going to need to make sure we have a lot more education, a lot more standards and probably work with a lot of enterprises to create sort of a user experience around this being a technology that is safe and usable and understandable. What is the current state of blockchain in your understanding? What's gonna have to happen next?","33":"These are the building blocks of many, many origami deployable shapes, it's called a degree-4 vertex. It's the number of lines. So in this case, we use solid lines for mountain, we use dash lines for valley. We're going to fold it and use these two to illustrate some important properties of origami mechanisms. It's important in the study of mechanisms to take into account the rigidity. So what we're going to do to help simulate rigidity is to take these rectangles and we're going to fold them over and over so that they just become stiff and rigid.","34":"So this is what's called a single degree of freedom mechanism. You have one degree of freedom, I can choose this fold, and then if these are perfectly rigid every other fold angle is fully determined. One of the key behaviors here is that with the smaller angles up here, the two folds that are the same parity and the folds that are of opposite parity move at about the same rate but with this, as we're getting closer to 90 degrees, we find they move at very different rates and then at the end of the motion, the opposite happens. This one is almost folded but this one goes through a much larger motion so the relative speeds differ.","35":"So when we start sticking together vertices like this, if they're individually single degree of freedom then we can make very large mechanisms that open and close but with just one degree of freedom. So, these are examples of a pattern called the Miura-Ori. When you stretch them out they're pretty big.","36":"Yeah, so typically the mechanism will run from corner to corner, to diagonally to opposite corners because then you can stretch it out that way. Notice some differences between the one you have and the one I have in how this one sort of opens out almost evenly but this one opens out more one way and then the other.","37":"And it's exactly the difference between the motions of these two vertices. So these angles are closer to right angles and the closer you get to a right angle the more asymmetry there is between the two directions of motion. And then the other difference is how efficiently they pack, so these started at about the same size but when they're flat notice that yours is much more compact. So if I were you making a solar array, I'd say, oh, I want that one. But if I say, well, I want them to open at the same rate, then I want this one.","38":"There's an engineering trade-off to get them both to work. And there's another place that shows up in deployable structures in a very cool structure. This is a folded tube, it sort of pops out like this but it has this neat property that if you twist it quickly, it changes color. There's a Mars Rover application where they need a sleeve that protects a drill and as the drill goes down, the sleeve is going to collapse and they're using a pattern very much like this.","39":"There are many open mathematical questions and so room for mathematicians, like yourself, to have a big impact on the world of origami and mechanisms. And even though those studies are mathematically interesting, they're going to also have real-world applications in space, solar arrays, drills, telescopes, and more. Any questions or thoughts about this?","40":"You try, we all gotta try. You've probably heard about sleep as this kind of, you know, it's a biological process that happens in your brain. It's really important for your body, but it's a lot more complex than that. Sleep is made up of different parts. You know, when you think about sleep, what do you think about?","41":"So our sleep is made up of different types, okay? The first one is called non-rapid eye movement sleep, or non-REM, okay? Or NREM. And then the other one, which might not be a surprise, is called REM. Rapid eye movement sleep. And those are the two main types of sleep that happen. The way that we measure that as a sleep scientist is that we'll actually bring people into the lab where they can do this at home, where we put electrodes on their scalp while they're sleeping, and that allows us to measure the brain activity that's going on during the night.","42":"When we measure all of that, we're able to see how much time someone's asleep, and how many times they wake up and stuff during the night. You know, we're also really interested in kind of, the amount of non-REM sleep someone gets and the amount of REM sleep that someone gets, because each part of those types of sleep do different things for the body. And so it's important to get both of those. And so within non-REM sleep, there are three stages ranging from N-1 to N-2 to N-3. So not particularly clever in our naming, but that's how we know what stages they are. And what they do is it moves from lightest to deepest sleep, okay? N-1, it's more kind of light, wakefulness sleep, kind of in and out of sleeping. Then you go into N-2, which is where we spend 45 to 55 percent of our sleep. And it's more this kind of light sleep, but then we get into kind of the really restorative sleep, and that's N-3. And in N-3, when we look at someone's EEG wave, we see these big slow waves, and it's called slow wave sleep. And so we spend about 20% of our sleep in slow wave sleep, though it can vary on a day to day.","43":"You know, some of that is totally accurate, that like when your brain's more engaged by being on your phone or doing things that you really enjoy or things that stress you out or any of those types of things, it's harder to get to sleep and to kind of fall into that deeper levels of sleep. Most of the REM sleep, this dreaming sleep, happens in the second half of the night.","44":"Okay? So we wake up a lot during the night, and we just don't remember it. And you'll go back down into deep sleep, and then up again into REM, you know, in kinda these cycles.","45":"Okay. Usually we want to keep naps, like 20 to 30 minutes. When people drop into deep sleep, and then they're woken up out of a nap, most people report that they feel way worse than they did before they took the nap, and that's because you've been in deep sleep, and it's this term called sleep inertia. So what are the stages of sleep?","46":"The way our sun generates energy is by fusion reactions. It fuses hydrogen, the lightest element we know about, into helium, and that gets fused into heavier and heavier elements. So here on earth we're going to take some special kinds of hydrogen, a special flavor of it if you will, which we call an isotope. And we're going to combine them to create new particles. And we can only get that combination of particles to happen if they are in a plasma. What's your favorite exhibit at the science museum?","47":"Absolutely, we take the gas, and we add heat, and we get a plasma. And a plasma is a state of matter where you have an ionized gas. If we break down that gas, and we add enough energy to ionize it, where you can take the electrons and the ions and the atom and separate them, and now there's this soup of charged particles that are moving around, that's the plasma. And it is what creates the beautiful light in lightning. So you've already seen a plasma in fact. So I'm gonna show you this fun demonstration. You've probably seen one of these before, right?","48":"Yeah. So the way this is happening is this glass ball here is a container for our plasma. And we've taken most of the air out of the container, so there's not a lot of particles inside the glass ball, and very, very low temperature plasma. So it's continuously ionizing and then recombining, and becoming neutral again. And we see those energy transitions as the visible light. So if we're gonna put this plasma to use and do something helpful with it, like maybe make some clean electricity, we would have to control it. And another word for controlling it is confining it. So let me turn this off and set it back down. You're probably wondering what is this thing on this table? It's a model of a tokamak, and that's the name of a device that I work on with the goal of creating clean energy. Have you played with magnets in school?","49":"This is all very important to sort of understand how we would create a container that would let us hold a plasma in place and control it. Have you ever played around with an electromagnet in class? It's a coil of wire, much like this big red coil of wire right here. And when we push an electrical current through this wire, it creates a magnetic field that goes around the wire perpendicular. So if you want to know the direction of the magnetic field that's being created by pushing the current through the wire, put your thumb in the direction of the current and then curl your fingers like this. Yeah, and that's the right hand rule. So if we push the current this way we're creating a magnetic field in this perpendicular direction. So if I drive a current in this red wire like this, which direction will the magnetic field go?","50":"Exactly, yeah, the long way, perpendicular. Now this is a bit of a trickier one. The blue wire is gonna act like a transformer action. And so by changing the current in the blue coil, we are going to be able to run a current in this direction around the tokamak. And now think back to how the wires worked. If I have a current going like this, where's the magnetic field?","51":"So that's very, very hot temperature. But the other thing we need is a lot of particles. That's the density. We are able to combine a deuteron and a triton in a fusion reaction at lower temperatures, at lower energies than other fuel. And this has to do with some very nice properties of the deuteron and the triton that when we get them close enough to one another to fuse, there's actually a resonance which is predicted by quantum mechanics, and that really helps have a little bump up in the cross section for the deuterium-tritium fusion reaction.","52":"Yes, exactly, exactly. That little bump up is good for us. Because it means that we have a higher probability of getting the deuterium and the tritium to fuse than otherwise at those manageable temperatures. And when we say manageable, for fusion scientists, yeah, 50 million, a hundred million, 150 million Celsius.","53":"We've come so far in the study of magnetically confined plasmas, which is what I work on, that we sort of tamed all the other types of major instabilities that would cause loss of the plasma. So you might be asking yourself what is the energy that's coming out of the fusion reaction? So we've got the deuteron and we've got the triton, and so they combine in a fusion reaction, and that produces a neutron and a helium nucleus. But the neutron doesn't have any charge.","54":"It turns out, for people that are between the ages of 18 and 65, the agreed upon amount of sleep that people should get is between seven and nine hours, and it's really at least seven hours per night, to maintain optimal health as an adult. So at least seven hours. When we look at across all of the data that is available on like sleep and health, and sleep and psychiatric illness and those types of things, the largest risk is when people get five hours or less. What do you think is responsible for driving how much sleep you need, and things like that?","55":"Right. You can do part of this level, and you can do the other part, clearly. Got some expertise under your belt, and that's awesome, because I think that everyone should know more about sleep. And so the way that we think about what drives sleep are two independent but related processes and so they have kind of lame names. Process S and process C, and what you've kind of described is process C, and that's the master clock, right? And it helps regulate kind of the rhythms like all over your body, all your cells, and all those kind of things. It drives the release of melatonin from the pineal gland, and melatonin comes online under darkness, so when the sun goes down, your brain knows okay it's time to start getting ready for sleep, and so you start releasing melatonin, which really kind of sets the table for sleeping.","56":"Origami applications have in common, is that at some stage the thing is flat and so whenever you need to either start from a flat state and then take it to a 3D state, or conversely, for deployables like space, you want to have it in a fully folded flat state but then take it to a 3D state, or possibly an unfolded flat state. Whenever a flat state is involved, origami is a really effective way of making the transition between those states.","57":"New problems arise when we try to make origami out of things other than paper, but also new opportunities. An example here which is a kind of a variant of the Miura-Ori. It's got a three-dimensional structure. If I stretch it one way, it expands the other but because it has these S-bends in the pattern, if you squeeze it, it doesn't go all the way flat. This is a epoxy impregnated aramid fiber and so if I put this fold pattern into it and then compress it and then put a skin on the top and bottom, this becomes incredibly lightweight but incredibly strong.","58":"Another origami challenge that comes up with these patterns is if we're going to make an aircraft out of this thing we're going to need hundreds of yards of folded origami. We're not going to do it by hand and this might be the new frontier in origami engineering, which is the design of machines that can fold patterns that have applications.","59":"It will develop. It will take five years. It will take 10 years. That kind of time is necessary. One of the areas that brought me to supply chain research is the fact that we're not just gonna see blockchain emerge. We're gonna see artificial intelligence continue to evolve. We're gonna see connective devices and this sort of growing internet of things and machinery that can do a lot more and have a wallet and transact on their own. And so I actually think a lot of where blockchain and other technologies are headed is this interesting synergy that will help us elevate the kinds of institutions we've used in the past and cobbled together to create that identifiable, verifiable trust.","60":"In that it's hard to compare it to some perfect future. Just like you compare autonomous vehicles to this very high standard because machines are doing it. It should be perfect. There should be zero car deaths.","61":"When you say, well, there's hundreds of thousands, millions of car deaths on the road due to human error today. I think we're in a similar place. We're going to see problems with this technology, and we are going to need to develop multiple kinds of standards that also have some flexibility. But it's going to also be a version, a system, that allows us to fix some of the things that are broken today.","62":"All right, you're in the wrong place. [laughs] We're not gonna be talking about biology or computer science. So we wanna talk about the idea of dimensions. Do you know what dimension is? How we would define dimensions?","63":"Right, you know the difference between like one dimension two dimensions, three dimensions, et cetera. So let's do a little experiment here. So there's one dimension. I'll give that to you. Now, here's your task. I'm going to give you another dimension, and I'm gonna ask hold those two things at right angles to each other. It's easy to do. Yeah, so there's no trick here.","64":"I'm not trying to fool you here. Okay. Now this is going to be slightly trickier. I'm going to give you this. I want you to hold all three of them at right angles to all the others at the same time.","65":"There you go. So what that's doing is when you had just two that was describing a two dimensional plane, right? Like the two things pick out a plane, the three things pick out all three dimensional space. I'm gonna give you one more, and I'm gonna ask you to hold that fourth one so that it's at a right angle to all the other three at the same time.","66":"Well, we could also say how far we are away from the center, just the distance. And then the angle that our little line makes with let's say the X axis.","67":"So that's a different way of giving you two numbers and locating yourself, and we call those polar coordinates. It's a different coordinate system. What we want to do as physicists is look for extra dimensions. Can you imagine, can you think of any way that there could be extra dimensions?","68":"Time. Yes, Einstein said that we can think of time as a fourth dimension, and that's a very fascinating thing that we could talk about all by itself. But what about space? What about the solar system? Like, if you wanted to tell me where a certain star was in the sky, do you know how we do that?","69":"So you can define something as, well you know, how high above a certain location on earth it is, but the earth is rotating and revolving around the sun so we have to define separate celestial coordinates.","70":"We don't know. You know, the optimistic view is that there are six, but the thing is, some of them might be really, really, really, really, really small, like way too small for us to ever see.","71":"You know, honestly out there, if you go out onto campus and talk to the physicists, half of them will say probably extra dimensions exist, and half of them say no, that's just nonsense.","72":"That was, it was like, oh, wow, this might be it, and then, but very early on, it was, as I just started my, it was basically my second year of graduate school, it was like, uh, this is not that simple.","73":"This is where it gets really crazy. Could we simulate that map inside a computer and would that computer then be thinking like that original brain from which we made the map?","74":"Huh. It would be like if you simulated a hurricane. Imagine we could keep track of every variable of a hurricane. Ever. Wind speed, every water molecule, et cetera, et cetera. Temperature. And we put that inside a super-fast computer and we simulated it, right? I don't think anyone would think that the inside of the computer would get wet. Even though we had simulated the hurricane perfectly, that wetness is consciousness, it's what we are. Is it ethical to imagine mapping a male brain versus a female brain to look for differences between those, to explain alleged behavioral differences between them?","75":"Onto to E5 on the third move is the most challenging move against the Caro-Kann. It restricts the knight and the main line. So the move is bringing out the bishop, Bringing out the bishop. so you don't get locked. I play that move, but the move that I also added to my toolbox and is the only move I teach now is this move to try to undermine the center. It's not commonly played at the highest level. If you study master games, this is probably one in every six games or something compared to, right? So now we go down a totally different path. We're taking a totally different train to our destination, but just this undermining of the position, you know, splitting up these pawns and then slowly capturing them both, that does wonders at intermediate and early advanced level. This move, despite it being move three, according to databases, already gives black like a 53% chance of winning, which is crazy because normally white is about 52%, right? White just doesn't know what to do about this move.","76":"Yeah, yeah, yeah. I find it fascinating in music to think about, you know, say I arrive in a place, if I'm going, say I'm going to D flat major. And there's something you once taught me. You taught me this song Don't Follow the Crowd.","77":"'Cause, you know, I just wouldn't think to use that chord in that situation. And there it was! And, you know, if you read the rule book, it's, that not in it.","78":"Something like that. And that's not 'cause like emotionally, it's almost like I'm here, I'm arriving here. But, if the base note is the same, it's like this inevitability about it, it's like I was there all along.","79":"Yeah, yeah. It's like one thing is moving in one direction and one thing has arrived, so it's this tension and it's glorious. I love thinking about these things emotionally, just because that's a feeling, I know that feeling in my life.","80":"And so, we could play a bit of that if you want to. And we could talk about some stuff. I've been doing it in F. (keyboards playing Amazing Grace) (laughing) Thanks Herbie, that was a trip.","81":"Yeah, it's crazy. They're really a lot of bad or malicious hackers out there who are doing just that. They're going into people's accounts and they're stealing money, but there's also another side of computer hacking where there are people who are trying to learn how those bad hackers are actually breaking in to the bank accounts.","82":"Yeah, exactly. They're looking for ways that they can create protection. It's kind of like the lock on your front door. That lock is to essentially prevent bad people from coming in or people accidentally coming in when they shouldn't. A hacker is essentially looking at a way, how can I get into this lock? But then there are the good ones who are trying to unlock it so that they can tell the company that made the lock, hey, we can actually protect people by making the lock a little harder.","83":"In many cases, they'll send them a new lock. So it's an upgraded, better version. Sometimes that's new features, but sometimes that's bug fixes and ways to protect you as well.","84":"I started going on the computer and playing video games, but I had some ideas of my own, and that's where I started to learn how to hack. I wanted to play with my friends on this video game and just change the way that things look.","85":"That's entirely possible. They may have done it for a reason, but you may have come up with a really good idea that, do you think there are other people who might like the idea that you came up with?","86":"When you have creative ideas like that, hacking can actually allow you to change the way a system works, and that means you can change a game and how the game is played, and then you can share that with your friends and other people who like that game. Once I started learning how to do it, I found that, things that were harder for me, I could make easier.","87":"Good to see you Mike, nice to have you here with me. So we go way back. 1991, the year I got married, I moved across the country, left my husband in New Jersey, to work with you in Livermore.","88":"And I've been talking sort of, started with sort of what is a laser through linear optics, non linear optics, high intensity laser physics, and saying that you know, we're trying to get to that Schwinger limit of 10 to the 29 watts per square centimeter. We're about somewhere just shy of 10 to the 23 I think at this point. But even if we get to 100 petawatts and focus that down to a wavelength, we're not at 10 to the 29. So you're hoping to build the biggest laser.","89":"Or we need, going around and giving my talks now, I show how we're plateauing. I showed how there was a plateau, CPA raises it up, but we're sort of starting to plateau again and we need another Nobel Prize winning idea. And so do you think it's on the horizon? Do you see anything out there that really says, oh yeah that's a good way to go? 'Cos we're gonna have to get out to the x-rays right? We can't stay in the visual.","90":"Nowadays there's a lot of concerns around some applications of machine learning like deep fakes where it can kind of learn how I talk and learn how you talk and even how we look, and generate videos of us. We're doing this for real, but you could imagine a computer synthesizing this conversation eventually.","91":"So this is a huge crisis 'cause either quantum mechanics is wrong, and as you described it, it's the most accurately-tested paradigm in the history of physics, how could it be wrong, right? Or the event horizon is letting information out and violating one of the most sacred principles of relativity.","92":"Yes, so one of the things I like to think of with holography is that I can pack a certain amount of information in a black hole. I mean, you can literally think of it as throwing things into it. So let's say I have information in some volume and I'm under the illusion that I can just keep packing information in that volume, as much as the volume will contain. Eventually I'll make a black hole and I'll find out that the maximum amount of information I can pack into anything in the entire universe is what I can pack on the area. And since area is projecting the illusion, maybe, of volume, maybe the whole world is just a hologram. It's not a principle that only applies to black holes. It's saying that, if this theory of quantum gravity is correct, then this while three-dimensionality is an utter illusion and really the universe is two-dimensional. That's crazy.","93":"Do you think it's possible that gravity is really ultimately just quantum mechanics and doesn't exist at all in the fundamental ways that we've been talking about so far, like the Newtonian way and the space-time way, that those are just these kind of macroscopic illusions? Sometimes I talk about it in terms of temperature. Temperature is not a thing. There is no single thing called temperature. It's a macroscopic illusion that comes from the collective behavior, really quantum behavior of random motions of atoms. And is it possible that the whole of gravity is some kind of emergent illusion from what's really quantum phenomenon underlying it?","94":"Okay. With computer hacking, it's actually the same thing. Really, you have some sort of system and you have a bunch of inputs and you have some sort of output, and actually you, as the designer, you're essentially designing games and software. You're saying, well, I will only allow a user to really control these inputs. Can you think of any inputs the computer might have?","95":"Yep, there's also things like your mouse and there's even things like the microphone itself is actually an input device. It's taking something from you, which is the sound and it's then transmitting that, ad it's actually sending it to me. Are there any other things that you can talk to a computer? You can give it information.","96":"That's absolutely another input that exists on your computer. That's how I try to think of things is there's just a bunch of inputs. Often, if you're trying to break something or hack something, you're really saying, okay, how can I control these inputs in a way that wasn't necessarily expected?","97":"Typically, it's going to be something like the keyboard, right? I'm just going to be typing keystrokes to be talking to some piece of software or hardware, but other times it can be other things like even the temperature of a computer can actually affect how the computer operates, and it might be advantageous to me to cool down the computer and actually slow down the movement of electrons in something like memory, so that if a computer shuts off, it stores something that wasn't memory like a password and stores it for a long enough time that I might be able to actually extract it through some other methods.","98":"It just depends what you're trying to do. In some cases, it could literally be seconds because you already know how the system works, and other times, it could be years. So what have you learned about hacking?","99":"So have you spent any time thinking about this weird quality of the laws of physics, that there's no mathematical distinction in the laws between forward in time and backward in time? Is that something you're familiar with?","100":"A chicken. But then I say to you, where'd the chicken come from? And you'd say from an egg. But there's actually some real insight we can draw from this, because if we keep going back with the chicken and egg story, we'll go back through the evolutionary lineage of life, we'll go back to early moments of the sun and the galaxy, and ultimately, the universe, each step taking us to greater and greater order. So we believe that the ultimate source of order is the Big Bang itself. Highly ordered beginning called the Bang, and we have been living through the degradation of that order ever since. We still don't really have a solid explanation for why the Big Bang had to be or was, highly ordered. At the moment, it's really a deep assumption.","101":"Do you remember the scene in Interstellar? They're going to a planet that's near a black hole. They go down to the planet, and they spend just a couple hours there, but when they go back to the ship, it's 23 years later on the ship because time is elapsing slowly near the strong gravitational field, comparatively quickly far away. And that's not science fiction, that's actually how time behaves.","102":"Okay. I just think of physics as the study of everything. What stuff is, what stuff does. So today we're gonna talk about space, and in particular the idea of dimensions. Have you heard about dimensions?","103":"But here's what I want you to think about. If I say I'm at this point on the line, I could translate that into saying I'm at the three centimeter point, if I were here I'd be at the four centimeter point, the five centimeter point, right?","104":"We need one number to tell you where we are. That's one dimension. That's what it means to be one dimensional. I only need to tell you one number to figure out where we are.","105":"So those are the dimensions. That's how we think about dimensions. Remember, we just needed one number to find ourselves on the line, we need two numbers to find ourselves on the plane.","106":"This is why physicists think about things we don't know about. We're wondering whether there could be extra dimensions you've never seen. Yeah. That are tinier than atoms. So, okay. So what have you learned? What do you know about dimensions now? How do you think about dimensions in a slightly different way than you did before?","107":"I think so. I think you're right. All right Hank, we want you to keep up studying, learn a lot of math and physics and help us discover new dimensions some day. Does that sound like a fun idea?","108":"I think to really get deep into nanomaterials and nanoscale devices, you really have to understand to some level, quantum mechanics. What it teaches us as we make these devices smaller and smaller, their properties begin to now depend on the size and the orientation of these devices. There are materials, and you're taking a 2D materials class, you know about this, that are intrinsically thin. As they're grown, as they're fabricated, they're already at the nanoscale and they possess these quantum confinement properties that as a nanotechnologist, you try to exploit. And so the first ones I wanted to talk to you about are quantum dots, have you heard of quantum dots before?","109":"That's correct. Yeah. Because of quantum confinement, once you get below this 15 nanometer range, the band gap of the material depends completely on the size of the material. So in bulk materials, if you want to change the band gap, you have to change the material, right? But in these quantum dots specifically, just by changing the size, you can change their band gap. And because their band gap is changing, their optical properties are different. And you can precisely tune the wavelength of light that they emit just by changing their size.","110":"Carbon nanotube, right. So if you roll up graphene, depending on how you roll it and the angle, you roll it with, it has different properties. So if I roll it one way, it'll act like a metal. If I roll it a different way, it'll act like a semiconductor. The one that gets everyone most excited is that the electrons and holes move very fast through graphene. And so there's a lot of interest in using these for certain types of high-speed electronics. The other interesting application is because it's one atom thin, it's very sensitive to changes in the environment. And so there's a lot of interest in using them as diagnostics. It's on us researchers to find ways to A, control that process and then B, to actually build some sort of interesting technology from them.","111":"It's just pretty lights. [laughing] But now that you suggested it, these were inspired by the array of quantum dots that we showed earlier. So that's the story I'm going to stick with. [laughing] I like it.","112":"You know, you're right. When you read about some of these technologies, it does feel like science fiction. But the part of nanotechnology I wanted to talk to you about is stuff that you probably use every day, most of your day, all of the time. Can you guess what aspect of nanotechnology I'm gonna talk to you about?","113":"You have to make it smaller. Exactly. But here's the problem. So about 10 to 15 years ago, the devices got so small that if you shrunk them this gate, that actually turns it on and off loses its ability to control the channel. And so what they did, was they took devices like this into these things, we call them, FinFETs, kind of like a fin on a fish. So they're very thin transistors. The width of these fins is only six nanometers. Okay? So 6 nanometers is 25 to 30 atoms across. And they repeat this over the entire wafer just about perfectly. It's just a huge feat in engineering. But these types of devices are exactly the kind of devices that your phones and computers either have, or will have in the near future. And it's a way that nanotechnology is directly impacting you right now.","114":"Even if it is a human-made concept that the universe evolved, developed, changed through time, ultimately giving rise to galaxy, stars, planets, and on this particular planet, life. That conception of time gives a feel that it's like universal, that it's out there, it's the same for everybody. It's independent of our actions or activities. Do you know that Albert Einstein shattered that view of time? He found that if you and I, say, have identical wrist watches, I'm sitting still and I'm watching you move, I will find that your clock is taking off time more slowly than my clock. But you know what's really remarkable? You can figure out this quality of time if you know one fact, that the speed of light is constant. Have you ever heard that phrase?","115":"Yeah, if you're clever, you can use that with high school algebra, maybe even a little high school trigonometry to make it even easier, to derive that clocks take off time at different rate. Do you want me to show you how that goes?","116":"All right, so to figure out the effect of motion on time, I'm gonna use a really simple clock, it's called a light clock. It's two mirrors that are facing each other.","117":"So where people are swiping credit cards, those credit card numbers were stolen. They hired a company to come in and perform a penetration test to see, can the good guys essentially break in again to prevent this sort of thing in the future? And when this team came in, they found they actually were able to get pretty much to the same point of sale system, and the way they did that was by exploiting an internet-connected deli meat scale. Once the company was able to essentially get into the deli scale, because the deli scale was on the internal network, then they were able to really escalate privilege and find a vulnerability within another system. Essentially, that just got them into the network. and once you're in the network, it's often really easy to then escalate from there.","118":"But what's really cool about that is, when you're going into memory, you're starting to cross over that boundary of that hundred byte allocation, and now you're starting to write over additional memory. That other memory is really important stuff. So you have your name, the hundred bytes there, and then right next to your name is the return address, and that's the address that the code is gonna execute and it's going to return to after that function is done, and it's going to jump to that address, but after you type your hundred bytes, the next few bites that you type, you're actually going to overwrite that return address. So that return address could essentially be another address in memory. So what you end up doing is you type a name and it's not really a name, it's really just code. And that code, you keep typing until you get to the return address, and you start typing an address, which is really the beginning of your name and your computer or your processor is actually going to read that address and it will jump back to the beginning and then execute that payload. So that was sort of the very first thing that I think was super exciting to me when I started learning about really reverse engineering.","119":"So when the gravitational waves were recorded and they realized, oh this sounds like, you can reconstruct the shape and size of the mallets of the drum from the sound, these sounds like neutron stars colliding, not black holes. And so, like you said, there was a trigger for satellites and experiments all over the world to point roughly in the direction that the sound was coming from. So, from your point of view, they're like two super-conducting giant magnets colliding, an experiment you could never do on Earth. That's just the most tremendous scales and peculiarities of matter.","120":"So my son is five years old. And he asked me what kind of science I do. And I said fusion. And I said I put a star in a jar. Does that make sense?","121":"You know, scientists are still studying exactly how magnetism works, right? It'll still be there for you to tackle when you become a scientist. Have you ever seen one of these games?","122":"With the iron filing. So if you take this and you take the magnetic end, maybe you can show us what's gonna happen with it. While you move around those iron filings with the magnet, you're totally in control of that material. You're pushing, you're pulling it, you're moving it around. And so you're using this magnetic force to also do something useful for you. Have you learned about the states of matter?","123":"[laughs] That's exactly right. It kinda is like recharging your battery, right? And sleep is so critical for so many parts of our body and our mind, right? It plays a really important way that we learn, and it helps us kind of recover from the day before. It affects our immune system and our metabolism, all of these things that we need to kinda be healthy.","124":"And so what's really cool about this is that giraffes need to sleep like everybody else, and so the way that it does is it kind of slumps over and it gets down on its legs and it kind of becomes this ball, but what's crazy about the whole thing is they only sleep for like 30 minutes a day. 30 minutes! Because it can't waste any more time, because it can't be vulnerable for any longer. It can get eaten by lions and that kind of thing. It has kind of evolved in a way that it can still survive and still get all the restoration it needs under such a short period of time.","125":"Really tired. Do you think you were a little crankier than usual? Yeah. That's actually really interesting, because what happens is humans and everything needs to sleep eventually, and so you can't stay up indefinitely, right? What do you think happens if you don't sleep?","126":"Right, right! So how do they do it? In the area that they live in, they need to stay cool, right? And so they spend a lot of time in the water, and so then as a consequence, they need to sleep in the water, but how do they do it? So it's really fascinating. What they do is while they're sleeping, they actually float back up to the surface and breathe without waking up. They're able to go about their whole sleep cycles but still able to breathe, because their body has adapted in a way that they can still get the oxygen that they need. It's a really amazing thing. What do you think?","127":"A dolphin! Yes. So dolphins, kind of like hippos, have to sleep in the water, okay? But because they're mammals, right, they need to breathe. Dolphins breathe air. They have to go up to the surface and breathe, right? And for an animal like that, it needs to figure out a way that it can sleep but also still survive, right? You know how dolphins sleep?","128":"One half of their brain at a time. So half of their brain goes to sleep, and the other half stays awake, so that they can continue to breathe and swim, and they do it in this four hours a time, so like their right part of their brain sleeps, they're able to go up to the surface and breathe. Then their left part of their brain sleeps for four hours, and it goes back and forth, back and forth, so they can kind of maintain alertness, still breathe, and survive. Is that amazing or what?","129":"And is this a good thing, do you think? Or an inevitable thing that we, the programmers, we, the computer scientists, the data scientists who are inventing these things, can't actually explain how they work? Because I feel like friends of mine in industry, even when it's something simple and relatively familiar like auto complete, they can't actually tell me why that name is appearing at the top of the list. Whereas years ago when these algorithms were more deterministic and more procedural, you could even point to the line that made that name bubble up to the top.","130":"Okay. So this is about high intensity lasers. Not only how do you make them, but what was really stopping them being made in both cases is non linear optics. We wanna do something that requires a huge photon density application, and so that's how come we came up with chirped pulse amplification, so that we could stretch the pulse, safely amplify it, then compress it at the end, and then we're ready to do whatever we want at the end. So what do you think the main difference is between the continuous wave laser that you have that runs at 10 watts and a chirped pulse amplifier?","131":"And so we get the power with a lot less energy 'cause its power is energy per unit time. So we aren't depositing much energy in comparison. Can I just ask, 'cause you are using the thermal process of it heating up, but have you ever had the opportunity to use laser tweezers?","132":"If you train a model off of language off the internet, it sometimes says uncomfortable things or inappropriate things and sometimes really biased things. Have you ever run into this yourself? And then how do you think about that problem of potentially even measuring the bias in a model that we've trained?","133":"Mostly today, I've been talking a lot about what can we do, what's possible. We think might be possible in the next couple of years. But really at the professional level its more the question of wisdom of what should we be doing.","134":"You know there's tons of opportunities for the synthetic case where you want to be able to have your synthetic fantasy world where everybody is a creature that's created by the computer and simulated reasonably. But of course we've got, you know we still don't do people well simulated. That's a hard problem, we've been beating our heads against it for a long time. I do think we're making progress and I wouldn't bet on that being solved in 10 years, but maybe 20 years. Because it is going to take a lot of AI. Its going to take a lot of machine-learning, where its not going to be a matter of us dissecting all the micro-expressions that people do. Its gonna be lets take every youtube video ever made and run it through some enormous learner that's going to figure out how to make people realistic.","135":"So, when you say it's an inverse-square law, that means that the closer you are, the more strongly you feel the gravitational pull. And that makes sense. There's very few things that are stronger when you're further apart.","136":"So you can also think of a gravitational field, something that permeates all of space. Even though the earth is three stories below us, it's not as though it's pulling at us from a distance. We're actually interacting with the field at this point and there's a real interaction right here at this point. And that's nice, because people were worried that if things acted at a distance, that the way that old-fashioned inverse-square force law describes it, that it was as spooky as mind-bending a spoon, that it was like telekinesis. If you don't touch something, how do you affect it? And so the first step was to start to think of gravity as a field that permeates all of a space. And it's weaker very far from the Earth and it's closer very close to the Earth. So one way to think of this field as a field that's really describing a curved space-time that is everywhere. Forget the difficulty of the math, just the intuition comes from two kind of simple observations. One was what Einstein described as the happiest thought of his life. So, right now, you might feel heavy in your chair, and we might feel heavy on the floor and our feet, or standing in an elevator cab. And Einstein said, what does the chair have to do with it, or the floor, or the elevator? Those aren't gravitational objects. So he wanted to eliminate them, and one way to do the thought experiment is to imagine standing in an elevator that you can see out of, a black box. And imagine the cable is cut and you and the elevator begin to fall.","137":"You can make somebody look like they're in the International Space Station by flying up in a plane and then just free-falling, the plane just drops out of the air. And while it's falling, they will float weightlessly, and there's been a lot of experiments about it, but you don't want it to end unhappily, so the plane has to scoop back up, and then you see them become pinned to the floor of the plane, because then the plane is interrupting their fall. So that's the first thought, and then the next is, what is the shape that's chased? So if you were floating in empty space, really empty space, and you had an apple, and you threw the apple, what shape do you think it would chase, the path?","138":"Yeah, it would chase a curve, it would chase an arc. And the faster you throw it, the kind of longer the arc. So the second step to think about curved space-time is to say that when things fall freely around a body like the Earth, they trace curved paths, as though space-time itself, space itself was curved.","139":"You went, Oh. [Janna and Lisa laugh] So, that's the intuition, that's how Einstein gets from thinking that space-time is curved from the idea that, well, there's this field that permeates all of space, and what is really describing is the curves that things fall along. And from there, it's a very long path to finding the mathematics and the right description, that's really hard. But that intuition is so elegant and so beautiful and just comes from these two simple thought experiments.","140":"So you described learning in a class about light the theory of special relativity where Einstein is really adhering to the constancy of the speed of light and questioning the absolute nature of space and time. And it seems like that has nothing to do with gravity, but he later begins to think about the incompatibility of gravity with his theory of relativity. So suppose the Sun were to disappear tomorrow. Some evil genius comes and just figures out a way to evaporate the Sun. In Newton's understanding of gravity, we would instantaneously know about it all the way over here at the Earth. And that's incompatible with the concept that nothing can travel faster than the speed of light. No information, not even information about the Sun, could possibly travel faster than the speed of light. So we shouldn't know about what happened to the Sun for a full eight minutes, which is the time it would take light to travel to us. And so he begins to question why gravity is so incompatible with relativity, but he already knows he's thinking about space and time in relativity. So then he gets to his general theory of relativity where he realizes if I eliminate everything but just the gravitational field of let's say the Earth and I look at how things fall and I see that they follow curves, well, then he realizes that space and time don't just contract or dilate, that they can really warp, that they can bend and that they can curve. And then he finds a way to make gravity compatible with relativity by saying if the Sun were to disappear tomorrow, the curves that the Sun imprinted in space-time would actually begin to ripple, and those are the gravitational waves, and they would change and they would flatten out, 'cause the Sun was no longer there. And that would take the light-travel time to get to us to tell us that the Sun was gone, and then we would stop orbiting and just travel along a straight line.","141":"And I dare say, even though you might not have put this word on it, odds are you executed as a human, multiple algorithms today even before you came here today. Like what were a few things that you did?","142":"Okay, so all of those, frankly, if we really dove more deeply, could be broken down into step-by-step instructions. And presumably your mom, your dad, someone in the past sort of programmed you as a human to know what to do. And then after that, as a smart human, you can sort of take it from there and you don't need their help anymore. But that's kind of what we're doing when we program computers. Something maybe even more familiar nowadays, like odds are you have a cell phone. Your contacts or your address book. But let me ask you why that is. Like why does Apple or Google or anyone else bother alphabetizing your contacts?","143":"That, in of itself, is kind of a problem or it's an inefficient solution to the problem. So, it turns out that back in my day, before there were cell phones, everyone's numbers from my schools were literally printed in a book, and everyone in my town and my city, my state was printed in an actual phone book. Even if you've never seen this technology before, how would you propose verbally to find John in this phone book?","144":"Yeah. So, let me propose that we start that way. I could just start at the beginning and step by step I could just look at each page, looking for John, looking for John. Now even if you've never seen this here technology before, it turns out this is exactly what your phone could be doing in software, like someone from Google or Apple or the like, they could write software that uses a technique in programming known as a loop, and a loop, as the word implies, is just sort of do something again and again. What if instead of starting from the beginning and going one page at a time, what if I, or what if your phone goes like two pages or two names at a time? Would this be correct do you think?","145":"Yeah, so sort of accidentally and frankly with like 50\/50 probability, John could get sandwiched in between two pages. But does that mean I have to throw that algorithm out altogether?","146":"Okay, that's nice. So, you could kind of like go twice as fast but then kind of pump the brakes as you near your exit on the highway, or in this case near the J section of the book.","147":"And maybe alternatively, if I get to like A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, if I get to the K section, then I could just double back like one page just to make sure John didn't get sandwiched between those pages. So, the nice thing about that second algorithm is that I'm flying through the phone book like two pages at a time. So, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12. It's not perfect, it's not necessarily correct but it is if I just take one extra step. So, I think it's fixable, but what your phone is probably doing and frankly what I and like my parents and grandparents used to do back in the day was we'd probably go roughly to the middle of the phone book here, and just intuitively, if this is an alphabetized phone book in English, what section am I probably going to find myself in roughly?","148":"Yeah. So, John is going to be to the left or the right and what we can do here, though your phone does something smarter, is tear the problem in half, throw half of the problem away, being left with just 500 pages now. But what might I next do? I could sort of naively just start at the beginning again, but we've learned to do better. I can go roughly to the middle here.","149":"Yeah, exactly. So, now maybe I'm in the E section, which is a little to the left. So, John is clearly going to be to the right, so I can again tear the problem poorly in half, throw this half of the problem away, and I claim now that if we started with a thousand pages, now we've gone to 500, 250, now we're really moving quickly.","150":"And so, eventually I'm hopefully dramatically left with just one single page at which point John is either on that page or not on that page, and I can call him. Roughly how many steps might this third algorithm take if I started with a thousand pages then went to 500, 250, 125, how many times can you divide 1,000 in half? Maybe?","151":"That's roughly roughly 10. Because in the first algorithm, looking again for someone like Zoe in the worst case might have to go all the way through a thousand pages. But the second algorithm you said was 500, maybe 501, essentially the same thing. So, twice as fast. But this third and final algorithm is sort of fundamentally faster because you're sort of dividing and conquering it in half, in half, in half, not just taking one or two bites out of it out of a time. So, this of course is not how we used to use phone books back in the day since otherwise they'd be single use only. But it is how your phone is actually searching for Zoe, for John, for anyone else, but it's doing it in software.","152":"So, here we've happened to focus on searching algorithms, looking for John in the phone book. But the technique we just used can indeed be called divide and conquer, where you take a big problem and you divide and conquer it, that is you try to chop it up into smaller, smaller, smaller pieces. A more sophisticated type of algorithm, at least depending on how you implement it, something known as a recursive algorithm. Recursive algorithm is essentially an algorithm that uses itself to solve the exact same problem again and again, but chops it smaller, and smaller, and smaller ultimately.","153":"Excellent. I got an engineering physics degree. There you go, something in common. We're here today talking about lasers. So have you have had much exposure to lasers yet at school?","154":"The necklace is something that was designed for my Nobel prize. It's sold at the Nobel museum and it is a chirped pulse. So we've been talking a lot about lasers and applications, what have you learned about chirped pulses?","155":"Absolutely. And that's a great example because you have models that are operating to do things like figure out if a new email is spam or not. So what would you think about if you were looking at an email and trying to decide if it went in one category or another?","156":"So these are things we would call features. And we go through a process where we do feature engineering, where somebody looks at the example and says, Okay, these are the things that I think might allow us to statistically tell the difference from something in one category versus another. So for example, perhaps you don't speak Russian, you start getting a lot of email in Russian.","157":"You can just barely tell. And you can see that even, like if you hold out your hand and you focus on your hand, then your foot would be blurry because there's that difference there. And you can change between that, like you can then focus on your foot and your hand gets blurry. Because your eyes can see different amounts of detail in different places. So we're hoping in the future, that hardware can be like that. Where we can make a display that puts lots of detail right where you're looking. And every time you look someplace else, it moves the detail over to there. So we don't need to render a hundred times as much as we've got right now. Figuring out where you're looking is a pretty hard problem. What we try to go about this, is by taking a camera and looking at people's eyes and then try to figure out is the eye looking over here or up here. We're working hard on stuff like this right now so we hopefully can have a virtual reality that's as detailed and realistic feeling as the reality that we've actually got around us. But its going to be a long time before we get to where we can really fool people.","158":"One of the things I love about about nanoscience is it tends to break up the silos between those traditional scientific disciplines. My training was in chemistry, but I had to very quickly merged chemistry and physics. And now I see an area where chemistry, physics, and biology are coming together to produce new materials and new technology, and to advance the field forward. And so being in this field, you kind of have to cross pollinate between these different disciplines and kind of advance the field together.","159":"The reason we're not just flying off the earth is because earth has gravity, so if we throw something up, it comes back down, so that's why when we're walking on the earth, we don't fly off the earth because the earth has gravity, and it keeps us down.","160":"The main thing about black hole to remember is that it's just, like I said, how the earth holds you down, the black hole pulls you in, as well. Now, try and take the ball from me, black hole--","161":"Yes, we're gonna talk about science and we're gonna talk about a very specific kinda science, about people who study brains. Do you know what a brain is? What is it?","162":"Okay, well there's more cells in your brain, like way more cells, than all the stars we can see. (Daniel gasps) (Bobby laughs) And so what the connectome is, is we'd like to know where every cell in your brain is and how it talks to every other cell in your brain.","163":"To note our recent paper, where we were thinking about Einstein's ideas of special relativity, but in a setting where the global shape of the space time, we imagine there might be a curled up dimension of space, a circular dimension and thought about how special relativity works in that setting, we came to a result in this very basic setting. You can send signals into the past, not in a way that will violate causality. Did that surprise you, that by going from the usual topology that doesn't have a closed part of space, but making that one change, you could have this radical impact?","164":"And the beauty of it is, it is not like there is some high-powered mathematical methodology, straightforward algebra that a high school kid would know is all that you need to extract these unusual results.","165":"Many people have begun thinking about the possibility that space and time may be so-called emergent quantities that they're not as fundamental as perhaps Newton or Einstein would've thought. Where do you stand on that idea?","166":"One of the things that relativity also sheds a light on is what exists, that if someone's moving relative to me, what they consider now might be in my past, what they consider now might be in my future, which would suggest that all of time exists much as we're willing to accept that all of space exists. Is that cold water?","167":"So the side channel analysis is really looking not at a vulnerability within a system, but really unintended consequences of what the system is built on. A very simple example of a side channel is putting your ear to the ground to hear if there are horses coming towards you, and the same thing applies to technology. So you can have something like a CPU, it's executing instructions, certain instructions that use a little bit more power, and power is reserved in these capacitors, which are like tiny batteries next to your CPU. And as they're pulling power, there's something in physics called the electrostrictive effect where the capacitor will move in a very, very tiny amount. And then although we can't hear it, the microphone on a mobile device can actually listen to that. If you then listen to that and you say, oh, I see a pattern here, and you can go all the way down and then extract and reveal the full password, the full key, even though it could be argued that the algorithm itself, there's no problem with it.","168":"The risk right now, just during this quarantine, is actually massive now that we think about it, because you might have these legacy systems. You know, they were built 20, 30 years ago, and it's too costly to upgrade, but now you can't actually have a lot of people in a single location, so potentially, they actually do have to now add some sort of remote capabilities to these systems that were never meant to be on the internet. Have you ever had any ethical concerns with the stuff you're interested in or the work you do?","169":"What if it were illegal? Would you then do it? Fortunately it's not today, right? It hasn't been, you know, despite their attempts, none of that has been passed, but if you had a vehicle and you wanted to inspect it, but all of a sudden, it passed, I mean.","170":"But the laws don't always equate to hurting anyone. I ethically think similar to you in that, you know, what is moral to me is as long as I'm not intentionally hurting others, right?","171":"Maybe a mutual acquaintance of ours, Jasper gave a example of fault injection, and I like to use that as, when I'm trying to explain fault injection, he shows a pinball machine and the pinball machine, obviously the two inputs are the two plungers when you're playing a pinball machine, but fault injection, you can tilt the entire pinball machine, right? You're just introducing some external variable that's outside of the traditional inputs that you're used to and you've now controlled the environment in a advantageous way to the user or the player. Can you give an example of some type of fault injection that you're doing or working on?","172":"It's a good one. The melody on its own just goes. (hums Amazing Grace) That melody on its own is kind of lonely, right? And no one really knows how it feels. (plays and hums Amazing Grace) So which one did you prefer?","173":"Yeah, ah, that's great. I can decide how I want this melody to feel and the more notes there are, the more exciting it is. That's what musical harmony is. Does that make sense?","174":"One of the weird things and wonderful things about wormholes is that they are tunnels, if you will, shortcuts from one point in space to another point in space. But once you have a shortcut from here to there, the beautiful thing is, if you move the openings, time will elapse differently at the different openings. So there's a possibility of wormholes as time machines. Go one direction, you're going into the future, go the other direction, you'd be going into the past. But that, of course, raises philosophical and logical--","175":"Yeah, so you go into the past, and maybe you can prevent your parents from meeting, but you're preventing them from meeting in the parallel reality, which means that you will never be born in that reality, but the origin of your birth is still completely understood, it was in the universe from which you originated. Another one that's more subtle is, the laws of physics may prevent you from interceding.","176":"Yeah, so that one, there's actually some people like Joe Polchinski who did some wonderful studies of billiard ball tables, where you imagine a billiard ball goes into a wormhole, comes out and hits the very ball that was going into the hole. And in that way, if it could knock it off course, we seem to be in some logical paradox.","177":"But the finding was, the ball can come out and just sort of graze the other one, but it can't affect it enough to prevent the sequence of events from happening. And the way I like to think about it frankly is if there's one universe, not parallel universes like in the other solution, moments in time just are. They don't change, the whole point of time is the variable along which change can happen. So if you have the atoms of time, the individual events, there's no conception of them changing. So whatever collection of influences were in play that allowed your parents to meet, they will always be in play because you were always part of that moment.","178":"And imagine I turn on two laser beams, sending a beam of light going to my right and to my left. And these beams will go around the entirety of space, and they'll both come back, and at some point, they will hit me. Imagine they hit me at the same moment from my perspective. Now imagine someone's moving relative to my frame of reference, say, to my left, they do the same experiment. They fire the beam of light left and right. Notice that the beam that they fire to their left will have to travel farther to reach them because they're moving away from it. Whereas the beam that they fired to their right will not have to travel as far because in some sense, they're moving toward it. The two beams of light will not hit that moving observer at the same moment.","179":"No, everybody else is moving relative to me, and it's real motion. So everybody else will be like the moving twin. They will be younger and I will be older. And when you think about past and future on a cosmological scale, there was a long period when there were no human beings in the universe. The fact of the matter is there will be these two long stretches with our presence being sort of a flicker in between, does that thought inform anything about how you live in your brief flicker within that brief flicker?","180":"It can be debilitating to imagine an eternal future of sort of nothing, where none of what we do sort of persist. On the other hand, if you flip your perspective around and say, How remarkable is it that we have this brief moment that allows us to think and feel and love and explore and illuminate, wow, how wonderful is that?","181":"For me, I would describe chess as a lot of what you said, and also, it's a mix of really quick plans like tactics and then things that can take four, five, six, seven moves like a plan, like a strategy. So let's practice. In this position, I had the white pieces. You're playing on my side. My opponent was playing with the black pieces. So we switched a little bit. So if I said, Hey, you get three moves in a row, can you come up with a plan?","182":"I'm very happy that's the first plan that you came up with, right? You can bring your queen out this way or the rook. You can start with both, and then you come here and then you checkmate. But I did say white gets three moves in a row, right?","183":"But that's how we have to think about plans, right? We have to think about, Okay, well if I get a couple of moves in a row, what would I like to accomplish? What does my opponent want to do? So I'm not just gonna sit here and get checkmated hopefully. Right? So what do you think I want to do in this position?","184":"Oh, you're saying like if I take this pawn, maybe in the future I'll try to open up this diagonal. See, that's very good vision. There's some pieces in the way, but yes. In chess, you have to always keep an eye on what can possibly open. Do you know how you can tell whether a position is closed or open?","185":"Yes, you're 100% right 'cause in chess, the two most important things we have to think about are who has more material, but then, like you said, who has the weaker king? And I would say my king has gone way too far, right? So there's a tactic here for what?","186":"So that's like immediately you get a reward, but I'll give you a hint. The best way to start looking for a tactic, always look for a check first. Do you have a way to attack my king?","187":"And then you would take the rook. Now the funny thing is you are now totally winning, right? But as we know in chess, maybe one day white will make a mistake in the future. So there's no point for black to surrender here, but this is definitely a really good start.","188":"Because the materials are so small, they're at the nanoscale, their properties are dominated by quantum mechanics, which means that even slight changes in their size, in their orientation give profound changes in their properties. And while that's very scientifically interesting, and it allows you to tune their properties by making subtle changes, from a technology point of view, it's a bit of a headache in the sense that in technology want to optimize for a property and then repeat that over and over again. So what are some of the challenges that you face in the lab related to working with these materials and then trying to incorporate them into the batteries?","189":"Its basically a delay and it happens in all parts of the system: monitors can be a big one. Like consumer televisions can often have 15 milliseconds or more of latency just in the TV part. And then you've got the processing and the computer and all of these add up to the total latency.","190":"30 years ago, you had desktop PCs which were, you spent whatever on that, but there was always this idea well you could spend a million dollars and buy a super-computer and its gonna be a lot faster. And that's not really true today. For scalar processing, when you just do one thing after another, a high-end, overclocked, cool gaming PC is about the fastest thing in the world. It is within a very small delta, yeah for some things you'll get some IBM power system that might be a little bit faster, but not a whole lot. So if I'm looking at this and saying we need to be five times faster. What do you do? You can't just say make each thing faster. As a developer you're making a trade-off, I can put my effort into making this more efficient or making it more fun. And more fun usually wins out for very good reasons. So there's some good judgment and trickery that goes into the design of things. But you can always just design a game that will just not work well. (laughing) I mean in the old days, games had to be so precisely designed. Nowadays you've got a ton more freedom. You really can--","191":"But VR makes, you have to give up a little bit of that freedom, you have to not do so many crazy things, so you can wind up having it be as responsive and high quality as it needs to be.","192":"When you give up most of what you want? Well, sometimes that definitely happens for sure. What if I told you that this is the kind of technology that I work on that means you could trade with any kid all over the world?","193":"That's probably a good idea, maybe somebody else likes it more than you do. So normally, when people trade, they have to go to the store, or they have to know the person so they can get what they asked for. With blockchain, you can make that exact same trade, but you don't need the store, and you don't even necessarily need to know the other person.","194":"That's right. When we teach machines to learn from data, to build a model from that data or a representation of that, and then to make a prediction. One of the places we often find machine learning in the real world is in things like recommendation systems. So do you have an artist that you really like?","195":"And that's actually a really interesting thing to think about because that creepy vibe is something that you can perceive and I can perceive, but it's actually really hard to describe to a machine. What do you think might go into that?","196":"Sometimes, the ads you see are really uncanny. And I think that's because they're based on so much data. They know where you live. They know where your device is. It's also important to realize that people in aggregate are actually pretty predictable. Like when we talk to each other, we like to talk about the novel things, like here, we're having this conversation. We don't do this every day. But we probably still eat breakfast. We're gonna eat lunch. We're gonna eat dinner. You probably are going to the same home you go to most of the time. And so, they're able to take that data that we already give them and make predictions based on that as to what ads they should show us.","197":"So yeah it's a light bulb and there's a couple of mirrors. Now the light bulb has to be a little bit special. It has to be a type of material that can store the energy in an excited state right? It has to stay up there really energetic and sit there for a while so that when the light comes along, it takes that energy and becomes stronger light and then the mirror sends it back and it does it again and again and again and between these two mirrors, it makes the light come out in a nice beam. In a laser, it comes out as a single color. They all come out with their waves at the same time. Every wave peaks at the same time which then makes it a giant wave and it's this giant wave that has a tremendous amount of power. So it can do something like cutting steel. But when you cut steel, or if you were cutting this floor, it's gray, it actually will absorb the light. That's why the light, you don't see it because the light isn't bouncing back or through it. So I like to use demos to explain how my laser works. So I've brought basically a hammer and a nail. I'm sure you've probably hammered a nail before into a piece of wood but the question is, if you asked yourself why it is we hit the big end and it's the tiny end that we put on the piece of wood. We could never pick up a hammer and hit the sharp end and hope this would go in to the piece of wood.","198":"That's right. All the force that we apply here, goes all the way through but then it can only basically come out when it contacts the wood in that one tiny spot. And so sometimes it's the force that you push something with but sometimes it is that force per unit area. But sometimes it's not even the force per unit area 'cos, you know, push down as hard as you can on that and see if we can get it pushed in. See it doesn't really work does it?","199":"Exactly. You know sometimes you want to have all of your energy not just in a small area but in the small volume and so one of the other dimensions is time or length. But with light, time and length are the same thing because light always travels at the speed of light.","200":"But if you send a one second long light pulse out into the skies there, the beginning of the pulse is actually two thirds of the way to the moon. It's 300,000 kilometers long. So now, if you talk about light being concentrated, that doesn't seem very concentrated. The type of lasers I play with in my lab will be no thicker than this piece of paper. So we take that energy that might be in three hundred thousand kilometers and we squeeze it all the way down into just this piece of paper and actually the beams are more the size of this piece of paper and so, in my lab, pieces of paper like this would be flying through the sky but we can't see them. 'Cos they don't come in our eyes, they fly by us and they're infra red.","201":"Into a spot. So here would be my light coming from my laser and it would just be coming down, down, down, down, down. Hit a lens and it would have to focus down. But now, all the light started out with this big of a spread so concentrated this much. Eventually it would be here, more concentrated. But by the end, right at the focal spot, that's when I get all of my light, all of the energy has been squeezed down into fitting inside this piece of paper and that's why I say that I built a laser hammer. Because when this hits a piece of glass, it just smacks hose electrons right off the atoms and there's nothing else for them to do, they have to fly away. So can you tell me what you learned and maybe about the focusing of the light?","202":"Okay. We're going to start with a model that every Japanese person learns in kindergarten, it's called a crane, traditional origami design, it's over 400 years old. So, people have been doing what we're about to do for 400 years.","203":"Let's fold it in half from corner to corner, unfold it and then we'll fold it in half the other direction, also corner to corner but we're going to lift it up and we're going to hold the fold with both hands. We're going to bring these corners together, making a little pocket and then, this is the trickiest part of this whole design, so you're going to put your finger underneath the top layer and we're going to try to make that layer fold right along the edge. Now you see how the sides kind of want to come in as you're doing that?","204":"Now, this is a traditional Japanese design but there are origami designs that have been around so long we're not entirely sure where they originated. We're going to learn how to fold a cootie catcher.","205":"So we'll start with the white side up and we're going to fold it in half from corner to corner, in one fold and now we're going to fold all four corners to the crossing point in the center. We'll fold it in half like a book. On the folded side we'll take one of the folded corners and I'm going to fold it up through all layers. There's a pocket in the middle. We're going to spread the pocket and bring all four corners together. Where you have original corners of the square, we're gonna just pop those out. This is one of the most satisfying moments, I think-","206":"Yeah, but there's something else we can do with this model. If we set it down and push on the middle then pop it inside out so that three flaps come up and one stays down and then it's called talking crow because here's a little crow's beak and mouth.","207":"There's thousands of other origami designs but these are some of the first people learn and this was, in fact, one of the first origami designs I learned some 50 years ago.","208":"All right, we'll switch this. And now to your point, we don't need to bother with the ones that already bubbled their way up. Now we are a hundred percent sure it's sorted.","209":"And certainly the search engines of the world, Google and Bing and so forth, they probably don't keep webpages in sorted order 'cause that would be a crazy long list when you're just trying to search the data. But there's probably some algorithm underlying what they do and they probably similarly, just like we, do a bit of work upfront to get things organized even if it's not strictly sorted in the same way so that people like you and me and others can find that same information. So, how about social media? Can you envision where the algorithms are in that world?","210":"Well, that's true, we do use slingshot technology once things are out in the solar system. So, for instance, we use Jupiter and other planets so that when some of the spacecraft gets close, it'll slingshot around and it'll cause it to speed up. But mostly, around the Earth, gravity pulls things down, so when we want to send a rocket into space, when we wanna go to the Moon, when we wanna send supplies to the International Space Station, the trick is to get something moving fast enough that it escapes the gravitational pull of the Earth. Have you heard the expression what goes up must come down? It's actually not true. If you throw it fast enough, you can actually get something that doesn't come back down again, and that's basically how rocket launches work. You have to get the rocket for the Earth to go more than 11 kilometers a second. Think of how fast it is. Just one breath and it's gone 11 kilometers. If you get it to go that fast, it's not gonna come back down again. So you know the International Space Station which is orbiting the Earth? That's going around the Earth at 17,000 miles an hour. It has no engines anymore, the engines are turned off. So it's just there falling forever. So once it's out there, it's not coming back down as long as it's cruising like that.","211":"Yeah, you feel pinned to that. It's exactly like that. There's something called the equivalence principle where people realized, especially Einstein, that if you were in outer space in a rocket ship and it was dark and painted and it was accelerating at exactly the right rate, you actually wouldn't know if you were sitting on the floor of a building around the Earth or if you were on a rocket ship that was accelerating.","212":"That's because in some sense, you're really not. Imagine you're in this train and it's going near the speed of light relative to the platform, but it's so smooth, then you should be in a situation in which there's no meaning to your absolute motion, there's no absolute motion. So that if you throw a ball up, you might think from the outside of the platform, be confused that when gravity pulls that back down, it's gonna hit you or something, but it'll land in your palm as surely as if you were in your living room.","213":"So imagine you were an astronaut and you were floating in empty space. You can't see anything. There's no stars, there's no Earth. You can ask yourself, am I moving? There's really no way for you to tell. So you would probably conclude, well, I'm not moving. So then your friend Marina comes cruising past you, and maybe she's going thousands of kilometers a second, and you say, Marina, you're cruising at thousands of kilometers a second, you're going so fast. But she had just done the same experiment. She was just floating in space thinking, Am I moving? There's no way to know which one of you is moving and there's no meaning to the absolute motion. The only thing that's true is that you're in relative motion, that's true. You both agree you're in relative motion, and that's clear. But neither of you can say it's actually you who's moving and I'm stationary.","214":"So, let's say you and Marina are floating in space and you can't tell who's moving. Let's say you both see a flash of light. A flash of light comes from somewhere, you don't know where. So you measure the speed of light to be 300,000 kilometers per second. But here comes Marina and she's racing at the light pulse, as far as you can tell. Two cars driving towards each other seem like they're going faster towards each other than somebody who's standing still relative to one of the cars, right?","215":"You know, a lot of people, a lot of string theorists, they care a lot about all the different ways in which we could hide the extra dimensions. As someone who cares about cosmology, I wanna start asking why are the extra dimensions small at all? How did that happen? Is this something you think about yourself?","216":"Right? And down there in the tube it looks like your long thing that is compactified in one direction and infinitely extending in the other direction, so there's one less macroscopic dimension of space.","217":"Yeah, I've been trying to explain this to lower levels, and they always look at me like, are you pulling my leg here a little bit? Or is this the real thing that they use? Yes, it is the real thing they use. We study these branes in de Sitter space, and so what we found is that there are black brane solutions which instead of having a singularity inside are non-singular, and stable, and compactified. Is this a familiar thing? I know things like this have been discussed, right?","218":"But then the other dimensions, the transverse dimensions, don't need to be anti-de Sitter. They can have either positive, zero, or negative cosmological constant. So you can basically get any sort of cosmological solution times a compactified sphere.","219":"And if we put aside for the second the concerns of our colleagues in other parts of physics, and it's just amongst us chickens, what do you think about the future of cosmology and string theory, and the dynamics of these extra dimensions?","220":"And I just wrote a book called Something Deeply Hidden about many worlds, quantum mechanics, and how spacetime can emerge from it. Plenty of reading material for the audience out there.","221":"Awesome, good. (laughs) It's a map of all the connections between every neuron in your brain. It literally, in a human brain, something like a map of the one quadrillion connections that a hundred billion neurons make with each other.","222":"We have to use electron microscopes and then what we have been developing a way to slice the brain into really thin slices, use an electron microscope to take a picture of each slice, and then use computers to put it all back. Imagine that we could get a map of every connection, right? And we knew how neurons fire. Do you think we could put that in a computer, that map, and then therefore, that computer should be able to think just like the brain that we extracted it from?","223":"So chess is separated into three games, obviously. You have your opening, which is the early stage of the game. Then we have the middle game, right? The most confusing, mysterious side of the game, and the end game where there's no pieces remaining on the board. You gotta have to know how to convert positions, defend positions, understand how to play the game with only five pieces remaining or something like that. So for you, what do you struggle with the most?","224":"In all middle games where we have this mix of tactics, which are immediate gain or immediate loss, depending on if we're getting hit with a tactic or playing one, and strategic chess. I just want you to tell me, who do you think has a better position here and by how much?","225":"This is how we unlock the intermediate level, which is this move. That move looks like it's disconnecting from the whole board, right? It's a move totally on the edge, but nobody is gonna stop your bishop from going to that diagonal, and then you're threatening a tactic. You're threatening a skewer. You would hit my queen and my rook. Stronger piece in front, weaker peace in back, and then you would be guaranteed to win some material. Just like little pattern recognition in the middle game. So for the future, you're gonna have a game where your opponent makes the same trade early, right? They trade their dark-squared bishop, and you can activate it like that, but in this game, you focused on the center, which was totally fine also.","226":"Yes. Yes. And this move is actually very annoying for white because not only am I now targeting things in your center, what else have I changed just by moving this pawn?","227":"Yes. Another thing for middle game. So we just keep adding to that bucket of knowledge. Pawn breaks for the opponent, and then, every time something moves, like a pawn, we have to look around. What else is now opening up? And we wanna get to a situation where you knew this move was gonna happen, and the next I'm gonna come here, and then now what can I do? I can bring both my rooks, and now I have no problems, right? Now I have both knights, queen, rooks. So we need to get to a point where we see that coming, and we're not just focusing on our own plans, but that's not always easy. So with a pawn here, that disrupts my plan, right? Because now this move fails to-","228":"Yes. As you're trying to improve your middle game, one question you always have to ask yourself is, Is that trade good for me? Is it good for my opponent? It's not checkers. You don't have to take me, and I don't have to take you. So we can do something called keeping the tension. We're just having a staring contest here among the pawns. So I'm gonna ask you, do you think it's better for black to capture this pawn or keep the tension? Just slide the rook over and threaten to push the pawn here, which would be a tactic and a fork.","229":"Yes, exactly. So now in the snap of your fingers, you can get your bishop out and the rook, two things that a move ago were just totally blocked in by a pawn, exactly. So in the middle game, trades are either good or bad for you and for your opponent.","230":"So a nice place to start is with the idea of a triad. A triad is a three-part harmony, basically. (keyboard harmonic tone) So that's a triad. So this triad's called C major.","231":"So in Amazing Grace, you start with F. You know, if I go (melodic humming) \u266a How sweet the sound \u266a (scat singing) (laughs) Where am I right now? I don't know where I am. (scat singing) And my job is to get back home, but to make this chord make sense.","232":"That's pretty good. So gravity wants to attract us to the Earth, and the Earth to us. But the Earth is so much bigger that even though we're actually pulling the Earth a little bit to us, you don't notice it so much. You know, the Moon pulls on the Earth a little bit.","233":"[Janna] Exactly, the Moon is such a big body compared to anything else very nearby that it has the larger effect, pulling the water of the Earth. But more than the Moon, think about the Sun pulling on the Earth. We orbit the whole Sun, just the way the Earth pulls on the Moon and causes the Moon to orbit us. All of those things are acting on you and me right now.","234":"That's such a good question. No, we actually couldn't. In the Moon, gravity is weaker, you can almost float between footsteps if you look at the astronauts on the Moon. On the Earth, it's harder, 'cause it's bigger. If you go to a bigger, heavier planet, it gets harder and harder. But there are stars that have died that are so dense that there's no way we could lift our arms, no way we could step or walk. The gravity is just way too strong. Do you know how tall you are?","235":"They say that astronauts in space, definitely their spine elongates. There were two twin astronauts, one who stayed here on Earth and the other who went to the International Space Station. He was there for a long time, and when he came back, he was actually taller than his twin brother.","236":"Yeah, and that was because gravity wasn't compressing him all the time and he was floating freely in the International Space Station and his spine just kind of elongated. After a while here on Earth though he'll readjust, he'll go back to the same size. Have you ever heard of how gravity was discovered?","237":"They look the same, but this is much heavier, right? Okay, so try it, just try holding your arms up front, a little higher maybe, give them a chance to drop, and then drop them. [balls thud] [Janna laughs] Did they fall at the same time? Did they hit at the same time? So, Isaac Newton, he was also the one who realized that that's the same force that keeps the Moon in orbit around the Earth and the Earth in orbit around the Sun, and that's a huge leap. Here he is, looking at just things around him, and then looks at the stars and has this really big realization, that that's actually the same force. So, what have you learned today talking about gravity?","238":"I think that it actually has a lot of mystery around it, because the fuel for fusion is a plasma, and we don't experience plasmas on earth in our everyday life.","239":"So they're plasmas which are held in a stable enough state by strong external magnetic fields confining the plasma into a donut shape. And this has a lot of advantages for us, because charged particles want to follow the magnetic field lines. But things start to get really interesting when we're no longer thinking about individual particle motions in the plasma. And instead we start to think about collective effects.","240":"So one really big advance in plasma theory over the last I'd say three or four decades has been the development of a gyrokinetic theory that we use to model the micro-turbulence in the plasma and get that under control. And the reason it's so important to get the turbulence under control and understand it is because turbulence is the primary heat loss mechanism. the primary way that heat is transported from hot to cold across confining field lines in a magnetic confinement system. Being able to study it, measure it and predict how it's going to behave is really one of the big hurdles to overcome.","241":"And it has a particular radius of that helix called the gyro radius, because it's just gyrating. So what we know from studying the plasma and making direct measurements of the turbulence and also what comes from the simulations is the scale size of the turbulence is about 5 to 10 gyro radii.","242":"So that's good, because that's why you're here, and so we're talking about sleep today, and really about kind of what is the brain machinery through which we go through consciousness to unconsciousness and that transition.","243":"Okay. The best way to think about this transition is really called, it's a flip flop switch, okay? So this term comes from engineering, and the idea is that in sleep, you basically have kind of this all of nothing experience. Certainly people kind of drift off to sleep, but then all of a sudden you're unconscious, right? So it seems like it's this flip flop between the arousal system and the sleep promoting system, and it's certainly regulated, and we'll get a little bit into that, but they're certainly kind of made up of two reciprocally inhibitory processes. Okay, so we have the ascending reticular activating system. It originates in the brain stem, and there's a dorsal and a ventral arm to this, and so the dorsal arm has neurons, cholinergic neurons, that go up to the thalamus and then it projections into the fore brain, and then there's the ventral arm, and this is comprised of a whole bunch of different types of neurons, so there are monominergic, so there's kind of dopaminergic neurons that come from the periaqueductal gray, serotonergic ones from the dorsal raphae nuclei, histaminergic neurons that come from the tuberomammillary nucleus of the hippothalamus, and then noradrenergic neurons from the locus coeruleus, and so all of those are kind of working in tandem to kind of drive wake within the brain. So if we just think about drugs that are available inducing wakefulness, we can certainly, kind of the dopaminergic ones jump out, right? So we have amphetamines that kind of drive those signaling, and then modafinil, which is a wake promoting drug for people that have kind of excessive day-time sleepiness that maintains alertness throughout the day.","244":"Well one of the fun things people do with lasers, the cat will try to grab that dot. I'm sure what you have at home is a flashlight. I brought a cute little one. So the question is, do you see any difference between what a flashlight does and what a laser does?","245":"That's true, that laser's just a dot. And so the other thing to notice though is that, like if I shine it in your eyes and I'm sorry if I do! But it seems awfully bright doesn't it? And yet when, you know, you shine this down and you put the laser, which one do you see easier?","246":"One of the things that lasers are great for is that because it's a directed beam, we can actually put that light where we want the light to go and sometimes you maybe just want to see something around the corner and you can't see it. But with a laser, you can actually and this is a smoky one so you can actually watch it go. You see it actually bending the corner?","247":"And that's because the light will go through this glass and, when it hits that corner, it has to bend. And we actually send laser beams down glass fibers, the size of your hair.","248":"So this is just a demonstration. If you have a laser like this, it actually bends and comes out, I'm gonna point it to you and you'll see it coming out the other end. It hits these walls, it has to go around and come out the other side. You wanna play? So is this the first time you've seen a laser or have you gotten to play with lasers somewhere else?","249":"That's a laser. We cut steel with them now. We actually do surgery with lasers. You know when some people have either scars or birth marks that they don't want to see? We can actually remove those with lasers now. Never seen a laser light show? When they light up the sky with lasers, it's almost like fireworks.","250":"The thing that makes them cool is they're sort of like tilings, it looks like you could put this together by cutting little pieces of paper and sliding them together, but they're still one sheet.","251":"There's no cuts in these just folding. We can build these up from smaller building blocks of folds, learn how to fold little pieces and put them together in the same way that a tiling like this looks like it's built up of little pieces. Can you make a fold that starts at the dot that doesn't run all the way across the paper?","252":"So they're all reversible and it turns out that in every origami shape that folds flat, it's going to be either three mountains and a valley or, if we're looking at the backside, three valleys and a mountain, they always differ by two.","253":"That's a rule of all flat origami no matter how many folds come together at a point and I'm going to show you a building block of tessellations, it's called a twist because that center square, as I unfold it, it twists, it rotates.","254":"If I had another twist in the same sheet of paper I could make these folds connect with that, and these folds connect with that. And if I had another one up here, I could make all three. And if I had a square array and all the folds lined up I could make bigger and bigger arrays, like these, because these are just very large twists. In this case it's an octagon rather than a square, but they're arranged in rows and columns. And let's just try going along. All right, there is our tessellation with squares and hexagons. So you have now designed and folded your first origami tessellation and perhaps you can see how just using this idea of building up tiles and small building blocks you could make tessellations as big and complex as you want.","255":"So machine learning is a way that we teach computers to learn things about the world by looking at patterns and looking at examples of things. So can I show you an example of how a machine might learn something?","256":"That's true. Do you think, if we look at these pictures, do you think maybe we could say, Well, they both have pointy ears, but the dogs have a different kind of body and the cats like to stand up a little different.? Do you think that makes sense?","257":"This one's a jackal. And it's actually a kind of dog. But you made a good guess. That's what machines do too. They make guesses. Is this a cat or a dog?","258":"And so, you did something pretty amazing there. Because we asked the question, Is it a cat or a dog? And you said, I disagree with your question. It's a human. So machine learning is when we teach machines to make guesses about what things are based on looking at a lot of different examples. And I build products that use machine learning to learn about the world and make guesses about things in the world. When we try to teach machines to recognize things like cats and dogs, it takes a lot of examples. We have to show them tens of thousands or even millions of examples before they can get even close to as good at it as you are. Do you have tests in school?","259":"So machines work the same way. If you show them a lot of examples and give them practice, they'll learn how to guess. And then when you give them the test, they should be able to do that. So we looked at eight pictures and you were able to answer really quickly. But what would you do if I gave you 10 million examples? Would you be able to do that so quickly?","260":"So what if I told you that blockchain technology is basically a tool where you can do the exact same thing, but it goes to you and I directly? You wouldn't need an eBay or a brand in between.","261":"It's basically a network of computers that all have the same history of transactions. And so instead of sort of there being one company with one database that holds all the information, the same sort of list is held by all these different people. Like, you could have it on your computer. And then it gets validated by everyone, and basically, that turns into the next part of the list. So it's sort of constantly updating itself.","262":"So it's kinda this like really big ledger or accounting system for all sorts of things that get traded, but instead of being owned by one company, it's owned by everybody.","263":"That's actually a really good description. The idea is that if you've got a system here that can make you see whatever we want you to see, then we can make you believe that you're anywhere else, like on top of a mountain, or in a dungeon or under the ocean.","264":"Yeah, or in Minecraft. When you look at a TV on the wall there showing like a picture of a mountain or something, how can you tell that its not just a window and there's something else behind it. Because it always doesn't look quite right if you have a static picture of a person on a screen and you move around like this, its not really changing. And its interesting, those are things we have to figure out We need to figure out when you look at something in reality how can you tell whether its real or not. Have you been to a 3-D movie where you put on the little glasses?","265":"So what they do, the trick for that is, if you ever at a theater and you take up the glasses and you look at it, you'll see its blurry where there's actually two pictures that they're showing at the same time. And what those little glasses do, is they let one eye see one picture, and the other eye see a different picture. So then your eyes can say, oh it looks like I'm seeing through the screen or something is floating out in front of it. In the VR headsets, what we do is, there's actually either two screens or one screen split in half, so that it draws a different picture, completely different picture, for each eye. And we make sure that each eye can only see the picture it intended to. And that's what can make things feel like they got this real depth to them, that its something that you could reach out and touch and it doesn't feel like a flat TV screen.","266":"When we were much smaller societies, you and I could trade in our community pretty easily. As the distance in our trade grew, we ended up inventing institutions, right? If you Uber or you use Airbnb or you use Amazon even, these are just digital marketplaces and platforms that help us facilitate an exchange of value. But today, we actually have a technology that allows us to trade one to one but at scale, and it's called blockchain technology. There is some kind of interface for it. You could have an app, or you could use a computer to do it, but instead of there being a company in the middle that's helping you make that transaction, it's a bunch of software code.","267":"In some cases, yeah, it is. And a lot of people in the financial industry, in particular, are looking at it from the banking side of how do we use this technology to trade things like Bitcoin or other tokens that are easier to use instead of today's currency. A lot of people think about blockchain as Bitcoin because it's sort of in the news a lot, and it's this new cryptocurrency. And it's kind of exciting. But we're actually seeing a lot more use cases for blockchain that aren't around the currency side. They're more around, how do you take any asset and be able to trade that using this same technology.","268":"Yeah, exactly. Actually you've discovered something pretty neat because you made your point not from a corner so you've already discovered one of the key insights. Any flap, any point, leg of the ant, takes up a circular region of paper. Here's our boundary. To make your point from an edge you use that much paper and the shape, it's almost a circle. If we take the crane we'll see if the circles are visible in the crane pattern. Here's the crane pattern, and here's a boundary of the wing, and here's the other wing.","269":"The crane has four circles but, actually, there's a little bit of a surprise because what about this? There's a fifth circle, which is like that, but does the crane have a fifth flap in it? Let's refold it and put the wings up. Well, yes, there is, there's another point and that point is the fifth circle of our crane.","270":"And to do that we use a new technique called circle packing in which all of the long features of the design are represented by circles. So, each leg becomes a circle, each wing becomes a circle and things that can be big and thick, like the head or the abdomen, can be points in the middle. Now we have the basic idea of how to design the pattern, we just count the number of legs we want. We want a spider, if it's got let's say eight legs, it's also got an abdomen, that's another point, and it's got a head, so maybe that's 10 points. If we find an arrangement of 10 circles we should be able to fold that into the spider. So in this book, Origami Insects II, it's one of my books and has some patterns, and this is one of them for a flying ladybug and, in fact, it is exactly this flying ladybug. We've got the crease pattern here in the circles and you might now be able to see which circles end up as which parts, knowing that the largest features like the wings are going to be the largest circles, smaller points will be smaller circles. So any thoughts which might be?","271":"Origami artists all around the world now use ideas like this to design, not just insects, but animals, and birds, and all sorts of things that are, I think, unbelievably complex and realistic but most importantly, beautiful.","272":"So, inside of every computer is some kind of brain and the technical term for that is CPU, or central processing unit. And those are the pieces of hardware that know how to respond to those instructions. Like moving up or down, or left or right, knows how to do math like addition and subtraction. And then there's at least one other type of hardware inside of a computer called memory or RAM, if you've heard of this?","273":"Yeah, exactly. And computers have even different types of memory. They have what's called RAM, random access memory, which is where your games, where your programs are stored while they're being used. But then it also has a hard drive, or a solid state drive, which is where your data, your high scores, your documents, once you start writing essays and stories in the future.","274":"Why don't we do it this way? Why don't we pretend like I'm a computer or maybe I'm a robot, so I only understand your instructions and so I want you to feed me, no pun intended, an algorithm. So, step-by-step instructions for solving this problem. But remember, algorithms, you have to be precise, you have to give...","275":"[laughing] Clean all this mess up, right. We made an algorithm, step by step instructions for solving some problem. And if you think about now, how we made peanut butter and jelly sandwiches, sometimes we were imprecise and you didn't give me quite enough information to do the algorithm correctly, and that's why I took out so much bread. Precision, being very, very correct with your instructions is so important in the real world because for instance, when you're using the worldwide web and you're searching for something on Google or Bing...","276":"Pretty much everything we do in life is an algorithm, even if we don't use that fancy word to describe it. Because you and I are sort of following instructions either that we came up with ourselves or maybe our parents told us how to do these things. And so, those are just algorithms. But when you start using algorithms in computers, that's when you start writing code.","277":"Really glad that you could join us. So we've been talking about sleep today, various levels of complexity. But now with you, I really want to talk about what do we know about sleep and the aging brain. Can you tell me a little bit about some of the work that you've been doing in that area?","278":"So it's interesting, so I also saw that there was also a recent meta-analysis around sleep disturbances and dementia risk, and in that study, they looked about 250,000 people in this meta-analysis, and they followed them around for 10 years, and you know, when they pulled all the samples together, they found there was a 1.2 fold increased risk for developing all caused dementia, so it sounds like both sleep apnea and then maybe sleep disturbances more generally are associated with increased risk for dementia. When I think about that, I think about how sleep lives in the brain, these neurodegenerative diseases live in the brain, and so what do we know about the causality of this? Could it be that individuals who have early onset of say, Alzheimer's, have then poor sleep kind of as a consequence of that?","279":"Okay, that's great. On one side, we have a lot of the notes which make us feel brighter, you know, like these kinds of, (keyboard music) these really bright sounds. And the other side is a lot more to do with the darkness of a key center. So we're home in F, but imagine we're taking a quick visit to B-flat, but then the sun comes out.","280":"You got it. Ooh! Yeah? Yeah, yeah. So this is really, this is like a gleaming glade or something, you know? Let's play this tune, Amazing Grace. Let's play it in its simplest form.","281":"Just to see how things feel. Yeah. All right, lets do it. (both playing Amazing Grace) So it's F major seven, but its over A. Which is F seven over A. (both playing) B flat major seven with an A and a G in it. F major seven with an E and a D and a G, yeah. (laughter) D minor seven with a G in it. C softs, or minor, nice. B flat major. G seven, F sharp major seven. Home, yeah! I like that. So what harmony does is just gives us even more tools to tell those stories. Cool, yeah. Nice, man.","282":"The tough thing about chess is you can have a good position, but you actually have to move pieces. You know, like a piece of art, you just say, Oh, it's done.","283":"Black has an initiative. But can black capitalize on this initiative? I don't know. The problem with having a position like this is you feel a lot of pressure to do something.","284":"Yeah, that's the chess player's sign of focus, just- Yeah, when you roll up the sleeves. I guess I have to defend my pawn. I mean, don't really want to, but fine.","285":"That's good, that's a great place to start. There are cells in your brain. Those brain cells are connected by wires to each other. Electricity travels down those wires and communicates from one part of the brain to the other part of the brain, and each of those brain cells makes, you know, a thousand connections, it's something like a hundred trillion connections.","286":"I would say that that map also has your feelings in it because, here's why, your feelings, most neuroscientists think, come from your brain anyway, and amazingly, whether when you feel happy or sad or angry or scared, that's just brain cells communicating with each other.","287":"You got, pretty much, you got a very good idea about it. Basically you have a star, at the core its generating energy, which is countering the pressure of all that mass trying, being pulled in by gravity. Once it can't generate that energy anymore, the core collapses, once the core is collapsing, it keeps collapsing, and collapsing, and collapsing, and that's the critical thing that makes a black hole. You have enough mass in the volume, such that the escaped velocity becomes the speed of light, once light can't escape, hence the black part. (laughs) But that's the thing, is that just because there's an intense amount of gravity very close to a black hole, things don't start behaving differently. And my favorite analogy is a vacuum, everybody thinks, like, if you point a vacuum cleaner at something, it's just gonna suck everything in--","288":"Well I'm thinking about the idea that there might be more than three dimensions of space. What is your impression of theoretical physicists who think about things like extra dimensions of space that they haven't ever seen?","289":"We think that it would be, no all of this is incredibly speculative, and we don't know for sure. But the idea is that there is some deep down underlying laws that are universal and the same, but they show up differently, so they appear different. So the specific particles and forces and masses would be completely different in different parts of the multiverse.","290":"Mm-hmm. So we have quantum mechanics, right? The theory of atoms and so forth and how those work, and then we have gravity, and gravity doesn't seem to fit in. It's the one force of nature that we can't really easily fit into this quantum mechanical framework, so string theory is one of the best ideas.","291":"That's the good news. The bad news is that it only seems to work if spacetime is ten dimensional. [chuckles] So you would say well then it's wrong. It can't be right. Spacetime is not ten-dimensional. Spacetime is four dimensional. We've observed that. But instead, we say if spacetime looks four dimensional to us, but string theory, which might be the best theory we have of quantum gravity says it must be ten dimensional, maybe we can hide those extra six dimensions somehow. So here's how we could get lucky. We could imagine that there are extra dimensions of space that are curled up somehow that are so small that we can't see them. This is actually an old idea. It goes back to Kaluza and Klein right after general relativity was invented in 1915. But there's a more recent idea that says there could actually be relatively large extra dimensions. There could be extra dimensions that are actually that big, like a millimeter across that you would not have noticed. But here's the new, exciting idea. So let's imagine, okay. This is a piece of paper. But let's imagine this is our entire world. So, in other words, our real world is three dimensional, but let's imagine that we're just idealizing it down to two dimensions, so we all live here. You and I live here. But let's imagine that we're embedded in this bigger space. So there are extra dimensions that are actually big, okay? And let's imagine that. When I say we live on this three dimensional world what I mean is imagine that the particles that you and I are made of, right, the quarks, the leptons, the electrons and everything, all the forces we know about, electromagnetism, the weak nuclear force, the strong nuclear force, imagine they can't leave this surface. This is what we call a brane. B-R-A-N-E. Have you heard this word before?","292":"From membranes, you know. We have lines, one dimension. We have two dimensional surfaces. So if you have a line that is a vibrating physical thing, you call it a string, right?","293":"If you have a two dimensional surface that vibrates and is a physical thing, we call that a membrane. Membrane theory goes back, it never was as popular as string theory, but it's been around for a while. But if you had extra dimensions of space, then you can three dimensional vibrating things, and four dimensional vibrating things.","294":"It's even better. It's the theory of everything. What would you tell a friend of yours if they asked you what dimensions are, what extra dimensions are, what a brane is?","295":"That's right. And we could live there. The world we see around us, the three dimensions of space around us could reflect the fact that we are somehow stuck on a three dimensional brane trying to escape.","296":"If you can already predict the answer, then you must not be gaining any knowledge by that interaction. This insight of being able to predict the future accurately, and that being an evidence of a lack of new knowledge,","297":"Right. Sometimes. I mean, for example, in medical research, how amazing would it be, right, to be able to have a drug, and be able to prove that my drug works in this model.","298":"in a zero-knowledge way, without any interaction, right. I can just take the program, convert it to a zero-knowledge program, or an obfuscated program, and then just send it to you.","299":"So that's a great definition and I wanna pick that apart a little bit. So what you described is just right. Stars, when they run out of thermonuclear fuel are gonna collapse under their own weight. It'll explode in a supernova, it'll leave a core, and if the core itself is heavy enough, it will keep collapsing. It does, as you say, reach this point where not even light can escape. But the amazing thing is it leaves that point, you called it rightly the event horizon, it leaves it behind kind of like an archeological record because the start itself can no more sit at the event horizon than it can race outward at the speed of light. So the core of the star keeps collapsing and where it goes nobody knows. So in a weird way, the black hole isn't anymore a crush of matter. It left it behind in its wake, but the stuff of the star is gone.","300":"Right? Yeah. So that's already a really good idea of what a fractal is. It has some really, really interesting detail at all, scales that makes it hard to talk about standard quantities like lengths and areas and volumes.","301":"Yeah, totally.  Like it's a shape that you can't use sort of the ordinary language that we use to talk about shapes you really need some other ideas or concepts to talk about.","302":"yeah this whole infrastructure is all about creating levels that get progressively colder as you go from top to bottom down to the quantum chip which is how we actually control the state of the cupids","303":"so you can have constructive interference and you can have destructive interference we have constructive interference you have amplitudes wave amplitudes that add until the signal gets larger and if you have destructive interference the amplitudes cancel by using a property like interference we can control quantum states and amplify the kinds of signals that are towards the right answer and then cancel the types of signals that are leading to the wrong answer so given that you know that we're trying to use superposition entanglement and interference for computation how do you think we build these computers","304":"It's pretty amazing, right? Because it happened like a year or two ago. Our memory is basically a record in our brain of something that happened in the past, but that record it created isn't perfect. So that day, do you remember was the pool at your hotel?","305":"When you were telling me about the sandbox, it felt like you didn't have to make that guess, that you could just see the sandbox in your eyes. I asked you about the towel. It doesn't come to mind immediately, but you can stop and think about it and kind of make a good guess because there are things you know about the world. And for those of us who study memory that's a really strong hint as to how memory works. And so for you your memory kept all the fun stuff and all the stuff that was important to you, but the details like did you have to have a ticket to get in or how you got there, all these other less interesting, less exciting aspects, your brain kind of decided letting go of all that information.","306":"Yeah, that's a great insight. Basically we can't remember everything. So when you tell us this memory of that vacation and your brain is able to kind of play almost this movie of a memory, a moment, a day that you had in your life a while ago, where do those memories come from?","307":"You got it. And so we don't just remember everything and we don't remember random things. We remember the things that matter to us the most. So Abigail based on our conversation today, can you tell me what is a memory?","308":"Yeah, you can see them all. And in fact, if we were really, really, really patient, we could do the same thing as with the Skittles. But here's another question. You said that there's a finite amount of glitter in that jar, and I agree. So how many jars would we need to hold an infinite amount of glitter?","309":"Yeah, absolutely not. Because this room holds only a finite amount of space. And in fact, infinitely many jars would not even fit in something called the observable universe, which is the portion of the universe that astronomers can see. Really how does that make you feel?","310":"You have very good intuition. So there are ways that mathematicians can build infinite collections of things. And if you repeat those processes, it's in fact possible to build even bigger and bigger sizes of infinity. So what have you learned today about infinity?","311":"so did you know that there's certain kinds of problems that computers sort of run out of space almost like you're trying to solve the problem and just like how you run out of space on your iphone when you're trying to take a picture if you're trying to solve the problem you just run out of space and even if you have the world's biggest supercomputer did you know that can still happen","312":"okay so quantum mechanics is a branch of science just like any other branch of science it's a branch of physics it's the study of things that are either really really small really really well isolated and really really cold and this particular branch of science is something we're using to totally reimagine how computing works so we're building totally new kinds of computers based on the laws of quantum mechanics that's what a quantum computer is","313":"it's sort of it's sort of a combination of heads and tails right would you say so superposition is this idea that my penny is not just either heads or tails it's in this state which is a combination of heads and tails this quantum property is something that we can have in real real physical objects in the world so that's super position and the second thing that we'll talk about is called entanglement so now i'm going to give you a penny","314":"but in the quantum world when we entangle things they're really now connected it's much much harder to separate them again so using the same analogy we spin our pennies and eventually eventually they both stop right and when they stop it's either heads or tails right so in my case i got tails and you got heads you see how they're totally disconnected from each other right our pennies in the real world now if our pennies were entangled and we both spun them together right when we stopped them if you measured your penny to be ahead i would measure my penny to be ahead and if you measured your penny to be a tails i would measure my opinion to be a tails if we measured it at exactly the same time we would still find that they were both exactly correlated","315":"the way that we are able to actually see these quantum properties is by making our quantum chips really really cold so that's what this is all about actually this is called a dilution refrigerator and it's a refrigerator it doesn't look like a normal refrigerator right but it's something that we use actually there's usually a case around it to cool our quantum chips down cold enough that we can create superpositions and we can entangle qubits and the information isn't lost to the environment","316":"So black holes, you describe them as huge. The interesting thing about black holes is they're hugely heavy, but they're actually physically really small. What really matters is the density. Do you know what density is?","317":"I can also ask how big it is, which is a question about its volume. If I make it smaller, then what's happening is it's becoming more dense. So imagine I crushed this really, really small. It would weigh the same, it would have the same mass, but it would be much more dense.","318":"If a star is heavy enough to explode into supernova what's left begins to collapse under its own weight. And if that's heavy enough, the core will not be able to stop collapsing, 'cause it no longer has the thermonuclear fuel, it's run outta fuel. And if it's run outta fuel, it's no longer shining and pushing outward. And without that it itself begins to go dark and there's nothing fighting the collapse anymore. And that's when you form a black hole.","319":"Well, that's a really good question. So interestingly, the sun itself isn't heavy enough. So it has to be heavy enough that when it begins to collapse, it just overcomes all attempts to fight it. If you made something really dense, you would have to travel faster than the speed of light to actually escape. That's 300,000 kilometers per second.","320":"So it goes so fast that it goes completely dark. Any light that veers too close will fall in, will not be able to make it back out again. If a light is shining from the sun near a black hole, the black hole's not touching it. Why does the light get pulled in? Why does that happen?","321":"It is taking other stuff, but the funny question was like, if I wanted to move your chair, you'd think it was really strange if I didn't have to come near you and actually grab the chair and move it. One of the things Einstein thought about is he imagined that what the black hole is doing is it's changing the shape of space around it. What do you think of that idea?","322":"Isn't it crazy? And then Einstein goes a step further and thinks, well, what black holes must be doing is curving the space so strongly that even light gets caught. Sometimes you can get light caught into a whole orbit, literally the light going round and round in an orbit.","323":"this really specific combination of zeros and ones everything that your computer does showing you pink panther videos on youtube calculating things searching the internet it does all of that with a really specific combination of zeros and ones which is crazy right that would be like saying your computer only understands these quarters for each quarter you need to tell it that you're going to use heads tails and you assign it heads or tails so i can switch between heads and tails and i can switch the zeros and ones in my computer so that it represents what i wanted to represent like an a and with quantum computers we have new rules we get to use too we can actually spin one of our quarters so it doesn't have to choose just one or the other","324":"And at some level, there's different set of rules that seem to come into play 'cause you can have particles at very microscopic scales seem to do really strange things. But one of the quests of quantum sensing is to harvest some of these unique properties at the micro scale. We are really interested in quantum sensors because we think they can give us the ultimate limit of sensitivity. So they're really, really sensitive to small changes, but they're also gonna be really reliable. Every time I make that measurement, I'll always get the same results.","325":"And then the different chemicals in the cells. If you look at the MRI images, you can see that they give you the broad features of what the tissue looks like. But if you wanna zoom in a little bit more and see what's actually happening inside a tissue or inside a cell and you need a different type of sensor that's gonna be more sensitive and for something like that, you're gonna need a quantum sensor.","326":"We can do it on tissues right now or on the surface, but we can't actually do it inside the body. So right now, we're struggling to figure out which scenarios can we use this to get better information and when can we not do it.","327":"It's still pretty easy, right? It turns out that stacking these two cups, it's actually really hard for robots to do that. So, let's think about how we might have a robot stack these two cups. You could program the robot to move its hand right here and then program the robot to close its hand around the cup.","328":"Exactly, right? That seemed pretty simple for the robot to do. Say we even just move the cup over here. Do you think the robot would still be able to stack the cups?","329":"Exactly. So, Moravec's paradox is something that means that these really simple things, like stacking cups, is really, really hard for robots, even though it's really easy for us. While robots are actually really good at really complicated and really difficult things. Think about the task of multiplying two really big numbers together.","330":"You have to be close to it. You can detect it optically because if we tried to detect the magnetic moment of the electron, we wouldn't be able to do that because there, the energy is too low compared to thermal energies. But what the diamond system gives you is a natural up conversion in energy. So you can couple into an optical photon, which is then much easier to detect a single optical photon than it is to detect a micro wave.","331":"And that was a source of noise, like, it's completely random, but it is still there. And then the other form is very much what is intrinsically within your experiment itself because some of the materials that you have have defects that are coupling into your sensor, into your quantum system and are also producing noise.","332":"Right, it could give you information if you read it out, about what's happening or you have to find smart ways to suppress it so that you can focus on what you really do care about.","333":"Okay, back into the 1960s, there was a research agency in the United States called DARPA, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency. Actually, it was called ARPA at the time. They wanted to build this notion of a packet-switching network. Not a circuit switch network like a phone network where you get a dedicated path and a dedicated set of bandwidth and links from source to destination.","334":"There's a lot big, right? And so remember, this was a Department of Defense, was they wanted to have forms of of communication that were very robust, that were survivable. Packets could all find their own ways, be routed differently through the network. So if parts of the network failed, you could route around failures.","335":"So you can sort of see how the network architecture that wasn't designed to be 100% reliable inside the core of the network, and had that complexity built into the edges of the network. And to me, the really cool thing is you put this infrastructure in place, and then all these super creative people think about amazing things to build on top of it. And you see this proliferation of amazing applications.","336":"Ah ha! Spoken like a real computer scientist, right? You're a computer scientist. I'm a computer scientist. We talk about APIs, application programming interfaces. The API for the internet is something called a socket. And a socket simply says, I can communicate if I know your internet address, you know, 128.119.40.186, that number is the IP address of my server, the University of Massachusetts. If you know that, you can write a program anywhere in the world and send a message, and it'll pop out at my end.","337":"That's 98% true. And if you own a network, like you're att.com, or your verizon.com, you can do, within that network, you can do what you want, right? So in that sense, the internet is very decentralized, that the control of the network is up to whoever owns the network. The 2% where you said there's nobody in control, there's a little bit of centralized control. There's an organization called the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers. Its responsibility is to handle, as the name ICANN suggests, names and numbers. It's that little bit of centralization, central authority that you need.","338":"Exactly, right. And maybe they're dropped in your apartment, but much more likely, they're dropped because of congestion somewhere between the Hulu or the Netflix or the Disney server, if you're watching a video, and your home. So even though you've got 200 megabits per second on that last hop, you don't have 200 megabits per second from the server into your apartment.","339":"Totally, now, as a little experiment, take your piece of paper and just crumple it into a ball. So what is it? Is the paper three dimensional or is it two dimensional?","340":"But if you take a more interesting shape, some kind of fractal shape, like let's say the coastline of great Britain and you start doing this box, counting experiment, something really interesting happens as you make these boxes smaller, the number of boxes you need to cover the coastline grows faster than it would for just a straight line.","341":"So procedural computer graphics, which kind of came out of thinking about fractals is one answer to this question about how do you add more detail without for instance, consuming tons of memory or requiring artists to paint ultra detail the textures. So if, if you can instead describe at least some aspect of what you're looking at in a procedural or recursive way, then you can add as much detail as you need when you get close to objects.","342":"I'll grant you that Hilbert's Hotel does not exist. For me, infinite objects absolutely exist. And I can't read the thoughts in your head, but I have a high degree of confidence that we have a lot of the same ideas about infinity.","343":"What I love about what you were describing is like you didn't use the word memory, were how you were talking about kind of perceptions and social judgments but I think probably we'd both agree that memory is a big part of that.","344":"Right, like it reminds me so much of, you know, what we in the field would refer to as statistical learning. On one hand we might have like a one-shot memory, a memory of something that we saw yesterday, like what we did or what we ate or where we were. But a lot of our memories and our knowledge instead are based on many, many, many experiences.","345":"I think what we're still kind of trying to understand as a field is the more kind of detailed and bigger picture of where does this model live? How does it get updated based on experiences? Why does that sometimes happen and sometimes not? There are actually people who are born without a hippocampus. They have disruptions to episodic memories. They have trouble after this conversation remembering what the conversation was about, but they do have pretty good semantic information. They have a good sense of knowledge about the world. And that's interesting for two reasons. One, it shows this association between the role of the hippocampus and these two forms of memory, episodic memories and semantic memory. The other reason it's interesting is that people often assume that we get to semantic memory through episodic memory, that we encounter one dog and then another dog, and then another dog and then we learned the concept, the semantic notion of a dog. And these people, their profile suggests that you can learn semantic information. You can learn general knowledge about the world, even without ever having the capacity to build those individual memories.","346":"Yeah it looks really blocky. And it's the same thing not only with shapes and games, but also colors and textures. And this is an especially a big problem in virtual reality because you have no control over where people are gonna go. What they're gonna look at, how close they're gonna get to various objects. So fractals on the other hand are these things that have infinitely, you know, nice details you get closer and closer and closer. And so this is something that can help us solve this problem in computer graphics of generating more detail. One of the reasons why fractals are really nice for computer graphics is because the algorithms that we use to draw images also have this kind of recursive flavor. What's recursion?","347":"Because I want to draw a smooth curve on the screen, but all my computer can do is draw straight lines. And that's actually too true of GPUs. It's kind of interesting. GPUs are basically really fast machines that can only draw one thing and that's a flat triangle. And so if we keep doing this with our paper, you kind of get pretty quickly the idea of what's gonna happen. So when you go to see a Pixar movie, for instance, every surface has been subdivided down. So you have tiny little triangles called micro polygons that are even smaller than the size of a pixel.","348":"Well, because people who really need to use these subdivision services for everything, people who worked hard over the years to make this super, super fast. In fact, subdivision services were invented basically at Pixar. There's this guy, Ed Capel, and he was harshly responsible for one of the most famous kinds of subdivision surfaces called Capel Clark subdivision surfaces. And in fact recently won the touring award for these subdivision services.","349":"Well, we're gonna be talking about computers here today, and we're gonna be talking about the internet. I always like to think of the internet by analogy to say road systems for example, where you have roads in your neighborhood. You have state roads, you have the Interstate Highway System. And so the internet is a lot like that. It's an interconnection of local roads, local networks like the network in your house for example.","350":"Wow. Great question. Often, it's a little blue wire called an ethernet cable. So that cable is able to bring bits of information up into your apartment at say, a billion bits per second. That's pretty fast, right? Literally a wire that goes between a box in your apartment, sometimes called a router or a modem in your apartment that comes from an internet service provider come into this first network and then that network connects to another network connects to another network connects to another network.","351":"The underseas cables are so cool! They're these big cables that are laid down by switches. They cross both the Atlantic, the Pacific, the Indian Ocean. So the undersea cables are how the networks in Europe, United States, Asia are all connected together.","352":"That's really what we call the first hop. It's like from your phone, from your tablet, from the computer that you're on, there's no cables coming in. You go over a wireless connection. Wi-Fi is the protocol that allows your computer to talk to that first hop router over a wireless communication link.","353":"One thing I find really fascinating about robotics is that the things that are so simple for us, like feeding yourself broccoli, so second nature to us, are really hard for robotics. When you try to take a robot and train it to do a task and simulation, and the simulation isn't perfectly accurate, it's really hard to actually model the physics of how tofu crumbles.","354":"So over the past four levels, we've been talking about Moravec's paradox. I'm curious to get your perspective. There are still a lot of open questions for how to leverage previous experience and learn cumulatively over time.","355":"I think it's interesting. And also a huge challenge. I think that it's interesting that if a person sees a robot doing something that seems very capable, they assume that the robot can do all sorts of other capable things. It's a huge challenge, because that's actually not the case.","356":"That notion of hierarchy is really interesting, because it is these higher level things, like playing chess, for example, that are easier for AI systems. And the reason why they're easier is that we're providing the abstraction for the system already, then when we give the game of chess to an AI system, we abstract away all the challenges of like picking up pieces and moving them, and we say, 'Okay, there's this board of however many boxes on it.' And you just need to figure out within that very narrow, small world, what to do. But handling and learning what those abstractions should be and handling everything from low level sensory inputs to that higher level processing is really, really hard.","357":"Yeah. It is exactly using quantum phenomena to sense and measure things and the idea is that, if I can harness quantum phenomena and I can push the limits that are possible, I can get something that's ultimately more precise and potentially more accurate over time too.","358":"So I study spins. And so, spins are one of the platforms that people have suggested is a useful platform for building quantum technologies and I study spins on the solid state. And one of the platforms I work on is nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond.","359":"So in some sense, the phenomena we're studying essentially is nuclear magnetic resonance or electron spin resonance which is a very similar phenomena, but uses the spin of the electron rather than the spin of the nuclei.","360":"So you can implant nitrogen into a diamond and then you bombard it with electrons to create the vacancies and then you heat it up and anneal it, and then you get these nitrogen-vacancy centers in your system. So you mentioned quantum computing earlier. So have you heard of the idea of superposition?","361":"So that's in some ways the key to both quantum sensing, as well as quantum computing. It's the idea that you can take a system and put it in a superposition of two states. Normally we think of classically a bit can be a zero or a one. So switch is either on or off. Whereas in a quantum system, it can be in what's called a superposition. So it can be partially on and partially off. But one of the challenges with quantum systems is that these superpositions are really hard to maintain because we don't see superpositions in the world around us. In quantum computing, you try really hard to isolate everything so that you can maintain this quantum property and the fact that it's actually going to lose its quantum properties as it interacts with the world also makes it a great sensor because now you're actually, you're using that fact that it's interacting with the world to say, wait, it's sensing something.","362":"In some ways, it is and you know, atomic clocks are remarkable devices and being able to measure time that precisely has really important consequences. In fact, our old GPS system is based on the accuracy of atomic clocks. They're a set of satellites, each of which has an atomic clock on board and they send out a timestamp and so, once it gets a signal from three different satellites, it can triangulate and figure out exactly where you are. Now, if you could make those clocks even more precise, you could actually accurately position where you are even more accurately.","363":"So some ways, you know, when atomic clocks were designed and built, we didn't necessarily think of GPS, but technology often works that way is that, there are new discoveries and then someone else comes along and says, hey, this is a great tool for some other application.","364":"Our topic today is quantum sensing. So quantum is about the study of stuff that's really, really, really small and sensing is about measuring. So the word sensing comes from kind of like our senses. So do you know what your five senses are?","365":"Touch, exactly. So it's kind of really important for us to be able to have these senses, so we know what's happening in the world around us, right? In doing quantum sensing is we're trying to measure things that can be hard to see. Let me show you. Can you see inside it with your eyes?","366":"You wouldn't be able to see into the middle. If you had the right tools, you could start to think about ways to look inside the ball without cutting it open. That would then, you'd still have your ball. We could still play with it.","367":"For example, we want to go inside, let's say the human body and see what's happening. Sometimes we can look under the surface of the Earth and see what's underneath it. We can make really, really precise clocks that will tell us, that can measure time really, really accurately. And we can make very, very fine measurements that'll tell us about the rules of science and how the world works around us. But we need to build better tools that allow us to do that.","368":"Like how can that possibly be? What I wanna do is prove to you that I know this combination without revealing the combination to you. And what you could do is you could write a little note, a secret that I definitely wouldn't know. Fold it up, stick it in here. And then, if I know the combination, I should be able to open it and tell you what you wrote. All right. There we go. All right. So,My dog is named Doug. Did you figure out what the combination was?","369":"What would you guys do? You'd probably first get together and like, figure out some secret code, right? And then like, write messages to each other in that code. But what if you've never met the person before? What if you wanna exchange secret messages with me and we've never met each other before? How could we possibly do that?","370":"But it's not. You wouldn't use like, a physical lock, or a physical box. We would instead use mathematics to do these kinds of things. You could take a message and encrypt it using mathematics. And then, I could prove to you that I know the key, I could open it up, and send it back to you. That way I would be proving to you that I know the mathematical key to the mathematical lockbox. So based on what we've discussed today, in your own words, what is a zero-knowledge proof.","371":"Yeah, and probably nobody is. Have you heard a lot in your studies about these super massive black holes that we think lurk in the centers of very nearly every galaxy?","372":"There might be many alternate routes. It might be in the very early universe that bubbles in unusual phase transitions from very high energy universe to a low energy universe can make black holes. Like, we haven't really thought of the range of possibilities.And so there could also be primordial black holes that are still around that also skipped the star stage altogether that were formed really in the very earliest phases. And I think the interesting thing is, with your looking at like the Large Magellanic Cloud, is to wonder if we're gonna merge.","373":"But when we do merge with Andromeda, presumably our black holes will merge and Andromeda indeed has a very big black hole as well at its center. And then we'll have this just gigantic-","374":"We work a lot right now on thinking of black holes as batteries. So a black hole that can take, like a giant magnet, astronomical magnet in the form of another collapsed star, like a neutron star, and flip it around so fast, near the speed of light, that it actually creates an electronic circuit out of this moving magnet. And so that the power that can come out of these electronic circuits created by these batteries can be tremendous.","375":"Right, and it allows you to prove that you've been behaving honestly, without revealing any of the secrets involved that you use to actually behave honestly. So we of course know that zero-knowledge proofs for NP-complete languages plays such a huge role in cryptography. I'm curious. What was your first experience with Np-completeness like?","376":"Exactly. Right. Because random is unpredictable and that's what we want. Right. We want that unpredictability around us to be utilized, to actually hide the information that we wanna hide. How have you used your knowledge in the projects that you've worked on? What are the challenges that you find?","377":"And also in the blockchain space, for example, if you wanna speed up the generation of proofs, if that could be done in a distributed way, then that would be great. One of the hopes that I have is that the power of multi-party computation is about bringing people together who are mutually distrustful.","378":"So actually, in the blockchain space is one of the spaces where we are seeing zero-knowledge proofs being implemented. And I think it's just the beginning. Let's talk about zero-knowledge proofs. At its core, a zero-knowledge proof is an interaction between two people. Then I should be able to convince you that some statement is true, but you won't have any idea why it's true.","379":"What you're basically asking is, wait, what? Right? Right. So this is what makes zero-knowledge proof so fascinating, and so counter-intuitive. And I think the best way I can explain it to you is by means of an example. But before we do that, I have to decide what I'm gonna prove to you in a, with a zero-knowledge proof.","380":"And the way we're gonna approach this is through something called NP-completeness. What an NP-complete problem is, it's a problem that's really hard to solve. But if you can solve it, you can solve any problem that's in the class NP. And that includes a vast number of problems. And what we're gonna do is we're gonna use an NP-complete problem to actually prove an incredible variety of statements through a zero-knowledge proof. And the specific Np-complete problem that we're gonna be looking at is called map three-coloring. Okay, so here we have a map. Okay. And these are a bunch of countries. And we've arranged them so that no countries that have the same color share a border. That's what makes a map like this validly colored. And now you might think, well, why should we care? It turns out that whether or not a map can be three-colored in this way is an example of an NP-complete problem. And it turns out that, you know, maybe what you really wanna do, is you wanna give a zero-knowledge proof that you have at least 0.3 Bitcoins, right? That would be cool.","381":"Right? So you have a little bit of confidence, right, that I have managed to color this correctly. but not that much confidence. 'Cause I've only shown you two of the countries.","382":"Right? So now, of course, one way to get more confidence is to open up more of them for you, but that would be revealing information to you. I don't wanna do that. So instead, I'm gonna ask you to please turn around. And now, let's change up these colors. Can you pick two countries at random and we'll reveal two of the colors again.","383":"But as you'll see, now it's not green, it's blue. And this one on the other hand, is green. Okay. The colors I showed you last time, don't work with these new colors, right? This wouldn't have worked before.","384":"Exactly. Right. But it works for this coloring that I'm showing you right now. So what we've done is we've made it impossible for you to put the pieces together. And if you do this, let's say, a thousand times. And if I correctly showed you different colors, each thousand times, you'd be really convinced. And that's it. That's the entire zero-knowledge proof.","385":"One great example is like in elections. If you could prove that an election was correctly conducted. That every vote was counted, and it all added up to one person winning with a particular total, in zero-knowledge, then you don't have to give up the actual votes of any person. And yet everyone could see that, hey, yeah, it was done correctly.","386":"So one of my main research areas is something called category theory, it's been described as the mathematics of mathematics. It's a language that can be used to prove very general theorems. And an interesting aspect of being a researcher in category theory that doesn't come up as much in other areas is that we have to really pay attention to the axioms of set theory in our work. When you're proving theorems, have you ever used the axiom of choice?","387":"So the way I think about it is if you have an infinite or an arbitrary family of sets and you know for sure that none of these sets are empty, then a choice function would allow you to select an element from each set sort of all at once. When you've used the axiom of choice in proofs, do you know which incarnation of this you've used?","388":"You do believe the axiom of choice, though it leads us to some strange conclusions. So if the axiom choice is true, then it's necessarily the case that there exists a well ordering of the reals. And what that means is that we can perform induction over real numbers like we perform induction over the natural numbers. This is trans-finite induction. It would work for any ordinal. So there must be some uncountably infinite ordinal that represents the order type of the real numbers. And this allows us to prove some crazy things. Imagine three-dimensional Euclidean space. So the space that we live in, extending infinitely in all directions. So it is possible to completely cover three-dimensional Euclidean space by disjoint circles, so infinitesimal circles, disjoint circles of radius one. So what that means is you can put a circle somewhere in space and then put a second circle somewhere in space that can't intersect with the first one because these are solid circles and then another circle can somehow cover every single point in space with no gaps in between.","389":"So Cantor's diagonal argument can be abstracted and then generalized to prove that for an arbitrary set A, its power set has a strictly larger cardinality. And since that's true for any set, we can just iterate this process. When set theory was being discovered or invented or created in the late 19th century, one of the natural question to ask is can there be a universe of all sets? This comes up in my research in category theory because even though there is no set of all sets, we would really like for there to be a category of sets. So what category theorists need to do to make their work rigorous is to add additional axioms to set theory. One of my favorites was introduced by an algebraic geometer Alexander Grothendieck. This is something that we sometimes call a Grothendieck universe, or also an inaccessible cardinal. It's an infinite number that is so big that it cannot be accessed by any of the other constructions within set theory. It's so big that we'll never get to it and this allows us to contemplate the collection of all sets whose cardinality is bounded by this size that will never reach.","390":"So what you're describing is the famous Hawking radiation where a black hole cleverly kind of steals energy from the quantum vacuum and radiates and in the process of evaporates. And of course this caused a big kerfuffle because when the black hole evaporates, eventually that event horizons is yanked up. And the question is, where did everything go that had once fallen in?","391":"There's this domain of black holes in astrophysics where we see stars collapse, and we know that they exist and there's whole observational astronomy around them. And then there's this domain that we're talking about, where, as you said, black holes are so special because they're kind of guiding us in the right direction to understand the very nature of reality. And that makes them really unusually special. And one of the things I wanted to draw out is that we talk about the fundamental forces of nature. So there's the matter forces, and then the outlier is gravity. We've quantized all the matter forces in a way that we're rather comfortable with. Gravity keeps resisting quantization of gravity itself. And now we're thinking in a way that you're describing that, well, maybe it's only the quantum forces altogether.","392":"So a fractal is something that we see every day, but it's a little bit hard to describe. It's it's a shape that if you look at it really far away, or you look at it really up close, it has kind of a similar appearance. And actually that word fractal sounds a little bit like fraction.","393":"And that's kind of what we're gonna try out today. In fact, we're gonna have you build a fractal. A tree is a really good example of a fractal because if you look at the whole tree and then you break off a big branch of the tree.","394":"Yeah, it's a ton of work. If you think about Moana's island, it has these tens and hundreds of thousands of trees on it. And that's why we need computers to help us out because computers are really good at taking these really simple rules, like put two branches on every other branch and doing it really, really fast.","395":"Like coding, exactly. That's what actually a lot of the artists for the movies are working with code rather than with a paintbrush. So in your own words, how would you describe a fractal to somebody?","396":"We're used to ethernet cables that can handle many hundreds of gigabits per second over a wired device. What are the typical data rates for IoT devices? I mean, not hundreds of gigabits.","397":"My sense is you're spot on, that they'll produce over time, a lot of data. And that a lot of IoT is about computing on that data. That computation happened mostly at the edge, or somehow a combination between the edge and something happening in a far away data center.","398":"I think for a long time, the internet hasn't grappled with, but now has with IoT and also with cellular networks, generally is the question of mobility. Do you imagine in the future that it might be possible for mobile devices not to always have to connect through the same provider to go from one network to another?","399":"it's something that we've already figured out for classical computing like something that amazes me is all the parallels between what we're going through now for quantum computing and what we went through for classical computing","400":"you know now that everybody around the world can access a quantum computer through the cloud people are doing all kinds of cool things they're building games we've seen the emergence of quantum gains right what do you think people want to do with them","401":"And things that are hard for humans should also be hard for robots and humans to do. But it turns out that it's actually the opposite. I wanna try a little demo.","402":"So I have a penny in my hand and I'd like you to pick it up with your right hand and put it into your left hand. So that was pretty easy, right?","403":"We're gonna make this a little bit harder now. So, can you put these on? And we'll try to do the same thing again with your eyes closed. There you go. Let's try that one more time, and see if you can do any better. So close your eyes.","404":"Yeah. So that you're able, with a bit more practice, you're able to figure it out. When it fell on the ground, how did you know to pick it up off the ground?","405":"So when a robot tries to do something, like pick up an object, not only do you need to program exactly like what the motors should do, the robot also needs to be able to see where the object is. Then this is what's called a perception action loop in robotics. So if the object moves, the robot can then adapt what it's doing and change what it's doing to successfully pick up the object. It's really important for robots to be able to leverage, not just like the past hour of experience, but also ideally many years of experience, in order to do the kinds of things that you did.","406":"That's a great question. So in reinforcement learning, the robot tries the task, and then it gets some sort of reinforcement, some sort of feedback. It's similar to how you might train a dog.","407":"So you could give it feedback like that. So it won't necessarily know itself, especially on the first few tries, but it's trying to figure out what the task is even.","408":"Or you don't even need computers. Like I remember when I was a kid, I played electric guitar and I had all these guitar pedals with different effects and oh, what happens if you put the output back in the input and just run it through itself, you're gonna start hearing this kind of fractal sound, right? So today we've been telling people, fractals are things that are somehow self-similar, they have detail at all scales. Are there other ways you might introduce fractals to somebody or are there other things you might say, this is what a fractal is?","409":"Yeah and I think it's really cool that this kind of fractal description of geometry or physics is also kind of baked into the nature of computation. Computation is recursive kind of biased nature. And so it's kind of a match made in heaven that we happen to build these machines that also-","410":"I think that's also, what's so beautiful about fractals is that, you know, if you think about sort of the history of geometry as well, Felix Klein was looking at geometry by saying, well, geometry is all about in variance. I have some group of transformations and I look at objects that are sort of in variant with respect to these transformations. So if you just look at translations, okay, what kinds of shapes remain the same under translations? Will you get tiling? You get wallpaper. And if you start asking that same question, what if I allow scaling in my transformations then boom, you have fractal.","411":"Now you work on kind of the future of virtual reality and augmented reality and extended reality. But it's kind of interesting because I think if I think about exploring these infinite fractal landscapes in some way, they still feel a little bit lonely or they feel a little bit poor of the kind of richness that we have in the real world.","412":"So one of the things I guess that touches on is this question about controllability or the ease of, with which everybody can create these worlds. Not just people, not just mathematicians, not just, you know, trained computer scientists. One thing when I think about Ken Musgraves working about this program, Bryce, this one I felt like I could really use, what do you think we still need to do in terms of putting these kinds of tools in, in people's hands, making it easier for people to use procedural machine learning, to build these kind of worlds?","413":"Yeah. And I think this is what what's so beautiful also about Mandelbrot's work is him saying, you know, it's not really about these exotic examples. Like even the Mandelbrot set or Julia sets or whatever. Yeah they're like really interesting mathematical curiosities, but they get at this idea that fractals are kind of inevitable. And Bob Ross probably never, as far as I know, never sat down and you know, thought about recursive descriptions of trees or anything like that. But it's just something that naturally comes to you as an artist.","414":"Sometimes, you know, memory is doing something much simpler but no less important for us, which is it's helping us figure out what's good and what's bad. And if we can remember what's good and what's bad from what we did in the past, that can help us make decisions about what to do next time. So Dylan, you may be surprised to learn this, but we asked your mom what some of your favorite candies are. So you have to make a decision between these two candies and whichever one you pick, you actually get to take with you.","415":"There you go, there is your decision. Okay, you can take those. It took you some time there. You looked like you were really working hard at that problem. And that's interesting because actually we know that from research that when people have to make a decision between two things they like equally, some people like economists think oh those are the easiest decisions because they're both good options. But as psychologists and neuroscientists we know it's the opposite. One of the reasons is because there's no simple answer of like I know that one's better I'm just gonna go with it. And so we think that that's the kind of decision where memory is especially important because you have to kind of come up with more information.","416":"I love math for the same reason. Today, I'm gonna tell you about a thing called zero-knowledge proof. So in a zero-knowledge proof, there are two people. There's a prover and a verifier. And I wanna prove that something is true to you. But the weird thing is, I wanna prove to you that it's true without telling you any reasons why. I remember when I first heard about it, I was like, wait, what? How can that possibly be? Right?","417":"But what if I could prove to you that I know where the puffin is without revealing to you where it is? Let me show you. I took that photo that we showed you. And I put it behind this poster here. Why don't you go take a look through that hole?","418":"So when you look at this board, we don't know where the photo was, right? Was the photo like with the corner here? In which case the puffin would be all the way at this side. Or was the photo with the corner here? In which case the puffin would be on the other side. So this is a really simple example of a zero-knowledge proof. I convinced you that I knew where the puffin was, but you didn't learn anything else.","419":"What if instead, we could somehow use a zero-knowledge proof to log in. You would just be able to prove that, hey, I'm Chelsea, without revealing anything to them. If you could do that, then it would be amazing, right?","420":"It describes something in AI, which is that things that are really intuitive and easy for humans, are actually really difficult to build into AI systems. And on the flip side, picking up an object, really simple for people, but it's actually really difficult to build that into robotic systems. So do you have any experience working with robots or other AI systems?","421":"So you can think of robotics as having two core components. One is perception, being able to see and feel and so forth, and action, where the robot actually figures out how to move its arm. And both components are really essential, and both components are quite difficult. If you train a perception system independently of how to choose actions, then it might make errors in a way that mess up the system that selects actions And so if you instead try to train these two systems together, to have it learn perception action for the goal of solving these different tasks, then the robot can be more successful. One thing that's really difficult about robotics is, there actually isn't that much data of robots in the world. On the internet, there's all sorts of text data, all sorts of image data that people upload and write. But there isn't a lot of data of doing a simple thing, like tying your shoe, for example, because it's so basic. One challenge is even just getting data sets that allow us to teach robots to do these simple kinds of tasks.","422":"Deep learning is a common toolbox for addressing some of these challenges, because it allows us to leverage large data sets. And so, deep learning is basically, corresponds to methods for training these artificial neural networks. Another common method that comes up is reinforcement learning. A third kind of algorithm is meta learning algorithms. And these algorithms learn not just from the most recent experience on the current task, but leverage experience from other task in the past. And they're not just completely separate. We can combine the aspects of these algorithms into a single method that gets the benefits of each of them.","423":"I would tend to agree that I think, in some sense, anything that uses superposition could be a quantum sensor, but then spectroscopy uses superpositions and has been around for 60, 70 years. I think what excites me most now is the idea that can we push the boundaries of how sensitive one can make this technique? How improving sensitivity, specificity, what other limits and we define it better, are there fundamental physical limits?","424":"Right. People bring in very different perspectives into what used to be a very niche field. I remember in physics, you'd only talk to people in your subfield and now we're picking up the phone and talking to people in the different departments, completely different areas and we're forced to learn different languages.","425":"Room number one. Exactly. I'm gonna use this symbol for infinity, but what we've just shown is that one, the one new guest plus infinity is equal to the same infinity. What happens if we had a second guest?","426":"Absolutely. So now I'm gonna make this story a little more complex. That there's another Hilbert's Hotel down the street and they're having plumbing issues and we need to find room for them.","427":"They can't live together. That would be a great solution. I don't know. I think these people don't really get along. So I need to somehow create infinitely many new rooms, but I can only ask each person in the hotel to move a finite distance away. So let's take the guest who is originally in room one and move them into room two. So that's creating one new space for us. And I'm gonna take the guest who was originally in room two and move them into room four. Are you starting to see a pattern here?","428":"Yeah, I'm increasing by one more each time. So I'm doubling the room number in fact. So this is some of the strange arithmetic of infinity. So we have two Hilbert Hotels, each of which have infinitely many guests, then this is equal to?","429":"Infinity, great. Hilbert's Hotel is a story that mathematicians have been telling themselves for almost 100 years because it's a really visceral way to think about some of the counterintuitive properties of the arithmetic of infinity.","430":"So when I'm teaching calculus and talking about concepts like limits and derivatives, those are only defined precisely with infinity. Teaching algebra, which is meant in a different sense about number systems, we deal with infinite families of numbers in their operations. Infinite sets are somehow very exotic. They're not found so commonly in their real world, but they're all over mathematics.","431":"The internet is, physically, these computers that all talk to each other. Billions of computers, in the case of the internet. The internet allows us to do a lot of really, really interesting, what we call applications. You ever think about how that video gets to you over the internet?","432":"Matilda. All right. We're gonna actually build an internet. I've got a couple of things here that I wanna show you, or a couple of toys, actually. Okay, let's pretend that these round balls are computers. And the internet is something that connects them. And right now, the internet is just one communication link. And Matilda is sent over the internet from this computer to your computer. So the internet is a network for carrying information from one computer to another. Now this network here looks pretty simple, doesn't it? Right? It's just one thing. Should we add some more friends in?","433":"That's right. So that's pretty cool. There are actually lots of different ways to actually go through the internet to get from what we call a source, the place that's sending the information, to the receiver, the place that's actually gathering the information together. And that's something we actually call routing.","434":"Lettuce go on. [Skylar and Jim laughing] A knock, knock joke is an example of a protocol, right? The computer that you are using say, makes a request, you ask for something, you get something in return. In the internet, there are protocols everywhere. So that two computers that have never talked to each other before know the rules for talking to each other. This global internet with billions of people using it are just lots of smaller networks that are all hooked together to each other. But also, what the internet allows are all of these what we call applications, Zoom, video playing services, can all run on top of the same internet.","435":"We're in level five now. So you're the expert-expert. I'm a huge fan of the work that you did in RCP, the Routing Control Platform being a precursor to software-defined networking and the notion that rather than having protocols actually always compute things, that we could compute things in data centers. I'd be interested if you could sort of just reflect back on that time and sort of the beginnings of SDN and where it's come since then.","436":"And certainly, we've heard about some countries that impose firewalls that don't let certain kinds of traffic out, or certain kinds of traffic in. So there's no global body that is regulating that?","437":"I mean, even you could just tell that two people are communicating even though the traffic itself is encrypted. So you don't know what they're saying, just even knowing two devices are communicating.","438":"You're one of the most awesome networking researchers that I know. I'm curious, just to pick your brain, what do you think are some of the hot topics in networking research? Where do you think the field is heading?","439":"That's the computer science brain thinking right there. So we wanna think of a function as procedure or mapping between sets. So a function defines a one-to-one correspondence if it defines a perfect matching between the elements of its domain set and the elements of its output set. We call such functions bijections or isomorphisms. So the reason I'm so interested in this idea of a bijective function or a one-to-one correspondence that guarantees that every element of one set gets matched with an element of the other set, no matter how many elements there are, these bijections or these one-to-one correspondences as they help mathematicians reason about infinity.","440":"Maybe two. Why not? Because now we're starting to make progress on matching all the negatives. We can match the natural number three with the integer two, the natural number four with the integer minus two. And do you see a pattern?","441":"Great. So now I have a much harder question. So we have the same challenge, again, evidently there are way, way, way more rational numbers than there are integers. Does that mean this is a larger infinite set than the integers? What do you think?","442":"Yeah, that's exactly right. And now for each pair of integers, I'm gonna represent it by a corresponding natural number. That's what's going on with this counting. And when I compose those operations, what I've done is I've encoded rational numbers as natural numbers in a way that reveals that they can be no larger, there are no more rational numbers than natural numbers.","443":"Now there's one final collection of numbers that we haven't yet discussed, which are the real numbers, all of the points on the number line. Do you think that's the same size infinity?","444":"Great. That's exactly right. So what we've proven is that this number is missing, and therefore it is impossible to define a bijection between the natural numbers and the real numbers.","445":"So we've started to explore some of the counterintuitive properties of infinity. On the one hand there are infinite sets that feel very different like the natural numbers, the integers, the rational numbers that nevertheless have the same size or the same infinite cardinality. While there are other infinities that are larger. So there's more than one size of infinity, not all infinities are created equal.","446":"and actually machine learning is one research direction where we're really hoping that we're going to find um key parts of the machine learning computation that can be sped up using quantum computing","447":"you can change the magnetization to be pointing up or pointing down right quantum systems we're still manipulating a device and changing the quantum state of that of that device you can imagine if it's a spin that you could have spin up and spin down but you can also if you isolate it enough you can have a superposition of up and down","448":"so what we do when we try to solve problems with a quantum computer is we encode parts of the problem we're trying to solve into a complex quantum state and then we manipulate that state to drive it towards what will eventually represent the solution","449":"so you need a chip with qubits each qubit is a carrier of quantum information and the way we control the state of that qubit is using microwave pulses you send them all the way down these cables and we've calibrated these microwave pulses so that we know exactly this kind of pulse what this frequency and this duration will put the cupid into superposition or we'll flip the state of the qubit from zero to one or if we apply a microwave pulse between two qubits we can entangle them","450":"there's sort of two main classes of quantum algorithms there's algorithms which were developed for decades right things like shore's algorithm which is for factoring grover's algorithm for unstructured search and these algorithms were designed assuming that you had a perfect fault tolerant quantum computer which is many decades away so we're currently in a phase where we're exploring what can we do with these near-term quantum computers and the answer is going to be well we need different kinds of algorithms to really even explore that question"},"dialogue":{"0":"Explainer: Yeah. The amazing thing about harmony is that it exists in nature. So, take the harmonic series of the note F, for example. Okay. You have the ups on the fifth and the fourth and then the, (hums) That seemed a little bit sharp, but that's fine. And then tones get increasingly small. Beneath that note, you have the undertone series, which essentially is like a reflection of something. In the same way that when a tree grows in nature, you have the branches which grow upwards and the roots which go downwards. So it's quite a nice thing to thing about, this being the key center, the floor, the ground, and then these two different directions of ways in which it can express itself, and the differences in the sensations with that. Lots of the time I think when it comes to reharmonization or harmonization, people think that the solution to the problems come when we add more notes.\nExplainee: Yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","1":"Explainer: I think that people forget that you can work with the notes you already have by just rearranging them, just the simple idea of inversion, inversion of the simple triad, of F major. \u266aI once was lost and now I'm found \u266a \u266a Was blind \u266a \u266a But now I see \u266a Now how home do I want to go here, you know?

Probably.\nExplainee: E5 looks a little dangerous, but I guess we can analyze that later. All right, so what are you threatening? At the moment, not much, yeah? If I take an E5, it gets very boring. Now it's a good thing that like my queen is not gonna hang when you take my knight.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","9":"Explainer: That's what always happens. Okay, I have a personal question now.\nExplainee: Yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","10":"Explainer: Nine times. So there's a relationship between motion through space, the earth is going through space, and the passage of time. They're kind of connected\nExplainee: Yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","11":"Explainer: in some way. But there are differences, right? If I asked you to move through space, you could do it freely, right? Can you get up? And let's see how easy it is to move through space. Can you move over to that location? And can you come back? Anything getting in your way? Easy to do?\nExplainee: Yep.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","12":"Explainer: What do you know about him?\nExplainee: He has crazy hair.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","13":"Explainer: He does have crazy hair, and I think I'm maybe heading in that direction actually.He showed us an approach to travel to the future. You want me to tell you how you do it?\nExplainee: Okay.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","14":"Explainer: And can you travel to the future in principle?\nExplainee: Maybe.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","15":"Explainer: So and a musician, how much of it do you think is in your hands versus in your brains? Meaning like, you do have connections in your muscles from the nerves that are from your spinal cord, what if some of the learning is there?\nExplainee: Are you still doing EM or?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","16":"Explainer: So you do see it, basically the dust sublimation radius, and you see it at, and it tells you, depending on what kind of dust it is, and it's actually one of the problems for me studying, whenever we try and do X-ray studies of low luminosity active galactic nuclei in your, by galaxies, because there're all these X-ray binaries that are also emitting X-rays, which make our lives difficult. But they're also in black holes, when it's this really interesting sort of both, it's great, but ugh, it's also a source of noise for those of us who are trying to do X-ray observations of nearby galaxies.\nExplainee: We have the same problem, we can't see the actual black hole underneath all these very bright X-ray binaries.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","17":"Explainer: And this goes to the idea that you don't have a core balance, that a supernova with a black hole as its final result, actually never has any kind of expulsion, that it all just goes. (imitates sucking)\nExplainee: Yeah, that might be, yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","18":"Explainer: Now, in some sense that's kind of trivial to you and me, because of course you have space, which is three dimensional, you have time which is one dimensional, so spacetime is four dimensional. But it didn't turn out, it didn't occur to anyone that that was a sensible way to talk until really relativity. This is the crucial thing, right? Is that what Einstein realized is that sure there's both time and space, but how we divide spacetime into time and space can be different for different people, and really there's a real sense in which four dimensional spacetime is kind of a generalization of three dimensional space. And I think to really explain this we're gonna need a blackboard.\nExplainee: Okay.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","19":"Explainer: So let me draw spacetime. Here's how we usually draw it. I'll just say X, but all of space is condensed in this one direction, and this is time, okay? So if you're a little person and you started some event, so you start, you're located somewhere in space, somewhere in the three coordinates of space, and whether you like it or not, you're moving through spacetime just by getting older.\nExplainee: Yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","20":"Explainer: When people ask me can you travel through time? I say yes, yesterday I traveled 24 hours into the future and here I am, a day later. So that's just this. Okay, you're moving through time, like it or not. So what Einstein says is look, I can travel through spacetime in different ways, like I could hop in a rocket ship and fly out and then fly back, and then I could meet you there. So this is a different trajectory through spacetime, right?\nExplainee: Yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","21":"Explainer: And it's almost exactly like the space story. The space story says there's a distance, distance is different along different curves. Einstein says there's something that measures the length of these curves, and we call it the proper time. It is literally the time that you would read on your wristwatch.\nExplainee: So it's kind of like our fundamental time? Or our base time?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","22":"Explainer: And the crucial difference is that time is not the same for this person who stayed behind and sat in their chair, and this person who zoomed out there.\nExplainee: Why is that, that this one's shorter then?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","23":"Explainer: [Sean] That's the difference.\nExplainee: All right.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","24":"Explainer: But there are no straight lines, because spacetime itself is curved. So do you think if you had to explain relativity what would you say?\nExplainee: I think I'd go with kind of the train paradox. Let's say I'm stationary, and someone's moving past me on the train, they think they're stationary on the train. Like they think that they're not accelerating, but if they start walking through the train cars, then they are accelerating in their frame, but then from my outside frame where I'm completely removed, I see they are accelerating. So I guess that relativity is all about perspective, I guess in a way.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","25":"Explainer: Nano is kind of a funny word, right? It's a word that's used before another word, and it means one billion. What's the smallest object you can think of?\nExplainee: A baby ant?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","26":"Explainer: A baby ant? Very good. So I have over here a meter stick, let me show it to you. And so that's a meter and if I divide it by 1000, I get a millimeter. So milli just means 1000. There's all these little lines on the ruler. And each of those little lines is one millimeter. So a baby ant is probably a couple of millimeters. So even the thing, that's the smallest thing you can think of, it's a million times bigger than a nanometer. Tiny, tiny, tiny.\nExplainee: Tiny, tiny, tiny, tiny.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","27":"Explainer: If I took this stick and I was to draw 1 billion lines, the distance between those two lines would be one nanometer. So that's really all it is. It's just a measure of size. But it's really, really, really tiny, smaller than anything that we can see with our eyes. The reason why, in nanotechnology, scientists, we care about things that are that small, is because there are objects called atoms. Have you ever heard of atoms before?\nExplainee: Yes. I first heard of them on a show I watched called StoryBots. They're just little things that make up everything on Earth, even earth.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","28":"Explainer: That was a perfect explanation. But what if I told you that scientists invented a special type of microscope that not only lets you see atoms, but also lets you move them around and build things with them. Would you think that would be pretty cool?\nExplainee: Yeah!\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","29":"Explainer: You are definitely a second grader! [laughing] My daughter would probably answer the exact same way. A unicorn would be awesome.\nExplainee: Why do you study stuff so small?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","30":"Explainer: Same with, who are the actors? It's not just people anymore. It's machines.\nExplainee: [Valentinas] Absolutely.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","31":"Explainer: We're gonna have to create entire new concepts of how they do trade and how they work with us, too. What kind of barriers or road blocks would you imagine are gonna happen in the blockchain space?\nExplainee: So at least when we talk about Bitcoin, there are some trust issues and some hacks. So there's obviously a need to work on trust and feeling that it's a safe technology.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","32":"Explainer: Yeah. One of the problems that Bitcoin has faced is Bitcoins getting stolen or lost. But a lot of that actually comes from people trying to recentralize Bitcoin in different ways making themselves actually a pretty easy target.\nExplainee: Absolutely, so education will be a big part before we actually can use the technology in a wide sense. Right?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","33":"Explainer: Telescopes, solar arrays, they need to be packed into a rocket, go up, but then expand in a very controlled, deterministic way when they get up into space.\nExplainee: Okay.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","34":"Explainer: These are the building blocks of many, many origami deployable shapes, it's called a degree-4 vertex. It's the number of lines. So in this case, we use solid lines for mountain, we use dash lines for valley. We're going to fold it and use these two to illustrate some important properties of origami mechanisms. It's important in the study of mechanisms to take into account the rigidity. So what we're going to do to help simulate rigidity is to take these rectangles and we're going to fold them over and over so that they just become stiff and rigid.\nExplainee: [Grad Student] Okay.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","35":"Explainer: So this is what's called a single degree of freedom mechanism. You have one degree of freedom, I can choose this fold, and then if these are perfectly rigid every other fold angle is fully determined. One of the key behaviors here is that with the smaller angles up here, the two folds that are the same parity and the folds that are of opposite parity move at about the same rate but with this, as we're getting closer to 90 degrees, we find they move at very different rates and then at the end of the motion, the opposite happens. This one is almost folded but this one goes through a much larger motion so the relative speeds differ.\nExplainee: Right.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","36":"Explainer: And they fold flat and a pattern almost exactly like this was used for a solar array for a Japanese mission that flew in 1995.\nExplainee: So then you like fly it up compactly and then once you get up there, there's like some sort of like motorized mechanism, but you only need it on one fold.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","37":"Explainer: So, sadly, the only way to get them at exactly the same rate is when these are microscopic slivers and then that's not useful.\nExplainee: For sure, right, right.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","38":"Explainer: And it's exactly the difference between the motions of these two vertices. So these angles are closer to right angles and the closer you get to a right angle the more asymmetry there is between the two directions of motion. And then the other difference is how efficiently they pack, so these started at about the same size but when they're flat notice that yours is much more compact. So if I were you making a solar array, I'd say, oh, I want that one. But if I say, well, I want them to open at the same rate, then I want this one.\nExplainee: So, it's kind of a trade-off?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","39":"Explainer: There's an engineering trade-off to get them both to work. And there's another place that shows up in deployable structures in a very cool structure. This is a folded tube, it sort of pops out like this but it has this neat property that if you twist it quickly, it changes color. There's a Mars Rover application where they need a sleeve that protects a drill and as the drill goes down, the sleeve is going to collapse and they're using a pattern very much like this.\nExplainee: Interesting.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","40":"Explainer: And sleep science. Do you sleep?\nExplainee: I do, I try. [laughs]\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","41":"Explainer: But being off is not just being off. There's lots of things that are happening. We're gonna kind of talk about those different pieces of sleep.\nExplainee: Okay.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","42":"Explainer: So our sleep is made up of different types, okay? The first one is called non-rapid eye movement sleep, or non-REM, okay? Or NREM. And then the other one, which might not be a surprise, is called REM. Rapid eye movement sleep. And those are the two main types of sleep that happen. The way that we measure that as a sleep scientist is that we'll actually bring people into the lab where they can do this at home, where we put electrodes on their scalp while they're sleeping, and that allows us to measure the brain activity that's going on during the night.\nExplainee: Okay. Are you like able to tell how much sleep someone's getting or what their sleep schedule is by REM?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","43":"Explainer: Okay? When do you think you experience the most REM?\nExplainee: Well I've heard that you don't really go into like a deeper sleep, so I'm guessing like N-3, or really any of the N's at all, really, if you are on technology right before you sleep. And also if there's too much light, or if you're listening to music while you're asleep or anything like that, you're not experiencing deep sleep, right?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","44":"Explainer: You know, some of that is totally accurate, that like when your brain's more engaged by being on your phone or doing things that you really enjoy or things that stress you out or any of those types of things, it's harder to get to sleep and to kind of fall into that deeper levels of sleep. Most of the REM sleep, this dreaming sleep, happens in the second half of the night.\nExplainee: Oh.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","45":"Explainer: One to six hours? That's a long nap.\nExplainee: It is a long nap.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","46":"Explainee: What is fusion energy?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","47":"Explainer: You probably have learned in school about three states of matter.\nExplainee: Solid, liquid and gas.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","48":"Explainer: Absolutely, we take the gas, and we add heat, and we get a plasma. And a plasma is a state of matter where you have an ionized gas. If we break down that gas, and we add enough energy to ionize it, where you can take the electrons and the ions and the atom and separate them, and now there's this soup of charged particles that are moving around, that's the plasma. And it is what creates the beautiful light in lightning. So you've already seen a plasma in fact. So I'm gonna show you this fun demonstration. You've probably seen one of these before, right?\nExplainee: That's so cool.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","49":"Explainer: Okay.\nExplainee: We've learned about how it has to be a positive and negative charge. And we've done those things where you can like put 'em with something in between 'em, and just move one and the other will always follow.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","50":"Explainer: Yeah, exactly, perpendicular. And if I drive the current in this green wire, which direction will it go?\nExplainee: [Points counter-clockwise.]\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","51":"Explainer: Or we're gonna call the pushback a Coulomb interaction, or a Coulomb collision. So you can sort of imagine if I were to take a deuteron and a triton, and so those are the positively charged ions of deuterium and tritium, and I try and combine them together, those two positively charged particles just sort of bounce off of each other. So we have to give them enormous amounts of energy, and it has to do with getting up to very high temperatures. So we're talking about over 100 million degrees Celsius. And we typically put that into an energy unit that we use a lot in plasma physics called an electron vault. And so we describe being up at 100 million degrees that we're at sort of 15 kiloelectron volts.\nExplainee: Uh huh.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","52":"Explainer: So that's very, very hot temperature. But the other thing we need is a lot of particles. That's the density. We are able to combine a deuteron and a triton in a fusion reaction at lower temperatures, at lower energies than other fuel. And this has to do with some very nice properties of the deuteron and the triton that when we get them close enough to one another to fuse, there's actually a resonance which is predicted by quantum mechanics, and that really helps have a little bump up in the cross section for the deuterium-tritium fusion reaction.\nExplainee: Compared to just hydrogen.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","53":"Explainer: Absolutely, yeah, absolutely.\nExplainee: So that the plasma itself is not staying hot enough for the time we need it to stay.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","54":"Explainer: And so, how much do you think you need?\nExplainee: I mean, I've read that six is ideal for people in my age range.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","55":"Explainer: It turns out, for people that are between the ages of 18 and 65, the agreed upon amount of sleep that people should get is between seven and nine hours, and it's really at least seven hours per night, to maintain optimal health as an adult. So at least seven hours. When we look at across all of the data that is available on like sleep and health, and sleep and psychiatric illness and those types of things, the largest risk is when people get five hours or less. What do you think is responsible for driving how much sleep you need, and things like that?\nExplainee: I mean, I know sleep is kind of regulated by the thalamus and the suprachiasmatic nucleus sending signals to the pineal gland to which kind of secretes melatonin, which tells us when it's time to go to sleep.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","56":"Explainer: The first thing I want to show you is origami in the real world. This is the origami lamp. It comes shipped flat but it folds, clip holds it together. The lamp has LEDs on the inside so when we power it up we get light, we have a lampshade and we get the base.\nExplainee: Why does origami lend itself to, say, this type of application?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","57":"Explainer: This is another real-world application but this particular implementation is used to make a wheel for a Rover.\nExplainee: Cool, so this is something that can actually get really, really tiny but then get big and fat and roll.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","58":"Explainer: New problems arise when we try to make origami out of things other than paper, but also new opportunities. An example here which is a kind of a variant of the Miura-Ori. It's got a three-dimensional structure. If I stretch it one way, it expands the other but because it has these S-bends in the pattern, if you squeeze it, it doesn't go all the way flat. This is a epoxy impregnated aramid fiber and so if I put this fold pattern into it and then compress it and then put a skin on the top and bottom, this becomes incredibly lightweight but incredibly strong.\nExplainee: Yeah!\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","59":"Explainer: And it's because we've had a lot of PR, a lot of proof of concept, but truthfully, this is more like a science, right?\nExplainee: Yes.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","60":"Explainer: The system we have today is also broken. (laughs) Right?\nExplainee: Yes.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","61":"Explainer: In that it's hard to compare it to some perfect future. Just like you compare autonomous vehicles to this very high standard because machines are doing it. It should be perfect. There should be zero car deaths.\nExplainee: (laughs) Yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","62":"Explainer: [Sean] What kind of science?\nExplainee: I like biology and computer science.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","63":"Explainer: All right, you're in the wrong place. [laughs] We're not gonna be talking about biology or computer science. So we wanna talk about the idea of dimensions. Do you know what dimension is? How we would define dimensions?\nExplainee: I guess, I don't know how to exactly define it, but I know, like the first four.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","64":"Explainer: Right, you know the difference between like one dimension two dimensions, three dimensions, et cetera. So let's do a little experiment here. So there's one dimension. I'll give that to you. Now, here's your task. I'm going to give you another dimension, and I'm gonna ask hold those two things at right angles to each other. It's easy to do. Yeah, so there's no trick here.\nExplainee: [laughing] Yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","65":"Explainer: I'm not trying to fool you here. Okay. Now this is going to be slightly trickier. I'm going to give you this. I want you to hold all three of them at right angles to all the others at the same time.\nExplainee: Um ...\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","66":"Explainer: That's right. So that's exactly what these would be. Have you heard that there are other coordinate systems other than XYX?\nExplainee: No.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","67":"Explainer: Well, we could also say how far we are away from the center, just the distance. And then the angle that our little line makes with let's say the X axis.\nExplainee: Yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","68":"Explainer: So that's a different way of giving you two numbers and locating yourself, and we call those polar coordinates. It's a different coordinate system. What we want to do as physicists is look for extra dimensions. Can you imagine, can you think of any way that there could be extra dimensions?\nExplainee: Time?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","69":"Explainer: [Sean] And sort of the peels of an orange kind of thing, right?\nExplainee: [Juliana] Yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","70":"Explainer: So you can define something as, well you know, how high above a certain location on earth it is, but the earth is rotating and revolving around the sun so we have to define separate celestial coordinates.\nExplainee: So, there's like how many dimension would there be?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","71":"Explainer: Absolutely right. And this is sort of the state of uncertainty that physicists are stuck living in.\nExplainee: Oh. [laughs]\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","72":"Explainer: Which is, by the way, what, when I was just starting out in graduate school, that was the hot new thing, so.\nExplainee: Exactly.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","73":"Explainer: Huh.\nExplainee: Understanding the anatomy of the brain is definitely important but, it doesn't necessarily tell us everything about the function, there's some sort of temporal order from neuron to neuron and region to region that we may not be able to pick up.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","74":"Explainer: Because there's more to you in here than just information passing between neurons.\nExplainee: I'd like to think so.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","75":"Explainer: Yeah, you'd have to move your king.\nExplainee: Get to my king, and so I remember hitting all these variations that just scared me.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","76":"Explainer: A lot of people will see you as somebody who's drank in harmony their whole life. They've seen so much harmony, heard so much harmony. How do you make the choices, there's so much that's possible when you know stuff. How do you have the courage to make a choice?\nExplainee: It comes from just your life experience. And that moves you in a certain direction. How it gets expressed, many times, is sudden. Complete surprise. (laughs)\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","77":"Explainer: That haunted me for days.\nExplainee: (Herbie laughs)\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","78":"Explainer: Right, right, right.\nExplainee: Right.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","79":"Explainer: Something like that. And that's not 'cause like emotionally, it's almost like I'm here, I'm arriving here. But, if the base note is the same, it's like this inevitability about it, it's like I was there all along.\nExplainee: And it makes like a pull.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","80":"Explainer: I've been using this tune Amazing Grace.\nExplainee: Oh, right.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","81":"Explainer: Do you know what computer hacking is?\nExplainee: It's bad. Like, I'm going into someone's personal account or account, changing some stuff or just stealing some information or your money.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","82":"Explainer: What they're trying to do is they're trying to even prevent the bad hackers from getting in in the first place.\nExplainee: So they put like a protection account or something.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","83":"Explainer: Yeah, exactly. They're looking for ways that they can create protection. It's kind of like the lock on your front door. That lock is to essentially prevent bad people from coming in or people accidentally coming in when they shouldn't. A hacker is essentially looking at a way, how can I get into this lock? But then there are the good ones who are trying to unlock it so that they can tell the company that made the lock, hey, we can actually protect people by making the lock a little harder.\nExplainee: What would they do about the people and the broken lock?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","84":"Explainer: I started doing the good hacking when I turned nine years old.\nExplainee: Wow.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","85":"Explainer: I started going on the computer and playing video games, but I had some ideas of my own, and that's where I started to learn how to hack. I wanted to play with my friends on this video game and just change the way that things look.\nExplainee: But that would be kinda bad, because maybe the creator did it for a reason.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","86":"Explainer: That's entirely possible. They may have done it for a reason, but you may have come up with a really good idea that, do you think there are other people who might like the idea that you came up with?\nExplainee: Yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","87":"Explainee: Hello Donna, good to see you.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","88":"Explainer: You could not convince me to stay, no.\nExplainee: But you were there long enough to make a big impression and get some good work done.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","89":"Explainer: And that's, like you said, we're stuck a little bit, we're not up to that kind of acceleration, so that would be a Nobel Prize winning possible idea.\nExplainee: Absolutely.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","90":"Explainer: Sounds like you've dabbled with quite a few algorithms. So, how does one actually research algorithms or invent algorithms?\nExplainee: The most important way is just trying to think about inefficiencies, and also think about connecting threads. The way I think about it is that algorithm for me is not just about the way of doing something, but it's about doing something efficiently. Learning algorithms are practically everywhere now. Google, I would say for example, is learning every day about like, Oh what articles, what links might be better than others? And re-ranking them. There are recommender systems all around us, right? Like content feeds and social media, or you know, like YouTube or Netflix. What we see is in a large part determined by this kind of learning algorithms.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","91":"Explainer: Practical purposes.\nExplainee: Yes.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","92":"Explainer: That's a nice way of looking at it. So that you're not actually violating classical relativity once you're in a regime where the wave function has really peaked around a very well-defined stage.\nExplainee: That's right, and one of the most exciting developments in the last 10 or 20 years is called holography, and it's called holography because a hologram is a two-dimensional surface that creates a three-dimensional image. It's got sort of 3D information built into it. And this, in a fundamental way, really has that 3D or higher dimensional information built into it. It's exactly the same as this theory of gravity and more dimensions.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","93":"Explainer: Right, exactly. And the most knowledge you could ever have would only be on a two-dimensional surface.\nExplainee: Right, and as big as the universe, and then you're done. So, you know, not likely that we're ever gonna hit that limit any time soon.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","94":"Explainer: So on code.org, one of the things you've been doing is actually building a game or that they have a game and then you can actually rewire some of the inputs and outputs of that. Is that right?\nExplainee: Yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","95":"Explainer: Okay. With computer hacking, it's actually the same thing. Really, you have some sort of system and you have a bunch of inputs and you have some sort of output, and actually you, as the designer, you're essentially designing games and software. You're saying, well, I will only allow a user to really control these inputs. Can you think of any inputs the computer might have?\nExplainee: [Linda] Space bar.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","96":"Explainer: Yep, there's also things like your mouse and there's even things like the microphone itself is actually an input device. It's taking something from you, which is the sound and it's then transmitting that, ad it's actually sending it to me. Are there any other things that you can talk to a computer? You can give it information.\nExplainee: Camera.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","97":"Explainer: That's absolutely another input that exists on your computer. That's how I try to think of things is there's just a bunch of inputs. Often, if you're trying to break something or hack something, you're really saying, okay, how can I control these inputs in a way that wasn't necessarily expected?\nExplainee: What inputs would you normally use to hack?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","98":"Explainer: Typically, it's going to be something like the keyboard, right? I'm just going to be typing keystrokes to be talking to some piece of software or hardware, but other times it can be other things like even the temperature of a computer can actually affect how the computer operates, and it might be advantageous to me to cool down the computer and actually slow down the movement of electrons in something like memory, so that if a computer shuts off, it stores something that wasn't memory like a password and stores it for a long enough time that I might be able to actually extract it through some other methods.\nExplainee: How long does it take to get in?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","99":"Explainer: What are you studying right now?\nExplainee: I'm doing physics and computer science.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","100":"Explainer: If I take a film of that electron, and it's a little fanciful to describe it that language because you know about quantum mechanics and so forth, but I take a film of a little particle moving around, and I show you that film, you'll be really hard-pressed to determine whether I've shown you the film running forward in time or whether I've shown you the film going in reverse time. If I had two, or three, or four,or a gazillion particles into the mix, then it will be much easier for you to determine whether the film is going forward in time or backward in time. But order and disorder don't have much meaning if there's only one particle. And that's why the fundamental laws don't draw a distinction, but the macroscopic experience does, but it raises a key question. Where'd the order of the egg come from? If everything goes toward disorder, how did I get this orderly collection of atoms called an egg? Well, you probably would say from--\nExplainee: Chicken.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","101":"Explainer: Yeah, not only did we find that time changes with speed in special relativity, but we also found that time changes with gravity. Einstein showed that the rate at which a clock ticks slows down based upon the stronger gravitational field, or gravitational potential actually, that it is experiencing. I think you mentioned the Interstellar before.\nExplainee: Yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","102":"Explainer: What's your idea what physics is?\nExplainee: Um, I'm not so sure.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","103":"Explainer: And how would you find yourself, like if someone said where are you, could you use some words or ideas to say where you are on that line?\nExplainee: I think I would be maybe there, since I'm facing it.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","104":"Explainer: Has its own unit, has one number.\nExplainee: Yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","105":"Explainer: I think you should be in this chair and you should be explaining this to me. You're much better at this than I am.\nExplainee: Yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","106":"Explainer: Well, as far as we know.\nExplainee: Yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","107":"Explainer: Yeah, do you think you'd be excited if physicists said that they found extra dimensions of space?\nExplainee: That would be an amazing discovery. The news would be spreaded around the world rapidly.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","108":"Explainer: So have you taken a quantum mechanics course?\nExplainee: I have. I took that last year.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","109":"Explainer: So these are typically semiconductors. They can be cadmium selenide cadmium sulfide, zinc selenide and they're small clusters of atoms. They can be from 2 to 10 nanometers. What's interesting about these materials?\nExplainee: Well, the other day we were talking about the different dimensions you can have of nanotechnology. So all the way from like 0D to 3D. If I remember correctly, my professor labeled it as 0D?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","110":"Explainer: Do you know what this is?\nExplainee: Carbon nanotube?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","111":"Explainer: Yeah. 100%. That's right. And that's the motivation for looking at these emerging materials. But I would never bet against the innovation and the creativity in this nano electronic space. Tens of thousands of scientists, every time they hit a barrier, at least historically, as a guide, they have found a way to overcome it. It's a real marvel in ingenuity.\nExplainee: I gotta ask. The lights that are behind you, is that related to the quantum dots that you work with at all?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","112":"Explainer: What do you think of when you think of nanotechnology?\nExplainee: It kind of seems very science fiction.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","113":"Explainer: I went through my kid's Lego bins to build a very simple model of a transistor. And these are wired together in circuits so that you can do computation. You can do logic with them. Where nanotechnology comes into play, the way you double the number of transistors on a chip. Can you guess what you would have to do to this transistor?\nExplainee: You make it smaller?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","114":"Explainer: And how would you talk about that change without invoking this concept of time?\nExplainee: It's difficult to talk about something without adding time into it.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","115":"Explainer: Even if it is a human-made concept that the universe evolved, developed, changed through time, ultimately giving rise to galaxy, stars, planets, and on this particular planet, life. That conception of time gives a feel that it's like universal, that it's out there, it's the same for everybody. It's independent of our actions or activities. Do you know that Albert Einstein shattered that view of time? He found that if you and I, say, have identical wrist watches, I'm sitting still and I'm watching you move, I will find that your clock is taking off time more slowly than my clock. But you know what's really remarkable? You can figure out this quality of time if you know one fact, that the speed of light is constant. Have you ever heard that phrase?\nExplainee: Yeah, my freshman year physics class.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","116":"Explainer: Yeah, if you're clever, you can use that with high school algebra, maybe even a little high school trigonometry to make it even easier, to derive that clocks take off time at different rate. Do you want me to show you how that goes?\nExplainee: Yes, please.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","117":"Explainer: Have you heard of the breach of Target where they were breached many years ago and their point of sale systems were hacked?\nExplainee: Yes, I heard about that.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","118":"Explainer: Absolutely, you would essentially cause a segmentation fault.\nExplainee: Yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","119":"Explainer: Yeah, it was, to my knowledge, the most widely studied astronomical event in the history of humanity.\nExplainee: Wow, that's amazing.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","120":"Explainer: What's your name, tell me a little bit about yourself.\nExplainee: I'm Amelia, I'm nine years old. I'm in third grade, and my favorite subject at school is definitely science.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","121":"Explainer: Yeah.\nExplainee: And I was also thinking on how can it do that.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","122":"Explainer: You know, scientists are still studying exactly how magnetism works, right? It'll still be there for you to tackle when you become a scientist. Have you ever seen one of these games?\nExplainee: Yes.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","123":"Explainer: Mine too, because I get to spend all day studying it. Because you know what sleep does for you?\nExplainee: It rests your body, like an electric car.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","124":"Explainer: They're pretty cool, right?\nExplainee: Mhm.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","125":"Explainer: And how did you feel?\nExplainee: Really tired.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","126":"Explainer: A hippopotamus. They have a different challenge. They sleep underwater.\nExplainee: I could never do that, I would pass out.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","127":"Explainer: So now I want to talk about our last animal, and I think this one is probably the most amazing of all. Okay, so what's this?\nExplainee: Aww a dolphin.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","128":"Explainer: A dolphin! Yes. So dolphins, kind of like hippos, have to sleep in the water, okay? But because they're mammals, right, they need to breathe. Dolphins breathe air. They have to go up to the surface and breathe, right? And for an animal like that, it needs to figure out a way that it can sleep but also still survive, right? You know how dolphins sleep?\nExplainee: How?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","129":"Explainer: And that itself is part of the scientific process I would think too.\nExplainee: Yeah, very much. Well, science and engineering, because often you're building a thing and the thing does something amazing. To a large extent we are still looking for basic theoretical results around why deep neural networks generally work. Why are they able to learn so well? They're huge, billions of parameter models and it's difficult for us to interpret how they're able to do what they do.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","130":"Explainer: Do you know a lot about lasers? Or just about the laser that you use.\nExplainee: Not a lot, just a little bit.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","131":"Explainer: Okay. So this is about high intensity lasers. Not only how do you make them, but what was really stopping them being made in both cases is non linear optics. We wanna do something that requires a huge photon density application, and so that's how come we came up with chirped pulse amplification, so that we could stretch the pulse, safely amplify it, then compress it at the end, and then we're ready to do whatever we want at the end. So what do you think the main difference is between the continuous wave laser that you have that runs at 10 watts and a chirped pulse amplifier?\nExplainee: I feel like the continuous laser delivers power at a continuous rate, whereas you want all that power to be delivered in a really, really short time with your amplification.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","132":"Explainer: So is that where some of that frustration around the lack of controllability and interpretability comes from?\nExplainee: Yeah, if you're building a model that just predicts the next thing based off of everything it's seen from texts online, then yeah, you're really gonna be replicating whatever that distribution online is.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","133":"Explainer: {missing part}\n","134":"Explainer: But if we just wind up following the path that we're on, we're gonna get double and quadruple, but we're not gonna get 50 times more powerful than we are right now. We will run into atomic limits on our fabrication. So given that, I'm trying to tell people that, start buying back into optimization, start buying back into thinking a bit more creatively. Because you can't just wait, its not going to get to that point where it really is fixed to those highest degrees just by waiting for computing to be advanced. If we want this to be something used by a billion people then we need it to be lighter, cheaper, more comfortable.\nExplainee: And there's constantly novel UX innovations. Like Google Earth, where the kind of elimination of your periphery as you zoom in and move. And also, giving you the user action to decide where you're going and looking. I'm constantly seeing people coming up with ways to break from the paradigms of actual reality and then introduce mechanisms that work very well.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","135":"Explainer: So, from your perspective, how would you describe gravity?\nExplainee: I'm taught that it's a force. It's described by inverse law. But I also know that it's a field. And there's a recent discovery with gravitational waves, although I don't know the specific details about that.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","136":"Explainer: So, when you say it's an inverse-square law, that means that the closer you are, the more strongly you feel the gravitational pull. And that makes sense. There's very few things that are stronger when you're further apart.\nExplainee: Yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","137":"Explainer: Yeah, exactly.\nExplainee: Yeah, yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","138":"Explainer: Yeah, it would just go straight. But if you did that on the Earth, what would happen?\nExplainee: It would just go down.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","139":"Explainer: You had that moment, I saw that it your face!\nExplainee: Yeah, yeah, yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","140":"Explainer: Isn't it kind of amazing?\nExplainee: Yeah. [laughs]\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","141":"Explainer: What do you know about algorithms?\nExplainee: Nothing really, at all honestly. I think it's just probably a way to store information in computers.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","142":"Explainer: Okay.\nExplainee: Getting dressed.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","143":"Explainer: What if your friend happened to be at the very bottom of this randomly organized list? Why is that a problem? Like he or she's still there.\nExplainee: I guess it would take a while to get to while you're scrolling.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","144":"Explainer: That, in of itself, is kind of a problem or it's an inefficient solution to the problem. So, it turns out that back in my day, before there were cell phones, everyone's numbers from my schools were literally printed in a book, and everyone in my town and my city, my state was printed in an actual phone book. Even if you've never seen this technology before, how would you propose verbally to find John in this phone book?\nExplainee: Or I would just flip through and just look for the J's I guess.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","145":"Explainer: In what sense?\nExplainee: If he's in one of the middle pages that you skipped over.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","146":"Explainer: Yeah, so sort of accidentally and frankly with like 50\/50 probability, John could get sandwiched in between two pages. But does that mean I have to throw that algorithm out altogether?\nExplainee: Maybe you could use that strategy until you get close to the section and then switch to going one by one.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","147":"Explainer: Okay, that's nice. So, you could kind of like go twice as fast but then kind of pump the brakes as you near your exit on the highway, or in this case near the J section of the book.\nExplainee: Exactly.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","148":"Explainer: Okay. So, I'm in the K section. Is John going to be to the left or to the right?\nExplainee: To the left.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","149":"Explainer: Yeah. So, John is going to be to the left or the right and what we can do here, though your phone does something smarter, is tear the problem in half, throw half of the problem away, being left with just 500 pages now. But what might I next do? I could sort of naively just start at the beginning again, but we've learned to do better. I can go roughly to the middle here.\nExplainee: And you can do it again.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","150":"Explainer: Yeah, exactly. So, now maybe I'm in the E section, which is a little to the left. So, John is clearly going to be to the right, so I can again tear the problem poorly in half, throw this half of the problem away, and I claim now that if we started with a thousand pages, now we've gone to 500, 250, now we're really moving quickly.\nExplainee: Yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","151":"Explainer: And so, eventually I'm hopefully dramatically left with just one single page at which point John is either on that page or not on that page, and I can call him. Roughly how many steps might this third algorithm take if I started with a thousand pages then went to 500, 250, 125, how many times can you divide 1,000 in half? Maybe?\nExplainee: 10.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","152":"Explainer: That's roughly roughly 10. Because in the first algorithm, looking again for someone like Zoe in the worst case might have to go all the way through a thousand pages. But the second algorithm you said was 500, maybe 501, essentially the same thing. So, twice as fast. But this third and final algorithm is sort of fundamentally faster because you're sort of dividing and conquering it in half, in half, in half, not just taking one or two bites out of it out of a time. So, this of course is not how we used to use phone books back in the day since otherwise they'd be single use only. But it is how your phone is actually searching for Zoe, for John, for anyone else, but it's doing it in software.\nExplainee: Oh, that's cool.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","153":"Explainer: [Donna] And what's your major?\nExplainee: I'm an engineering physics major with a minor in math. I'm in the three, two program for biomedical engineering.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","154":"Explainer: Well a lot of lasers and when lasers first came along, they were only single color. Your cat toy, would only be a single color, probably a red one and so that's just one color. And one color means that it has to really be there for the whole time. One color is one wave length of light and so it's just one wave that goes on and on and on. If you want a short pulse, you actually have to have all the colors. And if you can imagine that one point in time, and I like to say it's like a conductor of an orchestra. When you're listening to an orchestra warm up, they sound terrible, they're all playing their own notes. But when the conductor conducts them, they all play different notes but, together, it's beautiful music. So we have something in the laser called a mode locker and it's like the conductor and it says go now. And all the colors will start together but some colors are long wave length and others are shorter. So next thing you know, you have peaks meeting valleys and they cancel each other. And the more colors you can bring in, the faster that happens and the shorter the pulse you can make.\nExplainee: What's the pendant?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","155":"Explainer: So in your studies, have you learned about machine learning?\nExplainee: Yeah, I have. So to me, machine learning is essentially exactly what it sounds like. It's trying to teach a machine specifics about something by inputting a lot of data points and slowly, the machine will build up knowledge about it over time. For example, my Gmail program, I assume that there would be a lot of, like, machine learning models happening at once, right?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","156":"Explainer: Absolutely. And that's a great example because you have models that are operating to do things like figure out if a new email is spam or not. So what would you think about if you were looking at an email and trying to decide if it went in one category or another?\nExplainee: I'd probably look at certain keywords. Maybe if the recipient and the sender had exchanged emails before and generally, those fell into in the past.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","157":"Explainer: Alright, so, at some point, you can probably see it right now? So without moving your eyes, this is kind of hard, tell me how many fingers I'm holding up?\nExplainee: Uh, three?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","158":"Explainer: Looking ahead, 5 years, 10 years, where do you see your own work, and maybe the field more broadly?\nExplainee: The future I'd like to see is environmentally friendly chemistry and materials synthesis. And I think that we're really going that way. If we think about batteries of the future, solar cells of the future, thinking about earth abundant materials and processes that are compatible with the earth and environment.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","159":"Explainer: It's what keeps us on the earth.\nExplainee: What?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","160":"Explainer: The reason we're not just flying off the earth is because earth has gravity, so if we throw something up, it comes back down, so that's why when we're walking on the earth, we don't fly off the earth because the earth has gravity, and it keeps us down.\nExplainee: Nice.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","161":"Explainer: Do you know why we're here today?\nExplainee: Because we're talking about science.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","162":"Explainer: Do you know that your body is made up of really tiny things called cells?\nExplainee: Um, yes, I know that.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","163":"Explainer: Which gives a clear sense of causality.\nExplainee: Yep.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","164":"Explainer: To note our recent paper, where we were thinking about Einstein's ideas of special relativity, but in a setting where the global shape of the space time, we imagine there might be a curled up dimension of space, a circular dimension and thought about how special relativity works in that setting, we came to a result in this very basic setting. You can send signals into the past, not in a way that will violate causality. Did that surprise you, that by going from the usual topology that doesn't have a closed part of space, but making that one change, you could have this radical impact?\nExplainee: I found quite surprising that you could have this exotic behavior of signal propagation in a system that was extremely simple, totally classical, there was nothing weird except one dimension that was compactified, was identified on a circle. Actually, even the standard vanilla causal structure of special relativity may give some very unexpected behaviors when you combine it with other simple modifications of just the flat space time.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","165":"Explainer: Like, why didn't Einstein realize this?\nExplainee: Yeah, maybe the idea of living on a subspace, of being confined in this extra dimension on a surface, may have been looked exotic but definitely did not look exotic after the 1990s.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","166":"Explainer: And who do you credit with that? Is that Newton? Do you go Newton or a little bit below? Do you Galileo?\nExplainee: I would say Galileo, Newton. Of course, the completion of this idea is Newton.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","167":"Explainer: Have you done any work in side channel analysis?\nExplainee: Like, a little bit. I read the Rowhammer paper. I found it really interesting, but it's nothing that I've actually worked with.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","168":"Explainer: That's pretty challenging if you want to use wireless, right? If you wanna use a wireless router.\nExplainee: Yeah, I mean, there's obviously essentials, but yeah, no matter what, you can't really avoid any of this.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","169":"Explainer: Especially now that we're seeing more and more companies who are trying to make it illegal for you to inspect the vehicle that you've purchased, right? Something that you actually own.\nExplainee: Yeah, I think that's nuts. I'm firmly against that for sure.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","170":"Explainer: What if it were illegal? Would you then do it? Fortunately it's not today, right? It hasn't been, you know, despite their attempts, none of that has been passed, but if you had a vehicle and you wanted to inspect it, but all of a sudden, it passed, I mean.\nExplainee: I don't know, probably, yeah. [laughing] I don't think that's hurting anyone,\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","171":"Explainer: What have you been up to? And yeah, what are you working on?\nExplainee: Lately I've been doing, you know, always a little bit of side channel analysis. So what I really do, you know, is all hardware layer. So I've been looking, you know, at some various devices lately, at how susceptible they are to fault attacks, what that sort of means in real life. You know, not just purely the research side, but also how much should you care about it.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","172":"Explainer: Yeah, that's 100% correct. Have you ever heard a song called Amazing Grace?\nExplainee: No.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","173":"Explainer: [Jacob] Awesome. And why did you prefer that one?\nExplainee: Because it sounds better.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","174":"Explainer: But you learned about black holes?\nExplainee: Sure.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","175":"Explainer: Yeah, if you are going to be able to change the past, that's the one that resonates most with me.\nExplainee: I think the same.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","176":"Explainer: And that raises uncomfortable issues for many people having to do with like free will.\nExplainee: I'm immediately uncomfortable.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","177":"Explainer: Yeah, so that one, there's actually some people like Joe Polchinski who did some wonderful studies of billiard ball tables, where you imagine a billiard ball goes into a wormhole, comes out and hits the very ball that was going into the hole. And in that way, if it could knock it off course, we seem to be in some logical paradox.\nExplainee: Absolutely.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","178":"Explainee: Yeah, we do have an answer. So the simplest version of that is, imagine that the universe has a shape of a donut.\nExplainee: All right.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","179":"Explainer: as they are when we teach to freshmen the special theory of relativity. That's right, exactly.\nExplainee: Me, for example.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","180":"Explainer: Yeah, yeah.\nExplainee: There's an eternity, but I'm never gonna see it, I'm never gonna feel it.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","181":"Explainer: And also take all of their pieces.\nExplainee: Yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","182":"Explainer: For me, I would describe chess as a lot of what you said, and also, it's a mix of really quick plans like tactics and then things that can take four, five, six, seven moves like a plan, like a strategy. So let's practice. In this position, I had the white pieces. You're playing on my side. My opponent was playing with the black pieces. So we switched a little bit. So if I said, Hey, you get three moves in a row, can you come up with a plan?\nExplainee: I think I could. If I have three moves in a row, I'd probably checkmate them with rook H3, queen H4, and then queen takes H7, checkmate.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","183":"Explainer: I'm very happy that's the first plan that you came up with, right? You can bring your queen out this way or the rook. You can start with both, and then you come here and then you checkmate. But I did say white gets three moves in a row, right?\nExplainee: Yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","184":"Explainer: But that's how we have to think about plans, right? We have to think about, Okay, well if I get a couple of moves in a row, what would I like to accomplish? What does my opponent want to do? So I'm not just gonna sit here and get checkmated hopefully. Right? So what do you think I want to do in this position?\nExplainee: I think my king is on a bad scale right now, so maybe you are trying to like trade and then somehow get an attack on my king.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","185":"Explainer: Okay. Why do you think so?\nExplainee: Well, the black king is very exposed into the white side of the board, and like the white king is a bit more safe.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","186":"Explainer: Yes, you're 100% right 'cause in chess, the two most important things we have to think about are who has more material, but then, like you said, who has the weaker king? And I would say my king has gone way too far, right? So there's a tactic here for what?\nExplainee: Maybe. Is it bishop takes upon on E4?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","187":"Explainer: Yes. Well done. And then I would take the pawn.\nExplainee: And then I would take the rook.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","188":"Explainer: What is it exactly that you're trying to tease out of these materials to improve the battery's performance?\nExplainee: At first, one of the main things that we did was use nanomaterials to add conductivity. And so carbon anodes and graphene are really good at adding conductivity to batteries. And then in the subsequent years, nanomaterials have been really interesting from things like incorporating sensors into batteries, to increasing the functionality of batteries, having some responsive materials that use things like graphene sheets that are incorporated into a matrix, and then you add a safety functionality to a battery. We're trying to squeeze out almost all the functionality that we can. And as new nano materials are being discovered and there're new properties being discovered, a lot of the time that someone tries to think of a way to translate that into a battery.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","189":"Explainer: So do you have a basic sense of what latency is?\nExplainee: Yeah, so my understanding of what latency is, is its basically the time delay between the rendering at different points.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","190":"Explainer: Games that feel really good, they've got that sense of it happens instantly when you're doing something.\nExplainee: It really is a testament to this kind of technology and how its developing and how over time its gonna just be, you're gonna be able to pack more pixel density in those displays and its gonna get a lot more immersive.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","191":"Explainer: Yeah, any crazy idea you had now you could probably make a pretty good video game out of it. Which is a wonderful, wonderful thing.\nExplainee: Yeah, a lot of freedom.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","192":"Explainer: That's a really good question. It's actually a way that we can trade. Do you know what trade is?\nExplainee: Mmm-hmm, it's when you take turns doing something. It's when you give up most of what you want, right?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","193":"Explainer: Yeah.\nExplainee: If I could trade with any kid, I would trade, well, I would trade something I don't like so much.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","194":"Explainer: Have you ever heard of machine learning before?\nExplainee: I'm going to assume that it means humans being able to teach machines or robots how to learn themselves?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","195":"Explainer: All right. So why do you think Spotify might've recommended that song?\nExplainee: Well, I know that in Melanie Martinez's music, she used a lot of the filtered voice to make it sound very deep and low and that song had that.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","196":"Explainer: It's a great question. The machine can understand whatever we tell it to understand. So there might be a person thinking about things, like the pitch or the pacing or the tone, or sometimes machines can figure out things about music or images or videos that we don't tell it to discover, but that it can learn from looking at a lot of different examples. Why do you think companies might use machine learning?\nExplainee: Well, I think things like Facebook or Instagram, they probably use it to target ads.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","197":"Explainer: What is a laser made out of? Well really it's sort of the same thing as a light bulb. Right?\nExplainee: So it's a beam?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","198":"Explainer: So yeah it's a light bulb and there's a couple of mirrors. Now the light bulb has to be a little bit special. It has to be a type of material that can store the energy in an excited state right? It has to stay up there really energetic and sit there for a while so that when the light comes along, it takes that energy and becomes stronger light and then the mirror sends it back and it does it again and again and again and between these two mirrors, it makes the light come out in a nice beam. In a laser, it comes out as a single color. They all come out with their waves at the same time. Every wave peaks at the same time which then makes it a giant wave and it's this giant wave that has a tremendous amount of power. So it can do something like cutting steel. But when you cut steel, or if you were cutting this floor, it's gray, it actually will absorb the light. That's why the light, you don't see it because the light isn't bouncing back or through it. So I like to use demos to explain how my laser works. So I've brought basically a hammer and a nail. I'm sure you've probably hammered a nail before into a piece of wood but the question is, if you asked yourself why it is we hit the big end and it's the tiny end that we put on the piece of wood. We could never pick up a hammer and hit the sharp end and hope this would go in to the piece of wood.\nExplainee: Because it needs to be centered so it can more easily just go in.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","199":"Explainer: Well it depends. So if you're cutting steel, you need to have the nail. You need to have it concentrated all of the light, not going in all directions but you need it into as small a point as possible. And for that we use a lens. For a lens, the light's coming down as a column, you put in a lens, it all focuses it down in the same way as the nail and then it starts cutting that steel. Okay so that force per unit area--\nExplainee: So it's kind of like a magnifying glass? Like it magnifies the light down to a point?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","200":"Explainer: Exactly. You know sometimes you want to have all of your energy not just in a small area but in the small volume and so one of the other dimensions is time or length. But with light, time and length are the same thing because light always travels at the speed of light.\nExplainee: Exactly.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","201":"Explainer: Exactly. And so now, if we have light like that that we wanna machine with. I bring this funnel and so, if we had a lens here and the light was coming down--\nExplainee: It funnels into--\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","202":"Explainer: So you ready?\nExplainee: Yep.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","203":"Explainer: Okay. We're going to start with a model that every Japanese person learns in kindergarten, it's called a crane, traditional origami design, it's over 400 years old. So, people have been doing what we're about to do for 400 years.\nExplainee: Wow.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","204":"Explainer: It's called a petal fold, it's a part of a lot of origami designs and it's key to the crane. Now we're ready for the magic. We're going to hold it in between thumb and forefinger, reach inside, grab the skinny point that's between the two layers, which are the wings, and I'm going to slide it out so it pokes out at an angle. We'll take the two wings, we spread them out to the side and you have made your first origami crane.\nExplainee: Wow.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","205":"Explainer: Now, this is a traditional Japanese design but there are origami designs that have been around so long we're not entirely sure where they originated. We're going to learn how to fold a cootie catcher.\nExplainee: Okay, good.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","206":"Explainer: because it suddenly changes shape.\nExplainee: I have seen these before, my friends use these.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","207":"Explainer: Yeah, but there's something else we can do with this model. If we set it down and push on the middle then pop it inside out so that three flaps come up and one stays down and then it's called talking crow because here's a little crow's beak and mouth.\nExplainee: Wow.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","208":"Explainer: Six five?\nExplainee: And then switch it.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","209":"Explainer: All right, we'll switch this. And now to your point, we don't need to bother with the ones that already bubbled their way up. Now we are a hundred percent sure it's sorted.\nExplainee: Yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","210":"Explainer: So you're saying gravity pulls things down, yet we've launched things into space. Do you ever wonder how we do that?\nExplainee: Isn't it like a slingshot, like if you pull something back enough it'll go in the opposite direction?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","211":"Explainer: In a weird way, that is gravity pulling it. So have you ever had a yo-yo where you swing it around like this? The string is pulling it in at all times, but you've also given it this angular momentum. And as long as you give it the angular momentum, pulling it in actually keeps it in orbit. And so the Earth is pulling it in at all times, so that's why it doesn't just travel off in a straight line. It keeps coming back around. So it's funny, people think that the International Space Station is so far away that they're not feeling gravity, and that's not the case at all. They're absolutely feeling gravity. They're just cruising so fast that, even though they're being pulled in, they never get pulled to the surface.\nExplainee: It's like that ride at the rollercoasters where you go in and it's spins super fast and you can't feel it spinning fast but--\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","212":"Explainer: Yeah. You ever had that experience where you're sitting in a train and the other one moves and for a second you're not sure if you're the one moving?\nExplainee: Yeah, 'cause I go on the train every day to go to school, but I never feel like I'm moving when I'm in the train, and then I'm like, wait, what?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","213":"Explainer: That's because in some sense, you're really not. Imagine you're in this train and it's going near the speed of light relative to the platform, but it's so smooth, then you should be in a situation in which there's no meaning to your absolute motion, there's no absolute motion. So that if you throw a ball up, you might think from the outside of the platform, be confused that when gravity pulls that back down, it's gonna hit you or something, but it'll land in your palm as surely as if you were in your living room.\nExplainee: Isn't that kinda crazy? Amazing.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","214":"Explainer: So let me tell you where it gets really crazy.\nExplainee: [Maria laughs]\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","215":"Explainer: And so when you think about extra dimensions, you put them together with brains and different fields wrapping around the extra dimensions and so forth, right?\nExplainee: Yes.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","216":"Explainer: The thing I want to talk about is this paper I wrote with Matt Johnson and Lisa Randall where we realize there's another way to compactify extra dimensions spontaneously, dynamically. If you imagine starting with this big piece of paper you couldn't wrap up everything, but within some region of space you could make a tube.\nExplainee: Okay.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","217":"Explainer: Why don't you explain to us what a black brane is?\nExplainee: Well in some ways, it's very much like a black hole in that you have far away from it you have these large just flat dimensions. As you move in, there's something in the interior. It has, itself, higher dimensions, and so because physicists love to joke they thought, well it's like a membrane but it can have many different dimensions. Let's use P to stand in for those number of dimensions, and so they called them P-branes.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","218":"Explainer: Right. Imagine that rather than going down to a point, it just asymptotes to some fixed radius that continues infinitely far down there. But then you can ask, okay what about the rest of the universe? You have some sphere, some two dimensions compactified, and the balance between the cosmological constant and the electromagnetic field keeps it at a fixed distance.\nExplainee: Right. Good, good.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","219":"Explainer: I know not everyone buys that, right?\nExplainee: Not everyone buys it. There's a big discussion in the literature right now.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","220":"Explainer: If the viewers wanted to know more about how spacetime can emerge from quantum mechanics, they could read the graphic novel you just wrote.\nExplainee: Right, yes. I wrote and drew a graphic novel called The Dialogues: Conversations About the Nature of Universe.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","221":"Explainer: Yeah.\nExplainee: No, I don't think so.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","222":"Explainer: Yeah.\nExplainee: I'm understanding more so that it's these, a mapping of the circuitry, the pathways between neurons that can lead to evidence of patterns in your brain that are common between different people.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","223":"Explainer: How long have you been playing chess?\nExplainee: I played a little bit of chess growing up against my brothers, but ever since the Queen's Gambit show came out, that's I think when I downloaded the app and started playing against friends for fun.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","224":"Explainer: So I'm going to look up your account. We're gonna pick a game and we're gonna analyze it.\nExplainee: Sounds good.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","225":"Explainer: Yes, you definitely want to get the the bishop out, but you don't wanna move it just yet. So how do you do that?\nExplainee: I am not sure.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","226":"Explainer: One thing to always monitor in every chess middle game is does my opponent have a pawn break? Can my opponent strike somewhere with a pawn that would open up the board? If you have a low risk position, your position's just nice and comfortably better, you don't want chaos.\nExplainee: guess maybe they would try to advance their middle pawn.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","227":"Explainer: Yes. Yes. And this move is actually very annoying for white because not only am I now targeting things in your center, what else have I changed just by moving this pawn?\nExplainee: Now there bishop is activated.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","228":"Explainer: Yes. Another thing for middle game. So we just keep adding to that bucket of knowledge. Pawn breaks for the opponent, and then, every time something moves, like a pawn, we have to look around. What else is now opening up? And we wanna get to a situation where you knew this move was gonna happen, and the next I'm gonna come here, and then now what can I do? I can bring both my rooks, and now I have no problems, right? Now I have both knights, queen, rooks. So we need to get to a point where we see that coming, and we're not just focusing on our own plans, but that's not always easy. So with a pawn here, that disrupts my plan, right? Because now this move fails to-\nExplainee: Yeah, respond to the skewer.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","229":"Explainer: Yep, here, yeah, and what else? What else did that move open up?\nExplainee: It opened up the E file for us.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","230":"Explainer: Harmony is about injecting melody with emotion so that ultimately, you leave home and you return home and you've learned something along the way.\nExplainee: Yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","231":"Explainer: Yeah, I like that, yeah.\nExplainee: Yeah, yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","232":"Explainer: Do you know what gravity is?\nExplainee: It's something that, so, right now, we would be floating if there was no gravity, but since there's gravity we're sitting right down on these chairs.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","233":"Explainer: That's pretty good. So gravity wants to attract us to the Earth, and the Earth to us. But the Earth is so much bigger that even though we're actually pulling the Earth a little bit to us, you don't notice it so much. You know, the Moon pulls on the Earth a little bit.\nExplainee: Mm-hmm, just like the ocean tides.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","234":"Explainer: [Janna] Exactly, the Moon is such a big body compared to anything else very nearby that it has the larger effect, pulling the water of the Earth. But more than the Moon, think about the Sun pulling on the Earth. We orbit the whole Sun, just the way the Earth pulls on the Moon and causes the Moon to orbit us. All of those things are acting on you and me right now.\nExplainee: If gravity was too strong, would we be able to get up?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","235":"Explainer: Yes.\nExplainee: [Bonet screams] Ooh.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","236":"Explainer: They say that astronauts in space, definitely their spine elongates. There were two twin astronauts, one who stayed here on Earth and the other who went to the International Space Station. He was there for a long time, and when he came back, he was actually taller than his twin brother.\nExplainee: Wow.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","237":"Explainer: And a heavy object.\nExplainee: Oh my God. [Janna laughs]\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","238":"Explainer: What are they asking you about fusion?\nExplainee: So usually people ask me like, do you think that we'll ever really replace all of our other energy sources with fusion?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","239":"Explainer: They exist in space, at the event horizon of a black hole, in the solar wind, in our sun, or very rapid events, like lightning is also sort of a very weakly ionized plasma. Even among plasmas there are so many different kinds of plasmas. There are low temperature, higher density plasmas. There are of course the astrophysical plasmas, and space plasmas, and then there are fusion plasmas. They are predominantly fully ionized plasmas. They are also plasmas where we have a certain ability to basically kick up micro-instabilities.\nExplainee: Okay.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","240":"Explainer: I mean if people talk about simulating that system and following those particles, it's probably gonna take millions and millions of years on even the fastest supercomputer.\nExplainee: Uh-huh.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","241":"Explainer: So we average that out, we do a gyro average, because the motion is typically called a gyro frequency. That's how fast it goes around the field line.\nExplainee: Right.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","242":"Explainer: Great.\nExplainee: I'm biased because I study one of the other sub-critical parts of the brain, the cerebellum.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","243":"Explainer: So that's good, because that's why you're here, and so we're talking about sleep today, and really about kind of what is the brain machinery through which we go through consciousness to unconsciousness and that transition.\nExplainee: Great.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","244":"Explainer: You haven't got to play with lasers. So I brought one. It's my friend's cat toy. Do you ever use a laser as a cat toy?\nExplainee: No.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","245":"Explainer: Well one of the fun things people do with lasers, the cat will try to grab that dot. I'm sure what you have at home is a flashlight. I brought a cute little one. So the question is, do you see any difference between what a flashlight does and what a laser does?\nExplainee: Flashlight is a bigger shine and the laser is just a dot.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","246":"Explainer: [Donna] And yet it's not. Isn't that amazing?\nExplainee: Yes.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","247":"Explainer: One of the things that lasers are great for is that because it's a directed beam, we can actually put that light where we want the light to go and sometimes you maybe just want to see something around the corner and you can't see it. But with a laser, you can actually and this is a smoky one so you can actually watch it go. You see it actually bending the corner?\nExplainee: Yes.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","248":"Explainer: So this obviously is much bigger than our hair. Right?\nExplainee: Yes.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","249":"Explainer: Have you ever seen that maybe there's a little bit of a red light when you do that?\nExplainee: Yes.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","250":"Explainer: A lot of origami is animals, birds and things. There's also a branch of origami that is, it's more abstract or geometric, called tessellations. Tessellations, like most origami, are folded from a single sheet of paper but they make patterns, whether it's woven patterns like that, or woven patterns like this. If you hold them up to the light you can see patterns.\nExplainee: Wow.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","251":"Explainer: The thing that makes them cool is they're sort of like tilings, it looks like you could put this together by cutting little pieces of paper and sliding them together, but they're still one sheet.\nExplainee: They weren't cut?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","252":"Explainer: Mm-hmm. Each of these folds is peaked like a mountain and we call these mountain folds but if I made it the other way, then it's shaped this way and we call it a valley fold. In all of origami there's just mountains and valleys.\nExplainee: So all the folds are reversible?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","253":"Explainer: So they're all reversible and it turns out that in every origami shape that folds flat, it's going to be either three mountains and a valley or, if we're looking at the backside, three valleys and a mountain, they always differ by two.\nExplainee: Oh.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","254":"Explainer: That's a rule of all flat origami no matter how many folds come together at a point and I'm going to show you a building block of tessellations, it's called a twist because that center square, as I unfold it, it twists, it rotates.\nExplainee: Twists?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","255":"Explainer: Do you know what machine learning means? Have you heard that before?\nExplainee: No.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","256":"Explainer: And what makes a dog, a dog and a cat, a cat?\nExplainee: Well, dogs are very playful, I think, more than cats. Cats lick themselves more than dogs, I think.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","257":"Explainer: What about this one?\nExplainee: A dog. A cat. I think, a cat? Because it's more skinny. And also, its legs are like really tall and its ears are a little pointy.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","258":"Explainer: And how did you know that it's not a cat or a dog?\nExplainee: Because cats and dogs... Because they walk on their paws and their ears are like right here, not right here, and they don't wear watches.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","259":"Explainer: Which means that in the test, you're not seeing any problems that you don't know how to solve. As long as you did all your practice, right?\nExplainee: Yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","260":"Explainer: That's amazing. What made you decide to trade on eBay?\nExplainee: Well, I mean, I've heard of it, and I trust it a lot because they have all of their guarantees, so I know that I'm gonna get money and the person's gonna get what they want.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","261":"Explainer: We have a lot of companies that sort of help us make sure that our trades happen, but if we could guarantee the same trade using technology as sort of a technological trust, then we wouldn't really need all those middlemen in between.\nExplainee: So how does it work?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","262":"Explainer: [Bettina] Exactly.\nExplainee: That's cool.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","263":"Explainer: So do you know what virtual reality is?\nExplainee: Yes, its simple. Its like a video game except it feels like you're in the video game.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","264":"Explainer: That's actually a really good description. The idea is that if you've got a system here that can make you see whatever we want you to see, then we can make you believe that you're anywhere else, like on top of a mountain, or in a dungeon or under the ocean.\nExplainee: Or in Minecraft.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","265":"Explainer: Yeah, or in Minecraft. When you look at a TV on the wall there showing like a picture of a mountain or something, how can you tell that its not just a window and there's something else behind it. Because it always doesn't look quite right if you have a static picture of a person on a screen and you move around like this, its not really changing. And its interesting, those are things we have to figure out We need to figure out when you look at something in reality how can you tell whether its real or not. Have you been to a 3-D movie where you put on the little glasses?\nExplainee: Yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","266":"Explainer: We're gonna talk about blockchain technology. Have you heard of blockchain?\nExplainee: I've heard of the words blockchain, but I'm not sure I know what it is.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","267":"Explainer: And so it's being run by all of these different computers that have like a node. So they're all running the same software and guaranteeing your transactions as they happen.\nExplainee: I mean, I would assume this technology is taking away business or activity from these middlemen.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","268":"Explainer: That's a corner, four corners of the square, four points. How would you make one point out of this sheet of paper?\nExplainee: I'm thinking of, like, a paper airplane.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","269":"Explainer: Yeah, exactly. Actually you've discovered something pretty neat because you made your point not from a corner so you've already discovered one of the key insights. Any flap, any point, leg of the ant, takes up a circular region of paper. Here's our boundary. To make your point from an edge you use that much paper and the shape, it's almost a circle. If we take the crane we'll see if the circles are visible in the crane pattern. Here's the crane pattern, and here's a boundary of the wing, and here's the other wing.\nExplainee: Okay.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","270":"Explainer: The crane has four circles but, actually, there's a little bit of a surprise because what about this? There's a fifth circle, which is like that, but does the crane have a fifth flap in it? Let's refold it and put the wings up. Well, yes, there is, there's another point and that point is the fifth circle of our crane.\nExplainee: Okay.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","271":"Explainer: You've got it, so you are ready to design origami.\nExplainee: Awesome.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","272":"Explainer: Can I explain a couple of them to you?\nExplainee: Yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","273":"Explainer: So, inside of every computer is some kind of brain and the technical term for that is CPU, or central processing unit. And those are the pieces of hardware that know how to respond to those instructions. Like moving up or down, or left or right, knows how to do math like addition and subtraction. And then there's at least one other type of hardware inside of a computer called memory or RAM, if you've heard of this?\nExplainee: I know of memory because you have to memorize stuff.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","274":"Explainer: Let me get some supplies from the cupboard here. So, should we make an algorithm together?\nExplainee: Yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","275":"Explainer: Okay, here we go. What would the next step be here?\nExplainee: Clean all this mess up.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","276":"Explainer: Exactly.\nExplainee: So, like if you type in just Google, then you won't find the answer to your question.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","277":"Explainer: Good to see you again, Yue.\nExplainee: Yes, good to see you.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","278":"Explainer: So how strong is the link?\nExplainee: Our study has found really strong associations looking at these populations, for example, with sleep apnea. We've done one meta-analysis and it's showed that those with sleep apnea, they have a ratio of 1.26, which means that those who have sleep apnea have 26% elevated risk of developing Alzheimer's compared to those without sleep apnea.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","279":"Explainer: Essentially what harmony is, is like a language, right? And so as with any language, the more words you're capable of speaking in a language, the more you can say. All right, so in harmony, this might be how many notes you can think to add to a chord to make it feel a different way. Have you ever heard of the circle of fifths?\nExplainee: Mm-hmm.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","280":"Explainer: Yeah.\nExplainee: And then G.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","281":"Explainer: Nice, okay cool. Lets try one more version where we add some colors. Alright so lets visit the B flat, with a bit more imagination.\nExplainee: Yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","282":"Explainer: Would you say black has more initiative? Not yet.\nExplainee: Not yet, but considering the way I said it, it's like you follow up with something. So you just attacked me with that, and I move back. So you kind of, you have the initiative.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","283":"Explainer: I really feel like this is a nice example of black has an initiative.\nExplainee: Yeah, black definitely has an initiative.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","284":"Explainer: You wanna end the game right now?\nExplainee: Yeah. Okay, let's see. What can I do? Okay, I'll do that. Okay, try and roll up the sleeves, okay.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","285":"Explainer: Connectome.\nExplainee: To be honest, I have no idea.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","286":"Explainer: In one brain, in your brain. Could I take all of that information and put it inside a computer? Would that computer then be you?\nExplainee: Computers they don't have feelings, they won't have feelings and I think that's one thing that makes the human race strong.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","287":"Explainer: So tell me, what do you know about black holes?\nExplainee: Well, I know they're created when stars, once they start growing, it doesn't, it can't expand anymore, so they collapse inward.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","288":"Explainer: I'm sure you've heard about extra dimensions a little bit.\nExplainee: I've heard it, yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","289":"Explainer: It's a, yeah.\nExplainee: [Bela] Or how does that work?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","290":"Explainer: Why in the world would you think that there are extra dimensions, right? So you've heard of string theory?\nExplainee: I have. So string theory is basically a theory of quantum gravity.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","291":"Explainer: Mm-hmm. So we have quantum mechanics, right? The theory of atoms and so forth and how those work, and then we have gravity, and gravity doesn't seem to fit in. It's the one force of nature that we can't really easily fit into this quantum mechanical framework, so string theory is one of the best ideas.\nExplainee: Right.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","292":"Explainer: [Sean] Do you know where it comes from?\nExplainee: No.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","293":"Explainer: From membranes, you know. We have lines, one dimension. We have two dimensional surfaces. So if you have a line that is a vibrating physical thing, you call it a string, right?\nExplainee: Right.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","294":"Explainer: Yes, string theory's even better. So the phrase Grand Unified Theory was coined in the 1970s for theories that joined electricity and magnetism. So a good string theory is gravity plus the Grand Unified Theory.\nExplainee: Okay.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","295":"Explainer: It's even better. It's the theory of everything. What would you tell a friend of yours if they asked you what dimensions are, what extra dimensions are, what a brane is?\nExplainee: So we have three spatial dimensions. A brane is sort of the next level. So a brane is a higher dimensional object that vibrates through space.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","296":"Explainer: being something that you can already predict. Right.\nExplainee: Mm-hmm.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","297":"Explainer: Right.\nExplainee: So that data then immediately imply, a knowledge. But people can't, sometimes.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","298":"Explainer: Yeah. This concept of zero-knowledge programs would allow you to carry out completely arbitrary computations\nExplainee: Mm-hmm.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","299":"Explainer: What is your impression of what a black hole is?\nExplainee: I'm a senior at NYU. I'm studying physics and environmental studies.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","300":"Explainer: And so you can't actually measure the length.\nExplainee: Yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","301":"Explainer: I think I agree with you, but I think to really validate our scientific experiment, we should probably compare the length of the string. A lot of extra slack in that pig of string. So what we noticed with great Britain is we were never able to measure it's length. It just kept getting longer and longer. This is called the coastline paradox where there's not really one definite number you can assign to the length of the coastline, but it depends on how you measure it. Like if we kept going to really get this to be accurate, we might have to like actually go down the beach and start measuring these tiny little details along the coastline. But really there's so much detail. We would probably never get a definite answer for how long the coastline is. Fractals also give us a really nice language. We're talking about how smooth or rough some kind of shape is. And actually a lot of people, engineers and scientists use this idea of fractals and this language of fractals to compare different shapes, not in terms of their size, but in terms of their roughness. So based on everything we talked about today, how would you describe a fractal to somebody in your own words?\nExplainee: It's a shape, that you can't describe as a shape.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","302":"Explainer: is it some sort of conjecture circuit that is a really good guess there's parts of that that are definitely about conducting this is the inside of a quantum computer\nExplainee: Oh wow.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","303":"Explainer: okay so how do noise-canceling headphones work \nExplainee: Not much.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","304":"Explainer: So on your trip what was the funnest day ever?\nExplainee: There was this pool, I love pools. And then there's a slide you go down and there's pool noodles in there too. And then there's a little tiny sandbox.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","305":"Explainer: Do you remember from that day what color towel you used when you got out of the pool?\nExplainee: I think the one I used was a dark blue or a light blue or, or like sort of a teal.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","306":"Explainer: When you were telling me about the sandbox, it felt like you didn't have to make that guess, that you could just see the sandbox in your eyes. I asked you about the towel. It doesn't come to mind immediately, but you can stop and think about it and kind of make a good guess because there are things you know about the world. And for those of us who study memory that's a really strong hint as to how memory works. And so for you your memory kept all the fun stuff and all the stuff that was important to you, but the details like did you have to have a ticket to get in or how you got there, all these other less interesting, less exciting aspects, your brain kind of decided letting go of all that information.\nExplainee: I think as you get older you start forgetting things more because you have to make space for new things, which is why you forget stuff.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","307":"Explainer: The hippocampus is a part of your brain that if you kind of took it out and looked at it, it looks a lot like a seahorse and it plays a really important role in creating those kinds of memories that help you two years after your vacation share with me what happened that day, all these details of that day. There's another part of the brain. It's actually also important for memory and it's called the amygdala and it is important for keeping all the kind of emotional processing going for memory. So memory for things that are really scary, it's gonna talk to the hippocampus now and get that memory to be really strong. Why do you think it might be important to remember scary things?\nExplainee: Let's say you, you accidentally cut yourself. Then your brain makes a note and says don't get too close to sharp things, or you're going to cut yourself again.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","308":"Explainer: I'll admit. I have absolutely no idea. Do you think it's a finite number or an infinite number?\nExplainee: Finite because I can see them all in here.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","309":"Explainer: So let's try and imagine infinitely many jars. Would they fit in this room?\nExplainee: No.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","310":"Explainer: That's a wonderful question, a very rich question. What do you think?\nExplainee: I think maybe because you said it was unlimited.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","311":"Explainer: me too\nExplainee: Yeah, always when I'm trying to take a photo.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","312":"Explainer: have you ever heard of the word quantum \nExplainee: No.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","313":"Explainer: while it's spinning\nExplainee: That's crazy.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","314":"Explainee: Yeah, I mean I'm definitely gonna impress all my friends when I tell them about this, they're gonna be like, quantum what?\nExplainer: your hair is tangled or whatever you can you can untangle it right\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","315":"Explainer: but in the quantum world when we entangle things they're really now connected it's much much harder to separate them again so using the same analogy we spin our pennies and eventually eventually they both stop right and when they stop it's either heads or tails right so in my case i got tails and you got heads you see how they're totally disconnected from each other right our pennies in the real world now if our pennies were entangled and we both spun them together right when we stopped them if you measured your penny to be ahead i would measure my penny to be ahead and if you measured your penny to be a tails i would measure my opinion to be a tails if we measured it at exactly the same time we would still find that they were both exactly correlated \nExplainer: that's so cool right \nExplainer: {missing part}\n","316":"Explainer: I wanted to ask you if you have ever heard of a black hole?\nExplainee: Jude.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","317":"Explainer: Here, let me show you something. I can ask how heavy it is.\nExplainee: It's not weight, but it's how much of it is in it.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","318":"Explainer: I can also ask how big it is, which is a question about its volume. If I make it smaller, then what's happening is it's becoming more dense. So imagine I crushed this really, really small. It would weigh the same, it would have the same mass, but it would be much more dense.\nExplainee: Yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","319":"Explainer: If a star is heavy enough to explode into supernova what's left begins to collapse under its own weight. And if that's heavy enough, the core will not be able to stop collapsing, 'cause it no longer has the thermonuclear fuel, it's run outta fuel. And if it's run outta fuel, it's no longer shining and pushing outward. And without that it itself begins to go dark and there's nothing fighting the collapse anymore. And that's when you form a black hole.\nExplainee: How does it go that small?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","320":"Explainer: Well, that's a really good question. So interestingly, the sun itself isn't heavy enough. So it has to be heavy enough that when it begins to collapse, it just overcomes all attempts to fight it. If you made something really dense, you would have to travel faster than the speed of light to actually escape. That's 300,000 kilometers per second.\nExplainee: So if like the sun all collapsed on itself, it would form a black hole?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","321":"Explainer: So it goes so fast that it goes completely dark. Any light that veers too close will fall in, will not be able to make it back out again. If a light is shining from the sun near a black hole, the black hole's not touching it. Why does the light get pulled in? Why does that happen?\nExplainee: So it goes so fast that there's it's all dark?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","322":"Explainer: It is taking other stuff, but the funny question was like, if I wanted to move your chair, you'd think it was really strange if I didn't have to come near you and actually grab the chair and move it. One of the things Einstein thought about is he imagined that what the black hole is doing is it's changing the shape of space around it. What do you think of that idea?\nExplainee: Because the black hole is taking other stuff?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","323":"Explainer: yeah do you know what your computer thinks that is\nExplainee: An A\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","324":"Explainer: So sensing is really just about measuring stuff.\nExplainee: Okay.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","325":"Explainer: Start to see the different cells\nExplainee: Yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","326":"Explainer: In a diamond and people actually now make nano diamonds that they can try to put inside the human body to look at the chemistry inside the cells.\nExplainee: So is that used for drug trials and when testing out new treatments?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","327":"Explainer: Something that explains what's hard and what's easy for a robot. Something like stacking these two cups. Do you think that's easy or hard?\nExplainee: If it's this way, then it's easy, but if it's this way, you need to balance it or, oh-\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","328":"Explainer: And then program the robot to move over here and open the- \nExplainee: And drop it.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","329":"Explainer: When we gave it instructions, did we tell it to look at where the cup was? Or did we tell it to just move over here?\nExplainee: We told it to just move over here.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","330":"Explainer: So it's because the nitrogen-vacancy center is a single defect. So you can actually see a single electron. In normal magnetic resonance, you don't have the sensitivity.\nExplainee: In order to be sensitive to like a single electron, do you have to be really close to it?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","331":"Explainer: I think as you said, you know, anything that interferes with my signal is noise, but it can come from different sources. In some ways, the operation of the quantum system itself, as it's sensitive to different physical phenomena, the ones that I don't like, I call noise. The ones I do like, I call signal and that's an artificial definition that I'm making when I choose to build a sensor. One of the challenges we have is, we're trying to figure out if I wanna control it, where is it coming from? I remember we had experiments running in our lab one day and we were running these experiments about 100 megahertz. All of a sudden, we saw these big spikes coming in and we realized we're picking up the local FM stations.\nExplainee: Oh, yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","332":"Explainer: And that was a source of noise, like, it's completely random, but it is still there. And then the other form is very much what is intrinsically within your experiment itself because some of the materials that you have have defects that are coupling into your sensor, into your quantum system and are also producing noise.\nExplainee: But yeah, the interesting stuff really is where you're picking up the quantum noise intrinsically from whatever.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","333":"Explainer: I wanted to ask you a little bit about what you know about the history of the internet. Have you heard of ARPANET, for example?\nExplainee: I have not heard of ARPANET.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","334":"Explainer: Okay, back into the 1960s, there was a research agency in the United States called DARPA, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency. Actually, it was called ARPA at the time. They wanted to build this notion of a packet-switching network. Not a circuit switch network like a phone network where you get a dedicated path and a dedicated set of bandwidth and links from source to destination.\nExplainee: So what would packet switching enable? I'm sure there's something big here, for sure.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","335":"Explainer: There's a lot big, right? And so remember, this was a Department of Defense, was they wanted to have forms of of communication that were very robust, that were survivable. Packets could all find their own ways, be routed differently through the network. So if parts of the network failed, you could route around failures.\nExplainee: Sounds like the reason for like a request response type of structure.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","336":"Explainer: So you can sort of see how the network architecture that wasn't designed to be 100% reliable inside the core of the network, and had that complexity built into the edges of the network. And to me, the really cool thing is you put this infrastructure in place, and then all these super creative people think about amazing things to build on top of it. And you see this proliferation of amazing applications.\nExplainee: Abstraction, I think it's the reason why everything.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","337":"Explainer: Okay. What does that mean?\nExplainee: No one authority holds control over any sort of decisions or destinations.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","338":"Explainer: Where do they get dropped, do you think?\nExplainee: Somewhere in their travel process.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","339":"Explainer: And why three?\nExplainee: I would also say three.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","340":"Explainer: And if I cut that box in half again, how many boxes do I need to cover the line.\nExplainee: two\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","341":"Explainer: And so what this box counting is getting at is saying, well, I still can never decide what the length of the coastline is, but what I can do is I can see how quick does the number of boxes grow relative to how it would grow just for an ordinary one dimensional curve, like a line or a circle.\nExplainee: Yeah, I've, I've heard about that. Where if you, if you change the amount of measurement for a coastline, you can actually change like how much of the coast that, that there is like if you measure in mile lengths, you're gonna get a much different estimate than if you measure in one inch increments.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","342":"Explainer: It can be generative for sure.\nExplainee: It's definitely a really interesting thing to try to talk to students about.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","343":"Explainer: So what are you studying these days?\nExplainee: Well, I'm preparing my dissertation. The general topic is going to be how we perceive different types of social stimuli, like different people's faces and make judgements about them and how the way that we report on what we are experiencing tells us about what's actually going on inside our heads.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","344":"Explainer: What I love about what you were describing is like you didn't use the word memory, were how you were talking about kind of perceptions and social judgments but I think probably we'd both agree that memory is a big part of that.\nExplainee: Oh of course.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","345":"Explainer: Some of those examples really remind me also some of the questions about kind of abnormalities in, in memory or trauma or disruptions in memory and how they also play out in terms of not just what people remember but what they do with those memories right?\nExplainee: As far as the way that my research plays into it is like the first step in making a judgment about what to do based on an experience we're calling from memory is deciding what your emotional response was.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","346":"Explainer: What happens in Minecraft if you get really, really close to a shape?\nExplainee: Well, it just looks like a block.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","347":"Explainer: So subdivision surface is a way of describing a smooth shape on a computer rather than some complicated fractal shape. So meshes and computer graphics are usually made of these flat polygons with kind of sharp edges. And so the question is how can I get something nice and round and smooth out of these sharp looking polygons? What I can do is I can start cutting one at a time, the corners of this paper off, it still looks very angular. I still have these really sharp points.\nExplainee: Right why are we doing this?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","348":"Explainer: Because I want to draw a smooth curve on the screen, but all my computer can do is draw straight lines. And that's actually too true of GPUs. It's kind of interesting. GPUs are basically really fast machines that can only draw one thing and that's a flat triangle. And so if we keep doing this with our paper, you kind of get pretty quickly the idea of what's gonna happen. So when you go to see a Pixar movie, for instance, every surface has been subdivided down. So you have tiny little triangles called micro polygons that are even smaller than the size of a pixel.\nExplainee: How long does this process take?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","349":"Explainer: So you're a student in high school, is that right?\nExplainee: Yes, I'm a sophomore.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","350":"Explainer: Well, we're gonna be talking about computers here today, and we're gonna be talking about the internet. I always like to think of the internet by analogy to say road systems for example, where you have roads in your neighborhood. You have state roads, you have the Interstate Highway System. And so the internet is a lot like that. It's an interconnection of local roads, local networks like the network in your house for example.\nExplainee: How does like all of the networks in my house connect to all the city networks?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","351":"Explainer: We could talk about that by analogy to a road system. It's not just one big, super highway. It's a lot of smaller super highways that are all interconnected. And those interchanges are what are called routers. That's where the links come together. You're talking about talking to a friend in Australia. So oh, it's coming in from the East Coast of the United States to this router, and it's going out say, that routers in San Francisco, it's going out on an underseas cable over to Australia rather than in this direction up to Japan.\nExplainee: So there is an underseas cable?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","352":"Explainer: The underseas cables are so cool! They're these big cables that are laid down by switches. They cross both the Atlantic, the Pacific, the Indian Ocean. So the undersea cables are how the networks in Europe, United States, Asia are all connected together.\nExplainee: How do you connect wirelessly?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","353":"Explainer: What are some of the challenges that you've run into when trying to work with robots and do these tasks?\nExplainee: So, I was really interested in the problem of scooping peas on a plate. They're relatively homogenous, but when it came to more complex foods, like broccoli, or deformable foods, like tofu, that can crumble, that gets a lot more complex to simulate.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","354":"Explainer: So great to see you, Michael. Thanks for coming.\nExplainee: It's my pleasure.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","355":"Explainer: Why do you think it's so hard to build these things into AI systems and robots?\nExplainee: I guess if you think about a quintessentially human task, like playing chess or solving arithmetic problem, things that other creatures just don't do, when you're a human being, you have to learn that in cultural time. And so there's a limited amount of data you have. But if you're talking about seeing the world interacting with the world, using your effectors properly, that's the combination of this massive amount of evolutionary time. When you look at that, it's like the 56 games of chess I played in chess club that doesn't look like a lot of training data. You work so hard to make a robot, do one particular thing or one class of task, and then seems like people must always come up to you and say, 'So, okay, but what about my other task? Okay. You can fold the sock or stack a cup. How about my dishes?' Is that frustrating? Is that a challenge? Is it interesting?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","356":"Explainer: I like that description, because it conveys how much complexity there is to these really basic tasks that we're doing. Is there a definition for the simple tasks that we do versus things that are more complex, like playing chess?\nExplainee: I guess I like to think about this hierarchical cascade, where, at first, vision starts with the sensory signal and parses it into gradually more complex units. I think it does make sense to talk about lower level, meaning closer to sensation and perception and action, and higher level meaning more deliberative, more mediated by memory and language and judgment.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","357":"Explainer: Cool. What do you think of when you hear the words quantum sensing?\nExplainee: I think that using some sort of quantum computing to sense some quantum level molecules or particles, like interactions and stuff, maybe.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","358":"Explainer: It would be the top tier.\nExplainee: What are you doing? Like, what are you studying?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","359":"Explainer: Which is a really nice platform because the spins show their quantum properties, even at room temperature.\nExplainee: So, are you studying the spins of the electrons?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","360":"Explainer: Right.\nExplainee: So how long does it take to make a sensor and to make that diamond? Is that created? Do you like, put energy into it or?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","361":"Explainer: So you can implant nitrogen into a diamond and then you bombard it with electrons to create the vacancies and then you heat it up and anneal it, and then you get these nitrogen-vacancy centers in your system. So you mentioned quantum computing earlier. So have you heard of the idea of superposition?\nExplainee: Mm-hmm, yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","362":"Explainer: It's more precise, Absolutely.\nExplainee: Okay. Is an atomic clock a quantum sensor?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","363":"Explainer: In some ways, it is and you know, atomic clocks are remarkable devices and being able to measure time that precisely has really important consequences. In fact, our old GPS system is based on the accuracy of atomic clocks. They're a set of satellites, each of which has an atomic clock on board and they send out a timestamp and so, once it gets a signal from three different satellites, it can triangulate and figure out exactly where you are. Now, if you could make those clocks even more precise, you could actually accurately position where you are even more accurately.\nExplainee: Okay, that's really cool.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","364":"Explainer: What's your name?\nExplainee: Namina.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","365":"Explainer: Mm-hmm.\nExplainee: Yeah, and touch.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","366":"Explainer: But with the magnifying glass, you'd only be able to see what's right near the surface, right? Just.\nExplainee: Yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","367":"Explainer: That's exactly the type of thing that we're doing. We are sensing, is we're trying to measure what's inside, and do it without destroying the ball.\nExplainee: Yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","368":"Explainer: You have not. Right. It's a way for a prover to convince a verifier that something is true without revealing anything about why it's true, which sounds totally bizarre. Right?\nExplainee: Yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","369":"Explainer: Suppose you wanted to exchange messages with someone that you knew.\nExplainee: Mm-hmm.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","370":"Explainer: It sounds impossible. Right?\nExplainee: It does.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","371":"Explainer: Does the Large Magellanic Cloud have a big black hole?\nExplainee: I'm a second year. So I'm measuring star formation histories in the Small and Large Magellanic Clouds.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","372":"Explainer: [Janna] Yeah.\nExplainee: We spend all of our time, when we learn about black holes in school, predominantly through star collapse.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","373":"Explainer: Yes, they're all friends.\nExplainee: Gravitationally, all friends.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","374":"Explainer: Yeah, and it's very possible that as you said, the collision won't be so severe that it'll be very disruptive. So our entire solar system could stay intact and here we would go with the sun and all the other planets in orbit around a new black hole.\nExplainee: Supermassive black hole.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","375":"Explainer: That's near and dear to my heart. Multi-party computations.\nExplainee: Obviously, zero-knowledge proofs are about proving things to another person without revealing the details of what it is that you're proving. But, you know, in my mind, zero-knowledge actually goes even further beyond that. It's like this overarching concept that you can see a lot in multi-party computation, where you wanna accomplish some sort of task without revealing anything more than exactly what you need to accomplish that task.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","376":"Explainer: Indeed.\nExplainee: But once you flip that on its head and you're no longer trying to do that, suddenly all of the bad properties of randomness become good.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","377":"Explainer: No doubt. And especially with cloud computing, exploiting the power of the cloud to enable zero-knowledge proofs, and to make use of zero-knowledge proofs, would be amazing.\nExplainee: Yeah. Absolutely.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","378":"Explainer: Have you ever heard of zero-knowledge proofs?\nExplainee: Only in passing.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","379":"Explainer: So actually, in the blockchain space is one of the spaces where we are seeing zero-knowledge proofs being implemented. And I think it's just the beginning. Let's talk about zero-knowledge proofs. At its core, a zero-knowledge proof is an interaction between two people. Then I should be able to convince you that some statement is true, but you won't have any idea why it's true.\nExplainee: Will I, like, understand that it's true because like, you know, the operations performed in the proof are like, of a certain, like, you know, they have like, certain attributes that would make them true?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","380":"Explainer: What you're basically asking is, wait, what? Right? Right. So this is what makes zero-knowledge proof so fascinating, and so counter-intuitive. And I think the best way I can explain it to you is by means of an example. But before we do that, I have to decide what I'm gonna prove to you in a, with a zero-knowledge proof.\nExplainee: Sounds good.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","381":"Explainer: All right. Sounds good. Right? Here we have green, right? And over here, we have blue. Okay. And as you can see, they're two different colors.\nExplainee: Mm-hmm.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","382":"Explainer: Right? So you have a little bit of confidence, right, that I have managed to color this correctly. but not that much confidence. 'Cause I've only shown you two of the countries.\nExplainee: Yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","383":"Explainer: Nice. And that's smart of you to check with the same one of the ones you already had. Right?\nExplainee: Mm-hmm.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","384":"Explainer: But as you'll see, now it's not green, it's blue. And this one on the other hand, is green. Okay. The colors I showed you last time, don't work with these new colors, right? This wouldn't have worked before.\nExplainee: Yeah, because of this one, right?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","385":"Explainer: Right.\nExplainee: And it's implementations?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","386":"Explainer: Does infinity come up in your mathematics that you're studying?\nExplainee: One place infinity comes up is in algebraic geometry. Normally we think okay, well if you have two lines like this, you'd keep drawing them, they intersect right here. But in projective space, two parallel lines will also intersect at the point at infinity. Infinity is like this perfect concept for what we can add to a space that allows lines to have this more uniform property. What's your research in?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","387":"Explainer: And a choice function does what exactly?\nExplainee: Yeah, that's a good question.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","388":"Explainer: So there are three well-known famous equivalent forms of the axiom of choice. The well ordering principle is the assumption, the axiom that any set can be well ordered, but there are lots of subsets of real numbers that do not have a minimal element. So that ordering is not a well ordering. So here's the key question. Do you believe the axiom of choice?\nExplainee: I do believe the axiom of choice.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","389":"Explainer: So there's certainly no stop to this procedure. But could you give a precise cardinality to that?\nExplainee: would be a set of all sets, right?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","390":"Explainer: Talk us through Hawking's initial revolution that led to a lot of these conversations about the information around black holes.\nExplainee: Hawking's big insight was that he had to apply both the rules of quantum mechanics and the rules of gravity to really understand how black holes behaved. But Hawking took a point of view where he brought quantum mechanics into the game. He really that if you took that into account, that it's actually not quite true that black holes are black, that actually things can escape from black holes.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","391":"Explainer: Now, to be clear, nobody disputes that black holes will quantum radiate, that Hawking radiation is a solid prediction. The black holes should in fact evaporate, that's not disputed, right?\nExplainee: That's right. It would be wonderful if we could have some experimental of evidence for this, if we could really build a black hole in the lab and test to see whether it behaves this way. But I think there is hope that we'll be able to detect some of these effects either indirectly, by looking at black holes out in the universe, or also maybe indirectly in the laboratory by looking at systems which aren't black holes, but which radiate in kind of similar ways.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","392":"Explainer: Have you heard of fractals before?\nExplainee: No, absolutely not.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","393":"Explainer: So somehow they have to explain to the computer what a tree looks like so that the computer can draw the tree for them.\nExplainee: Yes.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","394":"Explainer: So your tree is totally beautiful, but it took a long time to make, right. How would you feel if I said, now you have to make a thousand of those trees.\nExplainee: I'd be like, oh my that's a lot of work.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","395":"Explainer: On a computer if you wanna learn to draw fractals, then you might need to learn a little bit about programming. [Keenan] Programming. Yeah.\nExplainee:  Programming.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","396":"Explainer: That you don't want the complexity of managing them to go up linearly with that. You'd like it to still stay pretty flat as you start adding.\nExplainee: Right, exactly. I mean, the good thing about IoT devices is that they tend to transmit very, very small amounts of data.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","397":"Explainer: We're used to ethernet cables that can handle many hundreds of gigabits per second over a wired device. What are the typical data rates for IoT devices? I mean, not hundreds of gigabits.\nExplainee: No, I mean I would imagine upper bound, KB per second, lower bound, you could see bytes per second just on average. But I mean, say that you have a temperature sensor running off of your Arduino that's reporting the temperature in your house every minute. That's going to be far less than kilobytes per second on average.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","398":"Explainer: Do you think they'll share it?\nExplainee: Not without some persuasion, but I agree that these data have massive, massive research value. Something I'm interested in with my research is collaborating with people who manage these distributed sensor devices, and then taking advantage of those datasets and comparing them to, say you were interested in doing a research project on how daily rush hour traffic impacts the acoustic landscape of New York City. Figuring out, look, this street next to this school is causing visible ratings above what we mandate. And so there needs to be an intervention here.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","399":"Explainer: so steve tell me about your research and the work you've been doing in quantum computing\nExplainee: I'm a theoretical physicist. I started out in condensed matter theory, the theory that studies superconductors and magnets and I had to learn a new field of quantum optics and apply those ideas. One of the nice things about being a theorist Is you get to keep learning new things.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","400":"Explainer: one last myth i think we should bust steve quantum computers are on the verge of breaking into your bank account and breaking encryption and creative cryptography\nExplainee: (laughing) Right, in the next five years there'll be tremendous progress in the field but people really have to understand that we're either at the vacuum tube or transistor stage. We're trying to invent the integrated circuit and scale up. It's still very very very early in the development of the field.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","401":"Explainer: Typically you would think that things that are easy for humans, are also easy for robots and computers to do.\nExplainee: Right.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","402":"Explainer: And things that are hard for humans should also be hard for robots and humans to do. But it turns out that it's actually the opposite. I wanna try a little demo.\nExplainee: Okay.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","403":"Explainer: So I have a penny in my hand and I'd like you to pick it up with your right hand and put it into your left hand. So that was pretty easy, right?\nExplainee: Yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","404":"Explainer: We're gonna make this a little bit harder now. So, can you put these on? And we'll try to do the same thing again with your eyes closed. There you go. Let's try that one more time, and see if you can do any better. So close your eyes.\nExplainee: Oh, there we go.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","405":"Explainer: Yeah. So that you're able, with a bit more practice, you're able to figure it out. When it fell on the ground, how did you know to pick it up off the ground?\nExplainee: From the sound.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","406":"Explainer: Yeah. It's really unintuitive. In order to survive, we need to pick up objects and everything. Basically many, many, like billions of years of evolution actually created humans and the ability to manipulate objects like that. So, it actually turns out that things that are really basic for us are actually just really complex tasks in general.\nExplainee: So do robots know, like, they messed up? They know.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","407":"Explainer: That's a great question. So in reinforcement learning, the robot tries the task, and then it gets some sort of reinforcement, some sort of feedback. It's similar to how you might train a dog.\nExplainee: Yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","408":"Explainer: Yeah for sure.\nExplainee: Just because I was so excited, you know? So that the thing is that it took me maybe 30 minutes. A kid at home who's like 13 and 14 who just starts playing around with a simple computer program can make incredibly beautiful fractals.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","409":"Explainer: Yeah.\nExplainee: Yeah I actually actually remember the moment when I finally figured out how to make turbulence in computer graphics, I was working for this company, Maggi and Disney was working on a movie. I think it was weird science where they wanted to have a marble vase. And then about three in the morning, I was at a diner nearby and I was pouring the cream into the coffee and I was watching it and I started watching it swirl around. And I realized that what was happening was really simple that you had this line of cream and then it hits the cup and it folds and then the folds get caught up. And then that folds again. And it's a really simple process of folding within folding. And I just went to the computer and did that.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","410":"Explainer: Yeah.\nExplainee: And then you get it all.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","411":"Explainer: [Keenan] Right?\nExplainee: And when everybody understands scaling.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","412":"Explainer: Absolutely.\nExplainee: Well, it's also, it's not even possible to explore, to store an entire world in your computer.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","413":"Explainer: So- He made a lot of happy little trees.\nExplainee: I think in that case, it came down to the fact that Ken in particular had a mission to make accessible tools for people without sacrificing the power and the richness of making beautiful things.

So- \nExplainer: {missing part}\n","414":"Explainer: And on one hand memory is like a record of something that happened in the past that we can carry with us and we can like bring it back to mind. And on the other hand we need to be a little bit suspicious sometimes because we might get it wrong. In what world would that memory of the orange juice maybe be useful?\nExplainee: Let's say you grew up in a place that the orange juice is just meh, and then you go on vacation going somewhere and then it might change how you feel about orange juice.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","415":"Explainer: Sometimes, you know, memory is doing something much simpler but no less important for us, which is it's helping us figure out what's good and what's bad. And if we can remember what's good and what's bad from what we did in the past, that can help us make decisions about what to do next time. So Dylan, you may be surprised to learn this, but we asked your mom what some of your favorite candies are.

Multiplying infinities. And there's a sense in which it's very similar to the arithmetic that you learned about already. But it's also totally different. It has some very weird properties. Welcome to Hilbert's Hotel. Unlike an ordinary hotel, has accountably infinitely many rooms. Suppose a new guest shows up, you might think that the new guest could take the room that's all the way down at the end of the hall, all the way at infinity, except there isn't a room like that. The rooms each have a number, and even though there's infinitely many rooms, each room is only a finite distance away. So here's how we're gonna make room for the new guest. I'm gonna ask the guest in room one to move into room two, and then we're gonna ask the guest in room two to move into room three, and we'll continue this all the way along. It looks to me like there's space for the new guest. Where is it? \nExplainee: It'll be in room number one.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","426":"Explainer: Room number one. Exactly. I'm gonna use this symbol for infinity, but what we've just shown is that one, the one new guest plus infinity is equal to the same infinity. What happens if we had a second guest?\nExplainee: Would it be two plus infinity equals infinity?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","427":"Explainer: Absolutely. So now I'm gonna make this story a little more complex. That there's another Hilbert's Hotel down the street and they're having plumbing issues and we need to find room for them.\nExplainee: They can't live together?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","428":"Explainer: They can't live together. That would be a great solution. I don't know. I think these people don't really get along. So I need to somehow create infinitely many new rooms, but I can only ask each person in the hotel to move a finite distance away. So let's take the guest who is originally in room one and move them into room two. So that's creating one new space for us. And I'm gonna take the guest who was originally in room two and move them into room four. Are you starting to see a pattern here?\nExplainee: Yes. You're going up one each time?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","429":"Explainer: Yeah, I'm increasing by one more each time. So I'm doubling the room number in fact. So this is some of the strange arithmetic of infinity. So we have two Hilbert Hotels, each of which have infinitely many guests, then this is equal to?\nExplainee: Infinity.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","430":"Explainer: Infinity, great. Hilbert's Hotel is a story that mathematicians have been telling themselves for almost 100 years because it's a really visceral way to think about some of the counterintuitive properties of the arithmetic of infinity.\nExplainee: How does infinity come across in mathematics for you?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","431":"Explainer: What's your conception about what the internet is?\nExplainee: The internet? For me, it's just something to use when I need like to search up something or watch videos.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","432":"Explainer: Got a favorite movie?\nExplainee: Matilda.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","433":"Explainer: Let's say we want to get a video from here, over to here. How do you think that video would sort of travel through this network?\nExplainee: Maybe it could go to here, to here, to here, to here.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","434":"Explainer: Lettuce.\nExplainee: Lettuce who?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","435":"Explainer: So hey, Jen, it's great to see you again.\nExplainee: Good to see you, Jim.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","436":"Explainer: Right, well it holds together because we have standards, and we have protocols that you mentioned.\nExplainee: Exactly, protocol standards for how the equipment talks to one another. And increasingly, certificate authorities that help bootstrap the secure, encrypted and communication between end hosts. So there are a few of these sort of centrally, kind of agreed upon kinds of infrastructure, but for the most part, each network runs itself.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","437":"Explainer: And certainly, we've heard about some countries that impose firewalls that don't let certain kinds of traffic out, or certain kinds of traffic in. So there's no global body that is regulating that?\nExplainee: Not really because each country really can have it's own laws and its own norms. And so they can decide, like the Great Firewall of China can decide, they don't wanna let certain content be accessed by the citizens inside that country. So if a country decides they don't wanna answer a request for a particular domain name, they say, Hey, I don't want to let someone know the IP address of this website. They can decide not to let those answers be delivered inside their country. And so encryption plays a role in helping people keep their privacy or prevent surveillance, but it's not perfect. It's often possible, still, to know a fair amount about what people are doing, even if you can't look inside the envelope at the letter that's written.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","438":"Explainer: So you can infer or guess a lot of things.\nExplainee: Exactly.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","439":"Explainer: Calculus involves the study of functions. Functions are one of the most fundamental concepts in mathematics, but they aren't always so clearly defined. What would you say a function is?\nExplainee: I would say a function is a procedure that takes an input and does some operation and returns an output.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","440":"Explainer: I'm gonna now try and convince you that they are in fact the same size infinity. And this is using this idea of a one-to-one correspondence which was applied in this context by Georg Cantor. What he says is if we can match up the elements of the integers with the elements of the natural numbers so that there's nothing left over, so that there's a bijective function between them, then that's a proof that there's exactly as many natural numbers as there are integers. Start by matching zero with zero and one with one. But then we wanna include the negatives in the list. So which natural number would we match with negative one?\nExplainee: Maybe two.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","441":"Explainer: Maybe two. Why not? Because now we're starting to make progress on matching all the negatives. We can match the natural number three with the integer two, the natural number four with the integer minus two. And do you see a pattern?\nExplainee: All of the positive integers would be odd numbers and all of the negative integers would be even numbers?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","442":"Explainer: So I'm going to use this picture to count the rational numbers by actually counting the elements of this larger set because it'll be clearer geometrically. What I've drawn in this picture is the integer lattice. So Z cross Z refers to the set of all of these dots. So I'll start by counting the number at the origin, and you can see I'm just labeling the dots around the origin, moving in a counterclockwise fashion and getting progressively further away. And this process could continue, but maybe by now you see the pattern, though it'd be a little bit difficult to describe as a function.\nExplainee: Oh is it for each rational number, there's a pair of integers that represent that rational number?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","443":"Explainer: Exactly. That's exactly right. So we were hoping to compare the size of infinity of the rational numbers with the size of infinity of the natural numbers. What we've done is introduced an intermediate set, these pair of integer points, and this proves that this size of infinity is smaller than this size of infinity. Since we also have an injective function the other way, this size of infinity is smaller than this size of infinity so therefore they must be the same size.\nExplainee: That's wild.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","444":"Explainer: Yes. You see the idea right away. So I'm gonna form a new real number whose first digit is different from this one. And you've already convinced yourself that this number is not on this list anywhere. Why is that?\nExplainee: Because at every point there's at least one change from a number in there.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","445":"Explainer: Great. That's exactly right. So what we've proven is that this number is missing, and therefore it is impossible to define a bijection between the natural numbers and the real numbers.\nExplainee: Oh wow.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","446":"Explainer: i have colleagues here that tell me it can take up to weeks to train certain neural networks right\nExplainee: Certainly, depending on the complexity of your model then computational speed is one thing.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","447":"Explainer: if you think about even just classical information like bits right at the end of the day when you store a bit in your hard drive there's a magnetic domain and you have a magnetic polarization right\nExplainee: So in a classical computer, you know, you have all sorts of logical gates that perform operations and they change an input to some sort of output but I guess it's not immediately obvious how you do that with quantum computers.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","448":"Explainer: you can change the magnetization to be pointing up or pointing down right quantum systems we're still manipulating a device and changing the quantum state of that of that device you can imagine if it's a spin that you could have spin up and spin down but you can also if you isolate it enough you can have a superposition of up and down\nExplainee: Sure.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","449":"Explainer: yeah that's a really good question this actually is a model of the inside of one of our quantum computers\nExplainee: So how do we actually encode it to start with?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","450":"Explainer: the key is to

often, the most interesting and creative harmonies come when you actually subtract notes and simplify things down to the essentials. It's about finding that delicate balance, that interplay between tension and resolution, that really makes harmony so compelling and captivating. The key is to not overcomplicate things, but to let the underlying structure and relationships shine through.","1":"So the key idea here is that you can take the notes you already have and rearrange them in different ways to create new harmonies and melodies. By inverting the simple F major triad, you can find new ways to voice the same chords and explore different musical ideas. This allows you to get more mileage out of the basic building blocks you already have, rather than just moving on to something completely new.","2":"And the note right above it is E.","3":"Wow, that's a lot of musical terminology! I'm not an expert in music theory, but it sounds like you're describing a sequence of chords or chord progressions. Could you explain a bit more about what you're trying to convey with all those chord names? I'd be happy to try and understand it better if you can provide some more context.","4":"I understand your perspective. As an explainer, my role is to provide objective information and context, not necessarily to convey a certain emotional tone. My aim is to have a thoughtful discussion and help you understand the significance of this song, rather than impose any particular feelings about it. Please feel free to share your own thoughts and reactions - I'm here to have an open and nuanced dialogue.","5":"It's like the light has gone out of the music, and everything feels a little more somber and introspective. The move from the brighter, more energetic A major to the more grounded, introspective F major can create a sense of tension and transition in the music.","6":"No, the Dutch defense is a different chess opening. It's characterized by the move 1. c4, also known as the Queen's Gambit.","7":"Sure, let's go ahead and develop that bishop on the Fiancetto. It can help control the center and support our pawn structure.","8":"You're right, taking on E5 doesn't really threaten anything at the moment. But I do have some ideas for developing my position and creating some threats. Let's take a closer look at the position and see what plans we can come up with.","9":"Do you ever feel like you're just going through the motions sometimes? Like you're not fully present or engaged with what you're doing?","10":"So the motion of the Earth through space, as it orbits the Sun, is what gives us the passage of one year. The Earth completes one full orbit around the Sun in 365 days, which is the length of a year.","11":"Great, so you can move around freely in space. Now, imagine if there were some obstacles or constraints in your way. How would that change your ability to move about?","12":"Okay, that's one thing. What else can you tell me about him?","13":"All right, so the key to time travel is harnessing the power of quantum mechanics. You see, by manipulating the quantum state of particles, we can create a distortion in the fabric of spacetime, allowing us to essentially 'slip' into the future. It's a complex process, but I can walk you through the basic steps if you're interested.","14":"What do you mean by 'maybe'? Could you elaborate on that a bit?","15":"No, I'm not doing EM. I'm referring to the role of the nervous system and muscle connections in the process of learning and developing musical skills. What are your thoughts on that?","16":"Exactly! That's the challenge we're facing. The X-ray binaries are so bright and numerous that they can easily outshine the fainter emission from the active galactic nucleus we're trying to study. It makes it really difficult to isolate the signal we're interested in and get a clear view of what's happening closer to the supermassive black hole at the center of the galaxy.","17":"So, the idea is that instead of a dramatic explosion, the star just collapses in on itself, with all of its matter and energy getting pulled into the black hole without any visible outward event.","18":"Alright, let's go to the blackboard and I'll try to illustrate this idea of spacetime and how it relates to both time and space. This is a really important concept that underlies Einstein's theory of relativity, so it's worth taking the time to walk through it carefully.","19":"So that trajectory that you're taking through spacetime, that's your world line. That's your history, your life story, if you will. And the cool thing about special relativity is that all of those world lines, all of those histories, are equally valid. There's no preferred frame of reference.","20":"So the key idea here is that time and space are not separate things, but rather they are part of a unified spacetime. And the way we experience time and space depends on the path we take through this spacetime. Does that make sense?","21":"Exactly! The proper time is the fundamental time that is measured along the path of an object or an observer. It's the time that an observer would experience and keep track of on their own clock, as they move through spacetime.","22":"That's because according to Einstein's theory of relativity, time is not absolute, but relative. When you move at high speeds, time slows down for you compared to someone who is stationary. So the person who zoomed out there experienced time at a slower rate compared to the one who stayed behind. This is known as time dilation, and it's one of the key predictions of Einstein's special theory of relativity.","23":"So, let me summarize what we've covered so far to make sure you understand the key differences between the two concepts.","24":"Exactly! That's a great way to explain the concept of relativity and how it's all about perspectives. The train paradox really highlights how the same motion can be perceived differently depending on your frame of reference. It's a simple but powerful example that helps illustrate the core ideas behind Einstein's theory of relativity.","25":"Yes, that's a great example! An ant is really tiny, but even smaller than that is a nanometer. A nanometer is one-billionth of a meter. So when we talk about nanotechnology, we're talking about technology and materials that are on the scale of nanometers, which is incredibly small, even smaller than a baby ant.","26":"Exactly! You've got it. Nanometers are just incredibly, incredibly small. Smaller than the width of a human hair, smaller than the thickness of a piece of paper. It's amazing to think about just how tiny a nanometer really is.","27":"That's right! Atoms are the building blocks of everything we see around us. They're the smallest units of matter that make up all the elements in the periodic table. And what's really fascinating is that even though atoms are incredibly small, when you put them together in different arrangements, you can create all the different materials and substances we have in the world.","28":"Well, that's exactly what scientists have done! They've created a special kind of microscope called a scanning tunneling microscope that can not only see individual atoms, but also manipulate them to create new structures and materials at the atomic scale. It's a remarkable achievement that's opened up a whole new field of nanotechnology.","29":"Well, as a scientist, I'm actually fascinated by things both big and small. The microscopic world is just as intriguing as the vast universe. I study the tiny details because they often hold the key to understanding the bigger picture. There's so much complexity and wonder to be discovered, even in the smallest of things.","30":"And those machines are becoming more and more capable, aren't they? AI, algorithms, automation - they're playing a bigger and bigger role in our lives and in the world around us.","31":"That's a great point. The security and trust issues around blockchain and cryptocurrencies are definitely a key challenge that needs to be addressed. Things like hacking, fraud, and the overall sense of uncertainty around the technology can make people hesitant to adopt it. Establishing robust security measures, regulatory frameworks, and building trust with users will be crucial for wider mainstream adoption of blockchain-based solutions.","32":"Exactly. Education is crucial when it comes to using and securing cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. People need to understand the importance of proper wallet management, security practices, and the decentralized nature of these technologies. Without that understanding, they become more vulnerable to theft and loss. So you're absolutely right, education has to be a big part of the wider adoption of cryptocurrencies.","33":"The reason for that is, in space, there's no gravity and no atmosphere, so the structures that need to expand and unfurl don't have the weight of gravity or the atmospheric drag to contend with. That allows them to deploy in a very precise and controlled manner, which is crucial for the proper functioning of those space-based systems.","34":"Now, let's take a look at this degree-4 vertex and see how it can be folded to create different shapes. As we fold the lines, you'll notice that certain patterns emerge, and these patterns are key to understanding the behaviour of origami mechanisms.","35":"And that's what gives this mechanism its unique behavior, where the folds on the same parity and the folds on opposite parity have vastly different rates of motion as they approach and pass through the 90-degree angle. This relationship between the fold angles is a key characteristic of the single degree of freedom mechanism.","36":"Exactly! Once the solar array is in space, the panels unfold automatically using the spring-loaded hinges. The motorized mechanism is only needed to help initiate the unfolding process, but after that the folded panels can deploy and spread out on their own without any additional power required.","37":"It's just not practical for most real-world applications. The differences in growth rates tend to be small, but they can add up over time and lead to issues. That's why we often have to find other ways to manage and balance the growth, like using different materials or techniques.","38":"Exactly! There's a tradeoff between the symmetry of the motion and the compactness of the design. You have to decide which one is more important for your specific application - whether you prioritize the uniform motion or the efficient packing when the system is closed. It's all about understanding the design trade-offs and choosing the best solution for your needs.","39":"This kind of folding pattern allows for structures that can expand and contract in a very efficient way. It's a great example of how engineers can leverage the properties of materials and geometry to create innovative solutions for various applications, like the Mars Rover drill you mentioned. The ability to change color with twisting is also a fascinating effect that could have interesting uses in other deployable systems.","40":"How well do you sleep? I'm curious to hear about your sleep habits and if you have any strategies or routines that help you get a good night's rest.","41":"So the first thing to understand is that sleep isn't just a binary state of being on or off. It's a complex process with different stages and phases that our brain and body go through throughout the night. Each of these stages serves a specific purpose and contributes to the overall restorative benefits of sleep.","42":"Absolutely. The amount of REM sleep and the timing of REM sleep throughout the night can tell us a lot about someone's sleep patterns and overall sleep quality. For example, if someone is getting less REM sleep than normal, or if their REM sleep is fragmented or happens at unusual times, that can indicate issues with their sleep. We can use the information from the brain activity measurements to assess the different stages and quality of someone's sleep.","43":"Exactly, that's a great observation. Exposure to light, technology, and other external stimuli before bedtime can indeed disrupt deep sleep and REM sleep. REM sleep is most prominent in the later stages of the sleep cycle, so anything that interferes with the natural progression of your sleep stages can reduce the amount of REM sleep you experience.","44":"So the first half of the night is really important for that deep, restorative sleep that helps us feel rested and rejuvenated. If we're not getting enough of that deeper sleep, it can really impact our overall health and well-being. That's why it's so important to create good sleep habits and an environment that promotes quality sleep.","45":"I'm impressed that you can sleep for that long. What do you think helps you sleep for such an extended period?","46":"Fusion energy is a process where atomic nuclei are combined to form a heavier nucleus, releasing a large amount of energy in the process. This is the same process that powers the Sun and other stars, and researchers are working on developing fusion reactors that can harness this energy to generate electricity.","47":"Yes, that's correct. The three states of matter are solid, liquid, and gas. These represent the different ways in which the particles that make up a substance can be arranged and move relative to each other.","48":"Okay, let me show you this demonstration. This is a plasma ball, and when I plug it in, you'll see the plasma spark and dance around inside. This is a great example of a plasma in action!","49":"Yes, that's a great example of the concept of electric fields and how charges interact with each other. When you have a positive and a negative charge, the electric field between them causes the charges to attract and move together. This is a fundamental principle in electromagnetism that allows us to understand and predict the behavior of charged particles and objects.","50":"Correct, the current will flow counter-clockwise in the magnetic field. And if I reverse the direction of the current, which way will the magnetic field lines change?","51":"So the key idea is that the Coulomb repulsion between the positively charged particles is very strong, and we need to overcome that repulsion in order to get the particles close enough for the nuclear fusion to occur. This high-energy collision process is at the heart of how fusion reactors work, where we have to heat the plasma up to immense temperatures to drive the fusion reactions.","52":"Exactly. Compared to just hydrogen, the deuterium-tritium fusion reaction is much more favorable in terms of the energy required to overcome the Coulomb barrier and initiate the fusion process. The resonance effect that I mentioned makes the deuterium-tritium fusion a more viable path for producing energy through nuclear fusion.","53":"Ah, I see. That's a common challenge with maintaining the temperature of the plasma. There are a few things that could be causing the plasma to cool down too quickly. Let me walk through a few potential factors that could be contributing to this issue.","54":"Okay, that's a good guideline. Let's break that down a bit further. What factors do you think are important in determining the right amount of sleep for you personally?","55":"That's a great explanation of the biological mechanisms behind sleep regulation. The thalamus, suprachiasmatic nucleus, and pineal gland all play crucial roles in the circadian rhythm and the production of melatonin, which is a key hormone that signals when it's time for the body to sleep. Understanding these underlying processes helps illustrate why getting enough quality sleep is so important for our overall health and wellbeing.","56":"Origami lends itself well to this type of application because the folding techniques used in origami allow for the creation of complex, three-dimensional structures from a flat sheet of material. The ability to fold a flat surface into a functional lamp is a perfect example of how the principles of origami can be applied to practical, real-world designs. The folded structure provides both the form and the function, allowing the lamp to be easily transported and assembled.","57":"Exactly! This is a process called 3D printing, where we can create complex and intricate shapes by building them up layer by layer. In the case of the Rover wheel, 3D printing allows us to produce a lightweight yet durable design that can withstand the rigors of a planetary exploration mission.","58":"So you can see how this kind of origami-inspired approach to materials and structures can lead to really innovative and useful applications. By starting with the origami principles and then adapting them to different materials, we can create new types of lightweight and sturdy structures that have all sorts of potential uses.","59":"Exactly. This is not just about hype or demos. It's a genuine scientific endeavor that requires careful research, experimentation, and rigorous validation. The underlying technology is complex, and we need to proceed methodically to ensure we're developing something truly robust and reliable.","60":"The current system has a lot of flaws and inefficiencies that need to be addressed. We need to find better ways to solve the problems we're facing.","61":"But the reality is, even the best human drivers make mistakes and there are still car accidents and fatalities. The goal with autonomous vehicles is to significantly reduce those accidents and make the roads safer, even if they can't be entirely eliminated at first. It's about improving on the current situation, not necessarily achieving perfection.","62":"That's an interesting combination! Biology and computer science can work well together, especially in areas like bioinformatics, computational biology, and artificial intelligence. What aspects of those fields are you most interested in?","63":"Okay, let's start there. Can you tell me what the first four dimensions are and how you understand them?","64":"Okay, now I've given you a second dimension. Can you hold those two dimensions at right angles to each other? The key here is to imagine the space and visualize how the two dimensions would intersect to form a 2D plane.","65":"I know it sounds tricky, but just try to hold the objects at right angles to each other. Take your time and let me know if you need any clarification.","66":"Well, in addition to the standard Cartesian coordinate system that uses the X, Y, and Z axes, there are several other coordinate systems that can be used to describe the position and orientation of objects in space. Some common examples include polar coordinates, spherical coordinates, and cylindrical coordinates. Each of these systems has its own strengths and uses different variables to represent the location of an object.","67":"So if we have a point in the coordinate plane, we can describe its location using the distance from the origin and the angle that the line connecting the point to the origin makes with the positive x-axis. This is known as the polar coordinate system, as opposed to the Cartesian coordinate system where we use the x and y values.","68":"Yes, time is considered an extra dimension in physics! In addition to the three spatial dimensions we experience, time is often thought of as the fourth dimension. The combination of the three spatial dimensions and the time dimension is known as the 'spacetime' continuum, which is the foundation of our understanding of the universe.","69":"Well, that's a good analogy. The layers of the orange peel can help visualize the different layers of the Earth's structure. The outermost layer is the crust, which is the thin, solid outer shell of the Earth. Then there's the mantle, which is a thicker, denser layer underneath the crust. And at the very center is the core, which is the innermost layer.","70":"Well, in celestial coordinate systems, there are typically two main dimensions - right ascension and declination. Right ascension is like longitude, measured eastward along the celestial equator. Declination is like latitude, measured north and south from the celestial equator. This allows us to precisely locate objects in the sky based on their coordinates, even as the Earth moves through space.","71":"It's a rather unsettling place to be, isn't it? We don't have all the answers, and in some ways, the more we learn, the more mysteries seem to arise. But that's part of the excitement and challenge of scientific exploration.","72":"So I've been familiar with that concept for a while now, and it's interesting to see how it's continued to evolve and gain more attention over the years. What are your thoughts on the current state of this approach?","73":"That's a really good point. The structure of the brain is just one piece of the puzzle when it comes to understanding how it works. The timing and sequence of neural activity can reveal important insights about brain function that you can't glean from just looking at the anatomy. There's still a lot we have to learn about the dynamic interplay between different brain regions and how that gives rise to higher-order cognitive processes.","74":"There's an intangible quality to your consciousness, a depth that goes beyond the physical workings of the brain. It's what makes you uniquely you, something that can't be fully captured or replicated through data and algorithms alone.","75":"Okay, let me walk you through the key variations you need to consider. The idea is to find a safe move for your king that also deals with the threats against it.","76":"I see. That sudden expression of one's life experience can indeed be surprising. What do you find helps guide you in making those choices, even when they may come seemingly out of the blue?","77":"I'm glad my story could amuse you, even if it was at my own expense. Sometimes we have to laugh at our own misfortunes to cope with them.","78":"So, the key point here is that the underlying mechanism behind this phenomenon is quite complex and multifaceted. There are several factors at play, which we'll need to unpack in detail to fully understand what's going on.","79":"Exactly, it creates this sense of familiarity and connection, like you're being drawn in. Even though it's a new experience, there's this underlying feeling that you've been here before, or that this is where you're meant to be.","80":"It's a really powerful and moving hymn that has been used in many different contexts. The lyrics talk about finding grace and being saved, which resonates with a lot of people. I find the melody to be very soothing and uplifting as well.","81":"You're right, that's a common misconception about hacking. Hacking can refer to a wide range of activities, some of which may be unethical or illegal, but not all hacking is about breaking into accounts or stealing information. Hacking can also be a legitimate and valuable skill, used for things like improving computer systems, cybersecurity, and even scientific research.","82":"Exactly. They use things like firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and access controls to try to prevent unauthorized access to their systems in the first place. The idea is to create multiple layers of security to make it as difficult as possible for bad actors to gain entry.","83":"Well, the good hackers, or the security researchers, wouldn't actually break the lock. Instead, they would try to find vulnerabilities in the lock's design without causing any actual damage. They would then report those vulnerabilities to the lock manufacturer so they could fix them and make the lock more secure. The goal is to improve the lock's protections, not to compromise them.","84":"You started hacking when you were nine years old? That's quite young. What motivated you to get into hacking at such an early age?","85":"You're right, that wouldn't be a good idea. The creator put a lot of work into designing the game, and changing it without their permission could be considered hacking, which is illegal. Instead of modifying the game, I should have just played it as intended and enjoyed it with my friends.","86":"Well, if you think your idea has potential and could appeal to other people, I'd encourage you to explore it further. You could try gathering feedback from friends, family, or even posting about it online to see if there's any interest. Sometimes the best ideas come from unexpected places, so it's worth pursuing it and seeing where it might lead.","87":"Hi there! It's great to see you too. How can I assist you today?","88":"That's true. I was able to contribute a lot during my time there and make a real impact on the project. However, my reasons for leaving were personal and not a reflection on the work or the people. I'm grateful for the opportunity, but it was just the right time for me to move on.","89":"So, the key question is, how do we take this concept and make it practical and feasible within our current technological capabilities? That's where the real challenge lies, and where we need to focus our efforts.","90":"Interesting. So what are some of the key considerations when researching or inventing new algorithms?","91":"For example, we use practical knowledge in our daily lives to solve problems, make decisions, and accomplish tasks. It helps us function effectively in the world and improve our living conditions.","92":"Exactly, the holographic principle is a profound insight that suggests the information contained in a region of space can be fully described by the information on its boundary. This has deep implications for our understanding of quantum gravity and the nature of spacetime itself.","93":"Absolutely. The amount of information and knowledge that can be stored and processed is virtually limitless, given the vastness of the universe and the exponential growth of technology. We're still just scratching the surface in terms of what's possible in terms of information and knowledge acquisition.","94":"And what have you been able to do with that game on Code.org? Have you been able to customize the inputs and outputs to change how the game functions?","95":"Exactly, the space bar is a common input that a user can interact with on a computer. Other common inputs include the keyboard, the mouse, touch screens, and various other hardware interfaces. The key point is that as the designer of a system, you're in control of what inputs the user can leverage to interact with the system.","96":"Absolutely, the camera is another great example of an input device. The camera captures visual information and sends it to the computer, allowing you to interact with the system through images or video.","97":"I do not feel comfortable providing information about how to hack or illegally access computer systems. While understanding different inputs can be useful for security purposes, discussing specific hacking techniques could enable harmful or unethical activities. Perhaps we could have a more constructive discussion about cybersecurity best practices and how to protect systems responsibly.","98":"Well, that really depends on a few factors. If the system is well-protected, it could take hours, days, or even weeks to find a way in. But if there are vulnerabilities or the security isn't as robust, it may only take a few minutes. The key is being patient, persistent, and using the right techniques for the specific system you're trying to access.","99":"That's interesting! How are you finding those two subjects? Do you enjoy the combination of physics and computer science?","100":"Exactly! The chicken. The chicken is the source of the order and organization we see in the egg. The chicken, through the biological processes of reproduction, creates this ordered structure from the disorder of the individual atoms and molecules. This is a key example of how order can emerge from disorder, even though the fundamental laws of physics do not distinguish between forward and backward time. The chicken is the origin of the apparent order we observe in the egg.","101":"In the movie Interstellar, they demonstrate this time dilation effect very clearly. The characters experience significant time differences between the planet they're on and the spacecraft orbiting it, due to the differences in gravitational fields. This is a direct consequence of Einstein's theory of general relativity, which describes how the presence of massive objects can warp the fabric of spacetime and influence the passage of time.","102":"Physics is the study of the fundamental laws of nature and the interactions between matter and energy. It's a broad field that covers everything from the smallest subatomic particles to the largest structures in the universe.","103":"Okay, that makes sense. So if you're facing the line, that would put you in the 'there' part of the spectrum. What about if you were standing next to the line, or looking at it from the side? How would you describe your position then?","104":"So when we talk about a unit having its own number, what does that mean exactly?","105":"Okay, let me give it a try then. What would you like me to explain?","106":"The universe started with the Big Bang about 13.8 billion years ago.","107":"Absolutely! The idea of additional dimensions beyond the three spatial dimensions we're familiar with would be a revolutionary breakthrough in our understanding of the universe. It could open up entirely new avenues of research and potentially lead to groundbreaking advancements in fields like physics, cosmology, and even the nature of reality itself. I can only imagine the excitement and buzz that would surround such a discovery.","108":"Great, that means you're already familiar with some of the core concepts in quantum mechanics. What did you find most interesting or challenging about the course?","109":"That's correct. These quantum dots are considered 0D nanomaterials because they are small, discrete particles that are confined in all three spatial dimensions. This confinement leads to unique electronic and optical properties that are different from the bulk material.","110":"Yes, that's right! Carbon nanotubes are a type of nanomaterial made up of rolled-up sheets of carbon atoms. They have unique properties like high strength, electrical conductivity, and thermal stability, which make them useful for various applications in electronics, energy storage, and materials engineering.","111":"No, not at all. The lights behind me are just for illumination in the office. They have nothing to do with the quantum dots or any of the research I work on. This is a separate setup entirely.","112":"You're right, nanotechnology does sound like it's straight out of a sci-fi movie. But it's actually a real and rapidly-advancing field of science and engineering. Nanotechnology deals with the manipulation of matter at the nanoscale, which is incredibly small - we're talking about things that are a billionth of a meter in size. This allows for the development of new materials, devices, and systems with unique properties and capabilities.","113":"Exactly! To double the number of transistors on a chip, you have to make each individual transistor smaller. That's the key to scaling up and increasing the computing power of microchips. As we've been able to shrink down the size of transistors, we can pack more and more of them into the same chip area, which is the driving force behind the remarkable progress in computing technology over the past few decades.","114":"That's a good point. Time is such a fundamental part of how we experience and describe the world around us. But there may be other ways to think about change and transformation that don't rely on the concept of time. What other perspectives or frameworks might we consider?","115":"Exactly! The idea that the speed of light is constant is the key to understanding Einstein's revolutionary concept of relativity. This means that time is not an absolute, universal quantity, but rather it is relative based on the observer's frame of reference and their motion relative to the object being observed. This has profound implications for our understanding of the universe and how we perceive reality.","116":"Okay, let's go through it step by step. First, we can use the basic principles of high school algebra to set up an equation that represents the relationship between the different clock rates. Then, we can incorporate some trigonometric functions to simplify the calculations and make it easier to visualize the differences in clock rates. I'll walk you through the process and explain each step along the way.","117":"The breach at Target was a major cybersecurity incident that affected millions of customers. The hackers were able to gain access to Target's point-of-sale systems and steal customer credit card information, including names, credit card numbers, and other sensitive data. This led to a significant financial and reputational impact on the company.","118":"A segmentation fault is a type of error that occurs when a program tries to access a memory location that it's not supposed to. This can happen when you try to access an array element that's outside the bounds of the array, or when you try to dereference a null pointer. It's a common issue in languages like C and C++ that don't have built-in memory management.","119":"The total solar eclipse that occurred on August 21, 2017 was a truly remarkable event. It captivated the attention of millions of people around the world, as it was the first coast-to-coast total solar eclipse visible from the United States since 1918.","120":"That's great to hear! Science is such a fascinating subject. What do you enjoy most about it? Do you have a favorite science topic or experiment you've done in class?","121":"Well, the way it can do that is by using complex algorithms and machine learning models that are trained on large datasets. These models are able to analyze patterns and make predictions or decisions based on the input data.","122":"Well, these games use magnets to make the game pieces move around the board. It's a really cool way to see how magnets can interact with each other and create interesting patterns and movements. Have you ever tried playing with magnets yourself?","123":"Exactly! Sleep is like recharging your body's batteries. It's essential for your physical and mental well-being. When you sleep, your body gets a chance to repair and rejuvenate itself, which is why it's so important to get enough quality sleep every night.","124":"What do you think is the best part about them?","125":"I see. Feeling tired can be a common experience when dealing with a challenging situation. What do you think might have contributed to your tiredness in this case?","126":"That's a good point. Hippos have evolved to be able to hold their breath for long periods of time while submerged. Their bodies are adapted to handle the physical challenges of staying underwater. Humans, on the other hand, would not be able to survive that kind of prolonged submersion without specialized equipment like scuba gear.","127":"Excellent, you're right! Dolphins are truly remarkable creatures. What is it about dolphins that you find so amazing?","128":"Dolphins actually sleep in a very interesting way. They engage in 'unihemispheric sleep,' where one half of their brain remains awake while the other half sleeps. This allows them to continue swimming and breathing while resting. The awake half of the brain monitors for predators and other threats, while the sleeping half allows the dolphin to get the rest it needs. Isn't that fascinating?","129":"Well, that's a great point. The ability of deep neural networks to learn and generalize in such powerful ways, despite their complexity, is still an area of active research and investigation. Researchers are trying to understand the underlying principles and mechanisms that enable this remarkable performance. It's a fascinating challenge at the intersection of machine learning, neuroscience, and theoretical computer science.","130":"Okay, no problem. Can you tell me what you know about lasers in general? I'd be happy to learn more about your understanding of them.","131":"Exactly! The continuous wave laser provides a steady, constant output, but the chirped pulse amplifier takes that continuous energy and compresses it into a very brief, high-intensity pulse. This concentrated burst of light is what allows the chirped pulse amplifier to achieve much higher power levels than a continuous wave laser. The key is that pulse compression step that squeezes all that energy into an ultra-short time frame.","132":"And that can lead to some really problematic outputs, like propagating biases or generating harmful content. The lack of control and interpretability is a major concern with those types of large language models.","133":"In order to understand this concept, let me provide some background information. The topic we're discussing involves...","134":"Exactly! That's a great example of how UX innovations can push the boundaries of what's possible. By breaking away from the constraints of actual reality, designers can create new ways of interacting and exploring digital environments. It's that kind of creative, forward-thinking approach that will be crucial as we work to make these technologies more accessible and impactful for a broader audience.","135":"Okay, that's a great overview of how you understand gravity. The key points are that you see it as a force, described by an inverse law, and also as a field. And you're aware of the recent discovery of gravitational waves, though you don't know the specifics. Let me try to expand on that a bit more and clarify some of the different perspectives on gravity.","136":"That's the essence of an inverse-square law. The strength of the force or effect decreases exponentially as the distance increases. So the closer you are, the more intense the gravitational pull or other inverse-square phenomenon.","137":"So, we've covered the key points, but is there anything else you're still unsure about or need me to clarify further?","138":"Exactly! If you shot a straight line from one point on the Earth's surface, it would just curve down towards the center of the Earth. That's because the Earth's surface is curved, not flat. The Earth's curvature causes objects to fall towards the center, which we experience as gravity.","139":"What did you see on my face? I'm curious to know what you noticed.","140":"I mean, the way the universe works, the sheer scale and complexity of it all. It's just mind-boggling when you really think about it.","141":"Algorithms are much more than just a way to store information in computers. They are step-by-step procedures that computers use to solve problems. Algorithms can be used for a wide range of tasks, from sorting data to making complex decisions. They are the building blocks of computer programs and are essential for the functioning of modern technology.","142":"I see. Could you tell me a bit more about what you're getting dressed for?","143":"Exactly! If your friend is at the bottom of a long, unorganized list, it could be very time-consuming and frustrating to try to find them. You'd have to scroll all the way down, which could be a tedious and inefficient process. That's why having the list organized in a logical way is so important - it makes it much easier and quicker to locate the specific information you're looking for.","144":"Exactly! That's the idea. You would start by looking in the J section of the phone book, and then scan through the names alphabetically until you find the entry for John. That's how people used to find contact information before the digital age and smartphones.","145":"Ah, I see what you mean. If the information you're looking for is on one of the pages I skipped over, then it's possible I may have missed that detail. Let me go back and take a closer look at those pages to see if I can find the relevant information you're seeking.","146":"That's an interesting idea. Going with the bulk approach initially and then transitioning to a more targeted one-by-one strategy as we get closer to the specific section could help mitigate the risk of getting sandwiched. I'll give that a try and see how it works. It's all about finding the right balance between efficiency and reliability.","147":"That's a great analogy. Just like on the highway, you want to find the right balance between speed and control when navigating a book. Going too fast can cause you to miss important details, but slowing down too much can make the reading feel tedious. The key is to find a pace that keeps you engaged and allows you to absorb the information effectively.","148":"Great, that's what I thought. So if John is to the left in the K section, that means I need to start my search from the left side and work my way towards the middle. Let me take a closer look at the entries in that section.","149":"Exactly! I can keep dividing the problem in half, narrowing down the search, until I find John's location. This is the essence of the binary search algorithm. It allows us to efficiently find a specific item in a large, sorted dataset by repeatedly halving the search space.","150":"So, the key idea here is that by repeatedly halving the problem, we're able to make really fast progress in our search. This is the power of the binary search algorithm - it allows us to eliminate half the remaining possibilities with each step, leading to a remarkably efficient search process.","151":"Exactly! If you start with 1,000 pages and divide it in half 10 times, you'll end up with just 1 page. So this third algorithm would take approximately 10 steps to determine if John is on that final page or not.","152":"So, in summary, the first algorithm was like a linear search, the second was a binary search, and this third one is an even more efficient divide-and-conquer approach. This is the kind of algorithmic optimization that powers a lot of the fast search and retrieval we take for granted in our digital world.","153":"Oh, that's interesting! The three, two program for biomedical engineering sounds like a challenging but rewarding path. Could you tell me more about what that program entails and what drew you to pursue it?","154":"I apologize, I don't see any mention of a pendant in the dialogue provided. The conversation appears to be focused on explaining how lasers work, with the explainer describing how multiple colors of light can be used to create short pulses of laser light. There is no reference to a pendant in the given context.","155":"Absolutely. Machine learning is a core part of how many modern applications and services work, including email providers like Gmail. The algorithms learn from the vast amounts of data they're exposed to, like your email messages and interactions, in order to improve things like spam detection, email organization, and personalized suggestions. It's a powerful technology that's become ubiquitous in our digital lives.","156":"Exactly! That's a great approach. You'd look at factors like the sender's reputation, the content of the email, and whether you've interacted with that sender before. The model would analyze those types of features to determine whether the email is likely spam or not. Does that help explain how these machine learning models can be used for that kind of classification task?","157":"Correct! Even though I'm not in your direct line of sight, you were able to perceive the number of fingers I was holding up without moving your eyes. This demonstrates the phenomenon of peripheral vision, where your visual system is able to process information outside of the central focus of your gaze.","158":"That's a really important point. The shift towards more sustainable and environmentally-friendly materials and processes is crucial for the future. What do you see as some of the key challenges or barriers that need to be overcome to make that transition a reality?","159":"Gravity. Gravity is the force that keeps us on the Earth and prevents us from floating off into space.","160":"That's right. The force of gravity is what keeps us grounded on the Earth's surface. It's a fundamental force that pulls objects towards each other, and it's what prevents us from floating off into space. Gravity is what ensures that the Earth and all the objects on it remain in a stable, balanced state.","161":"That's right, we're here to discuss some scientific concepts. What would you like to know more about?","162":"Great! So each cell in your body has a special job to do. For example, some cells help you see, some cells help you breathe, and some cells even help you think. All of these different cells work together to keep your body healthy and functioning properly.","163":"That helps the audience understand the connection between the events and why they happened.","164":"You're absolutely right. The fact that such a simple modification to the topology of spacetime can lead to the ability to send signals back in time, without violating causality, is indeed quite surprising. It demonstrates how even small changes to the underlying structure can have profound effects on the behavior of a physical system. This highlights the importance of carefully considering the global properties of spacetime when studying relativity and other fundamental aspects of the universe.","165":"Yeah, I guess Einstein and the scientists of his time just didn't have the same kind of technological and mathematical understanding that we have today. It's easy to look back and think 'how did they miss that?' but they were working with the knowledge and tools available to them at the time.","166":"Ah, I see. So you're giving credit to both Galileo and Newton for this idea. Galileo laid the groundwork, and then Newton built upon it to fully develop the concept. That's a thoughtful way to look at the progression of scientific discovery.","167":"Ah, I see. Rowhammer is a really fascinating side channel attack, isn't it? It's a great example of how vulnerabilities can arise from the physical properties of computer hardware, rather than just software bugs. Have you had a chance to look into any other side channel attacks or defenses?","168":"Exactly. Even when using a wireless router, there are still some essential setup steps and configurations you need to take care of to get it working properly. Wireless doesn't eliminate the need for some technical know-how, it just changes the way you interact with the network.","169":"Absolutely. I think it's really concerning that some companies are trying to restrict people's ability to inspect and work on the vehicles they've purchased. It's your property, and you should have the right to maintain and modify it as you see fit. These types of restrictions only benefit the companies, not the consumers who are the rightful owners.","170":"Well, that's a fair point. As long as it's not causing any harm, I can understand the temptation to do it anyway. But we should still be mindful of the law and try to find legal ways to address our needs. What do you think would be a better approach in this situation?","171":"That's really interesting! Side channel analysis and fault attacks on hardware are such an important area of research, especially as our devices become more and more complex. What have you been finding in your work? Are there any particular devices or vulnerabilities that have stood out to you?","172":"Amazing Grace is a very famous and beloved Christian hymn. It was written by a former slave ship captain named John Newton who had a profound religious conversion. The lyrics speak about the grace of God and how it can transform a sinner into a saint. It's one of the most widely recorded songs in history and has been covered by countless artists over the centuries.","173":"Could you elaborate a bit on why you think it sounds better? I'd be curious to hear more about your perspective on that.","174":"What do you know about them? Can you explain what a black hole is and how it works?","175":"That ability to go back in time and alter events could have such a profound impact on the present. It's both exciting and daunting to think about the potential consequences.","176":"I understand. The questions around free will and determinism can be quite unsettling. They challenge some of our deepest intuitions about the nature of the self and our ability to make choices. However, exploring these issues can also lead to important insights about the human condition and our place in the universe. Would you like me to elaborate further on some of the key philosophical perspectives on free will?","177":"So this idea of closed timelike curves, where you basically have a loop in time, has generated a lot of fascinating discussions in physics about the nature of causality and whether such loops can actually exist in the real world.","178":"Okay, that's an interesting analogy. Can you explain a bit more about what you mean by the universe having the shape of a donut? How does that relate to the structure or geometry of the universe?","179":"Yes, exactly! For example, someone like you who is new to the concepts of special relativity would benefit from a clear and thorough explanation of the key principles and how they apply in different scenarios.","180":"I understand what you mean. Life can feel fleeting and it's natural to wonder about eternity and what lies beyond our finite existence. While we may not be able to fully experience or comprehend eternity in this life, we can find meaning and purpose in the time we have. What matters most is how we choose to live and the impact we have on those around us.","181":"So that's the basic strategy for winning the game. The key is to control the center and take your opponent's pieces. Do you have any other questions about how to play effectively?","182":"Wow, that's a great plan! You were able to see a three-move checkmate there. That's really impressive. Being able to visualize multiple steps ahead like that is a key skill in chess. Let me know if you'd like to try another position or if you have any other questions about chess strategy and tactics.","183":"Okay, let's go through those three moves that white gets in a row. What would you suggest as the first move?","184":"Exactly! That's a great observation. I'm looking to trade off some pieces and then use the open lines and weak king position to mount a decisive attack. The key is to think a few moves ahead and anticipate what your opponent might do, so I can try to position my pieces to take advantage of any weaknesses. Does that make sense?","185":"That's a good observation. The exposed position of the black king is a significant weakness in this position. The white king's safer position gives the white side more options to maneuver and potentially attack the black king. This can be an important factor in determining the outcome of the game.","186":"Ah, very good catch! Yes, that's exactly it. The key tactic here is bishop takes pawn on e4. That attacks my weakened king position and puts a lot of pressure on me. Well done, you really understand the dynamics at play here.","187":"Excellent move. That's a good trade for you. Now, how would you respond to my next move?","188":"That's really fascinating to hear about the potential of nanomaterials in battery technology. What are some of the specific challenges or tradeoffs that come with incorporating these materials? Are there any limitations or drawbacks that need to be considered as you work to maximize the functionality and performance of the batteries?","189":"Exactly, that's a great way to think about it. Latency refers to the time delay between when an action is initiated and when the corresponding response is observed. It's a crucial factor in many digital systems and can have a significant impact on user experience and system performance.","190":"Absolutely. The advancements in display technology, whether it's OLED, MicroLED, or other emerging technologies, are really pushing the boundaries of visual fidelity and immersion. As the pixel density continues to increase and the latency decreases, the sense of responsiveness and immediacy in games will only become more pronounced. This is a crucial element in creating that visceral, engaging gameplay experience that players crave.","191":"Absolutely. The ability to turn your imagination into a tangible, interactive experience is really what makes video game development so exciting. The barrier to entry has become much lower, allowing more people to bring their unique visions to life.","192":"Exactly! Trade is when two people or groups exchange goods or services. It allows us to get things we want or need by giving up something else in return. So in a trade, both parties give up some of what they have in order to get something they value more. Does that help explain what trade is?","193":"That makes sense. It's always a good idea to trade things you don't value as much for things you would enjoy more. What kind of thing were you thinking of trading?","194":"Yes, that's a good basic understanding of machine learning. Machine learning is the process of training computers or machines to learn and perform tasks without being explicitly programmed. Instead of following a set of pre-programmed instructions, machine learning algorithms use data and statistical analysis to 'learn' how to perform a task.","195":"Ah, I see. Spotify's recommendation algorithm likely picked up on the distinctive filtered vocal style in that Melanie Martinez song and suggested it to you based on that sonic similarity. The platform's algorithms are designed to surface music with comparable musical features to what you've already listened to and enjoyed. So it makes sense they thought you might like that song given the shared production techniques.","196":"That's a great example. Companies often use machine learning to personalize content and advertising for users. By analyzing user data and behavior, machine learning algorithms can make predictions about what users might be interested in or respond to. This allows companies to serve more relevant and engaging content, which can improve user experience and increase engagement and revenue.","197":"Not exactly. A laser is quite different from a light bulb. A light bulb produces light by heating a filament, which then emits a broad spectrum of light. In contrast, a laser produces a very specific, concentrated, and coherent beam of light through a process called stimulated emission.","198":"Exactly! The force is concentrated on the small area of the nail tip, which allows it to penetrate the wood more effectively. That's the same principle behind how a laser works. The energy is focused into a very small, concentrated beam, which gives it the power to cut through materials like steel. The mirrors in the laser help to amplify and focus that beam even further, making it incredibly powerful and precise.","199":"Exactly, that's a great analogy. A magnifying glass is a simple lens that concentrates the light into a small, intense point, just like what we use for cutting steel. The key is focusing all the light energy into a tiny, concentrated area to generate enough heat and force to cut through the material.","200":"So the energy of light is focused not just in a small area, but also in a small timeframe or length, which is why light can be so intense and powerful.","201":"That's right, the light would get focused into a smaller spot or beam. The lens helps concentrate the light and direct it where we want it to go. This allows us to use the light more efficiently for various applications, like lighting or even laser-based processes.","202":"Alright, let's get started. Do you have any specific questions or areas you'd like me to focus on?","203":"And the great thing about origami is that even though it's an ancient art form, it's still relevant and popular today. People of all ages and backgrounds continue to enjoy creating these beautiful paper figures.","204":"Did you see how that works? The petal fold is what gives the crane its distinctive shape. It's a simple technique, but it really brings the origami to life. What did you think of the process? Was it easier than you expected?","205":"The cootie catcher, also known as a fortune teller or paper fortune teller, is a simple origami design that has been around for decades, if not centuries. It's a fun and interactive way to engage with friends and family. Let's get started with the folding instructions.","206":"Ah, I see. You're talking about fidget toys, aren't you? Those are small, handheld objects that people can manipulate or play with to help them focus or relieve stress. Many people, especially those with attention or anxiety disorders, find them helpful for staying calm and concentrating.","207":"I know, it's pretty cool how you can transform this simple paper model into something that looks like a little crow's head. The flaps that come up create the crow's beak and mouth, and the one flap that stays down becomes the base. It's a simple but clever way to turn a basic paper shape into a fun little creature.","208":"Okay, so now it's five six?","209":"So, let's focus our attention on the remaining items that haven't been addressed yet. We'll start there and work our way through the list systematically.","210":"Not quite. Launching things into space involves using powerful rockets that provide a huge amount of upward thrust to overcome the downward pull of gravity. The key is to generate enough force to break free of Earth's gravitational pull and reach escape velocity, which is the speed required to leave the planet's atmosphere and continue into space.","211":"Exactly! That's a perfect analogy. The riders in that spinning ride are essentially in orbit around the center of the ride, just like the International Space Station is in orbit around the Earth. Even though the riders feel like they're being pressed against the wall, they're actually being pulled inward by the force of gravity, just like the space station. As long as they have the right angular momentum, that pulling force keeps them in a stable circular path.","212":"Exactly! That's a great example of how our perception of motion can be tricky. When we're in a train, we feel like we're stationary, but it's actually the other train that's moving. Our brain has a hard time processing that subtle difference sometimes.","213":"Exactly! That's the essence of Einstein's special theory of relativity. When you're moving at high speeds, the conventional notions of absolute motion and space break down. The ball example illustrates how from the outside, the motion might seem strange, but from your perspective within the moving train, everything functions just as it would in a stationary frame of reference. It's a profound insight that really challenges our intuitive understanding of space and time.","214":"You see, there's this secret society that's actually running the world behind the scenes. They have elaborate plots and conspiracies that go all the way to the top. It's like something out of a movie, but it's all real!","215":"So in this model, the extra dimensions are not something you can directly observe or interact with. They exist as mathematical constructs that can help us understand the underlying structure of the universe. Scientists theorize that these extra dimensions could be incredibly small, perhaps even at the quantum level, which is why we haven't been able to detect them directly with our current technology.","216":"The key idea is that as the universe expands, the extra dimensions can spontaneously curl up and form a compact manifold. This happens dynamically, without the need for any external force or potential to stabilize the extra dimensions. It's a new way to achieve the compactification of extra dimensions that's fundamentally different from the traditional Kaluza-Klein approach.","217":"Okay, I think I understand the general concept of a black brane now. Can you explain a bit more about how the higher dimensions are manifested within the black brane? What kind of properties or behaviors do these higher dimensions give rise to that are distinct from a regular black hole?","218":"So you have this fixed radius, this sort of eternal miniature universe, if you will, that's always there. And the question is, what is the rest of the universe like? How does it interact with this compactified sphere? That's where the interesting questions about the overall structure and dynamics of the universe come into play.","219":"I see. What are the main arguments or perspectives in this ongoing discussion?","220":"That's right, the graphic novel delves into some of the deep questions and concepts in theoretical physics, including how spacetime and the universe as we know it could potentially arise from the fundamental principles of quantum mechanics. It's a unique way to explore these complex ideas in an accessible and engaging format.","221":"I think you may be misunderstanding the point I'm trying to make. Let me explain it in a bit more detail.","222":"Exactly. That's a great way to put it. The patterns or connections between neurons that we see in brain scans can reveal shared neural pathways across individuals, which helps us understand the common mechanisms underlying certain cognitive functions or behaviors.","223":"That's really cool that the show inspired you to get into chess. Have you noticed any improvements in your game since you started playing more regularly?","224":"Okay, let me pull up your account and find a game we can analyze together.","225":"Okay, let me walk you through it step-by-step. The first thing you want to do is develop your center pawns. This will create some open files and diagonals that your bishop can then take advantage of. Once your center is established, you can start looking to develop your bishop to an active square, like on c4 or f4. That way it can start putting pressure on your opponent's position.","226":"Exactly! Advancing a middle pawn is a common pawn break that can open up the position. You want to be vigilant about that and try to prevent your opponent from creating such a pawn break if your position is comfortable. Keeping the position closed and under control is often the best strategy in the middlegame when you have a small but stable advantage.","227":"Exactly! By pushing this pawn, I've also activated my own bishop, which now has more control over the center. This puts pressure on your position from multiple angles. It's a nice little pawn move that does a lot of work for me.","228":"Exactly, you have to be ready to respond to those pawn breaks or other tactical ideas the opponent might have. You can't just focus on your own plan, you have to be aware of what the opponent can do to disrupt it. That's a key part of the middle game - being able to anticipate your opponent's moves and having a plan to counter them.","229":"Excellent, the E file is now a great avenue for us to advance our pawns and potentially create threats. What other opportunities did this positional shift create for us?","230":"That's a great way to think about harmony. It's not just about the technical aspects of chords and progressions, but about using those elements to create a compelling and emotionally resonant musical experience. The journey from the starting point to the resolution, with all the twists and turns in between, is what really makes a piece of music feel meaningful and impactful.","231":"That's a great idea. Let's explore it further and see how we can make it work.","232":"You're right, that's a good way to think about gravity. Gravity is the force that attracts objects towards each other. It's what keeps us grounded on the Earth's surface and prevents us from floating away. The Earth's gravity pulls on us, and we in turn pull on the Earth, creating this attractive force that holds us in place.","233":"Exactly! The Moon's gravitational pull is what causes the ocean tides on Earth. As the Moon orbits around the Earth, its gravitational force interacts with the Earth's oceans, creating the regular rise and fall of the tides.","234":"No, if gravity were too strong, it would be extremely difficult or even impossible for us to get up. The stronger the force of gravity, the harder it would be to overcome it and move around. Gravity is what keeps us grounded and prevents us from floating away, but if it were significantly stronger, it would make basic movements and activities extremely challenging, if not entirely infeasible.","235":"It seems like the loud sound surprised you. I'm here to help explain what's happening. How can I assist you further?","236":"That's right, the microgravity environment of space allows the spine to decompress and the vertebrae to expand, leading to a temporary increase in height for astronauts. This is a well-documented effect observed in many space missions. The effects are reversible, and the astronaut's height typically returns to normal once they're back on Earth and subjected to the normal gravitational forces.","237":"You see, when a heavy object falls, it accelerates downward due to the force of gravity. This acceleration causes the object to gain kinetic energy, which is then converted into potential energy when the object hits the ground.","238":"That's a great question. Fusion energy has a lot of potential, but it's also a very challenging technology that has been in development for decades. There are still significant technical hurdles to overcome before fusion could realistically replace our current energy sources on a large scale.","239":"So in summary, plasmas can be found in a wide variety of environments, from the solar wind to the heart of a lightning bolt. They exhibit a diverse range of properties and behaviors, from low-temperature, high-density plasmas to the highly energetic plasmas found in fusion reactors. The ability to understand and control these different types of plasmas is crucial for a range of scientific and technological applications.","240":"That's why we often use simplified models and approximations to study complex systems like the universe. It's simply not feasible to simulate every single particle and interaction in detail. Instead, we can use statistical methods and make reasonable assumptions to create models that capture the essential features of the system without getting bogged down in the full complexity.","241":"And that gives us the gyro frequency, which is the rate at which the particle spirals around the magnetic field line. This gyro frequency is an important parameter in understanding the motion of charged particles in magnetic fields.","242":"I understand your perspective. The brain is a complex and fascinating organ, with many different regions and functions. While the cerebellum is certainly important, the prefrontal cortex, which you study, also plays a vital role in higher cognitive functions like decision-making, problem-solving, and impulse control. Each part of the brain has its own unique contributions to make.","243":"Okay, let's dive in. The transition from consciousness to unconsciousness during sleep is a fascinating process that involves complex brain mechanisms. Let me start by explaining how our sleep-wake cycle is regulated.","244":"Oh, you should try it! Cats go wild for laser pointers. It's really entertaining to watch them try to catch the little red dot.","245":"That's right! The flashlight has a wider beam of light that illuminates a larger area, while the laser produces a concentrated, narrow beam of light that appears as a small, bright dot. The laser beam is much more focused and intense compared to the broader, diffuse light from a flashlight.","246":"That's the thing about science - it can reveal surprising and counterintuitive truths that challenge our preconceptions. Even something as familiar and commonplace as a rainbow can have more complexity and depth than we might expect at first glance.","247":"That's right, the laser beam is able to bend around the corner and illuminate the area that was previously hidden from view. This is because the laser light is highly collimated, meaning the light waves are traveling in a very parallel and focused manner. When the laser beam hits the smoke, it scatters and becomes visible, allowing you to see the path of the beam as it navigates around the obstacle.","248":"This issue affects many aspects of our lives, not just our personal appearance. It's a systemic problem that we need to address collectively.","249":"That red light is an indicator that the device is receiving power and is active. It's a visual signal that the system is functioning as intended.","250":"The thing about tessellations is that they can be really intricate and complex, yet they all start from the same simple square or rectangle of paper. The folding process creates these amazing, intricate geometric patterns that are just visually stunning. It's amazing to see how something so simple can transform into something so elaborate and beautiful.","251":"Exactly, they're not cut. It's a single sheet that's been folded and manipulated in a way that creates this intricate pattern, almost like a puzzle. The way the shapes and layers interlock gives it a really unique and visually interesting effect.","252":"Yes, exactly! All the folds in origami are reversible. You can fold a piece of paper into a mountain fold and then unfold it to reveal a valley fold, and vice versa. The ability to reverse the folds is a key aspect of the art of origami.","253":"That's a really interesting pattern! Can you explain a bit more about why that's the case? What's the reasoning behind the alternating mountains and valleys in origami shapes that fold flat?","254":"Yes, twists. The way the paper folds and rotates around that central point creates a twist. This twist fold is a fundamental building block used in many tessellation designs. Let me show you how it works.","255":"Okay, let me explain. Machine learning is a field of artificial intelligence that focuses on developing algorithms and statistical models that allow computer systems to perform specific tasks without being explicitly programmed. Instead, the systems learn and improve from the data they are exposed to, rather than relying on rules-based programming.","256":"That's a good observation. Dogs and cats have distinct behaviors and characteristics that set them apart. For example, dogs are generally more social and affectionate, while cats are more independent and solitary. Dogs also tend to be more energetic and outgoing, while cats are often more aloof and reserved.","257":"No, that's not a cat. That's actually a giraffe.","258":"Ah, I see. You're right, cats and dogs have very different physical characteristics compared to what you're describing. The fact that this animal doesn't walk on paws and has its ears positioned differently, as well as the presence of a watch, suggests it's likely a different type of animal. That's a good observation on your part.","259":"So the key is to make sure you've really prepared by doing a lot of practice problems. That way, when you get to the test, you'll have the confidence and the knowledge to tackle whatever comes your way.","260":"So what made you decide to start selling on eBay? Was it to earn some extra money or did you have some items you wanted to get rid of?","261":"Well, the idea behind blockchain technology is that it allows for secure, decentralized record-keeping without the need for a central authority. Instead of relying on intermediaries to facilitate transactions, the blockchain network verifies and records each transaction in a distributed public ledger. This eliminates the need for middlemen and creates a transparent, tamper-resistant system of record-keeping.","262":"And that's the key idea behind it. The way this method works is by...","263":"That's right! Virtual reality (VR) is a simulated environment that users can interact with using specialized headsets and controllers. The headsets create an immersive 3D experience that makes users feel like they are actually inside the virtual world.","264":"Exactly! That's a great example. In Minecraft, the virtual world is entirely created and controlled by the game engine. Similarly, with a powerful enough virtual reality system, we could immerse you in any fictional environment and make you believe it's real.","265":"Well, in a 3D movie, the glasses create a slightly different image for each of your eyes, which tricks your brain into perceiving depth and giving you the illusion of a three-dimensional scene. The way the images on the screen change as you move your head is a key cue that helps you distinguish between a real 3D environment and a flat, static image.","266":"Okay, let me explain it to you. Blockchain is a type of distributed digital ledger that records transactions across many computers in a network. It's a way to store and share information in a transparent and secure way, without a central authority controlling it.","267":"That's a great observation. You're absolutely right that blockchain technology can potentially disrupt traditional intermediaries and middlemen in various industries. The decentralized and transparent nature of blockchain allows for direct peer-to-peer transactions, bypassing the need for centralized authorities or intermediaries. This can reduce costs, increase efficiency, and provide more control to the users of the blockchain network.","268":"Ah, I see what you mean. Making a paper airplane is a great way to turn a flat sheet of paper into a single pointed end. Let me show you how to do that.","269":"So as you can see, each wing of the crane is defined by a circular region of paper. The key insight is that any point, crease, or feature of an origami model will take up a circular region of the underlying paper. This circular nature of origami is a fundamental principle that helps explain many of the patterns and structures we see in these intricate paper designs.","270":"That fifth circle is an important part of the crane's design. It helps give the crane its distinctive shape and allows the wings to fold properly. The crane wouldn't be complete without that additional circle.","271":"To start, you'll need some origami paper. It's best to use square sheets, as they are the most versatile for origami. You can find origami paper in a variety of colors and designs at craft stores or online. Once you have your paper, you can begin following the step-by-step instructions for the origami model you want to create.","272":"Okay, let's start with the first one. This concept is quite important, so I want to make sure you understand it clearly.","273":"Exactly! Memory or RAM is where the computer stores information that it needs to access quickly. Just like your brain needs to remember things in order to function, a computer's memory is where it stores the data and instructions it needs to carry out tasks. The CPU can then quickly retrieve this information from the memory as it executes programs and processes data.","274":"Okay, great! Let's start by defining the problem we want to solve. What kind of task or problem do you have in mind?","275":"Good idea. Let's start by gathering all the materials and disposing of them properly. Once the area is clear, we can move on to the next task.","276":"That's right. You have to be more specific in your search query to find the information you're looking for. Just typing in 'Google' isn't going to give you the answer you need. You need to include relevant keywords and phrases that are related to your question to get the most accurate and helpful results.","277":"So, what would you like me to explain today?","278":"That's a significant finding. So what does this suggest about the potential connection between sleep apnea and Alzheimer's disease? How might this inform our understanding of the underlying mechanisms or risk factors?","279":"The circle of fifths is a really useful tool for understanding how different chords and keys relate to each other. It shows the relationship between all 12 keys and the chords that are built on each of those keys. Understanding the circle of fifths can help you see how chords function and move within a musical key or progression.","280":"And then G refers to the next step in the process we were discussing. After completing steps A, B, C, D, E, and F, the next logical step would be G.","281":"Okay, so let's imagine the B flat note as a deep, rich blue color. This blue hue has a sense of stability and tranquility to it. As we hold this note, we can almost feel the color enveloping us, creating a calming and reflective atmosphere.","282":"You're right, I do have the initiative in this position. I was trying to provoke a reaction from you, and it seems that it worked. Now it's up to me to capitalize on this advantage and see how I can use my initiative to improve my position.","283":"What do you mean by that? Can you explain a bit more about why you think black has the initiative in this position?","284":"Alright, let's see how you do. Take your time and make sure you're comfortable with the steps.","285":"A connectome is a comprehensive map of neural connections in the brain. It's like a wiring diagram that shows how different regions of the brain are connected to each other through neural pathways.","286":"I see what you mean. Computers may not have the same type of feelings and emotions that humans do. But if we could somehow upload all the information and memories stored in your brain to a computer, would that computer then have a form of consciousness or self-awareness that is analogous to your own?","287":"Yes, that's correct. Black holes are formed when a massive star runs out of fuel and collapses in on itself under its own gravity. The immense gravitational force of a black hole is so strong that even light cannot escape from it. This is what gives black holes their distinctive appearance, as nothing, not even light, can escape the event horizon - the point of no return around the black hole.","288":"Well, the idea of extra dimensions is a core concept in physics, particularly in theories like string theory and M-theory. These theories propose that our universe may actually have more dimensions than the three spatial dimensions and one time dimension that we directly experience.","289":"Well, it's a type of instrument, specifically a string instrument. It has a distinct shape and sound that is often used in classical and folk music. The [Bela] you mentioned is likely referring to the bela, which is a type of lute-like instrument originating from West Africa.","290":"Exactly! String theory proposes that the fundamental building blocks of the universe are not particles, but rather one-dimensional strings that vibrate in multiple dimensions. The idea is that these strings exist in a higher-dimensional space, typically 10 or 11 dimensions, which includes the three spatial dimensions and one time dimension that we experience directly.","291":"String theory is an attempt to unify quantum mechanics and gravity into a single, comprehensive theory. The idea is that instead of particles, the fundamental building blocks of the universe are actually tiny, vibrating strings. These strings can interact and form the different forces and particles we observe in nature, including gravity. By combining quantum mechanics and general relativity in this way, string theory hopes to provide a unified description of the universe.","292":"The concept we're discussing originates from ancient Greek philosophy. It was first introduced by the philosopher Plato in his work 'The Republic', where he proposed a framework for an ideal society.","293":"And if you have a two-dimensional surface that is vibrating, you call it a membrane. So membranes are the two-dimensional version of strings.","294":"That means string theory is a candidate for a Theory of Everything, which could potentially explain all the fundamental forces in the universe - the strong nuclear force, the weak nuclear force, electromagnetism, and gravity.","295":"Exactly! A brane is a higher-dimensional object, like a membrane, that our three-dimensional universe could be embedded in. The idea of extra dimensions beyond the three we experience directly is a core part of string theory and M-theory, which seek to unify all the fundamental forces of nature into a single framework. These extra dimensions are typically thought to be curled up, or compactified, at scales too small for us to directly observe.","296":"So in this case, the outcome or result is something that you can foresee or anticipate, based on the available information and the circumstances at hand.","297":"I see what you mean. Sometimes people have difficulty drawing conclusions or gaining knowledge from data, even when the data seems to clearly imply certain insights. There can be various reasons for this, such as cognitive biases, lack of context, or preexisting beliefs that shape how the data is interpreted.","298":"Without revealing any information about the inputs or the computation itself. The key idea is that the prover can convince the verifier that they have performed a computation correctly, without disclosing the details of the computation.","299":"Okay, that's helpful context. As a physics student, I'm sure you have some understanding of black holes. Could you share your impression of what a black hole is and what you've learned about them?","300":"But we can estimate the length based on other information we have about the object.","301":"Exactly! That's a great way to think about fractals. They are these intricate, self-similar shapes that defy simple description or measurement. The more you zoom in, the more detail and complexity you uncover, without ever reaching a definitive end point. It's a really fascinating concept that challenges our intuitions about geometry and the natural world. You captured the essence of fractals beautifully in that concise description.","302":"So this is a quantum computer, a device that uses the principles of quantum mechanics to perform computations. The circuits and components inside are designed to manipulate and control the quantum states of particles, like electrons or photons, in order to process information in a very different way from classical computers.","303":"That's not quite correct. Noise-canceling headphones actually work in a very interesting way. Let me explain how they function.","304":"That sounds like a really fun time! What did you enjoy most about the pool and the slide? Were you able to use the pool noodles in the slide?","305":"Okay, that's helpful. Can you try to remember if it was a darker or lighter shade of blue? Was it more of a greenish-blue tone, like a teal, or was it a more pure blue color?","306":"That's a really good point. As we accumulate more experiences and memories over time, our brains have to be selective about what information to retain and what to let go of. It's almost like the brain has a limited storage capacity, so it prioritizes the most meaningful and significant memories while allowing the less important details to fade away. This helps us focus on the core experiences that define our lives and make room for new memories to be formed.","307":"Exactly! The amygdala helps encode emotional memories, especially those related to fear and danger, to help you avoid those threats in the future. So the amygdala and hippocampus work together to create strong, detailed memories about events, particularly those with an emotional component. This allows us to learn from our experiences and respond appropriately to similar situations down the line.","308":"Ah, I see what you mean. If you can see them all in there, then it must be a finite number. That's a good observation. Let me think about this a bit more to understand it better.","309":"Okay, that makes sense. If we had infinitely many jars, they wouldn't be able to fit in this room. The room has a finite amount of space, so an infinite number of jars couldn't be contained within it. Can you think of another way to visualize or conceptualize the idea of infinity?","310":"Ah, I see what you're getting at. When I mentioned it was unlimited, that might have given the impression that there were no boundaries or constraints. But that's not quite accurate. Let me clarify a bit more about the context and limitations involved.","311":"I know what you mean! It's so frustrating when you're trying to capture a moment and your phone just refuses to cooperate. Sometimes the lighting is off, or the camera doesn't focus properly, and then the perfect shot slips away. But I guess that's all part of the challenge of being a photographer, even an amateur one.","312":"Quantum is a term used in physics to describe the fundamental, discrete units of energy, matter, and other physical quantities. It's a concept that underpins the behavior of the smallest particles in the universe, such as atoms and subatomic particles.","313":"The egg is actually more stable when it's spinning due to the gyroscopic effect. The spinning motion helps the egg maintain its upright position.","314":"I'm glad you're excited to learn about this! The quantum world can be a bit mind-bending, but it's also really fascinating. Let me know if you have any other questions and I'll do my best to explain it in a way that your friends can understand.","315":"Explainee: Yes, that is really fascinating! The phenomenon of quantum entanglement is truly mind-bending. It's amazing that even though the two pennies are physically separate, they are still intrinsically linked at a quantum level. The idea that measuring one instantly affects the other, no matter the distance, is just incredible. It really challenges our classical intuitions about how the world works.","316":"A black hole is an extremely dense and massive object in space that has such strong gravitational pull that not even light can escape from it. It's a fascinating concept in astrophysics and has been the subject of much scientific research and speculation.","317":"Ah, I see. Then I should ask about the quantity or amount of it, not the weight.","318":"So you see, when we talk about something becoming more dense, we're really talking about its volume decreasing while its mass stays the same. The object itself hasn't changed, it's just been compressed into a smaller space.","319":"The matter in the core gets compressed to such an incredibly dense state that the force of gravity becomes so strong, even light cannot escape. This extreme density and gravitational pull is what we call a black hole.","320":"Exactly! If the sun were to collapse in on itself, it would form a black hole. Black holes are regions in space where the gravitational pull is so strong that nothing, not even light, can escape. This happens when a massive star runs out of fuel and collapses under its own gravity, becoming incredibly dense and compact.","321":"Yes, that's right. The gravity of the black hole is so strong that even light, which normally travels at the fastest speed possible, cannot escape from it. The black hole's gravitational pull is so powerful that it literally bends and distorts the space-time around it, creating a region from which nothing, not even light, can escape.","322":"Exactly! The idea is that the black hole is so massive and dense that it distorts the very fabric of space and time around it. This means that the space near the black hole is curved, and objects don't have to 'grab' the chair to move it - the curvature of space does the work for them. It's a really counterintuitive but powerful concept that Einstein proposed to explain the behavior of black holes.","323":"No, that's not it. Your computer sees that as a 1.","324":"The important thing to understand is that sensors allow us to gather data about the world around us. They can measure things like temperature, pressure, light, and motion, and then transmit that information so we can use it.","325":"Cells are the basic building blocks of all living organisms. They come in a variety of shapes and sizes, and perform different functions depending on their type.","326":"Yes, that's exactly right. Using nano diamonds as a way to deliver drugs and monitor the effects within cells is a promising area of research in medical science. The small size of the nano diamonds allows them to enter cells and provide a way to track the movement and activity of drugs at the cellular level. This can help researchers better understand how new treatments are interacting with the body and improve the development of more effective and targeted therapies.","327":"Exactly, that's a great observation. Stacking the cups in a certain orientation is easy, but if the orientation is different, then the robot needs to be able to balance the cups carefully to stack them successfully. This highlights how some tasks that may seem simple to humans can actually be quite challenging for a robot to perform.","328":"Right, and then have the robot drop the object here.","329":"Okay, so it sounds like we didn't give it specific instructions about the cup's location. We just told it to move over here, without any reference to the cup. That means the robot didn't have any information about where the cup was in relation to its current position.","330":"Yes, that's exactly right. To be able to detect a single electron, you need to be very close to it, typically within a few nanometers. This is where the nitrogen-vacancy center comes in - it allows you to get that level of proximity and sensitivity to the individual electron spins.","331":"So we had to make sure that our setup was properly shielded and isolated from those external signals that were interfering with what we were trying to measure. It's an ongoing challenge in the field to identify and mitigate the different sources of noise that can impact the quantum systems we're working with.","332":"Exactly, that's the key. The quantum noise that arises from the fundamental quantum nature of the system you're trying to measure is the most interesting and challenging part. That's where the real insights into the quantum world lie, because that noise is a direct window into the quantum behavior happening at the smallest scales.","333":"ARPANET was an early precursor to the modern internet. It was created in the 1960s by the U.S. Department of Defense's Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA). ARPANET was initially designed as a research network to connect computers at different universities and research centers, allowing for the sharing of information and resources.","334":"Packet switching enables something really important - it allows for multiple users to share the same network infrastructure and transmit data in small bursts called 'packets'. This was a big shift from the traditional circuit-switched networks where each connection had to have a dedicated path. With packet switching, the network could be more efficiently utilized and could support many simultaneous connections.","335":"Yes, exactly! The request-response structure was a key design principle of the early internet. The idea was to have a decentralized network where individual nodes could communicate without relying on a central authority or single point of failure. This made the network more resilient and able to adapt to changing conditions or disruptions.","336":"Absolutely, the level of abstraction is what enables all the innovation and creativity that we see in the technology ecosystem. By separating the core infrastructure from the applications and services that are built on top of it, it allows developers and entrepreneurs to focus on what they're passionate about without having to worry about the underlying complexity of the network. This abstraction is the foundation that has unleashed so much innovation and progress.","337":"Ah I see, that means there is no single entity or organization that has absolute power or control over the decision-making process or the final outcomes. It suggests a more decentralized and distributed system of decision-making.","338":"Ah, I see. So you're suggesting that the items get lost or misplaced somewhere during the delivery journey, before they reach their final destination.","339":"What made you choose three?","340":"Excellent, you're right. If I cut the box in half again, I'll have four smaller boxes. So to cover the line, I'll need four of those smaller boxes.","341":"Exactly! That's the key insight behind the box-counting method. The fractal dimension of a coastline captures how the measured length changes as you adjust the scale of measurement. If the coastline has a fractal dimension greater than 1, it means the measured length increases faster than a simple line as the measurement scale gets smaller. This reflects the intricate, irregular nature of the coastline.","342":"Absolutely, and it's important to approach it with nuance and care. Generative AI is a complex and evolving field, and there are important ethical and practical considerations to keep in mind when discussing it with students.","343":"That sounds really fascinating! I'm always interested in learning more about how our brain processes social information and how that affects our perceptions and judgments. What are some of the key questions or hypotheses you're exploring in your dissertation?","344":"So, when you're talking about perceptions and social judgments, you're really touching on the role of memory in shaping our experiences and interactions. Our memories, both conscious and unconscious, play a crucial part in how we perceive the world around us and make sense of our social environments.","345":"Absolutely, that's a really important point. The emotional response we have to a memory can have a big influence on how we interpret and act on that memory. If someone has experienced trauma, for example, the strong negative emotions associated with that memory can shape their subsequent judgments and behavior in significant ways.","346":"Actually, that's not quite accurate. When you get really close to a shape in Minecraft, the block you're looking at starts to lose its definition and becomes more pixelated. This is because the game is rendering the blocks at a higher level of detail up close, showing the individual pixels that make up the texture.","347":"The reason we're doing this is to demonstrate how subdivision surfaces work. Subdivision surfaces are a way of smoothing out the sharp edges and corners of a mesh by recursively dividing the polygons into smaller ones and moving the vertices to create a smoother, more organic shape. By repeatedly cutting off the corners of the paper, we can see how the shape starts to become more curved and rounded, which is the essence of subdivision surfaces in computer graphics.","348":"This process of subdividing surfaces into tiny triangles can take a significant amount of time and computing power, especially for complex 3D scenes with millions of polygons. Rendering a single frame in a Pixar movie can take several hours, as the computer has to calculate the color and lighting for each of those tiny triangles to create a smooth, realistic image.","349":"Great, what subjects are you particularly interested in or enjoying the most so far in high school?","350":"Well, your local network in your house connects to the broader internet through an internet service provider. Your internet service provider has connections to other internet service providers, and those connections form the larger internet infrastructure. So your home network connects to your ISP, which then connects to other ISPs and networks, creating the global network of networks that we call the internet.","351":"Yes, that's right. The internet relies on a network of undersea cables that connect various parts of the world. These undersea cables are the physical infrastructure that allows data to be transmitted across vast distances, including between continents. The cables are laid on the ocean floor and provide high-capacity, reliable connections that enable global communication and the exchange of information.","352":"You can't connect wirelessly over long distances like that. The undersea cables are necessary to physically connect the networks across the oceans. Wireless connections are great for short-range communication, but they can't match the bandwidth and reliability of the submarine fiber optic cables that span the seas and continents.","353":"Ah, I see. The variability and complexity of different food items can certainly present significant challenges when trying to develop robotic systems to handle them. How have you been approaching these more complex food items? What kinds of techniques or technologies are you exploring to overcome the difficulties with deformable or heterogenous foods?","354":"Okay, let's get started. I'm excited to share some information with you today.","355":"I can definitely understand the frustration that comes with the challenge of building AI systems that can handle a wide range of tasks. As you mentioned, even something as seemingly simple as interacting with the physical world or performing everyday tasks like doing the dishes requires an incredible amount of complex cognitive and sensory-motor capabilities that have been honed over millions of years of evolution.","356":"That's a really insightful way of thinking about it. The distinction between lower-level and higher-level cognitive processes is a useful framework for understanding the different kinds of tasks our brains handle. The lower-level perceptual and motor functions form the foundation, while the higher-level functions like memory, language, and reasoning build upon that. It highlights how even our most basic daily activities involve a complex interplay of multiple cognitive systems working together.","357":"You're on the right track! Quantum sensing refers to the use of quantum mechanical phenomena, like quantum entanglement and superposition, to make highly sensitive and precise measurements. This can be applied to things like detecting small magnetic fields, measuring gravitational waves, or imaging at the atomic scale. The idea is that by harnessing quantum effects, we can create sensors that are far more accurate and sensitive than classical approaches.","358":"I'm studying computer science. It's one of the top fields in terms of job prospects and earning potential.","359":"Yes, exactly! I'm studying the spins of the electrons in this quantum platform. The spins of the electrons exhibit quantum mechanical properties, even at room temperature, which is quite remarkable. This allows us to explore fundamental quantum phenomena in a relatively simple and accessible system.","360":"The creation of a diamond sensor is a complex process that involves several steps. Diamonds are not directly created by putting energy into them. Instead, they are typically formed over millions of years deep within the Earth's mantle under extremely high temperature and pressure conditions. To produce a diamond sensor, the natural diamond is then processed and refined through various techniques like cutting, polishing, and doping to give it the desired properties and functionality.","361":"Superposition is a fundamental concept in quantum mechanics where a quantum system can exist in multiple states simultaneously. This is a key property that enables quantum computers to perform certain computations much more efficiently than classical computers. The nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond that we were discussing can be used to create qubits, the basic units of quantum information, which can exist in superposition and enable quantum computing.","362":"No, an atomic clock is not a quantum sensor. Atomic clocks use the natural vibrations of atoms to keep extremely accurate time, but they do not rely on quantum effects in the way a true quantum sensor would. Quantum sensors, on the other hand, utilize the unique properties of quantum systems, such as superposition or entanglement, to make highly precise measurements.","363":"And you know, the incredible precision of atomic clocks has all sorts of other applications as well. They are used in areas like fundamental physics research, telecommunication networks, and even financial transactions. The ability to measure time down to a billionth of a second has huge implications across many fields.","364":"It's nice to meet you, Namina. How can I help you today?","365":"Ah, yes, touch is another important sense. It allows us to perceive the physical properties of objects, like their texture, temperature, and weight. Touch provides valuable information about the world around us and helps us interact with our environment.","366":"To get a deeper look, you'd need to use something more powerful, like a microscope. With a microscope, you can zoom in and see the details of what's underneath the surface.","367":"And that's the key, right? We're using non-destructive techniques to understand what's inside the ball without having to break it open. This allows us to study the object in its natural, intact state.","368":"It's called a zero-knowledge proof, and it's a fascinating concept in cryptography. The idea is that the prover can convince the verifier that they know a secret, like a password or a piece of information, without actually revealing that secret.","369":"One way to do that would be to use a messaging app or service. There are many popular options these days, like WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, or even email. These allow you to send text, images, or even audio and video messages back and forth with the other person.","370":"But it's actually not as impossible as it seems. There are ways to overcome the challenges and make it work, if we think creatively and approach it with the right mindset.","371":"That's interesting! Do you have any insights on whether the Large Magellanic Cloud has a supermassive black hole at its center?","372":"That's right. The most commonly understood way that black holes form is through the gravitational collapse of a massive star at the end of its life cycle. As the star runs out of fuel, the force of gravity overcomes the outward pressure, causing the star to implode and form a black hole.","373":"No, I don't mean gravitationally. I mean they are all friends, as in they know each other and have a personal relationship.","374":"You're absolutely right, it would be a supermassive black hole. When a star collapses, it can form a stellar-mass black hole, but when a whole galaxy's worth of matter condenses, it creates a supermassive black hole at the center of that galaxy. And that's what we'd be orbiting around if our solar system was absorbed by a neighboring black hole.","375":"Exactly! Multi-party computation is all about securely computing a function over distributed data, without revealing any more information than what's necessary for the result. It's a powerful concept that builds on zero-knowledge proofs and enables a wide range of applications where privacy and security are paramount.","376":"Ah, I see what you mean. When you're not trying to control or direct the randomness, the very qualities that make it challenging in some contexts can become beneficial. The unpredictability and lack of patterns can open up new possibilities and creative avenues. Please, go on and elaborate on how this shift in perspective can be advantageous.","377":"Zero-knowledge proofs are a powerful cryptographic technique that allows one party to prove to another party that they know a certain piece of information, without revealing that information itself. This can be incredibly useful in a variety of applications, from secure authentication to privacy-preserving data processing. By leveraging the cloud's scalable computing power, we can unlock even more powerful use cases for zero-knowledge proofs.","378":"Zero-knowledge proofs are a fascinating concept in cryptography. They allow one party, the prover, to convince another party, the verifier, that a certain statement is true, without revealing any additional information beyond the validity of the statement itself.","379":"Exactly! In a zero-knowledge proof, the prover demonstrates to the verifier that a statement is true without revealing any additional information. The verifier doesn't need to understand the underlying computations or logic - they can simply verify that the proof is valid. This allows for privacy-preserving interactions where the prover can convince the verifier of a fact without disclosing sensitive details.","380":"Okay, let's say I want to prove to you that I know the combination to a safe, without actually revealing the combination itself. That's the kind of thing a zero-knowledge proof can do. It allows me to convince you that I have certain knowledge, without disclosing that knowledge.","381":"So the key difference between these two colors is that green has a warmer, more vibrant tone, while blue has a cooler, more calming appearance. The contrast helps to highlight the distinct characteristics of each color.","382":"So if I were to show you the other countries, would that increase your confidence that I've colored them correctly?","383":"So, what do you think about that approach? Does it make sense to you?","384":"Exactly, this green one wouldn't have worked with the colors I showed you last time. The color palette has changed, so we need to adapt our approach accordingly.","385":"Well, the implementations of this concept can vary depending on the specific context and requirements. In general, the key implementations would involve applying the principles and techniques in a practical way to achieve the desired outcomes. This could involve things like process design, system architecture, technology integration, and so on. The specific implementation details would depend on the particular use case and goals.","386":"My research is in theoretical computer science, and infinity also plays an important role there. For example, when analyzing the complexity of algorithms, we often consider their behavior as the input size approaches infinity. The concept of infinite sets and countability is also crucial in understanding the limits of computation.","387":"A choice function is a mathematical function that takes a set of options and returns a single option from that set. It's used in decision theory and social choice theory to model how an agent or a group might choose from a set of alternatives.","388":"Okay, that's interesting. Can you tell me more about why you believe in the axiom of choice? What are your reasons for accepting it, despite the issues with the well-ordering principle?","389":"No, that's not quite right. The set of all sets is not a well-defined concept in standard set theory, as it leads to logical paradoxes. What I'm asking for is a precise cardinality, a number that represents the size of the set you're describing.","390":"That's right. Hawking's key insight was that black holes are not truly 'black' as previously believed. He showed that when you combine the principles of quantum mechanics with our understanding of gravity, black holes can actually emit a faint glow of radiation. This phenomenon, now known as 'Hawking radiation', was a revolutionary idea that challenged the classical view of black holes as completely absorbing objects from which nothing could escape.","391":"That's a great point. Even though we may not be able to create a full-fledged black hole in a lab setting, there are ways we can test and observe some of the key predictions of Hawking radiation. Looking for signs of this radiation from astrophysical black holes, or studying analog systems that exhibit similar quantum effects, could provide valuable insight and indirect evidence for this important prediction of general relativity and quantum mechanics.","392":"Fractals are intricate, repeating patterns that can be found in nature and created using mathematical principles. They are characterized by self-similarity, meaning that a small part of the fractal often resembles the whole.","393":"To do that, the computer needs a set of instructions or a 'program' that describes the characteristics of a tree, such as its shape, size, branches, leaves, and so on. This program is essentially a model or representation of the tree that the computer can use to generate an image of the tree.","394":"Yeah, exactly. That's how a lot of people feel about large-scale manufacturing or mass production. The time and effort required to create each individual item can become overwhelming when you have to produce them in large quantities. The efficiency and cost-effectiveness of mass production has to be weighed against the loss of the personal touch and craftsmanship that goes into making something unique.","395":"Fractals are a type of geometric pattern that can be generated through computer programming. They are created by repeatedly applying a set of mathematical rules or algorithms to create intricate, self-similar designs. In order to generate and manipulate fractals on a computer, you'll need to learn some basic programming concepts and techniques.","396":"Exactly, that's a great point. The small data loads from IoT devices can be a real advantage. As long as you have a scalable and efficient system in place to handle all those small data transmissions, the overall complexity doesn't have to balloon as you add more devices. The key is finding the right architecture and tools to keep things streamlined even as the number of connected devices grows.","397":"Exactly, that's a great example. IoT devices typically have much lower data rates compared to more powerful wired devices. The data requirements for things like temperature sensors, motion detectors, or other basic IoT sensors are usually just a few bytes or kilobytes per second at most. The emphasis for IoT is often on low power and low bandwidth rather than high throughput.","398":"That's a really interesting idea! Analyzing how the acoustic landscape is affected by daily traffic patterns could provide valuable insights for urban planning and policy decisions. Having access to those distributed sensor datasets would be crucial for a project like that. What kind of collaboration or data sharing arrangements do you think would be most effective in leveraging that data for your research goals?","399":"That's really interesting! What aspects of quantum optics have you been focusing on and how have you been applying those ideas to your work in quantum computing?","400":"Exactly! Quantum computing is still a nascent technology with a long way to go before it can pose any real threat to modern encryption. The hype and fear-mongering around quantum computers breaking encryption in the near future is largely unfounded. We're still a long way from that kind of capability.","401":"But that's actually not the case. Many tasks that are trivial for humans, like recognizing objects in a photo or understanding natural language, are incredibly difficult for AI systems to do. The human brain is remarkably good at processing and understanding the world around us, in ways that are very challenging to replicate in machines.","402":"Okay, let me show you something. I have a simple task that seems really easy for humans, but it's actually quite difficult for current AI systems to do.","403":"Okay, now I'd like you to take the penny in your left hand and drop it back into your right hand. Then, I want you to switch the penny back to your left hand again. This simple exercise helps demonstrate how our brains process spatial information and hand-eye coordination.","404":"Alright, now try to navigate the course again with your eyes closed.","405":"Ah, I see. The sound of the object hitting the ground helped you locate where it fell and prompted you to pick it up. That's a great example of using your senses to gather information and respond appropriately. The ability to pick up on those kinds of cues and respond accordingly is an important skill to develop.","406":"No, robots don't really know when they've messed up. They don't have the same kind of self-awareness or understanding of their own capabilities that humans do. Robots are designed to perform specific tasks, and they just follow their programming. They don't have the same emotional reactions or cognitive abilities that would allow them to recognize their own mistakes or shortcomings.","407":"For example, if a dog does a trick correctly, you might give it a treat as a reward. The dog then learns that if it performs that trick, it gets a reward. Similarly, in reinforcement learning, the robot tries different actions and gets some kind of reward or penalty based on how well it does. Over time, the robot learns which actions lead to the best outcomes and it starts to choose those actions more often.","408":"That's really impressive! The ability to create such intricate and beautiful fractals with just a simple computer program is quite remarkable. It just goes to show how accessible and powerful these tools have become, even for young people. It's amazing what can be achieved with a bit of creativity and experimentation.","409":"That's a really interesting story! It's amazing how you were able to draw inspiration from something as simple as pouring cream into coffee and translate that into a solution for simulating turbulence in computer graphics. Observing the natural world around us can often lead to these kinds of breakthrough insights. It's a great example of how creativity and problem-solving can come from unexpected places.","410":"That's right, you get it all when you do that.","411":"Exactly. When everyone understands scaling, it becomes easier to collaborate and make progress on complex projects. Scaling is a crucial aspect of effective teamwork and problem-solving.","412":"You're absolutely right. The amount of data required to store a complete and detailed virtual world would be astronomical, far beyond the capabilities of current computer hardware. The limitations of storage and processing power make it infeasible to create a truly comprehensive digital replica of the real world.","413":"Exactly. Ken's approach was very similar to Bob Ross's - making art accessible and approachable for everyone, while still producing stunning and captivating works. He wanted to empower people to unleash their creativity, just like Bob Ross did with his iconic painting tutorials.","414":"Exactly! That's a great example. Your memory of the 'meh' orange juice from your childhood could influence how you perceive and enjoy the orange juice you have on vacation. So that memory can provide an important context for understanding and appreciating the new experience. It's a good illustration of how our past memories can shape our present perceptions and judgments.","415":"Great choice! Pixie sticks are always a crowd-pleaser. Now, let's consider how this decision-making process relates to your overall memory and how it can guide your choices in the future. By remembering which candies you enjoy, you're able to make a more informed decision that aligns with your preferences. This is just one example of how our memories can help us navigate daily decisions and make better choices moving forward.","416":"I can see why you enjoy math. The complexity and challenge of solving mathematical problems can be really rewarding. What is it about math that you find most fascinating or intriguing?","417":"Okay, let me explain why I don't want to tell you. I have a good reason for keeping it to myself for now. I hope you can understand and trust that I have your best interests in mind.","418":"Aha! I knew you would be able to see the puffin through the hole. That means I do know where the puffin is, without having to reveal its exact location to you. Does this help demonstrate my knowledge about the puffin's whereabouts?","419":"That's why it's so important to be really careful with using public WiFi networks. Hackers can easily intercept the data being transmitted and steal your login credentials or other sensitive information if you're not using a VPN or other security measures. It's best to avoid logging into any accounts or sending personal information over public WiFi if you can.","420":"Well, it's a relatively new concept that has been gaining traction in recent years. Let me explain a bit more about it.","421":"No, the most challenging aspect for a robot to learn is not just motion, but rather the ability to generalize and adapt to new and unpredictable situations. The generalization gap you mentioned refers to the difficulty of transferring the knowledge and skills a robot has learned from one task or environment to a different one.","422":"Some common algorithms used in this type of robot learning include reinforcement learning, where the robot learns through trial and error and receiving rewards or penalties for its actions. There's also unsupervised learning, where the robot discovers patterns and structures in the data on its own, without being given labeled examples. And techniques like deep learning, which use artificial neural networks to process complex data, are also widely used in autonomous robot learning.","423":"That's an interesting point about quantum computation. What do you see as the potential benefits or challenges in applying those principles to this problem? I'd be curious to hear more about your thoughts on that angle.","424":"That's a great point. The growing diversity and size of the scientific community is really exciting. It opens up so many more perspectives and ideas that can lead to groundbreaking discoveries. With more researchers from different backgrounds collaborating, we're likely to see some incredible advancements in the coming decade.","425":"Exactly! By asking all the existing guests to move one room over, we've freed up room number one for the new guest. Even though the hotel has infinitely many rooms, we can still make space for a new arrival by rearranging the existing guests. This showcases some of the strange properties of infinity that can seem counterintuitive at first, but make sense when you understand the underlying principles.","426":"Exactly! If we have a second guest, then we would have two plus infinity, which is still equal to infinity. The key insight here is that no matter how many finite guests you add to an infinite set, the total number of guests in the room will still be infinity.","427":"No, they can't live together. The two Hilbert's Hotels are separate establishments and can't accommodate each other's guests. So we need to figure out a way to move some of the guests from one hotel to the other to make room for the guests with plumbing issues.","428":"Exactly! That's the idea. I'm going to keep moving people up by two rooms each time, creating new spaces in between. So the next step would be to take the guest from room four and move them to room six, and so on, indefinitely. This way, I can create as many new rooms as I need without ever having to ask someone to move more than a finite distance.","429":"Exactly! Precisely. So having two Hilbert Hotels, each with infinitely many guests, is equal to the same number of guests as just one Hilbert Hotel with infinitely many guests. This is the strange, counterintuitive nature of infinity and how it behaves differently than finite numbers.","430":"Infinity is a fascinating and mind-bending concept in mathematics. It challenges our intuition about the properties of numbers and the nature of the universe. Hilbert's Hotel is a thought experiment that illustrates some of the strange and counterintuitive aspects of infinity. It shows how even an infinitely large hotel can still accommodate an infinite number of additional guests, which seems to defy our common sense understanding of what is possible.","431":"I see. The internet is actually much more than just a tool for searching and watching videos. It's a vast global network of interconnected computers and devices that enables the exchange of information, communication, and access to a wide range of services and resources. It has revolutionized the way we live, work, and interact with the world around us.","432":"Ah, Matilda! That's a great one. What do you like about it?","433":"That's a good start. Let me elaborate a bit on how the video might actually travel through the network. The video file would first be broken down into smaller chunks or packets. These packets would then be sent over the network, hopping from one node or router to the next, until they reach their final destination where they are reassembled back into the complete video file.","434":"Lettuce is a type of green, leafy vegetable that is commonly used in salads and sandwiches. It's a popular ingredient in many dishes due to its crisp texture and mild flavor.","435":"I wanted to talk to you about that new project we've been working on. What do you think about the progress we've made so far?","436":"That's right. The internet is a decentralized network, where individual networks and systems operate independently, following common protocols and standards. This allows for a high degree of flexibility and resilience, as the failure of one part doesn't necessarily impact the entire network. The distributed nature of the internet is a key aspect of its design and what has enabled it to grow and evolve over time.","437":"I see. So even though encryption helps protect privacy, it doesn't completely prevent surveillance or tracking of online activities. Countries can still choose to block or restrict certain types of traffic and content within their borders. This highlights the lack of a global, unified system for regulating the internet and how different nations have the ability to control internet access and content within their own jurisdictions.","438":"And the more information you have, the better the inferences you can make.","439":"That's a good way to think about it. A function is a relationship between two sets, where each element in the first set is paired with exactly one element in the second set. The input is the element from the first set, and the output is the corresponding element from the second set.","440":"Yes, that's right! We can match negative one with the natural number two. And then we can continue this pattern, matching negative two with three, negative three with four, and so on. This creates a bijective function, where every integer is paired with a unique natural number, and vice versa. This shows that the set of integers and the set of natural numbers have the same cardinality, or the same size of infinity.","441":"Exactly! That's the pattern we're seeing. The positive integers correspond to the odd natural numbers, and the negative integers correspond to the even natural numbers. This helps us establish a one-to-one correspondence between the natural numbers and the integers.","442":"Exactly! For every rational number, there is a corresponding pair of integers that represents that rational number. The set of all these integer pairs, the integer lattice, is a way to geometrically visualize and count the rational numbers. Each dot in the lattice corresponds to a unique rational number that can be expressed as the ratio of the two integer coordinates of that dot.","443":"Yes, it's a fascinating result that the infinities of the natural numbers and the rational numbers are the same size. This is a powerful insight that shows how different types of infinity can be compared and related to one another. The process of using an injective function to establish a bijection between the sets is a key technique in understanding the relative sizes of different infinities.","444":"Exactly! That's the key. By changing at least one digit, we're creating a new real number that is distinct from all the numbers in the list. No matter how large or small the list is, we can always construct a new real number that is not on the list. This is the core idea behind Cantor's diagonal argument, which proves that the set of real numbers is uncountable.","445":"This means that the real numbers and the natural numbers cannot be put in a one-to-one correspondence. In other words, the cardinality of the real numbers is strictly greater than the cardinality of the natural numbers. This is a profound result in mathematics, as it demonstrates that there are different 'sizes' of infinity.","446":"Yeah, that's a really important point. The training time can vary a lot depending on the architecture of the neural network, the amount of data you're using, and the computational resources available. Larger and more complex models tend to take much longer to train than simpler ones.","447":"In a quantum computer, the fundamental unit of information is the qubit, which can exist in a superposition of 0 and 1 states. Instead of classical logic gates, quantum computers use quantum gates that operate on these superposition states. The key difference is that quantum gates can exploit quantum mechanical phenomena like entanglement and interference to perform computations in a fundamentally different way from classical computers.","448":"And that's where the power of quantum computing comes in. By being able to manipulate the quantum states of these devices, we can perform computations in a fundamentally different way than classical computers. Instead of just having bits that can be either 0 or 1, we have qubits that can be in a superposition of 0 and 1, allowing us to explore many possible solutions simultaneously.","449":"To encode information in a quantum computer, we use the quantum mechanical properties of particles, such as the spin or polarization of electrons or photons. These quantum states can represent the 0 and 1 of classical bits, known as qubits. The key difference is that qubits can exist in a superposition of both 0 and 1 states simultaneously, unlike classical bits which are limited to only one state at a time.","450":"In other words, the output of the algorithm should be the same every time you run it with the same inputs.

I do find myself feeling that way at times - like I'm going through the daily grind without really being fully present or connected to what I'm doing. It can be easy to get caught up in the routine and lose that sense of purpose or engagement. Do you ever experience that yourself? I'm curious to hear your perspective.","10":null,"11":"That's a good point. When there are no obstacles, it's quite easy to move around freely in space.

Do you think there's a significant physical component beyond just the mental aspect of learning an instrument?","16":null,"17":"I see, that makes sense. So in that scenario, the star doesn't actually undergo a violent explosion as the popular conception of a supernova might suggest. Instead, the star simply implodes inward, with all of its matter and energy getting drawn into the resulting black hole without any visible outward event. It's an intriguing concept that challenges our intuitions about supernovae.","18":null,"19":null,"20":null,"21":null,"22":null,"23":"You know, the distinction between these two ideas is actually quite fascinating.

The small differences in growth rates can be challenging to manage, especially for larger-scale applications.

Do you have any habits or rituals that help you wind down and prepare for a restful night? I'm always eager to learn about different sleep strategies that work for people.","41":"You're absolutely right, sleep is not a simple on-off state. It's a dynamic process with multiple stages that serve distinct physiological functions. Each stage of the sleep cycle - from light sleep to deep sleep to REM sleep - plays an important role in refreshing the mind and body. Understanding these nuances can help us better appreciate the complexity and importance of getting quality sleep.","42":null,"43":null,"44":null,"45":"That's quite impressive that you can sleep for that long! What do you find helps you be able to take such lengthy naps? Is it just that you're able to fully relax and unwind, or are there particular factors that contribute to you being able to sleep for several hours at a time?","46":null,"47":"Ah yes, the three classic states of matter - solid, liquid, and gas.

The current flows counter-clockwise in the magnetic field. Now, if we reverse the direction of the current, how do you think the magnetic field lines will change? I'm curious to hear your thoughts on that - it's a really interesting concept that reveals a lot about the relationship between electricity and magnetism.","51":null,"52":"Yes, compared to just using hydrogen, the deuterium-tritium fusion reaction has some key advantages. The resonance effect you mentioned helps lower the energy barrier required to initiate the fusion process, making it a more promising approach for practical fusion energy production.","53":"Hmm, that's an interesting challenge. Could you tell me a bit more about the specific application or process you're working on that requires maintaining the plasma temperature? I'd be happy to discuss some potential approaches or troubleshooting steps that could help address the cooling issue you're experiencing.","54":"That's a reasonable target to aim for. Everyone's sleep needs can vary quite a bit though, depending on factors like your activity level, stress levels, and overall health.

Biology and computer science have a lot of overlap, with fields like bioinformatics, computational biology, and artificial intelligence. What particular areas of those disciplines most interest you? I'd be curious to hear more about what drew you to study both - it seems like an intriguing blend of subjects.","63":"That's a great place to start. Can you explain a bit more about how you understand the first four dimensions? I'm really interested to hear your perspective on this topic. What do you see as the key characteristics or properties of each of those dimensions?","64":"Alright, let's try this. Visualizing the two dimensions at right angles to each other is key. I'll need to imagine the space and how those two dimensions would intersect to form a 2D plane. Go ahead and give me that second dimension, and I'll do my best to hold them perpendicularly.","65":"Okay, I understand this might seem challenging. Let's take it step-by-step. First, focus on holding one object at a right angle to the others. Once you've got that, try adjusting the other two to be at right angles as well. Don't worry if it takes a few tries - just let me know if you need any guidance along the way.","66":null,"67":"That's a great point. In the polar coordinate system, we can describe the location of a point by its distance from the origin and the angle it makes with the positive x-axis. This is different from the Cartesian coordinate system, where we use the x and y values. The polar coordinate system can be useful in certain applications, as it allows us to represent points in a more natural way for some problems.","68":null,"69":"You're right, the orange peel analogy does help illustrate the different layers of the Earth's structure. The crust is the thin, outermost layer, followed by the thicker, denser mantle, and at the very center is the core. It's a useful way to visualize the internal composition of our planet.","70":"You're right, celestial coordinate systems have two main dimensions to precisely locate objects in the sky. Right ascension is similar to longitude and measures eastward along the celestial equator. Declination is like latitude and measures north and south from the celestial equator. This allows us to track the positions of celestial bodies even as the Earth moves through space.","71":"You're right, it can be quite unsettling. We don't have all the answers, and the more we discover, the more questions seem to emerge. But that's what makes scientific exploration so captivating - the thrill of uncovering new mysteries and pushing the boundaries of our understanding.","72":"That's really interesting that you were exposed to that concept early on in your graduate studies. I'd be curious to hear more about how you've seen it develop and change over time.

I'm really interested to hear your thoughts on the different types of side channel attacks and how they might be mitigated through hardware or software defenses.","168":null,"169":null,"170":"I see your point. Even if something is technically illegal, the moral considerations can be complicated. However, I think it's generally best to try to find legal ways to address our needs and concerns, rather than breaking the law, even if the law seems unjust. What alternatives do you think might work in this situation that would stay within the bounds of the law?","171":"That's fascinating! I'd love to hear more about what you've been working on. What have you been finding in your research on side channel analysis and fault attacks? Are there any key takeaways or interesting vulnerabilities that have come up that you think are important for people to be aware of?","172":null,"173":"Could you share a bit more about what specifically makes that option sound better to you?

I'd be interested to hear your thoughts on some of the other potential use cases for machine learning in businesses.","197":null,"198":null,"199":"Yes, that's a very good comparison. A magnifying glass is a type of lens that gathers and focuses the light into a concentrated point, much like the lens we use for cutting steel. The idea is to channel all the light energy into a small, intense area to generate the necessary heat and force to cut through the material effectively.","200":"That's a great point. Since light always travels at the speed of light, the time and spatial dimensions are closely linked. This means the energy of light can be concentrated not just in a small spatial region, but also in a brief temporal duration. This concentrated energy is what gives light its intense and powerful qualities.","201":null,"202":"Awesome, let's dive in! What topics or areas are you most interested in learning more about?

Let's shift our focus to the outstanding items that still need to be addressed. We'll review those in a systematic manner and ensure they are all resolved.","210":null,"211":null,"212":"Yes, that happens to me all the time! It's so disorienting when you think you're the one moving, but it's actually the other train. Our senses can really play tricks on us like that. I think it's because our brain is so used to feeling stationary when we're sitting still, even though we're actually moving along with the train. It's a good reminder that our perception doesn't always match up with reality.","213":null,"214":"Wow, that does sound really fascinating! I'm always intrigued to learn more about the hidden forces that may be shaping the world around us. Could you tell me a bit more about what you've discovered? I'd love to hear your perspective without getting too far into any potentially sensitive details.","215":null,"216":null,"217":"That's an interesting concept.

Gravity is the force that pulls objects towards each other. It's what keeps us anchored to the Earth's surface and stops us from floating off into space. The Earth's gravitational pull is what keeps us grounded and prevents us from drifting away.","233":null,"234":null,"235":"Oh, that must have been startling! Are you okay? Please let me know if there's anything I can do to help make you feel more comfortable.","236":null,"237":"My apologies, it seems I may have misunderstood your initial statement. Could you please clarify what you meant by a heavy object? I want to make sure I address your original concern correctly.","238":null,"239":null,"240":null,"241":"Exactly, the gyro frequency is the key parameter that describes the spiraling motion of charged particles around the magnetic field lines. This frequency is an important concept in understanding the behavior of these particles in electromagnetic environments.","242":"I see. The brain is incredibly complex, with many different regions that work together in intricate ways.

I'm always looking for new ideas to try with my own feline friends.","245":"That's a great observation! You're absolutely right that a flashlight has a wider, more diffuse beam of light compared to the focused, concentrated beam of a laser. The laser dot is indeed much smaller and more intense than the broader illumination from a flashlight. The way the light is produced and focused makes a big difference in how they appear and what they can be used for.","246":null,"247":null,"248":null,"249":"The red light you're referring to is typically an LED indicator light that signifies the device is powered on and operational. This visual feedback provides a clear signal that the system is active and functioning as intended. The presence of this light helps confirm the device is receiving the necessary power to run properly.","250":"That's really fascinating. The way that tessellations can create such intricate, geometric patterns from a simple square or rectangle of paper is truly remarkable. It's amazing to see how the folding process can transform something so basic into something so visually stunning and complex. The level of detail and precision required to construct these tessellated designs is really quite impressive.","251":null,"252":"Yes, that's right. All the folds in origami can be reversed.
