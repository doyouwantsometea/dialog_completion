that's good, because that's why you're here, and so we're talking about sleep today, and really about kind of what is the brain machinery through which we go through consciousness to unconsciousness and that transition.","1":"Okay. The best way to think about this transition is really called, it's a flip flop switch, okay? So this term comes from engineering, and the idea is that in sleep, you basically have kind of this all of nothing experience. Certainly people kind of drift off to sleep, but then all of a sudden you're unconscious, right? So it seems like it's this flip flop between the arousal system and the sleep promoting system, and it's certainly regulated, and we'll get a little bit into that, but they're certainly kind of made up of two reciprocally inhibitory processes. Okay, so we have the ascending reticular activating system. It originates in the brain stem, and there's a dorsal and a ventral arm to this, and so the dorsal arm has neurons, cholinergic neurons, that go up to the thalamus and then it projections into the fore brain, and then there's the ventral arm, and this is comprised of a whole bunch of different types of neurons, so there are monominergic, so there's kind of dopaminergic neurons that come from the periaqueductal gray, serotonergic ones from the dorsal raphae nuclei, histaminergic neurons that come from the tuberomammillary nucleus of the hippothalamus, and then noradrenergic neurons from the locus coeruleus, and so all of those are kind of working in tandem to kind of drive wake within the brain. So if we just think about drugs that are available inducing wakefulness, we can certainly, kind of the dopaminergic ones jump out, right? So we have amphetamines that kind of drive those signaling, and then modafinil, which is a wake promoting drug for people that have kind of excessive day-time sleepiness that maintains alertness throughout the day.","2":"And do we know much about why, or which stages of the sleep cycle are affected? You know, if you take amphetamines, is it then when you go to sleep, that you're not able to transition through each of the sleep periods, or is that less clear?","3":"You know, so I think that's less clear. In some ways, you know, getting back to this idea of this wake-sleep system, we have this sleep system that is kind of the counterpoint to this wake arousal system, and so the primary nucleus region is the ventral lateral pre-optic nucleus, also called VLPO, and that has particular neuron outputs that release GABA and galanin, which work in an inhibitory way on kind of the wake promoting ones. And so, it's kind of this delicate balance of these two systems that are ongoing. In your cognitive neuro-science training, right, it sounds like it's pretty specific and focused in a particular part of the brain, the cerebellum, and one thing that I'm interested in is you bring a participant into the study, have you ensured that they got a good night's sleep? Have you asked them about their sleep?","4":"You know, what we do in our studies, is we actually track people, for say a week, and they have to get in within this range of amount of sleep and then it has to be both amount of sleep and how stable it is. That variability can kind of impact it and certainly might have an impact on the machinery that's happening in the brain.","5":"A lot of people will see you as somebody who's drank in harmony their whole life. They've seen so much harmony, heard so much harmony. How do you make the choices, there's so much that's possible when you know stuff. How do you have the courage to make a choice?","6":"Yeah, yeah, yeah. I find it fascinating in music to think about, you know, say I arrive in a place, if I'm going, say I'm going to D flat major. And there's something you once taught me. You taught me this song Don't Follow the Crowd.","7":"But at that moment, I'm coming from here, and I wanna forge some, some solution. I get myself in a situation. (keyboard music)","8":"'Cause, you know, I just wouldn't think to use that chord in that situation. And there it was! And, you know, if you read the rule book, it's, that not in it.","9":"Something like that. And that's not 'cause like emotionally, it's almost like I'm here, I'm arriving here. But, if the base note is the same, it's like this inevitability about it, it's like I was there all along.","10":"Yeah, yeah. It's like one thing is moving in one direction and one thing has arrived, so it's this tension and it's glorious. I love thinking about these things emotionally, just because that's a feeling, I know that feeling in my life.","11":"And so, we could play a bit of that if you want to. And we could talk about some stuff. I've been doing it in F. (keyboards playing Amazing Grace) (laughing) Thanks Herbie, that was a trip.","12":"It's a good one. The melody on its own just goes. (hums Amazing Grace) That melody on its own is kind of lonely, right? And no one really knows how it feels. (plays and hums Amazing Grace) So which one did you prefer?","13":"Yeah, ah, that's great. I can decide how I want this melody to feel and the more notes there are, the more exciting it is. That's what musical harmony is. Does that make sense?","14":"Its basically a delay and it happens in all parts of the system: monitors can be a big one. Like consumer televisions can often have 15 milliseconds or more of latency just in the TV part. And then you've got the processing and the computer and all of these add up to the total latency.","15":"30 years ago, you had desktop PCs which were, you spent whatever on that, but there was always this idea well you could spend a million dollars and buy a super-computer and its gonna be a lot faster. And that's not really true today. For scalar processing, when you just do one thing after another, a high-end, overclocked, cool gaming PC is about the fastest thing in the world. It is within a very small delta, yeah for some things you'll get some IBM power system that might be a little bit faster, but not a whole lot. So if I'm looking at this and saying we need to be five times faster. What do you do? You can't just say make each thing faster. As a developer you're making a trade-off, I can put my effort into making this more efficient or making it more fun. And more fun usually wins out for very good reasons. So there's some good judgment and trickery that goes into the design of things. But you can always just design a game that will just not work well. (laughing) I mean in the old days, games had to be so precisely designed. Nowadays you've got a ton more freedom. You really can--","16":"That's right. When we teach machines to learn from data, to build a model from that data or a representation of that, and then to make a prediction. One of the places we often find machine learning in the real world is in things like recommendation systems. So do you have an artist that you really like?","17":"It's a great question. The machine can understand whatever we tell it to understand. So there might be a person thinking about things, like the pitch or the pacing or the tone, or sometimes machines can figure out things about music or images or videos that we don't tell it to discover, but that it can learn from looking at a lot of different examples. Why do you think companies might use machine learning?","18":"Now, that makes the gravitational field incredibly strong around the neutron star. So what would happen if we were on a neutron star, because of the gravity?","19":"Black holes are so amazing that when the neutron star stops and there's something actually there. There's material there. If it's so heavy it becomes a black hole, so it keeps falling, once the event horizon of the black hole forms, which is the shadow, the curve that's so strong that not even light can escape, the material keeps falling. And like you said, maybe space-time breaks down right at the center there, but whatever happens, the star's gone, that black hole is empty. So in a weird way black holes are a place and not a thing.","20":"There isn't a sensible way to talk about it yet, and that probably means that's where Einstein's theory of gravity as a curved space-time is beginning to break down, and we need to take the extra step of going to some kind of quantum theory of gravity. And we don't have that yet. So even though the black hole isn't completely understood, we do know that they form astronomically, that in the universe things like neutron stars form and things like black holes form. The consequences are very much speaking to this curved space-time. So, for instance, if two black holes orbit each other, they're like mallets on a drum, and they actually cause space-time to ring, and it's very much part of gravitation. The ringing of space-time itself, we call gravitational waves. And this was something Einstein thought about right away in 1950-1960, he was thinking about that.","21":"[Janna] Yes, they ring space-time also like a drum, and you can record the sound of that ringing after a billion years, when it's traveled through the universe. But then the next thing that happens is those neutron stars collide, and because of this incredibly high energy state of matter, which you study, it becomes this firework of different explosions. It's really quite spectacular.","22":"So when the gravitational waves were recorded and they realized, oh this sounds like, you can reconstruct the shape and size of the mallets of the drum from the sound, these sounds like neutron stars colliding, not black holes. And so, like you said, there was a trigger for satellites and experiments all over the world to point roughly in the direction that the sound was coming from. So, from your point of view, they're like two super-conducting giant magnets colliding, an experiment you could never do on Earth. That's just the most tremendous scales and peculiarities of matter.","23":"Not an experimental one. So, our theme here today is dimensions. So this is great that you have some math background because mathematicians think about dimensions in a different way.","24":"Now, in some sense that's kind of trivial to you and me, because of course you have space, which is three dimensional, you have time which is one dimensional, so spacetime is four dimensional. But it didn't turn out, it didn't occur to anyone that that was a sensible way to talk until really relativity. This is the crucial thing, right? Is that what Einstein realized is that sure there's both time and space, but how we divide spacetime into time and space can be different for different people, and really there's a real sense in which four dimensional spacetime is kind of a generalization of three dimensional space. And I think to really explain this we're gonna need a blackboard.","25":"Let's bring one in. All right. The thing about relativity is that they really want you to think of spacetime as one four dimensional thing, right? It's kind of like space. It's not just three dimensions of space and one dimension of time.","26":"Why? This is a very good question. So, let's just start with space, right? We know a little bit about space. So here's my simple minded way of drawing space two dimensions, because that's how many I can draw on the blackboard. Let's say X and Y. And what is special about space, there's many things, but one is that if I have a curve or a path between two points, there's a distance that you can calculate, right? And the distance between those two points doesn't depend on your coordinates. It doesn't depend on whether you're in radial coordinates or Cartesian coordinates, or whatever. I'm allowed to imagine a curve that does something like this between those two points, and if I were a person walking on that curve, I would have an odometer with me maybe, and I would know, you would know, even without having done that, this path is always gonna be longer than that path. There's a formula, Pythagoras' Theorem that tells you what the shortest distance path is. That's the point. The physical-ness of what is real is the distance along a certain curve. So spacetime is like that. That's why it is useful to think about spacetime.","27":"So let me draw spacetime. Here's how we usually draw it. I'll just say X, but all of space is condensed in this one direction, and this is time, okay? So if you're a little person and you started some event, so you start, you're located somewhere in space, somewhere in the three coordinates of space, and whether you like it or not, you're moving through spacetime just by getting older.","28":"And it's almost exactly like the space story. The space story says there's a distance, distance is different along different curves. Einstein says there's something that measures the length of these curves, and we call it the proper time. It is literally the time that you would read on your wristwatch.","29":"Well kind of. What Einstein wants to get across is there's no such thing as fundamental, like there's the universe's time, this big letter T that might tell you how old the universe is, but then every individual has a clock with them, and they measure their own time depending on how they're moving through the universe.","30":"And the crucial difference is that time is not the same for this person who stayed behind and sat in their chair, and this person who zoomed out there.","31":"There is what we call a metric on spacetime, and when we talk about Euclidean space versus a curved space, versus a sphere or something, that's a different metric. And spacetime has its own metric which says the following thing, that the path between two events in spacetime that is a straight line, will always be the longest time.","32":"So when Einstein had this idea, oh gravity could be related to the curvature of spacetime, he did some equations, so he got it, that's a long story, we'll put that aside. What he figured out was that rather than gravity living on top of spacetime, it's a manifestation of the curvature of spacetime so when you have like the earth, the sun, the moon, they cause a gravitational field, they're actually warping the spacetime around them. They're giving it a different geometry.","33":"Yeah, exactly. If you had a sheet that was originally flat, and you set a marble on it, it would go in a straight line, but then if you put something on it so it warps it, that marble is now gonna be deflected.","34":"Yeah, that's right. And it goes exactly back to what we drew on the board where how those two people in the train and on the ground would divide spacetime up differently to space and time.","35":"So a nice place to start is with the idea of a triad. A triad is a three-part harmony, basically. (keyboard harmonic tone) So that's a triad. So this triad's called C major.","36":"So in Amazing Grace, you start with F. You know, if I go (melodic humming) \u266a How sweet the sound \u266a (scat singing) (laughs) Where am I right now? I don't know where I am. (scat singing) And my job is to get back home, but to make this chord make sense.","37":"You know, a lot of people, a lot of string theorists, they care a lot about all the different ways in which we could hide the extra dimensions. As someone who cares about cosmology, I wanna start asking why are the extra dimensions small at all? How did that happen? Is this something you think about yourself?","38":"The thing I want to talk about is this paper I wrote with Matt Johnson and Lisa Randall where we realize there's another way to compactify extra dimensions spontaneously, dynamically. If you imagine starting with this big piece of paper you couldn't wrap up everything, but within some region of space you could make a tube.","39":"Right? And down there in the tube it looks like your long thing that is compactified in one direction and infinitely extending in the other direction, so there's one less macroscopic dimension of space.","40":"Yeah. So we certainly assume that they're all large as a starting point, and it's worse than that. So in our paper we imagine you start in de Sitter space. You start in a universe with no matter, no anything like that, just empty space but with an energy that is positive and all the dimensions are large.","41":"Yeah, I've been trying to explain this to lower levels, and they always look at me like, are you pulling my leg here a little bit? Or is this the real thing that they use? Yes, it is the real thing they use. We study these branes in de Sitter space, and so what we found is that there are black brane solutions which instead of having a singularity inside are non-singular, and stable, and compactified. Is this a familiar thing? I know things like this have been discussed, right?","42":"Right. Imagine that rather than going down to a point, it just asymptotes to some fixed radius that continues infinitely far down there. But then you can ask, okay what about the rest of the universe? You have some sphere, some two dimensions compactified, and the balance between the cosmological constant and the electromagnetic field keeps it at a fixed distance.","43":"I guess. I mean, maybe you'd think otherwise. Again or maybe you could change my mind, I think that as long as it can happen it will happen some of the time, right?","44":"Someone probably wrote it for him. So it's possible that if you do have this starting point of an empty de Sitter space with positive cosmological constants and fields lying around you inevitably get a multiverse. It just happens, you know, it's just part of quantum nucleation to different things, and then maybe you need to explain why we live in this universe rather than some other one via the anthropic principle or something like that. So how does our kind of, you know, low-tech old fashioned way of making new universes intersect with the kinds of things you'd think about.","45":"And I just wrote a book called Something Deeply Hidden about many worlds, quantum mechanics, and how spacetime can emerge from it. Plenty of reading material for the audience out there.","46":"The reason we're not just flying off the earth is because earth has gravity, so if we throw something up, it comes back down, so that's why when we're walking on the earth, we don't fly off the earth because the earth has gravity, and it keeps us down.","47":"The main thing about black hole to remember is that it's just, like I said, how the earth holds you down, the black hole pulls you in, as well. Now, try and take the ball from me, black hole--","48":"Alright, so, at some point, you can probably see it right now? So without moving your eyes, this is kind of hard, tell me how many fingers I'm holding up?","49":"You can just barely tell. And you can see that even, like if you hold out your hand and you focus on your hand, then your foot would be blurry because there's that difference there. And you can change between that, like you can then focus on your foot and your hand gets blurry. Because your eyes can see different amounts of detail in different places. So we're hoping in the future, that hardware can be like that. Where we can make a display that puts lots of detail right where you're looking. And every time you look someplace else, it moves the detail over to there. So we don't need to render a hundred times as much as we've got right now. Figuring out where you're looking is a pretty hard problem. What we try to go about this, is by taking a camera and looking at people's eyes and then try to figure out is the eye looking over here or up here. We're working hard on stuff like this right now so we hopefully can have a virtual reality that's as detailed and realistic feeling as the reality that we've actually got around us. But its going to be a long time before we get to where we can really fool people.","50":"I don't know if people are working on that because I'm not so much in the medical field, but I should look into that and see if that's a possibility. So after hearing about high intensity lasers, can you think about next time you go back to the lab and you're wondering how to do something in the lab with lasers, can you see how short pulses might help you?","51":"As an engineer of course, I love quantifiable things. I like saying here's my 18 millisecond motion to photon, here's my angular resolution that I'm improving. I'm doing the color-space right. But you can look not too far back where you say we have blu-ray DVDs at this amazing resolution, but more people want to watch Youtube videos at really bad early internet video speeds. Where there are things that if you deliver a value to people then these objective quantities may not be the most important thing. And while we're certainly pushing as hard as we can on lots of these things that make the experience better in potentially every way or maybe just for videos or for different things. I don't think that its necessary. I've commented that I think usually my favorite titles on mobile that are fully synthetic are ones that don't even try, they just go and do light-mapped, black-shaded. And I think its a lovely aesthetic. I think that you don't wind up fighting all of the aliasing. While you get some other titles that, oh we're gonna be high-tech with our specular bump maps with roughness. And you've got aliasing everywhere, and you can't hold frame rate and its all problematic. While some of these that are clearly very synthetic worlds where its nothing but these cartoony flat-shaded things with lighting, but they look and they feel good. And you can buy that you're in that place. And you want to know what's around that monolith over there.","52":"The end goal of reality, of course in computer graphics people chase photo-realistic form for a long time. And basically, we've achieved it. Photo-realism, if you're willing to throw enough discreet path traced rays at things, you can generate photo-realistic views. And we understand the light really well. Of course it still takes a half hour per frame like it always has, or more, to render the different things. So its an understood problem and given infinite computing power we could be doing that in virtual reality. However, a point that I've made to people in recent years is that, we are running out of More's Law. Maybe we'll see some wonderful breakthrough in quantum structures or whatever--","53":"Right, you know the difference between like one dimension two dimensions, three dimensions, et cetera. So let's do a little experiment here. So there's one dimension. I'll give that to you. Now, here's your task. I'm going to give you another dimension, and I'm gonna ask hold those two things at right angles to each other. It's easy to do. Yeah, so there's no trick here.","54":"There you go. So what that's doing is when you had just two that was describing a two dimensional plane, right? Like the two things pick out a plane, the three things pick out all three dimensional space. I'm gonna give you one more, and I'm gonna ask you to hold that fourth one so that it's at a right angle to all the other three at the same time.","55":"Well, we could also say how far we are away from the center, just the distance. And then the angle that our little line makes with let's say the X axis.","56":"Time. Yes, Einstein said that we can think of time as a fourth dimension, and that's a very fascinating thing that we could talk about all by itself. But what about space? What about the solar system? Like, if you wanted to tell me where a certain star was in the sky, do you know how we do that?","57":"So astronomers call them right ascension and declination, which are two terrible words, but basically you've seen on the globe where you draw latitude and longitude, what it looks like.","58":"So you can define something as, well you know, how high above a certain location on earth it is, but the earth is rotating and revolving around the sun so we have to define separate celestial coordinates.","59":"We don't know. You know, the optimistic view is that there are six, but the thing is, some of them might be really, really, really, really, really small, like way too small for us to ever see.","60":"You know, honestly out there, if you go out onto campus and talk to the physicists, half of them will say probably extra dimensions exist, and half of them say no, that's just nonsense.","61":"For my studies, I actually, when I started at UCLA in graduate school, I worked with a professor named Matt Malkin who was, gotten a lot of data observations from the Hubble Space Telescope, so that was one of my very first projects to work on, so any, space-based observatories have been a really big advantage, and then I've moved on now to the Spitzer Space Telescope. In addition to that, then there's other people who've used a lot of X-ray telescopes, NuSTAR, Chandra have used data from that. It's been a combination of both ground-based observatories, as well as space-based ones, and going everywhere from X-ray observations, not done by me, but certainly ultraviolet, and then optical, and infrared, particularly, those are the ones that I've been most involved with.","62":"That's pretty good. So gravity wants to attract us to the Earth, and the Earth to us. But the Earth is so much bigger that even though we're actually pulling the Earth a little bit to us, you don't notice it so much. You know, the Moon pulls on the Earth a little bit.","63":"[Janna] Exactly, the Moon is such a big body compared to anything else very nearby that it has the larger effect, pulling the water of the Earth. But more than the Moon, think about the Sun pulling on the Earth. We orbit the whole Sun, just the way the Earth pulls on the Moon and causes the Moon to orbit us. All of those things are acting on you and me right now.","64":"That's such a good question. No, we actually couldn't. In the Moon, gravity is weaker, you can almost float between footsteps if you look at the astronauts on the Moon. On the Earth, it's harder, 'cause it's bigger. If you go to a bigger, heavier planet, it gets harder and harder. But there are stars that have died that are so dense that there's no way we could lift our arms, no way we could step or walk. The gravity is just way too strong. Do you know how tall you are?","65":"They say that astronauts in space, definitely their spine elongates. There were two twin astronauts, one who stayed here on Earth and the other who went to the International Space Station. He was there for a long time, and when he came back, he was actually taller than his twin brother.","66":"Yeah, and that was because gravity wasn't compressing him all the time and he was floating freely in the International Space Station and his spine just kind of elongated. After a while here on Earth though he'll readjust, he'll go back to the same size. Have you ever heard of how gravity was discovered?","67":"They look the same, but this is much heavier, right? Okay, so try it, just try holding your arms up front, a little higher maybe, give them a chance to drop, and then drop them. [balls thud] [Janna laughs] Did they fall at the same time? Did they hit at the same time? So, Isaac Newton, he was also the one who realized that that's the same force that keeps the Moon in orbit around the Earth and the Earth in orbit around the Sun, and that's a huge leap. Here he is, looking at just things around him, and then looks at the stars and has this really big realization, that that's actually the same force. So, what have you learned today talking about gravity?","68":"It turns out, for people that are between the ages of 18 and 65, the agreed upon amount of sleep that people should get is between seven and nine hours, and it's really at least seven hours per night, to maintain optimal health as an adult. So at least seven hours. When we look at across all of the data that is available on like sleep and health, and sleep and psychiatric illness and those types of things, the largest risk is when people get five hours or less. What do you think is responsible for driving how much sleep you need, and things like that?","69":"Right. You can do part of this level, and you can do the other part, clearly. Got some expertise under your belt, and that's awesome, because I think that everyone should know more about sleep. And so the way that we think about what drives sleep are two independent but related processes and so they have kind of lame names. Process S and process C, and what you've kind of described is process C, and that's the master clock, right? And it helps regulate kind of the rhythms like all over your body, all your cells, and all those kind of things. It drives the release of melatonin from the pineal gland, and melatonin comes online under darkness, so when the sun goes down, your brain knows okay it's time to start getting ready for sleep, and so you start releasing melatonin, which really kind of sets the table for sleeping.","70":"Yeah, no, that's a really great question, and the same is true in places where the sun never goes down during the summer, and when it's dark all the time during the winter, and it turns out light isn't the only thing that kind of gates your circadian rhythm. But I think the thing that's really important, again there are two processes, that the other one is the S process, and that one's just kind of a really important driver of sleep. One name we call it is the homeostatic sleep drive. Kind of the longer you're awake, the sleepier you get. You stay up, you get sleepy. Time goes by, you get sleepier. Time goes by, you get sleepier. But it's actually kind of a fundamental principle for how sleep is regulated, and it's really kind of akin to like a balloon, okay? So you wake up in the morning and your balloon is flat. You've kind of like drained out all of the sleepiness. But then as you kind of go throughout the day, it kind of fills up, so you use your energy, it gets filled up. And then it gets filled up more as you get towards nighttime, right? And then when it's at this optimal amount is when you kind of go to sleep and let out all of the sleepiness again. And this is really what underlies why napping can also be bad for you. So napping's not inherently bad, but if you actually let out some of this air during the day, it's going to take longer for the balloon to get bigger, right, I see to where you feel sleepy, right?","71":"So yeah it's a light bulb and there's a couple of mirrors. Now the light bulb has to be a little bit special. It has to be a type of material that can store the energy in an excited state right? It has to stay up there really energetic and sit there for a while so that when the light comes along, it takes that energy and becomes stronger light and then the mirror sends it back and it does it again and again and again and between these two mirrors, it makes the light come out in a nice beam. In a laser, it comes out as a single color. They all come out with their waves at the same time. Every wave peaks at the same time which then makes it a giant wave and it's this giant wave that has a tremendous amount of power. So it can do something like cutting steel. But when you cut steel, or if you were cutting this floor, it's gray, it actually will absorb the light. That's why the light, you don't see it because the light isn't bouncing back or through it. So I like to use demos to explain how my laser works. So I've brought basically a hammer and a nail. I'm sure you've probably hammered a nail before into a piece of wood but the question is, if you asked yourself why it is we hit the big end and it's the tiny end that we put on the piece of wood. We could never pick up a hammer and hit the sharp end and hope this would go in to the piece of wood.","72":"Exactly. You know sometimes you want to have all of your energy not just in a small area but in the small volume and so one of the other dimensions is time or length. But with light, time and length are the same thing because light always travels at the speed of light.","73":"Into a spot. So here would be my light coming from my laser and it would just be coming down, down, down, down, down. Hit a lens and it would have to focus down. But now, all the light started out with this big of a spread so concentrated this much. Eventually it would be here, more concentrated. But by the end, right at the focal spot, that's when I get all of my light, all of the energy has been squeezed down into fitting inside this piece of paper and that's why I say that I built a laser hammer. Because when this hits a piece of glass, it just smacks hose electrons right off the atoms and there's nothing else for them to do, they have to fly away. So can you tell me what you learned and maybe about the focusing of the light?","74":"That was, it was like, oh, wow, this might be it, and then, but very early on, it was, as I just started my, it was basically my second year of graduate school, it was like, uh, this is not that simple.","75":"You know, everybody's been just coming at it from different wavelengths at the optical infrared, and, but definitely the X-rays has been one of those things where it's like, oh, finally.","76":"It does seem to be that it may not even, in parts, it may not be even connected to this tiny, little torus at all because part of the work that I did, and others have done, is that type twos preferentially live in different kinds of galaxies than type ones, which should not in any way have to do with something such a small scale. They tend to be in smaller bulged, SB and SC type spiral galaxies. So there's something also having to do with environment that gets you to be a type two, and you can still maybe, timing wise, but there's something else that's going on on a larger scale because the type of the AGN should not really correspond to the host galaxy, but it seems to. And that was one of the things that we were finding out, and that was one of the early little ideas that the, individually, just as the torus model, the unified model, can't explain everything that we were observing at the time. But it is one of those things that it's, they're super luminous, they're all over the place, and we don't have a really good picture of it, which makes it exciting to study.","77":"You try, we all gotta try. You've probably heard about sleep as this kind of, you know, it's a biological process that happens in your brain. It's really important for your body, but it's a lot more complex than that. Sleep is made up of different parts. You know, when you think about sleep, what do you think about?","78":"So our sleep is made up of different types, okay? The first one is called non-rapid eye movement sleep, or non-REM, okay? Or NREM. And then the other one, which might not be a surprise, is called REM. Rapid eye movement sleep. And those are the two main types of sleep that happen. The way that we measure that as a sleep scientist is that we'll actually bring people into the lab where they can do this at home, where we put electrodes on their scalp while they're sleeping, and that allows us to measure the brain activity that's going on during the night.","79":"You know, some of that is totally accurate, that like when your brain's more engaged by being on your phone or doing things that you really enjoy or things that stress you out or any of those types of things, it's harder to get to sleep and to kind of fall into that deeper levels of sleep. Most of the REM sleep, this dreaming sleep, happens in the second half of the night.","80":"Okay? So we wake up a lot during the night, and we just don't remember it. And you'll go back down into deep sleep, and then up again into REM, you know, in kinda these cycles.","81":"Okay. Usually we want to keep naps, like 20 to 30 minutes. When people drop into deep sleep, and then they're woken up out of a nap, most people report that they feel way worse than they did before they took the nap, and that's because you've been in deep sleep, and it's this term called sleep inertia. So what are the stages of sleep?","82":"I think to really get deep into nanomaterials and nanoscale devices, you really have to understand to some level, quantum mechanics. What it teaches us as we make these devices smaller and smaller, their properties begin to now depend on the size and the orientation of these devices. There are materials, and you're taking a 2D materials class, you know about this, that are intrinsically thin. As they're grown, as they're fabricated, they're already at the nanoscale and they possess these quantum confinement properties that as a nanotechnologist, you try to exploit. And so the first ones I wanted to talk to you about are quantum dots, have you heard of quantum dots before?","83":"So these are typically semiconductors. They can be cadmium selenide cadmium sulfide, zinc selenide and they're small clusters of atoms. They can be from 2 to 10 nanometers. What's interesting about these materials?","84":"That's correct. Yeah. Because of quantum confinement, once you get below this 15 nanometer range, the band gap of the material depends completely on the size of the material. So in bulk materials, if you want to change the band gap, you have to change the material, right? But in these quantum dots specifically, just by changing the size, you can change their band gap. And because their band gap is changing, their optical properties are different. And you can precisely tune the wavelength of light that they emit just by changing their size.","85":"There are people that are exploring using these materials for diode lasers. There are companies that are building displays from these materials. And there're even people thinking about if I take these quantum dots, and I change the chemistry on the outside so they stick to specific types of cells or tissue, that I could really do some interesting imaging and therapeutic work to track disease, even maybe to treat disease, if you can very precisely control the chemistry.","86":"It's just pretty lights. [laughing] But now that you suggested it, these were inspired by the array of quantum dots that we showed earlier. So that's the story I'm going to stick with. [laughing] I like it.","87":"So machine learning is a way that we teach computers to learn things about the world by looking at patterns and looking at examples of things. So can I show you an example of how a machine might learn something?","88":"That's true. Do you think, if we look at these pictures, do you think maybe we could say, Well, they both have pointy ears, but the dogs have a different kind of body and the cats like to stand up a little different.? Do you think that makes sense?","89":"This one's a jackal. And it's actually a kind of dog. But you made a good guess. That's what machines do too. They make guesses. Is this a cat or a dog?","90":"And so, you did something pretty amazing there. Because we asked the question, Is it a cat or a dog? And you said, I disagree with your question. It's a human. So machine learning is when we teach machines to make guesses about what things are based on looking at a lot of different examples. And I build products that use machine learning to learn about the world and make guesses about things in the world. When we try to teach machines to recognize things like cats and dogs, it takes a lot of examples. We have to show them tens of thousands or even millions of examples before they can get even close to as good at it as you are. Do you have tests in school?","91":"Which means that in the test, you're not seeing any problems that you don't know how to solve. As long as you did all your practice, right?","92":"So machines work the same way. If you show them a lot of examples and give them practice, they'll learn how to guess. And then when you give them the test, they should be able to do that. So we looked at eight pictures and you were able to answer really quickly. But what would you do if I gave you 10 million examples? Would you be able to do that so quickly?","93":"So one of the differences between people and machines is that people might be a little better at this, but can't look at 10 million different things. So now that we've been talking about machine learning, is this something you want to learn how to do?","94":"Yes, we're gonna talk about science and we're gonna talk about a very specific kinda science, about people who study brains. Do you know what a brain is? What is it?","95":"Okay, well there's more cells in your brain, like way more cells, than all the stars we can see. (Daniel gasps) (Bobby laughs) And so what the connectome is, is we'd like to know where every cell in your brain is and how it talks to every other cell in your brain.","96":"Maybe a mutual acquaintance of ours, Jasper gave a example of fault injection, and I like to use that as, when I'm trying to explain fault injection, he shows a pinball machine and the pinball machine, obviously the two inputs are the two plungers when you're playing a pinball machine, but fault injection, you can tilt the entire pinball machine, right? You're just introducing some external variable that's outside of the traditional inputs that you're used to and you've now controlled the environment in a advantageous way to the user or the player. Can you give an example of some type of fault injection that you're doing or working on?","97":"We're also scratching the surface of, like, what is possible? It's not necessarily just the system itself and not necessarily that algorithm itself. Like you said, you don't necessarily need to attack the math in some cases. You can just attack that check. And I think something that's been pretty cool is looking at higher energy particles. It's going to be maybe hard to entirely confirm, but I think it'd be really, really cool to actually see. Like, I want to see one of these faults because I haven't seen it myself. And also, how do you know that you've seen it? I've started playing with, like, setting up a cloud chamber. A cloud chamber lets you actually view high energy particles going through sort of like in a small jar with some evaporated alcohol. And I thought it'd be really cool if we put some memory chip in there, like a basic memory chip and we just fill it with some data, but then you put a camera on that area and you just watch. Assuming that there is a high energy particle that actually hits that memory, that should potentially flip the energy state of that bit. The outside microcontrollers should be able to read that and actually say, Oh wait, the data, even though I'm not changing data, I'm only reading data, and we should be able to visibly or optically see it. What I'm wondering is could that be a next area of research? Because I don't think anyone's actually looking at intentionally injecting high energy particles to take over a computer, when really, you know, that's another technique for fault injection, technically speaking.","98":"I've never seen... Maybe call it a verifiable visualization of it, right? We know it's true, you know, you can get skin cancer by going outside and having too many high energy particles hit you, but we've never seen it. And we know it can happen to a computer chip, but I've never seen both.","99":"The thing is, even if you know about that, then there's so many others that someone won't necessarily know about, because there's so many, I guess, potential areas for a fault to occur. Where do you think security is going or new research is going? Are there any new areas you think are coming out or are going to be more interesting, you know, pretty soon?","100":"You got, pretty much, you got a very good idea about it. Basically you have a star, at the core its generating energy, which is countering the pressure of all that mass trying, being pulled in by gravity. Once it can't generate that energy anymore, the core collapses, once the core is collapsing, it keeps collapsing, and collapsing, and collapsing, and that's the critical thing that makes a black hole. You have enough mass in the volume, such that the escaped velocity becomes the speed of light, once light can't escape, hence the black part. (laughs) But that's the thing, is that just because there's an intense amount of gravity very close to a black hole, things don't start behaving differently. And my favorite analogy is a vacuum, everybody thinks, like, if you point a vacuum cleaner at something, it's just gonna suck everything in--","101":"Well, you're absolutely right that the attention machine learning gets has grown dramatically. 20 years ago, going to gatherings and telling people what I was working on and seeing the blank face or the like, Where's the turn? and walk away. Like, Oh, no. The accessibility of the tooling, like, we can now do in, like, five lines of code something that would have taken 500 lines of very mathematical, messy, gnarly code even, you know, five years ago. And that's not an exaggeration. And there are tools that mean that pretty much anyone can pick this up and start playing with it and start to build with it. And that is also really exciting.","102":"And part of the challenge of it is not the mathematics of building models, but the challenge is making sure that the data is sufficiently representative, potentially high quality.","103":"Right. And so, to say that another way, when you're collecting data from the real world and then building machine learning systems that automate decisions based on that data, all of the biases and problems that are already in the real world then can be magnified through that machine learning system. And so, it can make many of these problems much worse.","104":"I am incredibly optimistic and not... Perhaps it's a personality flaw, but I can't help but look at the potential of the technology to reduce harm, to give us information that help us make better decisions. And to think that we would choose to address the big problems ahead of us. I don't think we have a hope of addressing them without figuring out the role that machine learning will play. And to think that we would then choose not to do that is just unthinkable.","105":"A lot of origami is animals, birds and things. There's also a branch of origami that is, it's more abstract or geometric, called tessellations. Tessellations, like most origami, are folded from a single sheet of paper but they make patterns, whether it's woven patterns like that, or woven patterns like this. If you hold them up to the light you can see patterns.","106":"There's no cuts in these just folding. We can build these up from smaller building blocks of folds, learn how to fold little pieces and put them together in the same way that a tiling like this looks like it's built up of little pieces. Can you make a fold that starts at the dot that doesn't run all the way across the paper?","107":"Mm-hmm. Each of these folds is peaked like a mountain and we call these mountain folds but if I made it the other way, then it's shaped this way and we call it a valley fold. In all of origami there's just mountains and valleys.","108":"So they're all reversible and it turns out that in every origami shape that folds flat, it's going to be either three mountains and a valley or, if we're looking at the backside, three valleys and a mountain, they always differ by two.","109":"That's a rule of all flat origami no matter how many folds come together at a point and I'm going to show you a building block of tessellations, it's called a twist because that center square, as I unfold it, it twists, it rotates.","110":"If I had another twist in the same sheet of paper I could make these folds connect with that, and these folds connect with that. And if I had another one up here, I could make all three. And if I had a square array and all the folds lined up I could make bigger and bigger arrays, like these, because these are just very large twists. In this case it's an octagon rather than a square, but they're arranged in rows and columns. And let's just try going along. All right, there is our tessellation with squares and hexagons. So you have now designed and folded your first origami tessellation and perhaps you can see how just using this idea of building up tiles and small building blocks you could make tessellations as big and complex as you want.","111":"Neurons are also digital. Meaning a Neuron either fires or it doesn't fire, so that's either one or zero. And it's the combination of those ones or zeros that actually produce the 10 thousand different answers that you say.","112":"So fortunately there's, I'm also doing it from space with the Spitzer Space Telescope, so particularly in the infrared, and my main interest has been to try and study the environment around the super massive black holes, not as close as where the X-rays are coming from, but clearly there's something from the X-ray corona that illuminates the rest of the accretion disk, and the dust that's further out. And so fundamentally, that's one of the key things that I'm trying to use, is trying to see how long, once you've got this sort of pulse that's generated close to the black hole, it propagates out, and so you can use optical wavelengths to see that the accretion disk lights up in the optical a little bit as it gets heated up from the X-ray, and then later on, the infrared dust, the dust absorbs it, and emits it in the infrared. And so that, I love that, the ability to exchange time for resolution, because these structures are so far away that we're never gonna get a telescope big enough where that has the resolution to see the accretion disk, or the dust distribution around--","113":"So you do see it, basically the dust sublimation radius, and you see it at, and it tells you, depending on what kind of dust it is, and it's actually one of the problems for me studying, whenever we try and do X-ray studies of low luminosity active galactic nuclei in your, by galaxies, because there're all these X-ray binaries that are also emitting X-rays, which make our lives difficult. But they're also in black holes, when it's this really interesting sort of both, it's great, but ugh, it's also a source of noise for those of us who are trying to do X-ray observations of nearby galaxies.","114":"It's a weird thing to be sitting in your own galaxy, but not be able to separate all these, four million solar mass black hole creating, next to, how massive, it's like two to three solar masses for the X-ray binaries?","115":"And this goes to the idea that you don't have a core balance, that a supernova with a black hole as its final result, actually never has any kind of expulsion, that it all just goes. (imitates sucking)","116":"Which was one idea, but again, it's, I'll leave this to your theoreticians, I think there are problems with that, as well. I call it job security. That's right. (both laugh) We have a lot of things about black holes, both in terms of their formation, or even how they exist as they are, and how they're interacting with their environment that we're still not understanding.","117":"Do you think there are going to be general principles that guide those decisions? Because right now, it's generally up to the machine learning engineer to decide what tools they want to apply.","118":"I imagine in the last few years, we've seen a lot of changes and improvements in the capabilities of NLP systems. So is there anything in that that you're particularly excited about exploring further?","119":"So we've been talking about gravity from Newton and celestial bodies, the Earth, the Moon, pulling on each other in the conventional sense of gravity being an attractive force, to the Earth creating curves in space-time, then we moved on to just diffused seas of energy and space-time as the real universe and gravitation is really just talking about space-time in general, and here we are, and you're really hardcore in theoretical physics. Where would you take the exposition of gravity from that point?","120":"So do you think there's some sense in which we shouldn't be thinking about individual universes, individual space-time, so we should be thinking about superpositions of space-times?","121":"So when we're talking about the multiverse or the Big Bang, we are really talking about gravity ultimately, and we're talking about how a theory of gravitation which we know think of as a theory of space-time has a quantum explanation, has a quantum paradigm imposed on it that will help us understand these things, and we don't have that yet. One of the things that I think is so amazing is that the terrains in which we're going to understand quantum gravity are very few. It's the Big Bang, because that's where we know that quantum and gravity both were called into action. And there's black holes. One of the most interesting discoveries is of course Hawking's discovery, kick-started a kind of crisis, right? In thinking about why quantum mechanics and gravity were so knocking heads. It was one of the most beautiful examples.","122":"So this is a huge crisis 'cause either quantum mechanics is wrong, and as you described it, it's the most accurately-tested paradigm in the history of physics, how could it be wrong, right? Or the event horizon is letting information out and violating one of the most sacred principles of relativity.","123":"That's a nice way of looking at it. So that you're not actually violating classical relativity once you're in a regime where the wave function has really peaked around a very well-defined stage.","124":"Do you think it's possible that gravity is really ultimately just quantum mechanics and doesn't exist at all in the fundamental ways that we've been talking about so far, like the Newtonian way and the space-time way, that those are just these kind of macroscopic illusions? Sometimes I talk about it in terms of temperature. Temperature is not a thing. There is no single thing called temperature. It's a macroscopic illusion that comes from the collective behavior, really quantum behavior of random motions of atoms. And is it possible that the whole of gravity is some kind of emergent illusion from what's really quantum phenomenon underlying it?","125":"Okay, so we'll do some, but I want to tell you a little bit about origami. Most origami follows two, I'll call them customs, almost like rules. It's usually from a square and the other is it's usually folded with no cuts. So these guys are folded from an uncut square.","126":"Okay. We're going to start with a model that every Japanese person learns in kindergarten, it's called a crane, traditional origami design, it's over 400 years old. So, people have been doing what we're about to do for 400 years.","127":"Let's fold it in half from corner to corner, unfold it and then we'll fold it in half the other direction, also corner to corner but we're going to lift it up and we're going to hold the fold with both hands. We're going to bring these corners together, making a little pocket and then, this is the trickiest part of this whole design, so you're going to put your finger underneath the top layer and we're going to try to make that layer fold right along the edge. Now you see how the sides kind of want to come in as you're doing that?","128":"So we'll start with the white side up and we're going to fold it in half from corner to corner, in one fold and now we're going to fold all four corners to the crossing point in the center. We'll fold it in half like a book. On the folded side we'll take one of the folded corners and I'm going to fold it up through all layers. There's a pocket in the middle. We're going to spread the pocket and bring all four corners together. Where you have original corners of the square, we're gonna just pop those out. This is one of the most satisfying moments, I think-","129":"There's thousands of other origami designs but these are some of the first people learn and this was, in fact, one of the first origami designs I learned some 50 years ago.","130":"A lot of people are seeing blockchain in the news and maybe seeing a lot of sort of initial coin offerings (laughs) and sort of monetization opportunity around blockchain and getting very excited about it. And some of that excitement is real and should be, you know, encouraged, but some of it is also hype. How do you feel about the hype cycle around blockchain today?","131":"And it's because we've had a lot of PR, a lot of proof of concept, but truthfully, this is more like a science, right?","132":"In that it's hard to compare it to some perfect future. Just like you compare autonomous vehicles to this very high standard because machines are doing it. It should be perfect. There should be zero car deaths.","133":"When you say, well, there's hundreds of thousands, millions of car deaths on the road due to human error today. I think we're in a similar place. We're going to see problems with this technology, and we are going to need to develop multiple kinds of standards that also have some flexibility. But it's going to also be a version, a system, that allows us to fix some of the things that are broken today.","134":"Yeah, it's crazy. They're really a lot of bad or malicious hackers out there who are doing just that. They're going into people's accounts and they're stealing money, but there's also another side of computer hacking where there are people who are trying to learn how those bad hackers are actually breaking in to the bank accounts.","135":"Yeah, exactly. They're looking for ways that they can create protection. It's kind of like the lock on your front door. That lock is to essentially prevent bad people from coming in or people accidentally coming in when they shouldn't. A hacker is essentially looking at a way, how can I get into this lock? But then there are the good ones who are trying to unlock it so that they can tell the company that made the lock, hey, we can actually protect people by making the lock a little harder.","136":"I started going on the computer and playing video games, but I had some ideas of my own, and that's where I started to learn how to hack. I wanted to play with my friends on this video game and just change the way that things look.","137":"That's entirely possible. They may have done it for a reason, but you may have come up with a really good idea that, do you think there are other people who might like the idea that you came up with?","138":"When you have creative ideas like that, hacking can actually allow you to change the way a system works, and that means you can change a game and how the game is played, and then you can share that with your friends and other people who like that game. Once I started learning how to do it, I found that, things that were harder for me, I could make easier.","139":"You know, you're right. When you read about some of these technologies, it does feel like science fiction. But the part of nanotechnology I wanted to talk to you about is stuff that you probably use every day, most of your day, all of the time. Can you guess what aspect of nanotechnology I'm gonna talk to you about?","140":"So this is a silicon wafer, and they're embedded in basically almost every object that you use, from a laptop, to a phone, to cars, television sets, appliances. We ended up cutting these into little squares and those repeating patterns, each of those is a processor. And those chips are what goes into all of these objects. What I want to talk to you about is how we got from where we started, and how we're able to actually fit 18 billion of these little devices in a little one inch by one inch area. They're called transistors. It's a switch. Very simply, think of it as a light switch that turns on and turns off using an electric field by applying a voltage.","141":"I went through my kid's Lego bins to build a very simple model of a transistor. And these are wired together in circuits so that you can do computation. You can do logic with them. Where nanotechnology comes into play, the way you double the number of transistors on a chip. Can you guess what you would have to do to this transistor?","142":"When you give up most of what you want? Well, sometimes that definitely happens for sure. What if I told you that this is the kind of technology that I work on that means you could trade with any kid all over the world?","143":"That's probably a good idea, maybe somebody else likes it more than you do. So normally, when people trade, they have to go to the store, or they have to know the person so they can get what they asked for. With blockchain, you can make that exact same trade, but you don't need the store, and you don't even necessarily need to know the other person.","144":"So on code.org, one of the things you've been doing is actually building a game or that they have a game and then you can actually rewire some of the inputs and outputs of that. Is that right?","145":"That's absolutely another input that exists on your computer. That's how I try to think of things is there's just a bunch of inputs. Often, if you're trying to break something or hack something, you're really saying, okay, how can I control these inputs in a way that wasn't necessarily expected?","146":"Well, that's true, we do use slingshot technology once things are out in the solar system. So, for instance, we use Jupiter and other planets so that when some of the spacecraft gets close, it'll slingshot around and it'll cause it to speed up. But mostly, around the Earth, gravity pulls things down, so when we want to send a rocket into space, when we wanna go to the Moon, when we wanna send supplies to the International Space Station, the trick is to get something moving fast enough that it escapes the gravitational pull of the Earth. Have you heard the expression what goes up must come down? It's actually not true. If you throw it fast enough, you can actually get something that doesn't come back down again, and that's basically how rocket launches work. You have to get the rocket for the Earth to go more than 11 kilometers a second. Think of how fast it is. Just one breath and it's gone 11 kilometers. If you get it to go that fast, it's not gonna come back down again. So you know the International Space Station which is orbiting the Earth? That's going around the Earth at 17,000 miles an hour. It has no engines anymore, the engines are turned off. So it's just there falling forever. So once it's out there, it's not coming back down as long as it's cruising like that.","147":"Yeah. You ever had that experience where you're sitting in a train and the other one moves and for a second you're not sure if you're the one moving?","148":"That's because in some sense, you're really not. Imagine you're in this train and it's going near the speed of light relative to the platform, but it's so smooth, then you should be in a situation in which there's no meaning to your absolute motion, there's no absolute motion. So that if you throw a ball up, you might think from the outside of the platform, be confused that when gravity pulls that back down, it's gonna hit you or something, but it'll land in your palm as surely as if you were in your living room.","149":"So imagine you were an astronaut and you were floating in empty space. You can't see anything. There's no stars, there's no Earth. You can ask yourself, am I moving? There's really no way for you to tell. So you would probably conclude, well, I'm not moving. So then your friend Marina comes cruising past you, and maybe she's going thousands of kilometers a second, and you say, Marina, you're cruising at thousands of kilometers a second, you're going so fast. But she had just done the same experiment. She was just floating in space thinking, Am I moving? There's no way to know which one of you is moving and there's no meaning to the absolute motion. The only thing that's true is that you're in relative motion, that's true. You both agree you're in relative motion, and that's clear. But neither of you can say it's actually you who's moving and I'm stationary.","150":"So, let's say you and Marina are floating in space and you can't tell who's moving. Let's say you both see a flash of light. A flash of light comes from somewhere, you don't know where. So you measure the speed of light to be 300,000 kilometers per second. But here comes Marina and she's racing at the light pulse, as far as you can tell. Two cars driving towards each other seem like they're going faster towards each other than somebody who's standing still relative to one of the cars, right?","151":"[laughs] That's exactly right. It kinda is like recharging your battery, right? And sleep is so critical for so many parts of our body and our mind, right? It plays a really important way that we learn, and it helps us kind of recover from the day before. It affects our immune system and our metabolism, all of these things that we need to kinda be healthy.","152":"And so what's really cool about this is that giraffes need to sleep like everybody else, and so the way that it does is it kind of slumps over and it gets down on its legs and it kind of becomes this ball, but what's crazy about the whole thing is they only sleep for like 30 minutes a day. 30 minutes! Because it can't waste any more time, because it can't be vulnerable for any longer. It can get eaten by lions and that kind of thing. It has kind of evolved in a way that it can still survive and still get all the restoration it needs under such a short period of time.","153":"So we think it works the same way, but maybe just like more efficiently. And so we're still really learning about how this works. Sleep science itself is kind of a new field.","154":"Really tired. Do you think you were a little crankier than usual? Yeah. That's actually really interesting, because what happens is humans and everything needs to sleep eventually, and so you can't stay up indefinitely, right? What do you think happens if you don't sleep?","155":"Right, right! So how do they do it? In the area that they live in, they need to stay cool, right? And so they spend a lot of time in the water, and so then as a consequence, they need to sleep in the water, but how do they do it? So it's really fascinating. What they do is while they're sleeping, they actually float back up to the surface and breathe without waking up. They're able to go about their whole sleep cycles but still able to breathe, because their body has adapted in a way that they can still get the oxygen that they need. It's a really amazing thing. What do you think?","156":"So now I want to talk about our last animal, and I think this one is probably the most amazing of all. Okay, so what's this?","157":"A dolphin! Yes. So dolphins, kind of like hippos, have to sleep in the water, okay? But because they're mammals, right, they need to breathe. Dolphins breathe air. They have to go up to the surface and breathe, right? And for an animal like that, it needs to figure out a way that it can sleep but also still survive, right? You know how dolphins sleep?","158":"One half of their brain at a time. So half of their brain goes to sleep, and the other half stays awake, so that they can continue to breathe and swim, and they do it in this four hours a time, so like their right part of their brain sleeps, they're able to go up to the surface and breathe. Then their left part of their brain sleeps for four hours, and it goes back and forth, back and forth, so they can kind of maintain alertness, still breathe, and survive. Is that amazing or what?","159":"Nano is kind of a funny word, right? It's a word that's used before another word, and it means one billion. What's the smallest object you can think of?","160":"A baby ant? Very good. So I have over here a meter stick, let me show it to you. And so that's a meter and if I divide it by 1000, I get a millimeter. So milli just means 1000. There's all these little lines on the ruler. And each of those little lines is one millimeter. So a baby ant is probably a couple of millimeters. So even the thing, that's the smallest thing you can think of, it's a million times bigger than a nanometer. Tiny, tiny, tiny.","161":"If I took this stick and I was to draw 1 billion lines, the distance between those two lines would be one nanometer. So that's really all it is. It's just a measure of size. But it's really, really, really tiny, smaller than anything that we can see with our eyes. The reason why, in nanotechnology, scientists, we care about things that are that small, is because there are objects called atoms. Have you ever heard of atoms before?","162":"That was a perfect explanation. But what if I told you that scientists invented a special type of microscope that not only lets you see atoms, but also lets you move them around and build things with them. Would you think that would be pretty cool?","163":"So it's called a scanning tunneling microscope. And not only can you see the atoms, but you can move them around. Atoms are kind of sticky. You can actually build things using this instrument with actual individual atoms. So if I gave you that machine, would you want to make something? Would you want to look at something very carefully?","164":"I study it because objects that are that small have really interesting properties. They behave completely different than objects that are big. And because of that, we can build really cool things with them. Like really fast computers, for example, or new types of batteries or new types of solar cells. And a lot of nanotechnology is kind of like playing with Legos. You take these small objects and you put them together to build something new. Something interesting that no one's built before. It's like Legos for scientists.","165":"You know an interesting topic is: what are the limits to what we can do with virtual reality? Where I'm pretty pleased with what we have today. What we can show people and say virtual reality, its cool. People get an amazing response from it. But we're still clearly a very, very long ways from reality.","166":"There was a huge concern about that at Oculus. And the term internally that went around was poisoning the well. They were very, very concerned. I mean for a long time there was a fight about whether gear VR should even be done, because the worry was if we let a product go out, like gear VR that didn't have those things. That if somebody saw it and it was bad, made them sick, made their eyes hurt, then they would be like I'm never going to try VR again. I tried it that time and it was terrible. And there was legitimate arguments about whether it was even a good idea to do that. And it turned out that yes, its obviously better to have all those things, but you can still do something that's valuable for the user without it. Its weird being at the beginning of a medium like this.","167":"So, when you say it's an inverse-square law, that means that the closer you are, the more strongly you feel the gravitational pull. And that makes sense. There's very few things that are stronger when you're further apart.","168":"So you can also think of a gravitational field, something that permeates all of space. Even though the earth is three stories below us, it's not as though it's pulling at us from a distance. We're actually interacting with the field at this point and there's a real interaction right here at this point. And that's nice, because people were worried that if things acted at a distance, that the way that old-fashioned inverse-square force law describes it, that it was as spooky as mind-bending a spoon, that it was like telekinesis. If you don't touch something, how do you affect it? And so the first step was to start to think of gravity as a field that permeates all of a space. And it's weaker very far from the Earth and it's closer very close to the Earth. So one way to think of this field as a field that's really describing a curved space-time that is everywhere. Forget the difficulty of the math, just the intuition comes from two kind of simple observations. One was what Einstein described as the happiest thought of his life. So, right now, you might feel heavy in your chair, and we might feel heavy on the floor and our feet, or standing in an elevator cab. And Einstein said, what does the chair have to do with it, or the floor, or the elevator? Those aren't gravitational objects. So he wanted to eliminate them, and one way to do the thought experiment is to imagine standing in an elevator that you can see out of, a black box. And imagine the cable is cut and you and the elevator begin to fall.","169":"You're in total free fall. Now, because things fall at the same rate, including the elevator and you, you can actually float in the elevator. If you just floated in the elevator, the two of you would drop, and you might not even know you're falling. You could take an apple and drop it in front of you, and it would float in front of you. You would actually experience weightlessness. It's called the equivalence principle. It was Einstein's happiest thought that what you're really doing when you're experiencing gravity isn't being heavy in your chair, it's falling weightlessly in the gravitational field. And that was the first step, to think of gravity as weightlessness and falling.","170":"Yeah, it would chase a curve, it would chase an arc. And the faster you throw it, the kind of longer the arc. So the second step to think about curved space-time is to say that when things fall freely around a body like the Earth, they trace curved paths, as though space-time itself, space itself was curved.","171":"You went, Oh. [Janna and Lisa laugh] So, that's the intuition, that's how Einstein gets from thinking that space-time is curved from the idea that, well, there's this field that permeates all of space, and what is really describing is the curves that things fall along. And from there, it's a very long path to finding the mathematics and the right description, that's really hard. But that intuition is so elegant and so beautiful and just comes from these two simple thought experiments.","172":"So you described learning in a class about light the theory of special relativity where Einstein is really adhering to the constancy of the speed of light and questioning the absolute nature of space and time. And it seems like that has nothing to do with gravity, but he later begins to think about the incompatibility of gravity with his theory of relativity. So suppose the Sun were to disappear tomorrow. Some evil genius comes and just figures out a way to evaporate the Sun. In Newton's understanding of gravity, we would instantaneously know about it all the way over here at the Earth. And that's incompatible with the concept that nothing can travel faster than the speed of light. No information, not even information about the Sun, could possibly travel faster than the speed of light. So we shouldn't know about what happened to the Sun for a full eight minutes, which is the time it would take light to travel to us. And so he begins to question why gravity is so incompatible with relativity, but he already knows he's thinking about space and time in relativity. So then he gets to his general theory of relativity where he realizes if I eliminate everything but just the gravitational field of let's say the Earth and I look at how things fall and I see that they follow curves, well, then he realizes that space and time don't just contract or dilate, that they can really warp, that they can bend and that they can curve. And then he finds a way to make gravity compatible with relativity by saying if the Sun were to disappear tomorrow, the curves that the Sun imprinted in space-time would actually begin to ripple, and those are the gravitational waves, and they would change and they would flatten out, 'cause the Sun was no longer there. And that would take the light-travel time to get to us to tell us that the Sun was gone, and then we would stop orbiting and just travel along a straight line.","173":"Well I'm thinking about the idea that there might be more than three dimensions of space. What is your impression of theoretical physicists who think about things like extra dimensions of space that they haven't ever seen?","174":"It does. In fact, one way that different universes might be created and be different from each other is that different universes could have effectively different numbers of dimensions. Like we have three dimensions around us, but there's people out there, aliens, who could live in five dimensional universes.","175":"We think that it would be, no all of this is incredibly speculative, and we don't know for sure. But the idea is that there is some deep down underlying laws that are universal and the same, but they show up differently, so they appear different. So the specific particles and forces and masses would be completely different in different parts of the multiverse.","176":"That's the good news. The bad news is that it only seems to work if spacetime is ten dimensional. [chuckles] So you would say well then it's wrong. It can't be right. Spacetime is not ten-dimensional. Spacetime is four dimensional. We've observed that. But instead, we say if spacetime looks four dimensional to us, but string theory, which might be the best theory we have of quantum gravity says it must be ten dimensional, maybe we can hide those extra six dimensions somehow. So here's how we could get lucky. We could imagine that there are extra dimensions of space that are curled up somehow that are so small that we can't see them. This is actually an old idea. It goes back to Kaluza and Klein right after general relativity was invented in 1915. But there's a more recent idea that says there could actually be relatively large extra dimensions. There could be extra dimensions that are actually that big, like a millimeter across that you would not have noticed. But here's the new, exciting idea. So let's imagine, okay. This is a piece of paper. But let's imagine this is our entire world. So, in other words, our real world is three dimensional, but let's imagine that we're just idealizing it down to two dimensions, so we all live here. You and I live here. But let's imagine that we're embedded in this bigger space. So there are extra dimensions that are actually big, okay? And let's imagine that. When I say we live on this three dimensional world what I mean is imagine that the particles that you and I are made of, right, the quarks, the leptons, the electrons and everything, all the forces we know about, electromagnetism, the weak nuclear force, the strong nuclear force, imagine they can't leave this surface. This is what we call a brane. B-R-A-N-E. Have you heard this word before?","177":"From membranes, you know. We have lines, one dimension. We have two dimensional surfaces. So if you have a line that is a vibrating physical thing, you call it a string, right?","178":"Well basically the strings are the particles that we see. It's exactly the same thing as we said for the straw, if you look at it far away it looks one dimensional. A little loop of string, so a little one dimensional circle that is vibrating. If you look at it from very, very far away, it just looks like a particle. So in string theory, an electron is a little string. A photon is a little string.","179":"Yes, string theory's even better. So the phrase Grand Unified Theory was coined in the 1970s for theories that joined electricity and magnetism. So a good string theory is gravity plus the Grand Unified Theory.","180":"It's even better. It's the theory of everything. What would you tell a friend of yours if they asked you what dimensions are, what extra dimensions are, what a brane is?","181":"That's right. And we could live there. The world we see around us, the three dimensions of space around us could reflect the fact that we are somehow stuck on a three dimensional brane trying to escape.","182":"We're gonna have to create entire new concepts of how they do trade and how they work with us, too. What kind of barriers or road blocks would you imagine are gonna happen in the blockchain space?","183":"Yeah. One of the problems that Bitcoin has faced is Bitcoins getting stolen or lost. But a lot of that actually comes from people trying to recentralize Bitcoin in different ways making themselves actually a pretty easy target.","184":"Yeah. To actually transition into the mainstream and make it useful for average people to use, we're going to need to make sure we have a lot more education, a lot more standards and probably work with a lot of enterprises to create sort of a user experience around this being a technology that is safe and usable and understandable. What is the current state of blockchain in your understanding? What's gonna have to happen next?","185":"Because the materials are so small, they're at the nanoscale, their properties are dominated by quantum mechanics, which means that even slight changes in their size, in their orientation give profound changes in their properties. And while that's very scientifically interesting, and it allows you to tune their properties by making subtle changes, from a technology point of view, it's a bit of a headache in the sense that in technology want to optimize for a property and then repeat that over and over again. So what are some of the challenges that you face in the lab related to working with these materials and then trying to incorporate them into the batteries?","186":"That's actually, I think a very common problem. We can build a device in the lab it could be a transistor, can be a battery. And then you ask the question, okay, so what's the next step? How do we take it from that lab demonstration into a technology? The kind of work that I'm very interested in is developing tools to make the exact type of materials that you want. The tools that we've used in the past for conventional fabrication just don't work with these materials because they're all grown from the bottom up. They're intrinsically small, and you have to find ways to either use chemistry or some other means to get them to assemble into the structures that you want to actually either grow specifically what you want or after you grow them, to pull out the ones that you want. You need to be able to build that same thing over and over again, with the exact same properties. No one institution, no one research lab, no one national lab is gonna solve all of these problems on their own because they are difficult problems. And there is a real important payoff at the end. And it's gonna take all of us, making our contributions to push this field forward.","187":"The first thing I want to show you is origami in the real world. This is the origami lamp. It comes shipped flat but it folds, clip holds it together. The lamp has LEDs on the inside so when we power it up we get light, we have a lampshade and we get the base.","188":"Origami applications have in common, is that at some stage the thing is flat and so whenever you need to either start from a flat state and then take it to a 3D state, or conversely, for deployables like space, you want to have it in a fully folded flat state but then take it to a 3D state, or possibly an unfolded flat state. Whenever a flat state is involved, origami is a really effective way of making the transition between those states.","189":"New problems arise when we try to make origami out of things other than paper, but also new opportunities. An example here which is a kind of a variant of the Miura-Ori. It's got a three-dimensional structure. If I stretch it one way, it expands the other but because it has these S-bends in the pattern, if you squeeze it, it doesn't go all the way flat. This is a epoxy impregnated aramid fiber and so if I put this fold pattern into it and then compress it and then put a skin on the top and bottom, this becomes incredibly lightweight but incredibly strong.","190":"Another origami challenge that comes up with these patterns is if we're going to make an aircraft out of this thing we're going to need hundreds of yards of folded origami. We're not going to do it by hand and this might be the new frontier in origami engineering, which is the design of machines that can fold patterns that have applications.","191":"It's something we've talked about a little bit that with all the richness of behavior of origami from a flat sheet, it seems like there ought to be an equally rich world of things that don't start flat but are still made from flat sheets of paper.","192":"When we were much smaller societies, you and I could trade in our community pretty easily. As the distance in our trade grew, we ended up inventing institutions, right? If you Uber or you use Airbnb or you use Amazon even, these are just digital marketplaces and platforms that help us facilitate an exchange of value. But today, we actually have a technology that allows us to trade one to one but at scale, and it's called blockchain technology. There is some kind of interface for it. You could have an app, or you could use a computer to do it, but instead of there being a company in the middle that's helping you make that transaction, it's a bunch of software code.","193":"In some cases, yeah, it is. And a lot of people in the financial industry, in particular, are looking at it from the banking side of how do we use this technology to trade things like Bitcoin or other tokens that are easier to use instead of today's currency. A lot of people think about blockchain as Bitcoin because it's sort of in the news a lot, and it's this new cryptocurrency. And it's kind of exciting. But we're actually seeing a lot more use cases for blockchain that aren't around the currency side. They're more around, how do you take any asset and be able to trade that using this same technology.","194":"So today, a lot of people are working on how to create identity structures that leverage blockchains. And one of the tools for doing that is being able to cryptographically sign for a given attribute. So your government could sign that you have a US passport or a university could sign that you are a currently enrolled student. And you could then dole out that information and control it yourself and be able to show people those certifications on an as needed basis.","195":"Really glad that you could join us. So we've been talking about sleep today, various levels of complexity. But now with you, I really want to talk about what do we know about sleep and the aging brain. Can you tell me a little bit about some of the work that you've been doing in that area?","196":"So it's interesting, so I also saw that there was also a recent meta-analysis around sleep disturbances and dementia risk, and in that study, they looked about 250,000 people in this meta-analysis, and they followed them around for 10 years, and you know, when they pulled all the samples together, they found there was a 1.2 fold increased risk for developing all caused dementia, so it sounds like both sleep apnea and then maybe sleep disturbances more generally are associated with increased risk for dementia. When I think about that, I think about how sleep lives in the brain, these neurodegenerative diseases live in the brain, and so what do we know about the causality of this? Could it be that individuals who have early onset of say, Alzheimer's, have then poor sleep kind of as a consequence of that?","197":"So within dementia risk in particular, Alzheimer's for instance, there are kind of two clear features that seem to be part of the pathology, right? So there's beta-amyloid which accumulates in the brain, and then there's kind of these tangles, this tauopathies, right? And so it sounds like sleep seems to be related to the tauopathies. What about kind of beta-amyloid?","198":"Okay, so there is this bio-directional piece, but I think perhaps the most exciting thing that happened in the sleep field, at least in my view, has been understanding the role of sleep and its clearance of beta-amyloid in the brain. This idea that sleep is kind of the dishwasher of the brain, it seems like, that you know A betta accumulates as we kind of use energy, and you know it's kind of a waste product, and the idea that if you don't clear it out, that it's going to build up and accumulate.","199":"To figure out how to do that we need to learn a little bit about what makes a point. So, let's come back to the crane. You can probably tell that the corners of the square ended up as points, right?","200":"Yeah, exactly. Actually you've discovered something pretty neat because you made your point not from a corner so you've already discovered one of the key insights. Any flap, any point, leg of the ant, takes up a circular region of paper. Here's our boundary. To make your point from an edge you use that much paper and the shape, it's almost a circle. If we take the crane we'll see if the circles are visible in the crane pattern. Here's the crane pattern, and here's a boundary of the wing, and here's the other wing.","201":"Origami artists all around the world now use ideas like this to design, not just insects, but animals, and birds, and all sorts of things that are, I think, unbelievably complex and realistic but most importantly, beautiful.","202":"I remember reading your papers when I was a student and we're all trying to create these materials and finding ways to exploit their properties. What I love, and I'm delighted that you're here to talk to us about is how you took inspiration from nature and sort of recognize that nature's figured out a way to both synthesize incredibly complex nanostructures with high functionality and how you sort of were inspired by that to do the research that you're doing now.","203":"Whenever there's a part of a spacecraft that is shaped somewhat like paper, meaning it's big and flat, we can use folding mechanisms from origami to make it smaller.","204":"Telescopes, solar arrays, they need to be packed into a rocket, go up, but then expand in a very controlled, deterministic way when they get up into space.","205":"These are the building blocks of many, many origami deployable shapes, it's called a degree-4 vertex. It's the number of lines. So in this case, we use solid lines for mountain, we use dash lines for valley. We're going to fold it and use these two to illustrate some important properties of origami mechanisms. It's important in the study of mechanisms to take into account the rigidity. So what we're going to do to help simulate rigidity is to take these rectangles and we're going to fold them over and over so that they just become stiff and rigid.","206":"So this is what's called a single degree of freedom mechanism. You have one degree of freedom, I can choose this fold, and then if these are perfectly rigid every other fold angle is fully determined. One of the key behaviors here is that with the smaller angles up here, the two folds that are the same parity and the folds that are of opposite parity move at about the same rate but with this, as we're getting closer to 90 degrees, we find they move at very different rates and then at the end of the motion, the opposite happens. This one is almost folded but this one goes through a much larger motion so the relative speeds differ.","207":"Yeah, so typically the mechanism will run from corner to corner, to diagonally to opposite corners because then you can stretch it out that way. Notice some differences between the one you have and the one I have in how this one sort of opens out almost evenly but this one opens out more one way and then the other.","208":"And it's exactly the difference between the motions of these two vertices. So these angles are closer to right angles and the closer you get to a right angle the more asymmetry there is between the two directions of motion. And then the other difference is how efficiently they pack, so these started at about the same size but when they're flat notice that yours is much more compact. So if I were you making a solar array, I'd say, oh, I want that one. But if I say, well, I want them to open at the same rate, then I want this one.","209":"That's actually a really good description. The idea is that if you've got a system here that can make you see whatever we want you to see, then we can make you believe that you're anywhere else, like on top of a mountain, or in a dungeon or under the ocean.","210":"Yeah, or in Minecraft. When you look at a TV on the wall there showing like a picture of a mountain or something, how can you tell that its not just a window and there's something else behind it. Because it always doesn't look quite right if you have a static picture of a person on a screen and you move around like this, its not really changing. And its interesting, those are things we have to figure out We need to figure out when you look at something in reality how can you tell whether its real or not. Have you been to a 3-D movie where you put on the little glasses?","211":"Essentially what harmony is, is like a language, right? And so as with any language, the more words you're capable of speaking in a language, the more you can say. All right, so in harmony, this might be how many notes you can think to add to a chord to make it feel a different way. Have you ever heard of the circle of fifths?","212":"You got it. Ooh! Yeah? Yeah, yeah. So this is really, this is like a gleaming glade or something, you know? Let's play this tune, Amazing Grace. Let's play it in its simplest form.","213":"All right, so we're gonna start in F, right? Yeah. So say. \u266a I once \u266a F, yeah. (Amazing Grace) B-flat, yeah. F. C. F. So we're home.","214":"Just to see how things feel. Yeah. All right, lets do it. (both playing Amazing Grace) So it's F major seven, but its over A. Which is F seven over A. (both playing) B flat major seven with an A and a G in it. F major seven with an E and a D and a G, yeah. (laughter) D minor seven with a G in it. C softs, or minor, nice. B flat major. G seven, F sharp major seven. Home, yeah! I like that. So what harmony does is just gives us even more tools to tell those stories. Cool, yeah. Nice, man.","215":"Oh, very good. You've come to the right place. So we're gonna think about physics. Have you heard the word physics before? Do you know what that is?","216":"Okay. I just think of physics as the study of everything. What stuff is, what stuff does. So today we're gonna talk about space, and in particular the idea of dimensions. Have you heard about dimensions?","217":"And how would you find yourself, like if someone said where are you, could you use some words or ideas to say where you are on that line?","218":"But here's what I want you to think about. If I say I'm at this point on the line, I could translate that into saying I'm at the three centimeter point, if I were here I'd be at the four centimeter point, the five centimeter point, right?","219":"We need one number to tell you where we are. That's one dimension. That's what it means to be one dimensional. I only need to tell you one number to figure out where we are.","220":"So those are the dimensions. That's how we think about dimensions. Remember, we just needed one number to find ourselves on the line, we need two numbers to find ourselves on the plane.","221":"This is why physicists think about things we don't know about. We're wondering whether there could be extra dimensions you've never seen. Yeah. That are tinier than atoms. So, okay. So what have you learned? What do you know about dimensions now? How do you think about dimensions in a slightly different way than you did before?","222":"Absolutely. And that's a great example because you have models that are operating to do things like figure out if a new email is spam or not. So what would you think about if you were looking at an email and trying to decide if it went in one category or another?","223":"So these are things we would call features. And we go through a process where we do feature engineering, where somebody looks at the example and says, Okay, these are the things that I think might allow us to statistically tell the difference from something in one category versus another. So for example, perhaps you don't speak Russian, you start getting a lot of email in Russian.","224":"So typically, you would choose deep learning if you have sufficient high quality data, hopefully labeled in a useful way. If you really are happy not to necessarily understand or be able to interpret what your system is doing or you're willing to invest in another set of work afterwards to understand what the system is doing once you've already trained it. And this also comes down to the fact that some things are actually really easy to solve with linear regression or simple statistical approaches. And some things are impossible.","225":"Yeah. This is actually a good example of a very real world kind of machine learning problem where the solution to this was to build an interpretable system on top of the accurate predictions not to throw it away, but to do a bunch more work to figure out the why.","226":"It's actually fairly new that we're able to solve all of these problems and start to build these products and apply it in businesses and apply it, you know, everywhere. And so, we're still developing good practices and what it means to be a professional in machine learning. We're really developing a notion of what good looks like.","227":"Sometimes when people get, they worry about connectomics, I think what they're actually worrying about is that it's the end of the that we used to do neuroscience.","228":"So and a musician, how much of it do you think is in your hands versus in your brains? Meaning like, you do have connections in your muscles from the nerves that are from your spinal cord, what if some of the learning is there?","229":"Good to see you Mike, nice to have you here with me. So we go way back. 1991, the year I got married, I moved across the country, left my husband in New Jersey, to work with you in Livermore.","230":"And I've been talking sort of, started with sort of what is a laser through linear optics, non linear optics, high intensity laser physics, and saying that you know, we're trying to get to that Schwinger limit of 10 to the 29 watts per square centimeter. We're about somewhere just shy of 10 to the 23 I think at this point. But even if we get to 100 petawatts and focus that down to a wavelength, we're not at 10 to the 29. So you're hoping to build the biggest laser.","231":"Okay, but that's kind of cheating. That's not getting to 10 to the 29. If you could do it with 100% efficiency that's all we need.","232":"And that's, like you said, we're stuck a little bit, we're not up to that kind of acceleration, so that would be a Nobel Prize winning possible idea.","233":"Or we need, going around and giving my talks now, I show how we're plateauing. I showed how there was a plateau, CPA raises it up, but we're sort of starting to plateau again and we need another Nobel Prize winning idea. And so do you think it's on the horizon? Do you see anything out there that really says, oh yeah that's a good way to go? 'Cos we're gonna have to get out to the x-rays right? We can't stay in the visual.","234":"And right across the beam. Don't you think that's gonna be the challenge? 'Cos it's not like our beams are as perfect as we like to think they are.","235":"So where people are swiping credit cards, those credit card numbers were stolen. They hired a company to come in and perform a penetration test to see, can the good guys essentially break in again to prevent this sort of thing in the future? And when this team came in, they found they actually were able to get pretty much to the same point of sale system, and the way they did that was by exploiting an internet-connected deli meat scale. Once the company was able to essentially get into the deli scale, because the deli scale was on the internal network, then they were able to really escalate privilege and find a vulnerability within another system. Essentially, that just got them into the network. and once you're in the network, it's often really easy to then escalate from there.","236":"Yeah, that's another interesting concept. It's really just different layers that we have for protection, because often when you're talking about something like a corporate network, or even your home network, you typically have sort of one level of defense, right? If someone can break that or it can get in through some other system that is connected or exposes some other protocol, like Bluetooth, right? You can connect to a Bluetooth device without being on the wireless network, without being on the LAN. That potentially gives you another place that you can pivot on and then access other devices, because if something has both Bluetooth and also Wi-Fi, well, if you can get in through Bluetooth, then you can then access the Wi-Fi and get to other devices on the network. Are you familiar with buffer overflows?","237":"If we were to write a program that asked for your name and you typed in your name, but before you could type in your name, in a low leveling, which is like C or C++, you'd have to allocate some memory. So you might allocate a buffer of a hundred bytes because whose name is going to be longer than a hundred bytes or a hundred character? But what happens if you were to not really check that they limited to a hundred bytes? Do you know what happens if they essentially start typing over that hundred bytes?","238":"But what's really cool about that is, when you're going into memory, you're starting to cross over that boundary of that hundred byte allocation, and now you're starting to write over additional memory. That other memory is really important stuff. So you have your name, the hundred bytes there, and then right next to your name is the return address, and that's the address that the code is gonna execute and it's going to return to after that function is done, and it's going to jump to that address, but after you type your hundred bytes, the next few bites that you type, you're actually going to overwrite that return address. So that return address could essentially be another address in memory. So what you end up doing is you type a name and it's not really a name, it's really just code. And that code, you keep typing until you get to the return address, and you start typing an address, which is really the beginning of your name and your computer or your processor is actually going to read that address and it will jump back to the beginning and then execute that payload. So that was sort of the very first thing that I think was super exciting to me when I started learning about really reverse engineering.","239":"You brought up China and Iran, and something that's interesting about those areas is really censorship, right? They have essentially censored internet. In the US, we have a really interesting internal struggle here where we actually have government agencies like the state department that are funding software to evade censorship, like Tor and other mechanisms. While then we also have an internal struggle where we have other organizations like the NSA who are specifically looking to break that exact same system that the US government is also funding.","240":"It's good for us to understand how these systems can really break down. Although, I think one thing that I see is that some of, let's say, the organizations that are looking to break this are not necessarily going to share once they actually learn that information. They might actually sort of hold that in their back pocket and use it when it's advantageous to them.","241":"Well one of the fun things people do with lasers, the cat will try to grab that dot. I'm sure what you have at home is a flashlight. I brought a cute little one. So the question is, do you see any difference between what a flashlight does and what a laser does?","242":"That's true, that laser's just a dot. And so the other thing to notice though is that, like if I shine it in your eyes and I'm sorry if I do! But it seems awfully bright doesn't it? And yet when, you know, you shine this down and you put the laser, which one do you see easier?","243":"One of the things that lasers are great for is that because it's a directed beam, we can actually put that light where we want the light to go and sometimes you maybe just want to see something around the corner and you can't see it. But with a laser, you can actually and this is a smoky one so you can actually watch it go. You see it actually bending the corner?","244":"And that's because the light will go through this glass and, when it hits that corner, it has to bend. And we actually send laser beams down glass fibers, the size of your hair.","245":"So this is just a demonstration. If you have a laser like this, it actually bends and comes out, I'm gonna point it to you and you'll see it coming out the other end. It hits these walls, it has to go around and come out the other side. You wanna play? So is this the first time you've seen a laser or have you gotten to play with lasers somewhere else?","246":"That's a laser. We cut steel with them now. We actually do surgery with lasers. You know when some people have either scars or birth marks that they don't want to see? We can actually remove those with lasers now. Never seen a laser light show? When they light up the sky with lasers, it's almost like fireworks.","247":"So the side channel analysis is really looking not at a vulnerability within a system, but really unintended consequences of what the system is built on. A very simple example of a side channel is putting your ear to the ground to hear if there are horses coming towards you, and the same thing applies to technology. So you can have something like a CPU, it's executing instructions, certain instructions that use a little bit more power, and power is reserved in these capacitors, which are like tiny batteries next to your CPU. And as they're pulling power, there's something in physics called the electrostrictive effect where the capacitor will move in a very, very tiny amount. And then although we can't hear it, the microphone on a mobile device can actually listen to that. If you then listen to that and you say, oh, I see a pattern here, and you can go all the way down and then extract and reveal the full password, the full key, even though it could be argued that the algorithm itself, there's no problem with it.","248":"The risk right now, just during this quarantine, is actually massive now that we think about it, because you might have these legacy systems. You know, they were built 20, 30 years ago, and it's too costly to upgrade, but now you can't actually have a lot of people in a single location, so potentially, they actually do have to now add some sort of remote capabilities to these systems that were never meant to be on the internet. Have you ever had any ethical concerns with the stuff you're interested in or the work you do?","249":"What if it were illegal? Would you then do it? Fortunately it's not today, right? It hasn't been, you know, despite their attempts, none of that has been passed, but if you had a vehicle and you wanted to inspect it, but all of a sudden, it passed, I mean.","250":"But the laws don't always equate to hurting anyone. I ethically think similar to you in that, you know, what is moral to me is as long as I'm not intentionally hurting others, right?","251":"We have a lot of companies that sort of help us make sure that our trades happen, but if we could guarantee the same trade using technology as sort of a technological trust, then we wouldn't really need all those middlemen in between.","252":"It's basically a network of computers that all have the same history of transactions. And so instead of sort of there being one company with one database that holds all the information, the same sort of list is held by all these different people. Like, you could have it on your computer. And then it gets validated by everyone, and basically, that turns into the next part of the list. So it's sort of constantly updating itself.","253":"So it use cryptography, and that helps it basically encode all of the transactions. So you can't really see exactly what happened, but you can know it happened because it's like a marker.","254":"Excellent. I got an engineering physics degree. There you go, something in common. We're here today talking about lasers. So have you have had much exposure to lasers yet at school?","255":"Okay. As opposed to the experimental side and seeing things? Okay so I'm much more, I like to see the things happening. So then the question is, what's so special about making a light that's intense enough to actually possibly blow things up? Certainly we can blow atoms up with the laser hammer and when the laser light comes in and just smacks the electrons right off the atom. And so the question really is how do you make that? Back in the 70s and into the 80s, I know that was a long time ago for you, we had big energy lasers and we had short pulse lasers, we couldn't have big energy, short pulse lasers and actually it was my supervisor and I that figured the way around that and we got something called chirped pulse amplification. Have you heard of chirped pulse amplification by any chance?","256":"The necklace is something that was designed for my Nobel prize. It's sold at the Nobel museum and it is a chirped pulse. So we've been talking a lot about lasers and applications, what have you learned about chirped pulses?","257":"One nice emotional device when it come to harmony is just thinking about how to arrive somewhere. You know, it can be so sparse, it can be so rich, and it can be really emotional. So this idea of the overtone and the undertone in the harmonic series, how much do you know about this?","258":"I think that people forget that you can work with the notes you already have by just rearranging them, just the simple idea of inversion, inversion of the simple triad, of F major. \u266aI once was lost and now I'm found \u266a \u266a Was blind \u266a \u266a But now I see \u266a Now how home do I want to go here, you know? Is there another verse to come?","259":"Because I can delay the gratification of going home. First of all, just by using inversions, even before we add the notes to the chord. One thing that I was very joyful to discover is that every single melody note works with every single base note.","260":"F major, F minor, D flat major seven G flat diminished, G flat minor major seven, G minor seven, G soft, G seven, G seven sharp 11. And then, G seven with a flat 13","261":"That's it! (laughs) A flat soft, A flat major seven. A flat major seven sharp five, with a sharp 11. Essentially, what that demonstrates is that every note and every base note are compatible. So once we realize this its like, that's great! Now what should we do? What, how, what should we, what should we, how, what am I supposed to do? What to do, right. And sometimes the paralyzing thing when it comes to arranging, there are too many options, too many things are possible. So that's when it becomes super, super important to be aware of what you wanna try and say emotionally.","262":"Exactly, yeah. No, for sure. And, you know, F major can be something you arrive in from, if you arrive in F major from D flat, then it's like the sun's come up.","263":"So, there's a lot about context, I think. Once you have a language, it's about using it and applying it in those emotional ways. I think that's what makes the difference.","264":"That's good, that's a great place to start. There are cells in your brain. Those brain cells are connected by wires to each other. Electricity travels down those wires and communicates from one part of the brain to the other part of the brain, and each of those brain cells makes, you know, a thousand connections, it's something like a hundred trillion connections.","265":"I would say that that map also has your feelings in it because, here's why, your feelings, most neuroscientists think, come from your brain anyway, and amazingly, whether when you feel happy or sad or angry or scared, that's just brain cells communicating with each other.","266":"This is where it gets really crazy. Could we simulate that map inside a computer and would that computer then be thinking like that original brain from which we made the map?","267":"Huh. It would be like if you simulated a hurricane. Imagine we could keep track of every variable of a hurricane. Ever. Wind speed, every water molecule, et cetera, et cetera. Temperature. And we put that inside a super-fast computer and we simulated it, right? I don't think anyone would think that the inside of the computer would get wet. Even though we had simulated the hurricane perfectly, that wetness is consciousness, it's what we are. Is it ethical to imagine mapping a male brain versus a female brain to look for differences between those, to explain alleged behavioral differences between them?","268":"Like how can that possibly be? What I wanna do is prove to you that I know this combination without revealing the combination to you. And what you could do is you could write a little note, a secret that I definitely wouldn't know. Fold it up, stick it in here. And then, if I know the combination, I should be able to open it and tell you what you wrote. All right. There we go. All right. So,My dog is named Doug. Did you figure out what the combination was?","269":"So you're asking like, why shouldn't I just share my secrets with somebody? People don't trust each other. And if I was able to prove that I've done something correctly to someone without having to reveal my secrets, then that person would trust me more.","270":"What would you guys do? You'd probably first get together and like, figure out some secret code, right? And then like, write messages to each other in that code. But what if you've never met the person before? What if you wanna exchange secret messages with me and we've never met each other before? How could we possibly do that?","271":"But it's not. You wouldn't use like, a physical lock, or a physical box. We would instead use mathematics to do these kinds of things. You could take a message and encrypt it using mathematics. And then, I could prove to you that I know the key, I could open it up, and send it back to you. That way I would be proving to you that I know the mathematical key to the mathematical lockbox. So based on what we've discussed today, in your own words, what is a zero-knowledge proof.","272":"Is there any particular memory for you that you feel has been either kind of influential in your, in deciding which areas to pursue or that you feel is sort of emblematic of what it is to have a memory?","273":"So we're interested in the idea that memory is kind of a pervasive force that shapes all our behaviors. And we're trying to understand how different kinds of memory are organized in different structures of the brain. And then to understand how those different structures work together to orchestrate complex cognitive behaviors like decision-making or reasoning and thinking.","274":"The best way to kind of think about that distinction really goes back historically to one of the most important discoveries in memory research. The patient was referred to famously as patient HM. The neurosurgeon went in and removed the tissue that happened to be right around the hippocampus on both the left side and the right side of HM's brain. But then they started noticing something odd in his behavior. He was not able to create new memories of the experiences he had after the surgery. And that led Brenda Milner and her colleagues to report that the hippocampus was very important for memory, but a one particular kind, these sort of explicit, or as now referred to them episodic memories. But the hippocampus was not necessary for learning skills like mirror tracing, things that you can't necessarily articulate but you just get better at over time. And it really led to a couple of decades or more even of an enormous amount of very important work that kind of kept on breaking memory down further and further into different types. Episodic and semantic as both forms of explicit memory where episodic refers to memory for an event that happened like what you did yesterday morning and semantic refers to general knowledge about the world. Implicit memory is being broken down into a bunch of different kinds like skills or habits or conditioning. And when I started graduate school, many of us felt kind of the next question was really to understand how do we now understand how they work together. This was right around when functional magnetic resonance imaging started becoming a popular tool for measuring brain activity. We could scan the entire brain and we could ask questions about multiple brain regions at once. And we discovered that what we might expect during a skill learning task that only the striatum might show activity, that we also saw the activity in the hippocampus. Or when we asked someone to form an episodic memory that we thought might depend only on the hippocampus we suddenly also saw activity in the prefrontal cortex. And so the confluence of these new ideas and questions about how different forms of memory interact together with the development of new tools for studying the human mind and brain allowed us to kind of adjust our view of memory systems, to think of them less as multiple completely separate independent systems and instead to try to understand how they really work in concert with each other and give rise to all kinds of behaviors that might not fit neatly into one category or another.","275":"Yeah, you know things are kind of breaking down in unexpected ways I'd say. I think there's been a lot of really great work out of multiple labs showing hippocampal activity related to behaviors that don't look anything like episodic memories, but which might depend on episodic memories right? So for example also when you're making a decision about how to choose between two good options that suddenly you might see activity in the hippocampus related to the choice itself, others have found that you find activity in the hippocampus not only when people are forming memories, but also when they're imagining events that are gonna happen in the future. So it kind of forced us to rethink the way we define what the hippocampus might be doing in a way that can account for creating memories, thinking about the future, making decisions and other kinds of behaviors that involve what we would refer to you in the field as relational processing. And that raises all kinds of new questions about what memory really is. Reminiscing about our early influences that made us want to be scientists is that, you know, of course we know, we know better than to think that those are necessarily accurate memories. You know this reminds me of sort of the classic example from literature when people talk about memory of course is Marcel Proust's Madeleine in Remembrance of Things Past. Where in the book it's this taste for the, for the protagonist this taste of the crumbs of the Madeleine cookie and the tea that bring him back to his childhood. You know, seven volumes then emerge of memories of, of that childhood. Digging further into earlier drafts of Proust's novel that initially it didn't describe a Madeleine at all.","276":"You know I think these imperfections, I interpret them as an indication that the role of memory is much less about being accurate representation of the past and much more about being kind of a flexible compass into the future.","277":"I love math for the same reason. Today, I'm gonna tell you about a thing called zero-knowledge proof. So in a zero-knowledge proof, there are two people. There's a prover and a verifier. And I wanna prove that something is true to you. But the weird thing is, I wanna prove to you that it's true without telling you any reasons why. I remember when I first heard about it, I was like, wait, what? How can that possibly be? Right?","278":"But what if I could prove to you that I know where the puffin is without revealing to you where it is? Let me show you. I took that photo that we showed you. And I put it behind this poster here. Why don't you go take a look through that hole?","279":"So when you look at this board, we don't know where the photo was, right? Was the photo like with the corner here? In which case the puffin would be all the way at this side. Or was the photo with the corner here? In which case the puffin would be on the other side. So this is a really simple example of a zero-knowledge proof. I convinced you that I knew where the puffin was, but you didn't learn anything else.","280":"Because then even if the hacker hacked into the computer, he wouldn't learn anything. Because even the computer doesn't learn anything. So Chelsea, in your own words, what is a zero-knowledge proof?","281":"Yeah, that's absolutely right. So infinity gets used a lot of different ways in mathematics. There's a way that mathematicians think of infinity as a number, just like the number 13, just like the number 10 million. So the reason that mathematicians consider infinity to be a number is that it is a size of a set. So the first example of an infinite set in mathematics is the set of all counting numbers. So one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, et cetera. That list goes on forever. That is an infinite set. And to be a little bit more precise, it's a countably infinite set. But as a number, infinity is pretty strange.","282":"Room number one. Exactly. I'm gonna use this symbol for infinity, but what we've just shown is that one, the one new guest plus infinity is equal to the same infinity. What happens if we had a second guest?","283":"Absolutely. So now I'm gonna make this story a little more complex. That there's another Hilbert's Hotel down the street and they're having plumbing issues and we need to find room for them.","284":"Yeah, I'm increasing by one more each time. So I'm doubling the room number in fact. So this is some of the strange arithmetic of infinity. So we have two Hilbert Hotels, each of which have infinitely many guests, then this is equal to?","285":"Infinity, great. Hilbert's Hotel is a story that mathematicians have been telling themselves for almost 100 years because it's a really visceral way to think about some of the counterintuitive properties of the arithmetic of infinity.","286":"So when I'm teaching calculus and talking about concepts like limits and derivatives, those are only defined precisely with infinity. Teaching algebra, which is meant in a different sense about number systems, we deal with infinite families of numbers in their operations. Infinite sets are somehow very exotic. They're not found so commonly in their real world, but they're all over mathematics.","287":"Yeah, exactly. One thing that my research has been looking into is, if we can have robots learn from data, we'll collect data from the robot sensors. And if the robot has sensors in its arm, to figure out the angle of one of its wrist, for example, then we'll record that angle. And all of the robots experience will go into a data set, that if we wanted a robot to solve a task, like, I don't know, picking up a cup, and then maybe you want to pick up a different cup, if it only had the data of picking up the first cup, do you think it would be able to perform well on the second cup?","288":"So you can think of robotics as having two core components. One is perception, being able to see and feel and so forth, and action, where the robot actually figures out how to move its arm. And both components are really essential, and both components are quite difficult. If you train a perception system independently of how to choose actions, then it might make errors in a way that mess up the system that selects actions And so if you instead try to train these two systems together, to have it learn perception action for the goal of solving these different tasks, then the robot can be more successful. One thing that's really difficult about robotics is, there actually isn't that much data of robots in the world. On the internet, there's all sorts of text data, all sorts of image data that people upload and write. But there isn't a lot of data of doing a simple thing, like tying your shoe, for example, because it's so basic. One challenge is even just getting data sets that allow us to teach robots to do these simple kinds of tasks.","289":"That's a great question. I think we should be able to accelerate the data collection process by having robots collect more data autonomously on their own. And by doing that, we might be able to overcome some of the challenges of Moravec's paradox.","290":"Deep learning is a common toolbox for addressing some of these challenges, because it allows us to leverage large data sets. And so, deep learning is basically, corresponds to methods for training these artificial neural networks. Another common method that comes up is reinforcement learning. A third kind of algorithm is meta learning algorithms. And these algorithms learn not just from the most recent experience on the current task, but leverage experience from other task in the past. And they're not just completely separate. We can combine the aspects of these algorithms into a single method that gets the benefits of each of them.","291":"The Mandelbrot set or the Julia set, you know, the idea is always, oh, I'm gonna apply some polynomial over and over again. Z squared plus C or something like that. When I think about fractals, I try to get away from these very specific examples and ask, what is it fundamentally that makes a fractal, a fractal. And one thing that I think you can be precise about, even if you can't really say exactly what a fractal is, is you can talk about this idea of fractal dimension. Have you ever heard of that?","292":"Yeah, great. So, so the real physical paper has some amount of thickness, but when we model this mathematically, we might ignore the thickness and say, yeah, this is really just kind of a two dimensional sheet of paper. And then you have your apple, how many dimensions is the apple?","293":"Totally, now, as a little experiment, take your piece of paper and just crumple it into a ball. So what is it? Is the paper three dimensional or is it two dimensional?","294":"So it's not quite as solid as the apple, but it's also not quite as two dimensional as the original sheet of paper. And so for this reason, people associate this crumpled ball with a fractal dimension, maybe something like 2.5 dimensions instead of two or three, there are a lot of different definitions, precise definitions of fractal dimension. But I think the one that's easiest to understand is this thing called box counting dimension. You have, let's say an image and you want to decide what's the fractal dimension of this image. So what you're gonna do is you're gonna count the number of boxes, or you can imagine big pixels of this image that cover the boundary of this shape. And you're gonna see how does that counting compare with how the counts work for just an ordinary shape? So, so if I have a straight line and I start out with one big box that covers the whole line, and now I shrink my boxes by a factor of two, I just make boxes half as big. How many boxes will I need to cover that line?","295":"But if you take a more interesting shape, some kind of fractal shape, like let's say the coastline of great Britain and you start doing this box, counting experiment, something really interesting happens as you make these boxes smaller, the number of boxes you need to cover the coastline grows faster than it would for just a straight line.","296":"And so what this box counting is getting at is saying, well, I still can never decide what the length of the coastline is, but what I can do is I can see how quick does the number of boxes grow relative to how it would grow just for an ordinary one dimensional curve, like a line or a circle.","297":"So procedural computer graphics, which kind of came out of thinking about fractals is one answer to this question about how do you add more detail without for instance, consuming tons of memory or requiring artists to paint ultra detail the textures. So if, if you can instead describe at least some aspect of what you're looking at in a procedural or recursive way, then you can add as much detail as you need when you get close to objects.","298":"It's still pretty easy, right? It turns out that stacking these two cups, it's actually really hard for robots to do that. So, let's think about how we might have a robot stack these two cups. You could program the robot to move its hand right here and then program the robot to close its hand around the cup.","299":"Exactly, right? That seemed pretty simple for the robot to do. Say we even just move the cup over here. Do you think the robot would still be able to stack the cups?","300":"Exactly. So, Moravec's paradox is something that means that these really simple things, like stacking cups, is really, really hard for robots, even though it's really easy for us. While robots are actually really good at really complicated and really difficult things. Think about the task of multiplying two really big numbers together.","301":"this really specific combination of zeros and ones everything that your computer does showing you pink panther videos on youtube calculating things searching the internet it does all of that with a really specific combination of zeros and ones which is crazy right that would be like saying your computer only understands these quarters for each quarter you need to tell it that you're going to use heads tails and you assign it heads or tails so i can switch between heads and tails and i can switch the zeros and ones in my computer so that it represents what i wanted to represent like an a and with quantum computers we have new rules we get to use too we can actually spin one of our quarters so it doesn't have to choose just one or the other","302":"yeah they can especially if doing your homework involves calculating something or finding information but what if your homework was to discover something totally new a lot of those discovery questions are much harder to solve using the computers we have today so the reason we're building these kinds of computers is because we think that maybe one day they're going to do a lot of really important things like help us understand nature better maybe help us create new medicines to help people","303":"So actually, in the blockchain space is one of the spaces where we are seeing zero-knowledge proofs being implemented. And I think it's just the beginning. Let's talk about zero-knowledge proofs. At its core, a zero-knowledge proof is an interaction between two people. Then I should be able to convince you that some statement is true, but you won't have any idea why it's true.","304":"What you're basically asking is, wait, what? Right? Right. So this is what makes zero-knowledge proof so fascinating, and so counter-intuitive. And I think the best way I can explain it to you is by means of an example. But before we do that, I have to decide what I'm gonna prove to you in a, with a zero-knowledge proof.","305":"Right? So you have a little bit of confidence, right, that I have managed to color this correctly. but not that much confidence. 'Cause I've only shown you two of the countries.","306":"Right? So now, of course, one way to get more confidence is to open up more of them for you, but that would be revealing information to you. I don't wanna do that. So instead, I'm gonna ask you to please turn around. And now, let's change up these colors. Can you pick two countries at random and we'll reveal two of the colors again.","307":"But as you'll see, now it's not green, it's blue. And this one on the other hand, is green. Okay. The colors I showed you last time, don't work with these new colors, right? This wouldn't have worked before.","308":"Exactly. Right. But it works for this coloring that I'm showing you right now. So what we've done is we've made it impossible for you to put the pieces together. And if you do this, let's say, a thousand times. And if I correctly showed you different colors, each thousand times, you'd be really convinced. And that's it. That's the entire zero-knowledge proof.","309":"It's not about making something more efficient. It's about doing things that we just didn't know how to do before. I can actually prove to you without revealing to you any of my secrets that I use to behave honestly. Right? I could prove to you that I signed some encrypted document correctly. Right? Without revealing to you what that secret document was. That ability to change the game. Like, really just change what we can do is what zero-knowledge brings to the table.","310":"One great example is like in elections. If you could prove that an election was correctly conducted. That every vote was counted, and it all added up to one person winning with a particular total, in zero-knowledge, then you don't have to give up the actual votes of any person. And yet everyone could see that, hey, yeah, it was done correctly.","311":"I mean I think that's another common misconception about mathematics is that it's so far removed from the humanities, for instance. I mean it's hard to ignore some of these philosophical questions, particularly when we're talking about certain things like infinity. And I think one of the most difficult things to really be precise about and to explain to students is the continuum hypothesis. What do you say to students about the continuum hypothesis?","312":"So what's so fascinating about the continuum hypothesis, if you take a subset of the real line that's infinite, does it necessarily have either the cardinality of the naturals or the cardinality of continuum, or is there some sort of third possibility? What's very surprising is the continuum hypothesis has been completely resolved in the sense that we now know for absolute certain that we will never know whether it's true or false. So this is a little bit confusing. The standard foundational axioms of mathematics that we take for granted are completely insufficient to prove the continuum hypothesis one way or the other. Mathematicians among other things have been very clear about exactly what they're taking as an assumption and exactly what they're concluding from it. So mathematical practice is to be exact transparent about the hypotheses you need to prove your theorem. So now I think of a proof of a theorem more like constructing a function where the domain of that function is all of the hypotheses that I'm assuming and then the target of that function is maybe a particular element in some universe that is the modularized space of the statement that I'm trying to prove or something like this. If the foundations were to change, if set theory were replaced by something else, maybe dependent type theory, do you think the theorem you've proven would still be true?","313":"It's pretty amazing, right? Because it happened like a year or two ago. Our memory is basically a record in our brain of something that happened in the past, but that record it created isn't perfect. So that day, do you remember was the pool at your hotel?","314":"When you were telling me about the sandbox, it felt like you didn't have to make that guess, that you could just see the sandbox in your eyes. I asked you about the towel. It doesn't come to mind immediately, but you can stop and think about it and kind of make a good guess because there are things you know about the world. And for those of us who study memory that's a really strong hint as to how memory works. And so for you your memory kept all the fun stuff and all the stuff that was important to you, but the details like did you have to have a ticket to get in or how you got there, all these other less interesting, less exciting aspects, your brain kind of decided letting go of all that information.","315":"Yeah, that's a great insight. Basically we can't remember everything. So when you tell us this memory of that vacation and your brain is able to kind of play almost this movie of a memory, a moment, a day that you had in your life a while ago, where do those memories come from?","316":"You got it. And so we don't just remember everything and we don't remember random things. We remember the things that matter to us the most. So Abigail based on our conversation today, can you tell me what is a memory?","317":"Right? Yeah. So that's already a really good idea of what a fractal is. It has some really, really interesting detail at all, scales that makes it hard to talk about standard quantities like lengths and areas and volumes.","318":"Yeah, so if you look at kind of the wrinkly surface of an asteroid, each one of those little wrinkles adds a little bit to the surface area. And so it's really hard to say, what is the area of an asteroid? Let's take a look at a little example of where fractals actually show up in nature. What we're gonna try to do is we're gonna try to say what the length of the coastline of great Britain is. So we're gonna start out with the blue ones, which are spaced further apart. We're gonna ask you to connect the blue pins with a piece of string so we can get a measurement of the coastline. So we have our first measurement of the length of the coastline, and we're gonna do it over again. But this time we're gonna use the white pins, which are spaced closer together. So we measured the coastline again. And what do you think happens?","319":"I think I agree with you, but I think to really validate our scientific experiment, we should probably compare the length of the string. A lot of extra slack in that pig of string. So what we noticed with great Britain is we were never able to measure it's length. It just kept getting longer and longer. This is called the coastline paradox where there's not really one definite number you can assign to the length of the coastline, but it depends on how you measure it. Like if we kept going to really get this to be accurate, we might have to like actually go down the beach and start measuring these tiny little details along the coastline. But really there's so much detail. We would probably never get a definite answer for how long the coastline is. Fractals also give us a really nice language. We're talking about how smooth or rough some kind of shape is. And actually a lot of people, engineers and scientists use this idea of fractals and this language of fractals to compare different shapes, not in terms of their size, but in terms of their roughness. So based on everything we talked about today, how would you describe a fractal to somebody in your own words?","320":"Our topic today is quantum sensing. So quantum is about the study of stuff that's really, really, really small and sensing is about measuring. So the word sensing comes from kind of like our senses. So do you know what your five senses are?","321":"Touch, exactly. So it's kind of really important for us to be able to have these senses, so we know what's happening in the world around us, right? In doing quantum sensing is we're trying to measure things that can be hard to see. Let me show you. Can you see inside it with your eyes?","322":"You wouldn't be able to see into the middle. If you had the right tools, you could start to think about ways to look inside the ball without cutting it open. That would then, you'd still have your ball. We could still play with it.","323":"Yeah, I started out doing magnetic resonance, studying things like bone and biomedical magnetic resonance. Ended up playing with spins for a long time and the physics of spins just fascinated me.","324":"In a way, it's part of the same continuum. What you're doing is changing the technological platform and you're actually able to probe it more sensitively. The resolution you're able to get is much higher, so you can see smaller signals in a much smaller volume.","325":"You have to be close to it. You can detect it optically because if we tried to detect the magnetic moment of the electron, we wouldn't be able to do that because there, the energy is too low compared to thermal energies. But what the diamond system gives you is a natural up conversion in energy. So you can couple into an optical photon, which is then much easier to detect a single optical photon than it is to detect a micro wave.","326":"I think as you said, you know, anything that interferes with my signal is noise, but it can come from different sources. In some ways, the operation of the quantum system itself, as it's sensitive to different physical phenomena, the ones that I don't like, I call noise. The ones I do like, I call signal and that's an artificial definition that I'm making when I choose to build a sensor. One of the challenges we have is, we're trying to figure out if I wanna control it, where is it coming from? I remember we had experiments running in our lab one day and we were running these experiments about 100 megahertz. All of a sudden, we saw these big spikes coming in and we realized we're picking up the local FM stations.","327":"So one of the things that we're interested in is looking at, suppose, I want to build an entangled quantum sensor, when I put a number of spins together, in addition to being sensitive to an external field, they're sensitive to each other and they start talking to each other. You don't just see the external spins, you see the fluctuations of all the other spins in your system. So what you wanna do is make sure that they don't interact with each other, but they still stay sensitive to everything else. And there, you could think about the local interactions, the magnetic interactions between the spins as a form of noise. In some ways, it's interfering with what you wanna measure, which is the magnetic field outside the sample.","328":"So do you think you can integrate multiple NV centers or multiple optical sensors? So are there ways in which you can overcome this question of there's a spot size and that limits how many NVs I can pack into a certain region?","329":"Right. People bring in very different perspectives into what used to be a very niche field. I remember in physics, you'd only talk to people in your subfield and now we're picking up the phone and talking to people in the different departments, completely different areas and we're forced to learn different languages.","330":"it's something that we've already figured out for classical computing like something that amazes me is all the parallels between what we're going through now for quantum computing and what we went through for classical computing","331":"exactly so i think something that frustrates a lot of people about quantum computing is the concept of decoherence right you can only keep your information quantum for so long right and that limits how many operations you can do in a row before you lose your information","332":"you know now that everybody around the world can access a quantum computer through the cloud people are doing all kinds of cool things they're building games we've seen the emergence of quantum gains right what do you think people want to do with them","333":"So subdivision surface is a way of describing a smooth shape on a computer rather than some complicated fractal shape. So meshes and computer graphics are usually made of these flat polygons with kind of sharp edges. And so the question is how can I get something nice and round and smooth out of these sharp looking polygons? What I can do is I can start cutting one at a time, the corners of this paper off, it still looks very angular. I still have these really sharp points.","334":"Well, because people who really need to use these subdivision services for everything, people who worked hard over the years to make this super, super fast. In fact, subdivision services were invented basically at Pixar. There's this guy, Ed Capel, and he was harshly responsible for one of the most famous kinds of subdivision surfaces called Capel Clark subdivision surfaces. And in fact recently won the touring award for these subdivision services.","335":"Okay, back into the 1960s, there was a research agency in the United States called DARPA, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency. Actually, it was called ARPA at the time. They wanted to build this notion of a packet-switching network. Not a circuit switch network like a phone network where you get a dedicated path and a dedicated set of bandwidth and links from source to destination.","336":"There's a lot big, right? And so remember, this was a Department of Defense, was they wanted to have forms of of communication that were very robust, that were survivable. Packets could all find their own ways, be routed differently through the network. So if parts of the network failed, you could route around failures.","337":"So you can sort of see how the network architecture that wasn't designed to be 100% reliable inside the core of the network, and had that complexity built into the edges of the network. And to me, the really cool thing is you put this infrastructure in place, and then all these super creative people think about amazing things to build on top of it. And you see this proliferation of amazing applications.","338":"Ah ha! Spoken like a real computer scientist, right? You're a computer scientist. I'm a computer scientist. We talk about APIs, application programming interfaces. The API for the internet is something called a socket. And a socket simply says, I can communicate if I know your internet address, you know, 128.119.40.186, that number is the IP address of my server, the University of Massachusetts. If you know that, you can write a program anywhere in the world and send a message, and it'll pop out at my end.","339":"Okay, well I don't know about the number seven, but there's something in the internet that's sort of similar to that. It's called the Domain Name System. The DNS's role is to translate names like gaia.cs.umass.edu, or ibm.com, or facebook.com to an IP address so that your application can actually send a message to that name, to that named service.","340":"That's 98% true. And if you own a network, like you're att.com, or your verizon.com, you can do, within that network, you can do what you want, right? So in that sense, the internet is very decentralized, that the control of the network is up to whoever owns the network. The 2% where you said there's nobody in control, there's a little bit of centralized control. There's an organization called the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers. Its responsibility is to handle, as the name ICANN suggests, names and numbers. It's that little bit of centralization, central authority that you need.","341":"Exactly, right. And maybe they're dropped in your apartment, but much more likely, they're dropped because of congestion somewhere between the Hulu or the Netflix or the Disney server, if you're watching a video, and your home. So even though you've got 200 megabits per second on that last hop, you don't have 200 megabits per second from the server into your apartment.","342":"Yeah. It is exactly using quantum phenomena to sense and measure things and the idea is that, if I can harness quantum phenomena and I can push the limits that are possible, I can get something that's ultimately more precise and potentially more accurate over time too.","343":"So I study spins. And so, spins are one of the platforms that people have suggested is a useful platform for building quantum technologies and I study spins on the solid state. And one of the platforms I work on is nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond.","344":"So in some sense, the phenomena we're studying essentially is nuclear magnetic resonance or electron spin resonance which is a very similar phenomena, but uses the spin of the electron rather than the spin of the nuclei.","345":"So you can implant nitrogen into a diamond and then you bombard it with electrons to create the vacancies and then you heat it up and anneal it, and then you get these nitrogen-vacancy centers in your system. So you mentioned quantum computing earlier. So have you heard of the idea of superposition?","346":"So that's in some ways the key to both quantum sensing, as well as quantum computing. It's the idea that you can take a system and put it in a superposition of two states. Normally we think of classically a bit can be a zero or a one. So switch is either on or off. Whereas in a quantum system, it can be in what's called a superposition. So it can be partially on and partially off. But one of the challenges with quantum systems is that these superpositions are really hard to maintain because we don't see superpositions in the world around us. In quantum computing, you try really hard to isolate everything so that you can maintain this quantum property and the fact that it's actually going to lose its quantum properties as it interacts with the world also makes it a great sensor because now you're actually, you're using that fact that it's interacting with the world to say, wait, it's sensing something.","347":"So rather than trying to build a lot of complex algorithms and gates with it, what you do is, you take these quantum bits and you take them out into the world and say, what do you see? What are you sensitive to? So you can use an idea called entanglement to make an even more sensitive quantum sensor, but it's even more fragile. So there's always this trade-off between being super fragile and being super sensitive at the same time.","348":"So entanglement is the idea that two particles are correlated. They're essentially in the same quantum state, so that you can't disturb one particle without disturbing the second particle. And so, if I have a large number of quantum sensors that are entangled, then they're all going to interact much more strongly than if I just had one of them interact at a time.","349":"In some ways, it is and you know, atomic clocks are remarkable devices and being able to measure time that precisely has really important consequences. In fact, our old GPS system is based on the accuracy of atomic clocks. They're a set of satellites, each of which has an atomic clock on board and they send out a timestamp and so, once it gets a signal from three different satellites, it can triangulate and figure out exactly where you are. Now, if you could make those clocks even more precise, you could actually accurately position where you are even more accurately.","350":"Well, we're gonna be talking about computers here today, and we're gonna be talking about the internet. I always like to think of the internet by analogy to say road systems for example, where you have roads in your neighborhood. You have state roads, you have the Interstate Highway System. And so the internet is a lot like that. It's an interconnection of local roads, local networks like the network in your house for example.","351":"Wow. Great question. Often, it's a little blue wire called an ethernet cable. So that cable is able to bring bits of information up into your apartment at say, a billion bits per second. That's pretty fast, right? Literally a wire that goes between a box in your apartment, sometimes called a router or a modem in your apartment that comes from an internet service provider come into this first network and then that network connects to another network connects to another network connects to another network.","352":"That's really what we call the first hop. It's like from your phone, from your tablet, from the computer that you're on, there's no cables coming in. You go over a wireless connection. Wi-Fi is the protocol that allows your computer to talk to that first hop router over a wireless communication link.","353":"Ah, you said they're all in one spot. In fact, they're in lots of spots in Netflix. And so most applications would like to connect you with a server that's close to you. Server is really just a big computer with a lot of memory, a lot of discs that store all the Netflix movies, and also so that you don't have to cross over too many internet links to get from where the server is to the TV or the device in your home.","354":"Ah, another great question. There's a couple of things that could happen inside the internet. Information is sent in these little packets of information from the Netflix server to your display device. And literally, each packet that arrives says, This is the first packet for Jenna. This is the second. This is the third. This is the fifth. This is the fourth. And they're reordered for you. Matter of fact, your computer will say, using the TCP protocol to the server, Hey, I didn't get packet four, can you resend it again? And again, the Netflix server is very happy to send you packet four again. The other is the internet protocol. If you think about sending letters through the US Postal Service, how you've got an address on it. So every packet that flows from the Netflix server to you has an address on it. It says, This is going to Jenna. It's going to the what's called the Internet Protocol address of your device. Think of all the range of devices that are hooked up to the internet. It's totally amazing, right? Every single one of them has one thing in common, and that is they speak the IP protocol, the Internet Protocol. That was a great question.","355":"That's the computer science brain thinking right there. So we wanna think of a function as procedure or mapping between sets. So a function defines a one-to-one correspondence if it defines a perfect matching between the elements of its domain set and the elements of its output set. We call such functions bijections or isomorphisms. So the reason I'm so interested in this idea of a bijective function or a one-to-one correspondence that guarantees that every element of one set gets matched with an element of the other set, no matter how many elements there are, these bijections or these one-to-one correspondences as they help mathematicians reason about infinity.","356":"Today we're gonna think about infinity as a cardinality, which is a technical term for a number that could be a size of a set. And we're gonna use this idea of one-to-one correspondence to try and investigate the question of whether all infinite sets have the same size. So what I've drawn here are some pictures of some of the infinite sets that appear in mathematics. So the natural numbers are the prototypical example of an infinite set. So the natural numbers are clearly a subset of the integers. Both of these are infinite sets. Are they the same size infinity or different size infinities?","357":"I'm gonna now try and convince you that they are in fact the same size infinity. And this is using this idea of a one-to-one correspondence which was applied in this context by Georg Cantor. What he says is if we can match up the elements of the integers with the elements of the natural numbers so that there's nothing left over, so that there's a bijective function between them, then that's a proof that there's exactly as many natural numbers as there are integers. Start by matching zero with zero and one with one. But then we wanna include the negatives in the list. So which natural number would we match with negative one?","358":"Maybe two. Why not? Because now we're starting to make progress on matching all the negatives. We can match the natural number three with the integer two, the natural number four with the integer minus two. And do you see a pattern?","359":"Great. So now I have a much harder question. So we have the same challenge, again, evidently there are way, way, way more rational numbers than there are integers. Does that mean this is a larger infinite set than the integers? What do you think?","360":"So I'm going to use this picture to count the rational numbers by actually counting the elements of this larger set because it'll be clearer geometrically. What I've drawn in this picture is the integer lattice. So Z cross Z refers to the set of all of these dots. So I'll start by counting the number at the origin, and you can see I'm just labeling the dots around the origin, moving in a counterclockwise fashion and getting progressively further away. And this process could continue, but maybe by now you see the pattern, though it'd be a little bit difficult to describe as a function.","361":"Georg Cantor proved that it is impossible to count all real numbers like we've just counted the rational numbers or just counted the integers. This is called the cardinality of the continuum, it is uncountable. What I'm going to do now is form a new real number that I guarantee is not on this list. Okay, so here's how we do this. What I'm gonna do is I'm gonna look at the diagonal elements. So I'll highlight them. This continues forever, and now I'm going to form a new real number by changing all of these.","362":"Yes. You see the idea right away. So I'm gonna form a new real number whose first digit is different from this one. And you've already convinced yourself that this number is not on this list anywhere. Why is that?","363":"Great. That's exactly right. So what we've proven is that this number is missing, and therefore it is impossible to define a bijection between the natural numbers and the real numbers.","364":"So we've started to explore some of the counterintuitive properties of infinity. On the one hand there are infinite sets that feel very different like the natural numbers, the integers, the rational numbers that nevertheless have the same size or the same infinite cardinality. While there are other infinities that are larger. So there's more than one size of infinity, not all infinities are created equal.","365":"Really glad you asked me that. There's a practical implication for computer science. Alan Turing, he came up with a mathematical model of a computer, something called a Turing machine. So Turing was wondering is it possible to compute every real number, an arbitrary real number to within arbitrary precision in finite time? He defined a real number to be computable< if you could calculate its value, maybe not exactly, but as accurately as you'd like in a finite amount of time. And because there are uncountably infinitely many real numbers, but only a countably infinitely many Turing machines, what that means is that the vast majority of real numbers are uncomputable. So we'll never be able to access them with a computer program.","366":"yeah this whole infrastructure is all about creating levels that get progressively colder as you go from top to bottom down to the quantum chip which is how we actually control the state of the cupids","367":"so you can have constructive interference and you can have destructive interference we have constructive interference you have amplitudes wave amplitudes that add until the signal gets larger and if you have destructive interference the amplitudes cancel by using a property like interference we can control quantum states and amplify the kinds of signals that are towards the right answer and then cancel the types of signals that are leading to the wrong answer so given that you know that we're trying to use superposition entanglement and interference for computation how do you think we build these computers","368":"simulating nature is something that's really hard because if you take something like you know modeling atomic bonding and electronic orbital overlap instead of now writing out a giant summation over many terms you try and actually mimic the system you're trying to simulate directly on a quantum computer which we can do for chemistry and uh we're looking at ways of doing that for other types of things there's a lot of exciting research right now on machine learning trying to use quantum systems to accelerate machine learning problems","369":"So black holes, you describe them as huge. The interesting thing about black holes is they're hugely heavy, but they're actually physically really small. What really matters is the density. Do you know what density is?","370":"I can also ask how big it is, which is a question about its volume. If I make it smaller, then what's happening is it's becoming more dense. So imagine I crushed this really, really small. It would weigh the same, it would have the same mass, but it would be much more dense.","371":"It is taking other stuff, but the funny question was like, if I wanted to move your chair, you'd think it was really strange if I didn't have to come near you and actually grab the chair and move it. One of the things Einstein thought about is he imagined that what the black hole is doing is it's changing the shape of space around it. What do you think of that idea?","372":"So the way I think about it is if you have an infinite or an arbitrary family of sets and you know for sure that none of these sets are empty, then a choice function would allow you to select an element from each set sort of all at once. When you've used the axiom of choice in proofs, do you know which incarnation of this you've used?","373":"You do believe the axiom of choice, though it leads us to some strange conclusions. So if the axiom choice is true, then it's necessarily the case that there exists a well ordering of the reals. And what that means is that we can perform induction over real numbers like we perform induction over the natural numbers. This is trans-finite induction. It would work for any ordinal. So there must be some uncountably infinite ordinal that represents the order type of the real numbers. And this allows us to prove some crazy things. Imagine three-dimensional Euclidean space. So the space that we live in, extending infinitely in all directions. So it is possible to completely cover three-dimensional Euclidean space by disjoint circles, so infinitesimal circles, disjoint circles of radius one. So what that means is you can put a circle somewhere in space and then put a second circle somewhere in space that can't intersect with the first one because these are solid circles and then another circle can somehow cover every single point in space with no gaps in between.","374":"That's right. So a rigorous way to work with a category of sets is to demand that it's a category of sets whose size is bounded by this cardinality, Alpha say. That is then an example of a category that fits into another even still larger Grothendieck universe Beta. So implicitly in a lot of my research, I have to add an additional assumption that there exists maybe countably many inaccessible cardinals.","375":"We're used to ethernet cables that can handle many hundreds of gigabits per second over a wired device. What are the typical data rates for IoT devices? I mean, not hundreds of gigabits.","376":"My sense is you're spot on, that they'll produce over time, a lot of data. And that a lot of IoT is about computing on that data. That computation happened mostly at the edge, or somehow a combination between the edge and something happening in a far away data center.","377":"I think for a long time, the internet hasn't grappled with, but now has with IoT and also with cellular networks, generally is the question of mobility. Do you imagine in the future that it might be possible for mobile devices not to always have to connect through the same provider to go from one network to another?","378":"If you can already predict the answer, then you must not be gaining any knowledge by that interaction. This insight of being able to predict the future accurately, and that being an evidence of a lack of new knowledge,","379":"Right. Sometimes. I mean, for example, in medical research, how amazing would it be, right, to be able to have a drug, and be able to prove that my drug works in this model.","380":"We're definitely at this moment now, where zero-knowledge is gonna be used more and more. There are so many conferences and meetings that occur in the zero-knowledge space, where you and I are not invited. Because it's for the people who are developing. You know, the people who are programming, not us mathematicians.","381":"It's a great question. I wish I could see the future. I can't actually, but let me try. The part of that that I'm the most comfortable answering is of course the mathematical side.","382":"Yeah, and probably nobody is. Have you heard a lot in your studies about these super massive black holes that we think lurk in the centers of very nearly every galaxy?","383":"Yeah, I think it's a really good question. The only mechanism that we know for sure can form black holes is to collapse of very massive stars. So it's sensible to think, well maybe some very massive stars in a young universe collapsed under their own weight and then they merged and after some time they got big enough, but the black holes from stars can be tens of times the mass of the sun, maybe hundreds of times to the mass of the sun if they merge. To get to millions and billions, and if you just do the simple arithmetic of how many years that would take, there aren't enough years in the 14 billion years of the universe's lifetime. So they must have come from somewhere else.","384":"There might be many alternate routes. It might be in the very early universe that bubbles in unusual phase transitions from very high energy universe to a low energy universe can make black holes. Like, we haven't really thought of the range of possibilities.And so there could also be primordial black holes that are still around that also skipped the star stage altogether that were formed really in the very earliest phases. And I think the interesting thing is, with your looking at like the Large Magellanic Cloud, is to wonder if we're gonna merge.","385":"But when we do merge with Andromeda, presumably our black holes will merge and Andromeda indeed has a very big black hole as well at its center. And then we'll have this just gigantic-","386":"Yeah, and it's very possible that as you said, the collision won't be so severe that it'll be very disruptive. So our entire solar system could stay intact and here we would go with the sun and all the other planets in orbit around a new black hole.","387":"We work a lot right now on thinking of black holes as batteries. So a black hole that can take, like a giant magnet, astronomical magnet in the form of another collapsed star, like a neutron star, and flip it around so fast, near the speed of light, that it actually creates an electronic circuit out of this moving magnet. And so that the power that can come out of these electronic circuits created by these batteries can be tremendous.","388":"It's a great question. I once did a calculation of using a black hole made out of the moon and the strongest magnet we could find on Earth to see if I could make an electronic battery. And honestly, you only get about enough energy to power New York City. But we have to find one in our neighborhood first.","389":"and actually machine learning is one research direction where we're really hoping that we're going to find um key parts of the machine learning computation that can be sped up using quantum computing","390":"if you think about even just classical information like bits right at the end of the day when you store a bit in your hard drive there's a magnetic domain and you have a magnetic polarization right","391":"you can change the magnetization to be pointing up or pointing down right quantum systems we're still manipulating a device and changing the quantum state of that of that device you can imagine if it's a spin that you could have spin up and spin down but you can also if you isolate it enough you can have a superposition of up and down","392":"so what we do when we try to solve problems with a quantum computer is we encode parts of the problem we're trying to solve into a complex quantum state and then we manipulate that state to drive it towards what will eventually represent the solution","393":"so you need a chip with qubits each qubit is a carrier of quantum information and the way we control the state of that qubit is using microwave pulses you send them all the way down these cables and we've calibrated these microwave pulses so that we know exactly this kind of pulse what this frequency and this duration will put the cupid into superposition or we'll flip the state of the qubit from zero to one or if we apply a microwave pulse between two qubits we can entangle them","394":"there's sort of two main classes of quantum algorithms there's algorithms which were developed for decades right things like shore's algorithm which is for factoring grover's algorithm for unstructured search and these algorithms were designed assuming that you had a perfect fault tolerant quantum computer which is many decades away so we're currently in a phase where we're exploring what can we do with these near-term quantum computers and the answer is going to be well we need different kinds of algorithms to really even explore that question","395":"yeah they also unfortunately require fault tolerance right now the algorithms that we know of today to do those things um on a quantum computer require you to have millions of error-corrected qubits today we're at like 50. it's actually amazing that we're at 50. there's things that we know or we have strong reason to believe um are going to be faster to do on a quantum computer and then there's things that we'll discover just by virtue of having one","396":"i'm glad you're interested i think the place where lots of people can get involved right now is by going and trying it out and thinking about what they could do with it there's a lot of opportunity to find these near-term applications that are only going to be found by trying things out","397":"One thing I find really fascinating about robotics is that the things that are so simple for us, like feeding yourself broccoli, so second nature to us, are really hard for robotics. When you try to take a robot and train it to do a task and simulation, and the simulation isn't perfectly accurate, it's really hard to actually model the physics of how tofu crumbles.","398":"It's a really, really hard problem. A lot of simulators, they don't simulate the world as a fine enough time granularity to really accurately capture things like skewing an object, for example. One thing that I think is promising is to try to not build simulators entirely from first principles, from our knowledge of physics. But instead to look at real data and see how real data might inform our simulations and try to build, allow robots to build models of the world, build simulators of the world, based on data and based on experiences. There's a little bit of a chicken and egg problem, because if we wanna use simulators to get lots of data, and we also need data to get good simulators, then there's no way to get around this.","399":"So a fractal is something that we see every day, but it's a little bit hard to describe. It's it's a shape that if you look at it really far away, or you look at it really up close, it has kind of a similar appearance. And actually that word fractal sounds a little bit like fraction.","400":"And that's kind of what we're gonna try out today. In fact, we're gonna have you build a fractal. A tree is a really good example of a fractal because if you look at the whole tree and then you break off a big branch of the tree.","401":"So your tree is totally beautiful, but it took a long time to make, right. How would you feel if I said, now you have to make a thousand of those trees.","402":"Yeah, it's a ton of work. If you think about Moana's island, it has these tens and hundreds of thousands of trees on it. And that's why we need computers to help us out because computers are really good at taking these really simple rules, like put two branches on every other branch and doing it really, really fast.","403":"Like coding, exactly. That's what actually a lot of the artists for the movies are working with code rather than with a paintbrush. So in your own words, how would you describe a fractal to somebody?","404":"We're in level five now. So you're the expert-expert. I'm a huge fan of the work that you did in RCP, the Routing Control Platform being a precursor to software-defined networking and the notion that rather than having protocols actually always compute things, that we could compute things in data centers. I'd be interested if you could sort of just reflect back on that time and sort of the beginnings of SDN and where it's come since then.","405":"Right, so some people have called that the flattening of the internet, right? I think it used to be on average, you would go through 10 different networks to get from a source to a destination.","406":"And certainly, we've heard about some countries that impose firewalls that don't let certain kinds of traffic out, or certain kinds of traffic in. So there's no global body that is regulating that?","407":"I mean, even you could just tell that two people are communicating even though the traffic itself is encrypted. So you don't know what they're saying, just even knowing two devices are communicating.","408":"You're one of the most awesome networking researchers that I know. I'm curious, just to pick your brain, what do you think are some of the hot topics in networking research? Where do you think the field is heading?","409":"You know, we've had cellular networks now for 20, 30 years. So when we hear about 5G, what's trumpeted the most is the fact that oh, super high bandwidth, right? But I sense that the exciting things are more than just the network being faster.","410":"So that's a great definition and I wanna pick that apart a little bit. So what you described is just right. Stars, when they run out of thermonuclear fuel are gonna collapse under their own weight. It'll explode in a supernova, it'll leave a core, and if the core itself is heavy enough, it will keep collapsing. It does, as you say, reach this point where not even light can escape. But the amazing thing is it leaves that point, you called it rightly the event horizon, it leaves it behind kind of like an archeological record because the start itself can no more sit at the event horizon than it can race outward at the speed of light. So the core of the star keeps collapsing and where it goes nobody knows. So in a weird way, the black hole isn't anymore a crush of matter. It left it behind in its wake, but the stuff of the star is gone.","411":"It turns out that there are only three quantities that define a black hole, its electric charge, its mass, and its spin. So the most general black hole can also spin and it can also be electrically charged. Whether or not they are has to do with how they formed. If a star collapses, it will likely be spinning when it collapses and the remnant black hole that formsbwill likely be spinning. A black hole of a certain mass, charge, and spin is indistinguishable from any other black hole with those same properties. So in some sense, they're like fundamental particles, which makes them absolutely exceptional for any other astrophysical object. Have you heard the stories about what happens inside a black hole?","412":"So from the outside, if you're an astronaut, you're watching your friend, another astronaut going into the black hole, it's as though your times become rotated relative to each other. So the profound thing is as an astronaut on the outside, looking at this round event horizon, you think of the center of black hole as a point in space, but to the person who's fallen in, it's not a point in space at all, it's a point in time. The singularity, or the end of it all, the crush in the center of a black hole is in their future. So they can no more avoid the singularity than you can avoid the next instant of time coming. So the death in the singularity is inevitable. Although we don't really think the singularity necessarily exists.","413":"I would say to some extent we don't know for sure. What we have found is that the mathematics is so unbelievably powerful that we're able to disprove wrong ideas just in pen and paper. Just very recently, within the past couple of years, the first ever human-procured image of a black hole showed us what we expected to see of the event horizon. So Jayda, after our conversation today, what would you say a black hole is?","414":"The beauty of being a student of something like black holes is you never stop having new impressions of what this enigmatic phenomena is. So in a year, I'll tell you what I learned that's new.","415":"So what you're describing is the famous Hawking radiation where a black hole cleverly kind of steals energy from the quantum vacuum and radiates and in the process of evaporates. And of course this caused a big kerfuffle because when the black hole evaporates, eventually that event horizons is yanked up. And the question is, where did everything go that had once fallen in?","416":"It is amazing in the numerical simulations of two black holes merging, you really see the event horizons bobble around. And we were talking earlier about how really black holes are flawless, they don't tolerate those kinds of imperfections. And so you can so quickly watch the system wring away that misshapen merger. And it comes out in the gravitational waves, which is literally the ripples in the shape of spacetime until it settles down, and then it's utterly flawless again. It really happens fast. It's quite amazing.","417":"Right, and it allows you to prove that you've been behaving honestly, without revealing any of the secrets involved that you use to actually behave honestly. So we of course know that zero-knowledge proofs for NP-complete languages plays such a huge role in cryptography. I'm curious. What was your first experience with Np-completeness like?","418":"Exactly. Right. Because random is unpredictable and that's what we want. Right. We want that unpredictability around us to be utilized, to actually hide the information that we wanna hide. How have you used your knowledge in the projects that you've worked on? What are the challenges that you find?","419":"And also in the blockchain space, for example, if you wanna speed up the generation of proofs, if that could be done in a distributed way, then that would be great. One of the hopes that I have is that the power of multi-party computation is about bringing people together who are mutually distrustful.","420":"And on one hand memory is like a record of something that happened in the past that we can carry with us and we can like bring it back to mind. And on the other hand we need to be a little bit suspicious sometimes because we might get it wrong. In what world would that memory of the orange juice maybe be useful?","421":"Sometimes, you know, memory is doing something much simpler but no less important for us, which is it's helping us figure out what's good and what's bad. And if we can remember what's good and what's bad from what we did in the past, that can help us make decisions about what to do next time. So Dylan, you may be surprised to learn this, but we asked your mom what some of your favorite candies are. So you have to make a decision between these two candies and whichever one you pick, you actually get to take with you.","422":"There you go, there is your decision. Okay, you can take those. It took you some time there. You looked like you were really working hard at that problem. And that's interesting because actually we know that from research that when people have to make a decision between two things they like equally, some people like economists think oh those are the easiest decisions because they're both good options. But as psychologists and neuroscientists we know it's the opposite. One of the reasons is because there's no simple answer of like I know that one's better I'm just gonna go with it. And so we think that that's the kind of decision where memory is especially important because you have to kind of come up with more information.","423":"Everything you just said is exactly what we know from research. All the thoughts running through your mind, were really at kind of about a prediction into the future, right? You're like, how, how will this taste if, when it's in my mouth or how will I feel about my decision down the road? You know we think of memory as something in the past, but it's an example of how you use your memories of these two candies to predict what's gonna happen in the future so that you can make a decision in the present. But you did it, you made your way through that torture. And now you've got to keep the candy.","424":"We fluctuate a lot because we use different kinds of memory to kind of resolve the uncertainty basically every time. But also the way we make decisions will change because our memories change. What's interesting about your brain as a teenager is that we know it's actually a phase of life where the brain is especially sensitive to rewards, to things that are exciting and positive. It's a phase of life where those rewards, whether it's candy or your friends or whatever it is that's exciting can have an especially powerful control over the decisions you make and the memories you create.","425":"The internet is, physically, these computers that all talk to each other. Billions of computers, in the case of the internet. The internet allows us to do a lot of really, really interesting, what we call applications. You ever think about how that video gets to you over the internet?","426":"Matilda. All right. We're gonna actually build an internet. I've got a couple of things here that I wanna show you, or a couple of toys, actually. Okay, let's pretend that these round balls are computers. And the internet is something that connects them. And right now, the internet is just one communication link. And Matilda is sent over the internet from this computer to your computer. So the internet is a network for carrying information from one computer to another. Now this network here looks pretty simple, doesn't it? Right? It's just one thing. Should we add some more friends in?","427":"That's right. So that's pretty cool. There are actually lots of different ways to actually go through the internet to get from what we call a source, the place that's sending the information, to the receiver, the place that's actually gathering the information together. And that's something we actually call routing.","428":"Exactly. So, Skylar, that was a great discussion about what we just built. And I wanted to talk to you about, or ask you about maybe one other really important part about networks. And it's not so much the thing itself, the physical thing, but more about the rules about communication. That's governed by something that are called protocols. Are you up for one?","429":"Lettuce go on. [Skylar and Jim laughing] A knock, knock joke is an example of a protocol, right? The computer that you are using say, makes a request, you ask for something, you get something in return. In the internet, there are protocols everywhere. So that two computers that have never talked to each other before know the rules for talking to each other. This global internet with billions of people using it are just lots of smaller networks that are all hooked together to each other. But also, what the internet allows are all of these what we call applications, Zoom, video playing services, can all run on top of the same internet.","430":"We now think of the hippocampus so much in terms of memory but really some of the earliest work in neuroscience on the hippocampus talked about the role of the hippocampus in spatial navigation. And it really exposed I think one of the deepest questions in memory research, or at least from the neuroscience perspective is like, well what is the connection? What is the connection between spatial processing and memory? And why is it that neurons in the hippocampus when an animal is navigating a maze, why is it that there's spatial specialization there? I really do think that this notion of a mental model, a generative model is where those, where memory and space meet.","431":"It's really interesting. And I think it also really speaks to the kind of pervasive and circular role of memory, right? Because the maps are dependent on memories, they're built from memories and experiences. So there's this kind of dialogue with memory creating maps, maps creating experiences, experiences creating memories, affecting the maps, and really makes me think even of a question a friend asked me recently about moods and mental health and this feeling of like how do some people get kind of trapped in a state of mind where all they can see is a particular way forward. But then something happens in the world that shifts them to another model.","432":"Memories as models or models first and memory as part of what helps build the model starts generating new predictions. Exactly the kind you just brought up or other ways of thinking about things because an efficient model needs to let go of information, right? I just heard a colleague of mine joking about the fact that the principles of neuroscience textbook keeps growing and growing. And that if we had enough strength in theoretical neuroscience, if our models of neuroscience were good enough, that book should shrink back. We know that memory retrieval is essentially construction. And so you don't need to store all those separate memories. You need to construct them. But if you have a good model, let go of all those details and just construct them to feel as if it's a memory. But really all you're doing is using the model to fill the details. It's kind of like the matrix, you know.","433":"Getting way out there, but, but it is a way in which if you have the right model, it should be an efficient one. I'm wondering what you, what you think about what all this means for kind of a redefinition of what memory is, in many ways a revision or expansion of that notion. Would you be willing to try to help me think about how to define it?","434":"Okay, you wanna do the demo for me? So the LIGO instrument electronically records the ringing of the shape of space with its very complicated instrument. It stands for Laser Interferometric Gravitational-Waves Observatory and the design was incredibly difficult and they didn't know if they would succeed. I think of the instrument as like the body of the electric guitar. And then they take the readout of the motions of the waves that they're recording, just like that guitar is recording the motions of the waves on the string. Now just play it like a little bit. And you can't hear anything, right? You're not meant to hear an electric guitar when it's not plugged in. What's happening is the guitar strings are ringing, but so quietly that we can't actually hear the sound. And this is like the gravitational waves, which are ringing the drum of spacetime, but so quietly that they're not move the air and we're not hearing them. So now play and I'm gonna turn the volume up a little bit. While I can't actually hear the ringing of the strings themselves, I can hear the data of the shape of the string recorded and played through this amplifier. And that's kind of the idea behind the LIGO instrument.","435":"It's a great question. If I didn't see you playing the guitar, I would recognize the sound of a guitar. And even if I had never heard of a guitar before I could figure out the frequencies that the string was playing, I could tell how strongly it had been plucked, and I could tell the length of it and where it was pinned down from the harmonics of the string. And I can tell the different lengths of the strings from the notes that they play. So I can actually reconstruct the instrument that's playing it. And it's very similar to LIGO, we can listen to the notes, the amplitude, the harmonics, and we can deduce the size and shape of the objects doing that. And they're very massive and they're very small and they have all the markings of a black hole.","436":"So over the past four levels, we've been talking about Moravec's paradox. I'm curious to get your perspective. There are still a lot of open questions for how to leverage previous experience and learn cumulatively over time.","437":"I like that description, because it conveys how much complexity there is to these really basic tasks that we're doing. Is there a definition for the simple tasks that we do versus things that are more complex, like playing chess?","438":"That notion of hierarchy is really interesting, because it is these higher level things, like playing chess, for example, that are easier for AI systems. And the reason why they're easier is that we're providing the abstraction for the system already, then when we give the game of chess to an AI system, we abstract away all the challenges of like picking up pieces and moving them, and we say, 'Okay, there's this board of however many boxes on it.' And you just need to figure out within that very narrow, small world, what to do. But handling and learning what those abstractions should be and handling everything from low level sensory inputs to that higher level processing is really, really hard.","439":"What I love about what you were describing is like you didn't use the word memory, were how you were talking about kind of perceptions and social judgments but I think probably we'd both agree that memory is a big part of that.","440":"Right, like it reminds me so much of, you know, what we in the field would refer to as statistical learning. On one hand we might have like a one-shot memory, a memory of something that we saw yesterday, like what we did or what we ate or where we were. But a lot of our memories and our knowledge instead are based on many, many, many experiences.","441":"Some of those examples really remind me also some of the questions about kind of abnormalities in, in memory or trauma or disruptions in memory and how they also play out in terms of not just what people remember but what they do with those memories right?","442":"I think what we're still kind of trying to understand as a field is the more kind of detailed and bigger picture of where does this model live? How does it get updated based on experiences? Why does that sometimes happen and sometimes not? There are actually people who are born without a hippocampus. They have disruptions to episodic memories. They have trouble after this conversation remembering what the conversation was about, but they do have pretty good semantic information. They have a good sense of knowledge about the world. And that's interesting for two reasons. One, it shows this association between the role of the hippocampus and these two forms of memory, episodic memories and semantic memory. The other reason it's interesting is that people often assume that we get to semantic memory through episodic memory, that we encounter one dog and then another dog, and then another dog and then we learned the concept, the semantic notion of a dog. And these people, their profile suggests that you can learn semantic information. You can learn general knowledge about the world, even without ever having the capacity to build those individual memories.","443":"Each project should be very focused and rigorous and know what a study is designed for. But at the same time we have to keep our minds open, our eyes open for what else is happening. Some of the most interesting discoveries didn't make sense at first.","444":"And things that are hard for humans should also be hard for robots and humans to do. But it turns out that it's actually the opposite. I wanna try a little demo.","445":"So I have a penny in my hand and I'd like you to pick it up with your right hand and put it into your left hand. So that was pretty easy, right?","446":"We're gonna make this a little bit harder now. So, can you put these on? And we'll try to do the same thing again with your eyes closed. There you go. Let's try that one more time, and see if you can do any better. So close your eyes.","447":"Yeah. So that you're able, with a bit more practice, you're able to figure it out. When it fell on the ground, how did you know to pick it up off the ground?","448":"So when a robot tries to do something, like pick up an object, not only do you need to program exactly like what the motors should do, the robot also needs to be able to see where the object is. Then this is what's called a perception action loop in robotics. So if the object moves, the robot can then adapt what it's doing and change what it's doing to successfully pick up the object. It's really important for robots to be able to leverage, not just like the past hour of experience, but also ideally many years of experience, in order to do the kinds of things that you did.","449":"That's a great question. So in reinforcement learning, the robot tries the task, and then it gets some sort of reinforcement, some sort of feedback. It's similar to how you might train a dog.","450":"So you could give it feedback like that. So it won't necessarily know itself, especially on the first few tries, but it's trying to figure out what the task is even.","451":"We give robots a camera and the camera produces this array of numbers. Basically, each pixel has three different numbers, one for R, for G and for B. And so the robot sees this really massive set of numbers. And it has to be able to figure out, from that massive set of numbers, what is in the world. There is a number of different ways to have the robot see, but we use a technique called neural networks, that tries to take out in those big numbers and form representations of the objects in the world, and where those objects are.","452":"I think that robotics is really, really hard. Having robots do even really basic stuff, like pick up objects, is really, really hard. So if they do take over the world, I think it'll be a very, very, very, very long time from now.","453":"Or you don't even need computers. Like I remember when I was a kid, I played electric guitar and I had all these guitar pedals with different effects and oh, what happens if you put the output back in the input and just run it through itself, you're gonna start hearing this kind of fractal sound, right? So today we've been telling people, fractals are things that are somehow self-similar, they have detail at all scales. Are there other ways you might introduce fractals to somebody or are there other things you might say, this is what a fractal is?","454":"I think about like the scale and variance of different physical equations, like navier-stokes is, you know, kind of scale and variant, you know, this Reynolds number that tells you how viscous things are, but you can have the same kind of fluid behavior at all different scales. And that's why you get turbulence at all different scales.","455":"Yeah and I think it's really cool that this kind of fractal description of geometry or physics is also kind of baked into the nature of computation. Computation is recursive kind of biased nature. And so it's kind of a match made in heaven that we happen to build these machines that also-","456":"Now you work on kind of the future of virtual reality and augmented reality and extended reality. But it's kind of interesting because I think if I think about exploring these infinite fractal landscapes in some way, they still feel a little bit lonely or they feel a little bit poor of the kind of richness that we have in the real world.","457":"People outside of computer graphics and engineering and science and so forth have also thought a lot about and used fractals as a language for talking about nature, for characterizing shapes and behaviors and so forth tissue or friction, or all sorts of really important phenomena. Do you think that computer graphics has kind of dropped the ball in terms of saying, you know, this is not something that's exciting anymore to work on procedural descriptions and we're, we're moving on from that?","458":"Yeah. And I think this is what what's so beautiful also about Mandelbrot's work is him saying, you know, it's not really about these exotic examples. Like even the Mandelbrot set or Julia sets or whatever. Yeah they're like really interesting mathematical curiosities, but they get at this idea that fractals are kind of inevitable. And Bob Ross probably never, as far as I know, never sat down and you know, thought about recursive descriptions of trees or anything like that. But it's just something that naturally comes to you as an artist.","459":"That's a great way to think about it. Infinity is something that never ends, where finite, the opposite of infinity, refers to a process or a quantity that we could actually count all the way through, at least in theory if given enough time. So if you had to guess, how many Skittles are in this jar?","460":"217. And if we wanted to figure out the exact number, how would we find out? We could put them all out and divide them into pieces of five and then we could use that. Yeah, absolutely. In fact, I did that before you got here, and it's 649 Skittles. Here's a much harder question. How many pieces of glitter do you think are in that jar?","461":"Yeah, you can see them all. And in fact, if we were really, really, really patient, we could do the same thing as with the Skittles. But here's another question. You said that there's a finite amount of glitter in that jar, and I agree. So how many jars would we need to hold an infinite amount of glitter?","462":"Yeah, absolutely not. Because this room holds only a finite amount of space. And in fact, infinitely many jars would not even fit in something called the observable universe, which is the portion of the universe that astronomers can see. Really how does that make you feel?","463":"You have very good intuition. So there are ways that mathematicians can build infinite collections of things. And if you repeat those processes, it's in fact possible to build even bigger and bigger sizes of infinity. So what have you learned today about infinity?","464":"so did you know that there's certain kinds of problems that computers sort of run out of space almost like you're trying to solve the problem and just like how you run out of space on your iphone when you're trying to take a picture if you're trying to solve the problem you just run out of space and even if you have the world's biggest supercomputer did you know that can still happen","465":"it's sort of it's sort of a combination of heads and tails right would you say so superposition is this idea that my penny is not just either heads or tails it's in this state which is a combination of heads and tails this quantum property is something that we can have in real real physical objects in the world so that's super position and the second thing that we'll talk about is called entanglement so now i'm going to give you a penny","466":"but in the quantum world when we entangle things they're really now connected it's much much harder to separate them again so using the same analogy we spin our pennies and eventually eventually they both stop right and when they stop it's either heads or tails right so in my case i got tails and you got heads you see how they're totally disconnected from each other right our pennies in the real world now if our pennies were entangled and we both spun them together right when we stopped them if you measured your penny to be ahead i would measure my penny to be ahead and if you measured your penny to be a tails i would measure my opinion to be a tails if we measured it at exactly the same time we would still find that they were both exactly correlated","467":"the way that we are able to actually see these quantum properties is by making our quantum chips really really cold so that's what this is all about actually this is called a dilution refrigerator and it's a refrigerator it doesn't look like a normal refrigerator right but it's something that we use actually there's usually a case around it to cool our quantum chips down cold enough that we can create superpositions and we can entangle qubits and the information isn't lost to the environment","468":"And what the MRI scanner is doing is, it's measuring the signal from all the water molecules that are present and specifically the hydrogen atom. In our bodies, we have these hydrogen atoms that are essentially spinning around magnetic fields all the time and we just don't know them. So in some sense, you've already used a quantum sensor.","469":"And then the different chemicals in the cells. If you look at the MRI images, you can see that they give you the broad features of what the tissue looks like. But if you wanna zoom in a little bit more and see what's actually happening inside a tissue or inside a cell and you need a different type of sensor that's gonna be more sensitive and for something like that, you're gonna need a quantum sensor.","470":"We can do it on tissues right now or on the surface, but we can't actually do it inside the body. So right now, we're struggling to figure out which scenarios can we use this to get better information and when can we not do it."},"dialogue":{"0":"Explainer: Great.\nExplainee: I'm biased because I study one of the other sub-critical parts of the brain, the cerebellum.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","1":"Explainer: So that's good, because that's why you're here, and so we're talking about sleep today, and really about kind of what is the brain machinery through which we go through consciousness to unconsciousness and that transition.\nExplainee: Great.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","2":"Explainee: In terms of the dopamine, if you're taking amphetamines, that's usually to promote, as you said, wakefulness, but does that actually improve the quality of your sleep?

And so, it's kind of this delicate balance of these two systems that are ongoing.

If you have so much matter when a star is collapsing that it can't hold itself up, it collapses to a black hole, and those are so dense that space-time breaks down in some way or another.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","20":"Explainer: Black holes are so amazing that when the neutron star stops and there's something actually there. There's material there. If it's so heavy it becomes a black hole, so it keeps falling, once the event horizon of the black hole forms, which is the shadow, the curve that's so strong that not even light can escape, the material keeps falling. And like you said, maybe space-time breaks down right at the center there, but whatever happens, the star's gone, that black hole is empty. So in a weird way black holes are a place and not a thing.\nExplainee: So is there a sensible way to talk about what's inside a black hole, or is that, should you think of it as there is no space-time inside?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","21":"Explainer: There isn't a sensible way to talk about it yet, and that probably means that's where Einstein's theory of gravity as a curved space-time is beginning to break down, and we need to take the extra step of going to some kind of quantum theory of gravity. And we don't have that yet. So even though the black hole isn't completely understood, we do know that they form astronomically, that in the universe things like neutron stars form and things like black holes form. The consequences are very much speaking to this curved space-time. So, for instance, if two black holes orbit each other, they're like mallets on a drum, and they actually cause space-time to ring, and it's very much part of gravitation. The ringing of space-time itself, we call gravitational waves. And this was something Einstein thought about right away in 1950-1960, he was thinking about that.\nExplainee: Those waves are very exciting for me too because neutron stars orbiting each other also give off gravitational waves and we might be able to get some data about neutron star material from that kind of signal.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","22":"Explainer: Yeah, it was, to my knowledge, the most widely studied astronomical event in the history of humanity.\nExplainee: Wow, that's amazing.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","23":"Explainer: Usually if it's math and physics, you end up as a theoretical physicist, right?\nExplainee: Yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","24":"Explainer: [Sean] Being four dimensional, right?\nExplainee: Mm-hmm.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","25":"Explainer: Now, in some sense that's kind of trivial to you and me, because of course you have space, which is three dimensional, you have time which is one dimensional, so spacetime is four dimensional. But it didn't turn out, it didn't occur to anyone that that was a sensible way to talk until really relativity. This is the crucial thing, right? Is that what Einstein realized is that sure there's both time and space, but how we divide spacetime into time and space can be different for different people, and really there's a real sense in which four dimensional spacetime is kind of a generalization of three dimensional space. And I think to really explain this we're gonna need a blackboard.\nExplainee: Okay.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","26":"Explainer: Let's bring one in. All right. The thing about relativity is that they really want you to think of spacetime as one four dimensional thing, right? It's kind of like space. It's not just three dimensions of space and one dimension of time.\nExplainee: Why though?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","27":"Explainer: Why? This is a very good question. So, let's just start with space, right? We know a little bit about space. So here's my simple minded way of drawing space two dimensions, because that's how many I can draw on the blackboard. Let's say X and Y. And what is special about space, there's many things, but one is that if I have a curve or a path between two points, there's a distance that you can calculate, right? And the distance between those two points doesn't depend on your coordinates. It doesn't depend on whether you're in radial coordinates or Cartesian coordinates, or whatever. I'm allowed to imagine a curve that does something like this between those two points, and if I were a person walking on that curve, I would have an odometer with me maybe, and I would know, you would know, even without having done that, this path is always gonna be longer than that path. There's a formula, Pythagoras' Theorem that tells you what the shortest distance path is. That's the point. The physical-ness of what is real is the distance along a certain curve. So spacetime is like that. That's why it is useful to think about spacetime.\nExplainee: Okay.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","28":"Explainer: When people ask me can you travel through time? I say yes, yesterday I traveled 24 hours into the future and here I am, a day later. So that's just this. Okay, you're moving through time, like it or not. So what Einstein says is look, I can travel through spacetime in different ways, like I could hop in a rocket ship and fly out and then fly back, and then I could meet you there. So this is a different trajectory through spacetime, right?\nExplainee: Yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","29":"Explainer: And it's almost exactly like the space story. The space story says there's a distance, distance is different along different curves. Einstein says there's something that measures the length of these curves, and we call it the proper time. It is literally the time that you would read on your wristwatch.\nExplainee: So it's kind of like our fundamental time? Or our base time?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","30":"Explainer: Well kind of. What Einstein wants to get across is there's no such thing as fundamental, like there's the universe's time, this big letter T that might tell you how old the universe is, but then every individual has a clock with them, and they measure their own time depending on how they're moving through the universe.\nExplainee: I see.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","31":"Explainer: And the crucial difference is that time is not the same for this person who stayed behind and sat in their chair, and this person who zoomed out there.\nExplainee: Why is that, that this one's shorter then?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","32":"Explainer: [Sean] That's the difference.\nExplainee: All right.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","33":"Explainer: So when Einstein had this idea, oh gravity could be related to the curvature of spacetime, he did some equations, so he got it, that's a long story, we'll put that aside. What he figured out was that rather than gravity living on top of spacetime, it's a manifestation of the curvature of spacetime so when you have like the earth, the sun, the moon, they cause a gravitational field, they're actually warping the spacetime around them. They're giving it a different geometry.\nExplainee: Would it be if I had like a spring or not a spring, but like a sheet, and I dropped a book in the sheet, curves down?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","34":"Explainer: But there are no straight lines, because spacetime itself is curved. So do you think if you had to explain relativity what would you say?\nExplainee: I think I'd go with kind of the train paradox. Let's say I'm stationary, and someone's moving past me on the train, they think they're stationary on the train. Like they think that they're not accelerating, but if they start walking through the train cars, then they are accelerating in their frame, but then from my outside frame where I'm completely removed, I see they are accelerating. So I guess that relativity is all about perspective, I guess in a way.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","35":"Explainer: Harmony is about injecting melody with emotion so that ultimately, you leave home and you return home and you've learned something along the way.\nExplainee: Yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","36":"Explainer: Yeah, I like that, yeah.\nExplainee: Yeah, yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","37":"Explainer: And so when you think about extra dimensions, you put them together with brains and different fields wrapping around the extra dimensions and so forth, right?\nExplainee: Yes.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","38":"Explainer: You know, a lot of people, a lot of string theorists, they care a lot about all the different ways in which we could hide the extra dimensions. As someone who cares about cosmology, I wanna start asking why are the extra dimensions small at all? How did that happen? Is this something you think about yourself?\nExplainee: Yes, well ultimately we'd like to understand the observable universe. If string theory turns out to be the thing that the universe cares about, we'd like to know, with all of these possibilities that are in string theory, how do we get the one that looks like the world we live in?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","39":"Explainer: The thing I want to talk about is this paper I wrote with Matt Johnson and Lisa Randall where we realize there's another way to compactify extra dimensions spontaneously, dynamically. If you imagine starting with this big piece of paper you couldn't wrap up everything, but within some region of space you could make a tube.\nExplainee: Okay.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","40":"Explainer: [Sean] You think that sounds plausible to you?\nExplainee: It sounds like fun. What I would immediately ask is where do the large dimensions come from in the first place? Is that something you address, or you just assume that all the dimension are large as a starting point?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","41":"Explainer: Why don't you explain to us what a black brane is?\nExplainee: Well in some ways, it's very much like a black hole in that you have far away from it you have these large just flat dimensions. As you move in, there's something in the interior. It has, itself, higher dimensions, and so because physicists love to joke they thought, well it's like a membrane but it can have many different dimensions. Let's use P to stand in for those number of dimensions, and so they called them P-branes.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","42":"Explainer: Yeah, I've been trying to explain this to lower levels, and they always look at me like, are you pulling my leg here a little bit? Or is this the real thing that they use? Yes, it is the real thing they use. We study these branes in de Sitter space, and so what we found is that there are black brane solutions which instead of having a singularity inside are non-singular, and stable, and compactified. Is this a familiar thing? I know things like this have been discussed, right?\nExplainee: Yeah. Yeah. So, a lot of the branes that are relevant for studying things to do with anti-de Sitter spacetimes in various dimensions actually start out as these non-singular type brains, and then you find in the core, there's actually an anti-de Sitter spacetime.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","43":"Explainer: But then the other dimensions, the transverse dimensions, don't need to be anti-de Sitter. They can have either positive, zero, or negative cosmological constant. So you can basically get any sort of cosmological solution times a compactified sphere.\nExplainee: Is it that these have the lowest action of all the things that could possibly, all the possible solutions?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","44":"Explainer: It's quantum. [laughing] It's a loud, it's of a loud it's gonna happen.\nExplainee: I still laugh from Keanu Reeves I'm afraid. [laughing]\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","45":"Explainer: If the viewers wanted to know more about how spacetime can emerge from quantum mechanics, they could read the graphic novel you just wrote.\nExplainee: Right, yes. I wrote and drew a graphic novel called The Dialogues: Conversations About the Nature of Universe.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","46":"Explainer: It's what keeps us on the earth.\nExplainee: What?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","47":"Explainer: The reason we're not just flying off the earth is because earth has gravity, so if we throw something up, it comes back down, so that's why when we're walking on the earth, we don't fly off the earth because the earth has gravity, and it keeps us down.\nExplainee: Nice.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","48":"Explainer: Try look over there and concentrate on his face over there. Can you see me waving my hand without turning your eyes?\nExplainee: No.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","49":"Explainer: Alright, so, at some point, you can probably see it right now? So without moving your eyes, this is kind of hard, tell me how many fingers I'm holding up?\nExplainee: Uh, three?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","50":"Explainer: Yes. And maybe what, do pump-probe spectroscopy and watch the cell? Or to ionize it?\nExplainee: I mean I was thinking more on the lines of if we want to, let's say destroy one cell, like a tumor cell or something like that. So that the neighboring areas are not affected but just the cell burns.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","51":"Explainer: Mostly today, I've been talking a lot about what can we do, what's possible. We think might be possible in the next couple of years. But really at the professional level its more the question of wisdom of what should we be doing.\nExplainee: That's one of the things we're trying to figure out, from an artist and storytelling perspective, what are the things that will make this meaningfully different from what we're used to, like a television on our wall. And we've been finding a lot of things, aspects of virtual reality that very much do that in my opinion. Things that allow you to feel presence, first and foremost, where you get lost, and you have to remind yourself, this isn't actually happening. And things that ultimately allow you to embody other characters. Things where you can actually change your own self-perception and play with neuro-plasticity and teach yourself things that are bizarre and unique.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","52":"Explainer: As an engineer of course, I love quantifiable things. I like saying here's my 18 millisecond motion to photon, here's my angular resolution that I'm improving. I'm doing the color-space right. But you can look not too far back where you say we have blu-ray DVDs at this amazing resolution, but more people want to watch Youtube videos at really bad early internet video speeds. Where there are things that if you deliver a value to people then these objective quantities may not be the most important thing. And while we're certainly pushing as hard as we can on lots of these things that make the experience better in potentially every way or maybe just for videos or for different things. I don't think that its necessary. I've commented that I think usually my favorite titles on mobile that are fully synthetic are ones that don't even try, they just go and do light-mapped, black-shaded. And I think its a lovely aesthetic. I think that you don't wind up fighting all of the aliasing. While you get some other titles that, oh we're gonna be high-tech with our specular bump maps with roughness. And you've got aliasing everywhere, and you can't hold frame rate and its all problematic. While some of these that are clearly very synthetic worlds where its nothing but these cartoony flat-shaded things with lighting, but they look and they feel good. And you can buy that you're in that place. And you want to know what's around that monolith over there.\nExplainee: We did a project called Life of Us, which was exactly that mindset. We were let's embrace low-poly aesthetic and just simple vertex shading. And we ended up realizing, you can embody these various creatures and transform yourself. And when you do that with co-presence of another creature, another human, it makes for a totally magical journey. You don't even think for a second, you actually dismiss the whole idea of photo-realism and embrace that reality for what it is. I think it actually helps put you at ease a little bit.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","53":"Explainer: All right, you're in the wrong place. [laughs] We're not gonna be talking about biology or computer science. So we wanna talk about the idea of dimensions. Do you know what dimension is? How we would define dimensions?\nExplainee: I guess, I don't know how to exactly define it, but I know, like the first four.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","54":"Explainer: I'm not trying to fool you here. Okay. Now this is going to be slightly trickier. I'm going to give you this. I want you to hold all three of them at right angles to all the others at the same time.\nExplainee: Um ...\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","55":"Explainer: That's right. So that's exactly what these would be. Have you heard that there are other coordinate systems other than XYX?\nExplainee: No.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","56":"Explainer: So that's a different way of giving you two numbers and locating yourself, and we call those polar coordinates. It's a different coordinate system. What we want to do as physicists is look for extra dimensions. Can you imagine, can you think of any way that there could be extra dimensions?\nExplainee: Time?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","57":"Explainer: It's exactly the same thing as latitude and longitude but we put coordinates on the sky.\nExplainee: Oh.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","58":"Explainer: [Sean] And sort of the peels of an orange kind of thing, right?\nExplainee: [Juliana] Yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","59":"Explainer: So you can define something as, well you know, how high above a certain location on earth it is, but the earth is rotating and revolving around the sun so we have to define separate celestial coordinates.\nExplainee: So, there's like how many dimension would there be?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","60":"Explainer: Absolutely right. And this is sort of the state of uncertainty that physicists are stuck living in.\nExplainee: Oh. [laughs]\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","61":"Explainer: So we've been, we've had, now, effectively two different ways of getting more direct measurements, one is the LIGO, which is the Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory, which is where, getting the ripples in space time, coming off of the merging of black holes. The other one that you're mentioning is actually called the Event Horizon Telescope, where they're using radio waves to actually image the event horizon, that region where light cannot escape from the black hole at the center of our galaxy, which I know they're working on it right now. It's an amazing thing, but that'll be the most direct imaging of a black hole. LIGO is a direct detection of the consequence of the merging of black holes. The critical part has been, like, for the super massive black hole at the center of our galaxy, we've seen the stars orbiting it, and we've measured the mass, so that way, so if you look at a spinning black hole, it actually fundamentally alters the emission that's coming off the stuff that's falling into it. These are discovered as what are called X-ray binaries, that is, you know, there's an X-ray member of the binary that is emitting in the X-rays, and it's really not very bright in the optical (mumbles) at all, so there's always, people are looking at these X-ray binaries.\nExplainee: What sort of technology and, like, I guess tools have you been using in your studies, or, like, just in general, in the study of black holes?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","62":"Explainer: Do you know what gravity is?\nExplainee: It's something that, so, right now, we would be floating if there was no gravity, but since there's gravity we're sitting right down on these chairs.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","63":"Explainer: That's pretty good. So gravity wants to attract us to the Earth, and the Earth to us. But the Earth is so much bigger that even though we're actually pulling the Earth a little bit to us, you don't notice it so much. You know, the Moon pulls on the Earth a little bit.\nExplainee: Mm-hmm, just like the ocean tides.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","64":"Explainer: [Janna] Exactly, the Moon is such a big body compared to anything else very nearby that it has the larger effect, pulling the water of the Earth. But more than the Moon, think about the Sun pulling on the Earth. We orbit the whole Sun, just the way the Earth pulls on the Moon and causes the Moon to orbit us. All of those things are acting on you and me right now.\nExplainee: If gravity was too strong, would we be able to get up?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","65":"Explainer: Yes.\nExplainee: [Bonet screams] Ooh.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","66":"Explainer: They say that astronauts in space, definitely their spine elongates. There were two twin astronauts, one who stayed here on Earth and the other who went to the International Space Station. He was there for a long time, and when he came back, he was actually taller than his twin brother.\nExplainee: Wow.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","67":"Explainer: And a heavy object.\nExplainee: Oh my God. [Janna laughs]\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","68":"Explainer: And so, how much do you think you need?\nExplainee: I mean, I've read that six is ideal for people in my age range.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","69":"Explainer: It turns out, for people that are between the ages of 18 and 65, the agreed upon amount of sleep that people should get is between seven and nine hours, and it's really at least seven hours per night, to maintain optimal health as an adult. So at least seven hours. When we look at across all of the data that is available on like sleep and health, and sleep and psychiatric illness and those types of things, the largest risk is when people get five hours or less. What do you think is responsible for driving how much sleep you need, and things like that?\nExplainee: I mean, I know sleep is kind of regulated by the thalamus and the suprachiasmatic nucleus sending signals to the pineal gland to which kind of secretes melatonin, which tells us when it's time to go to sleep.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","70":"Explainer: Right. You can do part of this level, and you can do the other part, clearly. Got some expertise under your belt, and that's awesome, because I think that everyone should know more about sleep. And so the way that we think about what drives sleep are two independent but related processes and so they have kind of lame names. Process S and process C, and what you've kind of described is process C, and that's the master clock, right? And it helps regulate kind of the rhythms like all over your body, all your cells, and all those kind of things. It drives the release of melatonin from the pineal gland, and melatonin comes online under darkness, so when the sun goes down, your brain knows okay it's time to start getting ready for sleep, and so you start releasing melatonin, which really kind of sets the table for sleeping.\nExplainee: I'm from Hoi, so we have very long days. We have early sunrises, late sunsets. Does that signify less sleep, because we have a shorter amount of time for melatonin to be released?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","71":"Explainer: What is a laser made out of? Well really it's sort of the same thing as a light bulb. Right?\nExplainee: So it's a beam?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","72":"Explainer: Well it depends. So if you're cutting steel, you need to have the nail. You need to have it concentrated all of the light, not going in all directions but you need it into as small a point as possible. And for that we use a lens. For a lens, the light's coming down as a column, you put in a lens, it all focuses it down in the same way as the nail and then it starts cutting that steel. Okay so that force per unit area--\nExplainee: So it's kind of like a magnifying glass? Like it magnifies the light down to a point?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","73":"Explainer: Exactly. And so now, if we have light like that that we wanna machine with. I bring this funnel and so, if we had a lens here and the light was coming down--\nExplainee: It funnels into--\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","74":"Explainer: Which is, by the way, what, when I was just starting out in graduate school, that was the hot new thing, so.\nExplainee: Exactly.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","75":"Explainer: That was, it was like, oh, wow, this might be it, and then, but very early on, it was, as I just started my, it was basically my second year of graduate school, it was like, uh, this is not that simple.\nExplainee: It isn't.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","76":"Explainer: You know, everybody's been just coming at it from different wavelengths at the optical infrared, and, but definitely the X-rays has been one of those things where it's like, oh, finally.\nExplainee: And we've come a long way by seeing a wider range of the spectrum, we can elucidate more about the circumnuclear geometry, and there's just been so much progress made with all these new spectral models that we use to fit AGN spectra, and the different types of classes of AGN, like type one and type two are believed to be just a viewing angle effect of seeing this torus at different angles.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","77":"Explainer: And sleep science. Do you sleep?\nExplainee: I do, I try. [laughs]\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","78":"Explainer: But being off is not just being off. There's lots of things that are happening. We're gonna kind of talk about those different pieces of sleep.\nExplainee: Okay.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","79":"Explainer: Okay? When do you think you experience the most REM?\nExplainee: Well I've heard that you don't really go into like a deeper sleep, so I'm guessing like N-3, or really any of the N's at all, really, if you are on technology right before you sleep. And also if there's too much light, or if you're listening to music while you're asleep or anything like that, you're not experiencing deep sleep, right?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","80":"Explainer: You know, some of that is totally accurate, that like when your brain's more engaged by being on your phone or doing things that you really enjoy or things that stress you out or any of those types of things, it's harder to get to sleep and to kind of fall into that deeper levels of sleep. Most of the REM sleep, this dreaming sleep, happens in the second half of the night.\nExplainee: Oh.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","81":"Explainer: One to six hours? That's a long nap.\nExplainee: It is a long nap.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","82":"Explainer: So have you taken a quantum mechanics course?\nExplainee: I have. I took that last year.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","83":"Explainer: I think to really get deep into nanomaterials and nanoscale devices, you really have to understand to some level, quantum mechanics. What it teaches us as we make these devices smaller and smaller, their properties begin to now depend on the size and the orientation of these devices. There are materials, and you're taking a 2D materials class, you know about this, that are intrinsically thin. As they're grown, as they're fabricated, they're already at the nanoscale and they possess these quantum confinement properties that as a nanotechnologist, you try to exploit. And so the first ones I wanted to talk to you about are quantum dots, have you heard of quantum dots before?\nExplainee: Yes.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","84":"Explainer: So these are typically semiconductors. They can be cadmium selenide cadmium sulfide, zinc selenide and they're small clusters of atoms. They can be from 2 to 10 nanometers. What's interesting about these materials?\nExplainee: Well, the other day we were talking about the different dimensions you can have of nanotechnology. So all the way from like 0D to 3D. If I remember correctly, my professor labeled it as 0D?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","85":"Explainer: That's correct. Yeah. Because of quantum confinement, once you get below this 15 nanometer range, the band gap of the material depends completely on the size of the material. So in bulk materials, if you want to change the band gap, you have to change the material, right? But in these quantum dots specifically, just by changing the size, you can change their band gap. And because their band gap is changing, their optical properties are different. And you can precisely tune the wavelength of light that they emit just by changing their size.\nExplainee: What are the applications of these quantum dots?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","86":"Explainer: Yeah. 100%. That's right. And that's the motivation for looking at these emerging materials. But I would never bet against the innovation and the creativity in this nano electronic space. Tens of thousands of scientists, every time they hit a barrier, at least historically, as a guide, they have found a way to overcome it. It's a real marvel in ingenuity.\nExplainee: I gotta ask. The lights that are behind you, is that related to the quantum dots that you work with at all?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","87":"Explainer: Do you know what machine learning means? Have you heard that before?\nExplainee: No.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","88":"Explainer: And what makes a dog, a dog and a cat, a cat?\nExplainee: Well, dogs are very playful, I think, more than cats. Cats lick themselves more than dogs, I think.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","89":"Explainer: What about this one?\nExplainee: A dog. A cat. I think, a cat? Because it's more skinny. And also, its legs are like really tall and its ears are a little pointy.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","90":"Explainer: And how did you know that it's not a cat or a dog?\nExplainee: Because cats and dogs... Because they walk on their paws and their ears are like right here, not right here, and they don't wear watches.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","91":"Explainer: Are those like the practice problems you do before the test?\nExplainee: Well, just like everything that's gonna be on the test is on the review.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","92":"Explainer: Which means that in the test, you're not seeing any problems that you don't know how to solve. As long as you did all your practice, right?\nExplainee: Yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","93":"Explainer: So machines work the same way. If you show them a lot of examples and give them practice, they'll learn how to guess. And then when you give them the test, they should be able to do that. So we looked at eight pictures and you were able to answer really quickly. But what would you do if I gave you 10 million examples? Would you be able to do that so quickly?\nExplainee: No.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","94":"Explainer: Do you know why we're here today?\nExplainee: Because we're talking about science.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","95":"Explainer: Do you know that your body is made up of really tiny things called cells?\nExplainee: Um, yes, I know that.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","96":"Explainer: What have you been up to? And yeah, what are you working on?\nExplainee: Lately I've been doing, you know, always a little bit of side channel analysis. So what I really do, you know, is all hardware layer. So I've been looking, you know, at some various devices lately, at how susceptible they are to fault attacks, what that sort of means in real life. You know, not just purely the research side, but also how much should you care about it.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","97":"Explainer: Maybe a mutual acquaintance of ours, Jasper gave a example of fault injection, and I like to use that as, when I'm trying to explain fault injection, he shows a pinball machine and the pinball machine, obviously the two inputs are the two plungers when you're playing a pinball machine, but fault injection, you can tilt the entire pinball machine, right? You're just introducing some external variable that's outside of the traditional inputs that you're used to and you've now controlled the environment in a advantageous way to the user or the player. Can you give an example of some type of fault injection that you're doing or working on?\nExplainee: One of them was looking at, like, a little hardware Bitcoin wallet, and you could use fault injection to actually recover secrets from it, and a lot of devices. I mean, the whole idea is pretty cool, right? Because you tell the device, Hey, I want to authenticate, and it's supposed to run some really crazy math that authenticates it, but instead of doing that crazy math and attacking the math, you just attack the check at the end.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","98":"Explainer: You mean flipping bits within flash?\nExplainee: Yeah, exactly, right. So flipping it in this sort of flash memory. And so someone's done it with x-rays. There's actually, I forget who now. There's a paper, at least one, and it's just like a little plate they make with like a hole in it to concentrate the x-ray source and it works, so yeah, it's super interesting. Like, one bit in memory means a lot, especially in the flash memory side. Yeah, visualizing it would be cool though.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","99":"Explainer: I've never seen... Maybe call it a verifiable visualization of it, right? We know it's true, you know, you can get skin cancer by going outside and having too many high energy particles hit you, but we've never seen it. And we know it can happen to a computer chip, but I've never seen both.\nExplainee: Yeah, so actually, so it's funny you mentioned, like, making it more obvious. I mean, staying on fault injection right now, this is lately what I've been up to. A lot of making a little kind of, you know, like electronics kits of old, right? And you can assemble it all yourself and see how it works. So making something like that for fault injection. So all kind of older logic and stuff like that. So, I mean, it's sort of based on, like, you're presented the little MUX chip. You know, voltage switcher. That sort of idea, using just discreet logic to generate the actual glitch itself. So, but you know, it's part of, I think, this stuff, right? It's like people don't know about it sometimes. Like, even engineers designing systems. It's new to a lot of people.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","100":"Explainer: So tell me, what do you know about black holes?\nExplainee: Well, I know they're created when stars, once they start growing, it doesn't, it can't expand anymore, so they collapse inward.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","101":"Explainer: You know, we first met 10, 11 years ago and machine learning has changed a lot since then.\nExplainee: Tooling that we now have, the capacity, and also, an elevation of the problem sets that we're dealing with and how to frame the problem. And I'm almost struggling to figure out whether it's a blessing or curse that it has become as accessible and as democratized and as easy to execute and you just build another new company from scratch. And so, what's been, kind of, your reflection on that?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","102":"Explainer: Well, you're absolutely right that the attention machine learning gets has grown dramatically. 20 years ago, going to gatherings and telling people what I was working on and seeing the blank face or the like, Where's the turn? and walk away. Like, Oh, no. The accessibility of the tooling, like, we can now do in, like, five lines of code something that would have taken 500 lines of very mathematical, messy, gnarly code even, you know, five years ago. And that's not an exaggeration. And there are tools that mean that pretty much anyone can pick this up and start playing with it and start to build with it. And that is also really exciting.\nExplainee: In contrast, what I'm struggling with, the friend of mine who asked me to look at some health care data for him. And despite the capabilities that we're having in all of the, kind of, bigger societal problems alongside with data collection engineering, all the gnarly stuff, that is actually not the machine learning itself, it's the rest of it where certain data isn't available. And to me, it's staggering how difficult it is to get it off the ground and actually use.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","103":"Explainer: And part of the challenge of it is not the mathematics of building models, but the challenge is making sure that the data is sufficiently representative, potentially high quality.\nExplainee: And how transparent do I need to build it for it to be adopted at some point? What types of biases in the data collection, and then also in the usage? We now call it the bias, but we're still struggling with the society not really living up to its expectations and then machine learning, bringing it to the forefront.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","104":"Explainer: So when we think about the next five to 10 years, the things that are really still holding us back are these uneven applications of resources to problems because the problems that get attention are the high value ones in terms of how much money you can make or the things that are fashionable enough that you can publish a paper on it. So what do you think is holding us back?\nExplainee: I fully agree on the steps you pointed out and the processes. I think there is a chicken and egg problem, like your former example, that these areas that need to wait for data, the value of the data collection is then also slightly less apparent. And so, it gets delayed further and you'll see that happening. But what my experience has been, there's unfortunately, I feel a drifting apart between academia and the uses of AI, but I am somewhat frustrated with a generation of students who have standard data sets that they never think about what the model needs to be used for, that they never have to think about how the data was collected. So with all of these challenges ahead of us, how optimistic are you about this world that I deeply believe we can create and the steps towards it?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","105":"Explainer: {missing part}\n","106":"Explainer: The thing that makes them cool is they're sort of like tilings, it looks like you could put this together by cutting little pieces of paper and sliding them together, but they're still one sheet.\nExplainee: They weren't cut?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","107":"Explainer: There's no cuts in these just folding. We can build these up from smaller building blocks of folds, learn how to fold little pieces and put them together in the same way that a tiling like this looks like it's built up of little pieces. Can you make a fold that starts at the dot that doesn't run all the way across the paper?\nExplainee: How about like that?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","108":"Explainer: Mm-hmm. Each of these folds is peaked like a mountain and we call these mountain folds but if I made it the other way, then it's shaped this way and we call it a valley fold. In all of origami there's just mountains and valleys.\nExplainee: So all the folds are reversible?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","109":"Explainer: So they're all reversible and it turns out that in every origami shape that folds flat, it's going to be either three mountains and a valley or, if we're looking at the backside, three valleys and a mountain, they always differ by two.\nExplainee: Oh.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","110":"Explainer: That's a rule of all flat origami no matter how many folds come together at a point and I'm going to show you a building block of tessellations, it's called a twist because that center square, as I unfold it, it twists, it rotates.\nExplainee: Twists?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","111":"Explainer: We have to use electron microscopes and then what we have been developing a way to slice the brain into really thin slices, use an electron microscope to take a picture of each slice, and then use computers to put it all back. Imagine that we could get a map of every connection, right? And we knew how neurons fire. Do you think we could put that in a computer, that map, and then therefore, that computer should be able to think just like the brain that we extracted it from?\nExplainee: Well, the computer only communicates with itself in binary so it only has two options, it can only ask itself yes or no questions, but a human brain has an infinity of directions that it can go.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","112":"Explainee: So how do you do your observations in optical and infrared?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","113":"Explainer: Yeah, again, we don't know exactly where X, Y, Z, zero is, we're assuming that it's something, you know, the X-rays that are coming out are very close to the event horizon of the black hole, but this is still, you know, your realm of X-rays, to really figure out those kinds of things. But once the X-rays, once the photons hit the corona, and are re-scattered, and up, energized, and then they start illuminating the accretion disk, it heats it up, and so just by the light travel time, when the optical, if it gets, you know, brighter and fainter, and then the infrared gets brighter and fainter, two weeks later, then the dust is two light weeks away from that. So it's a one dimensional one, so we're averaging, so we don't get the two dimensional, or even three dimensional one. And then we've done it now, of course, we have better telescopes, there was a project where you could do it with the Hubble Space Telescope and the ultraviolet, you used the Swift Observatory, which had optical and ultraviolet, and then from ground base, we did optical, and then from space we did it with Spitzer and the infrared. So you could actually see this bright flash go off in a nearby AGN called NGC5548, and then you see it propagate as it warms up the disk, as all that light is falling onto it, and then eventually you hit the, the, further away, where the dust is, and the dust tends to radiate in an infrared. So we got basically a structure, and you just, you see this flashbulb go off, and then it illuminates, effectively, the structure.\nExplainee: So you can map out the dust, where do you see it?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","114":"Explainer: So you do see it, basically the dust sublimation radius, and you see it at, and it tells you, depending on what kind of dust it is, and it's actually one of the problems for me studying, whenever we try and do X-ray studies of low luminosity active galactic nuclei in your, by galaxies, because there're all these X-ray binaries that are also emitting X-rays, which make our lives difficult. But they're also in black holes, when it's this really interesting sort of both, it's great, but ugh, it's also a source of noise for those of us who are trying to do X-ray observations of nearby galaxies.\nExplainee: We have the same problem, we can't see the actual black hole underneath all these very bright X-ray binaries.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","115":"Explainer: Which is great, although it still doesn't help us in the AGN community, because we don't know how the millions to billions solar mass black holes came to be. But it's, at least we're building up, or hopefully that at some point, and by understanding these lower mass, how these lower mass black holes came to be, then we can see where there are a large scale number of mergers can potentially give us this, or you really need something, other, another corridor to fundamentally get us something that's a million solar masses, you know, on the minimum side, but definitely, you know, we've gotten those which are billion. So we know we can merge the million solar mass black holes to get the bigger ones, but how do you get to those in the beginning, particularly so early in the universe, when you get quasars at really high red shifts, so they're really early on.\nExplainee: Yeah, it is odd, it is very odd. I mean, the other thing that's a little odd, now we're going back to stellar mass black holes is, so we look at a lot of supernova remnants, and we, so we see them, we can only really see them in our own galaxy, and so we have a lot of supernova remnants, and so how we see them is, you see the expelled mass from the star as it died, so that creates an extended source, and then you look for the compact object that was left behind. And what's interesting is that you see, you quite often see the neutron stars because they pulse, so they're easy to see, but so far, we've not found a single black hole at the center of a supernova remnant. And so, which is interesting, so you say, you should see them, you know, you ought to see some fallback, you know, you need some matter, you need something, but no, never, not yet been detected.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","116":"Explainer: And this goes to the idea that you don't have a core balance, that a supernova with a black hole as its final result, actually never has any kind of expulsion, that it all just goes. (imitates sucking)\nExplainee: Yeah, that might be, yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","117":"Explainer: So what are some of the techniques you're applying to look at that debate data?\nExplainee: Something I'm interested in exploring is how well it works to use deep learning and sort of automatically extracted features from this text versus using some of the more traditional techniques that we have, things like lexicons or some sort of template matching techniques for extracting features from texts. That's a question I'm just interested in, in general. When do we really need deep learning versus when can we use something that's a little bit more interpretable, something that's been around for a while?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","118":"Explainer: If you train a model off of language off the internet, it sometimes says uncomfortable things or inappropriate things and sometimes really biased things. Have you ever run into this yourself? And then how do you think about that problem of potentially even measuring the bias in a model that we've trained?\nExplainee: Yeah, it's a really tricky question. As you said, these models are trained to, sort of, predict the next sequence of words, given a certain sequence of words. So we could start with just, sort of, prompts like the woman was versus the man was, and, kind of, pull out common words that are, sort of, more used with one phrase versus the other. So that's, sort of, a qualitative way of looking at it. It's not ever kind of a guarantee of how the model is gonna behave in one particular instance. And I think that's what's really tricky and that's why I, sort of, think it's really good for creators of systems to just be honest about, This is, sort of, what we have seen. And so then, someone can make their own judgment about, Is this gonna be too high risk for, sort of, my particular use case?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","119":"Explainer: {missing part}\n","120":"Explainer: To have the waves together.\nExplainee: Yeah, and in two states and in two possible states of the world, you can just literally put a plus sign between them and that's a sensible state, that's a good state, it makes sense.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","121":"Explainer: So do you think there's some sense in which we shouldn't be thinking about individual universes, individual space-time, so we should be thinking about superpositions of space-times?\nExplainee: Yeah, I think so. I think if you were to go far enough back in the history of the universe, back to when it was very, very dense, very small, and when quantum mechanics was certainly important, then it must have been like that. I mean, if we believe that the dominant standard model of cosmology, something had to produce the density perturbations, the things that seeded all the galaxies and stars and everything else in the world. So there's a galaxy over there, let's say, and not over there, so how did that happen? Why is there a galaxy there and not there? In the standard theory, as you know, that was a quantum event, a random event. And it doesn't mean that if happened there and not there 'cause you flipped a coin, it actually happened in both places. There's gotta be a wave function where in one branch of the wave function there's a galaxy there and not there, and on the other branch it's the opposite.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","122":"Explainer: Practical purposes.\nExplainee: Yes.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","123":"Explainer: So this is a huge crisis 'cause either quantum mechanics is wrong, and as you described it, it's the most accurately-tested paradigm in the history of physics, how could it be wrong, right? Or the event horizon is letting information out and violating one of the most sacred principles of relativity.\nExplainee: One thing about quantum mechanics is that any time you have a state of the world and another state of the world, you can literally add them together and get a third possible state, as crazy as that sounds. And so if you're gonna have a quantum theory of gravity, then we can't really talk about there being a black hole or not a black hole, or an event horizon or not an event horizon, because we could always a state that had an event horizon and a state that doesn't, or has the event horizon in a slightly different position, maybe, and add them together. So the existence or position of an event horizon can't possibly be determined as a fact any more than the position of an electron is determined. So I think that's the loophole.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","124":"Explainer: Right, exactly. And the most knowledge you could ever have would only be on a two-dimensional surface.\nExplainee: Right, and as big as the universe, and then you're done. So, you know, not likely that we're ever gonna hit that limit any time soon.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","125":"Explainer: [Robert] Would you like to give it a try?\nExplainee: Sure.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","126":"Explainer: So you ready?\nExplainee: Yep.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","127":"Explainer: Okay. We're going to start with a model that every Japanese person learns in kindergarten, it's called a crane, traditional origami design, it's over 400 years old. So, people have been doing what we're about to do for 400 years.\nExplainee: Wow.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","128":"Explainer: Now, this is a traditional Japanese design but there are origami designs that have been around so long we're not entirely sure where they originated. We're going to learn how to fold a cootie catcher.\nExplainee: Okay, good.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","129":"Explainer: Yeah, but there's something else we can do with this model. If we set it down and push on the middle then pop it inside out so that three flaps come up and one stays down and then it's called talking crow because here's a little crow's beak and mouth.\nExplainee: Wow.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","130":"Explainer: Sure, and people are working on that already.\nExplainee: Yeah, yeah, exactly. And it's this very fruitful area of research, and you can find yourself looking like 20 years out, right, where you have an enormous number of electric cars. You have all of these batteries. That's essentially a distributed peak load power grid, right. Like, the cars are getting plugged in and unplugged at different times. If you have a mechanism that's able to automatically and autonomously be distributing power based on batteries that are scattered throughout the grid that are being used for other purposes. Their owners don't even necessarily need to be aware. I mean, to have something that looks like a much more viable society that still has a lot of electricity needs but is able to base that much more on renewables, is able to make up the difference during peak load periods or during differences in weather, that is able to have power much closer to where it is needed rather than having to be distributed over great distances. It's like, that's something that would be an enormously hard problem to solve. And it's not that the blockchain makes it easy, but it makes it possible.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","131":"Explainer: Where is this technology? Why haven't I seen any change yet?\nExplainee: (laughs) Yes, yes, yes.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","132":"Explainer: The system we have today is also broken. (laughs) Right?\nExplainee: Yes.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","133":"Explainer: In that it's hard to compare it to some perfect future. Just like you compare autonomous vehicles to this very high standard because machines are doing it. It should be perfect. There should be zero car deaths.\nExplainee: (laughs) Yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","134":"Explainer: Do you know what computer hacking is?\nExplainee: It's bad. Like, I'm going into someone's personal account or account, changing some stuff or just stealing some information or your money.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","135":"Explainer: What they're trying to do is they're trying to even prevent the bad hackers from getting in in the first place.\nExplainee: So they put like a protection account or something.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","136":"Explainer: I started doing the good hacking when I turned nine years old.\nExplainee: Wow.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","137":"Explainer: I started going on the computer and playing video games, but I had some ideas of my own, and that's where I started to learn how to hack. I wanted to play with my friends on this video game and just change the way that things look.\nExplainee: But that would be kinda bad, because maybe the creator did it for a reason.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","138":"Explainer: That's entirely possible. They may have done it for a reason, but you may have come up with a really good idea that, do you think there are other people who might like the idea that you came up with?\nExplainee: Yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","139":"Explainer: What do you think of when you think of nanotechnology?\nExplainee: It kind of seems very science fiction.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","140":"Explainer: Yeah, so modern computer chips rely heavily on nanotechnology. Does this look familiar to you? Can you guess what this might be?\nExplainee: I don't know.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","141":"Explainer: So this is a silicon wafer, and they're embedded in basically almost every object that you use, from a laptop, to a phone, to cars, television sets, appliances. We ended up cutting these into little squares and those repeating patterns, each of those is a processor. And those chips are what goes into all of these objects. What I want to talk to you about is how we got from where we started, and how we're able to actually fit 18 billion of these little devices in a little one inch by one inch area. They're called transistors. It's a switch. Very simply, think of it as a light switch that turns on and turns off using an electric field by applying a voltage.\nExplainee: OK.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","142":"Explainer: That's a really good question. It's actually a way that we can trade. Do you know what trade is?\nExplainee: Mmm-hmm, it's when you take turns doing something. It's when you give up most of what you want, right?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","143":"Explainer: Yeah.\nExplainee: If I could trade with any kid, I would trade, well, I would trade something I don't like so much.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","144":"Explainer: Oh, that's pretty cool. What do you know about computer hacking?\nExplainee: I don't really know much about computer hacking actually.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","145":"Explainer: Yep, there's also things like your mouse and there's even things like the microphone itself is actually an input device. It's taking something from you, which is the sound and it's then transmitting that, ad it's actually sending it to me. Are there any other things that you can talk to a computer? You can give it information.\nExplainee: Camera.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","146":"Explainer: So you're saying gravity pulls things down, yet we've launched things into space. Do you ever wonder how we do that?\nExplainee: Isn't it like a slingshot, like if you pull something back enough it'll go in the opposite direction?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","147":"Explainer: Yeah, you feel pinned to that. It's exactly like that. There's something called the equivalence principle where people realized, especially Einstein, that if you were in outer space in a rocket ship and it was dark and painted and it was accelerating at exactly the right rate, you actually wouldn't know if you were sitting on the floor of a building around the Earth or if you were on a rocket ship that was accelerating.\nExplainee: That's crazy.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","148":"Explainer: Yeah. You ever had that experience where you're sitting in a train and the other one moves and for a second you're not sure if you're the one moving?\nExplainee: Yeah, 'cause I go on the train every day to go to school, but I never feel like I'm moving when I'm in the train, and then I'm like, wait, what?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","149":"Explainer: That's because in some sense, you're really not. Imagine you're in this train and it's going near the speed of light relative to the platform, but it's so smooth, then you should be in a situation in which there's no meaning to your absolute motion, there's no absolute motion. So that if you throw a ball up, you might think from the outside of the platform, be confused that when gravity pulls that back down, it's gonna hit you or something, but it'll land in your palm as surely as if you were in your living room.\nExplainee: Isn't that kinda crazy? Amazing.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","150":"Explainer: So let me tell you where it gets really crazy.\nExplainee: [Maria laughs]\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","151":"Explainer: Mine too, because I get to spend all day studying it. Because you know what sleep does for you?\nExplainee: It rests your body, like an electric car.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","152":"Explainer: They're pretty cool, right?\nExplainee: Mhm.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","153":"Explainer: And so what's really cool about this is that giraffes need to sleep like everybody else, and so the way that it does is it kind of slumps over and it gets down on its legs and it kind of becomes this ball, but what's crazy about the whole thing is they only sleep for like 30 minutes a day. 30 minutes! Because it can't waste any more time, because it can't be vulnerable for any longer. It can get eaten by lions and that kind of thing. It has kind of evolved in a way that it can still survive and still get all the restoration it needs under such a short period of time.\nExplainee: And how does it like recharge, like humans?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","154":"Explainer: And how did you feel?\nExplainee: Really tired.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","155":"Explainer: A hippopotamus. They have a different challenge. They sleep underwater.\nExplainee: I could never do that, I would pass out.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","156":"Explainer: Would it be cool to have that power?\nExplainee: Uh yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","157":"Explainer: So now I want to talk about our last animal, and I think this one is probably the most amazing of all. Okay, so what's this?\nExplainee: Aww a dolphin.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","158":"Explainer: A dolphin! Yes. So dolphins, kind of like hippos, have to sleep in the water, okay? But because they're mammals, right, they need to breathe. Dolphins breathe air. They have to go up to the surface and breathe, right? And for an animal like that, it needs to figure out a way that it can sleep but also still survive, right? You know how dolphins sleep?\nExplainee: How?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","159":"Explainer: I wanted to talk to you about a specific type of science called nanotechnology. Have you ever heard of this word before?\nExplainee: Nhn nhn.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","160":"Explainer: Nano is kind of a funny word, right? It's a word that's used before another word, and it means one billion. What's the smallest object you can think of?\nExplainee: A baby ant?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","161":"Explainer: A baby ant? Very good. So I have over here a meter stick, let me show it to you. And so that's a meter and if I divide it by 1000, I get a millimeter. So milli just means 1000. There's all these little lines on the ruler. And each of those little lines is one millimeter. So a baby ant is probably a couple of millimeters. So even the thing, that's the smallest thing you can think of, it's a million times bigger than a nanometer. Tiny, tiny, tiny.\nExplainee: Tiny, tiny, tiny, tiny.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","162":"Explainer: If I took this stick and I was to draw 1 billion lines, the distance between those two lines would be one nanometer. So that's really all it is. It's just a measure of size. But it's really, really, really tiny, smaller than anything that we can see with our eyes. The reason why, in nanotechnology, scientists, we care about things that are that small, is because there are objects called atoms. Have you ever heard of atoms before?\nExplainee: Yes. I first heard of them on a show I watched called StoryBots. They're just little things that make up everything on Earth, even earth.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","163":"Explainer: That was a perfect explanation. But what if I told you that scientists invented a special type of microscope that not only lets you see atoms, but also lets you move them around and build things with them. Would you think that would be pretty cool?\nExplainee: Yeah!\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","164":"Explainer: You are definitely a second grader! [laughing] My daughter would probably answer the exact same way. A unicorn would be awesome.\nExplainee: Why do you study stuff so small?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","165":"Explainer: {missing part}\n","166":"Explainer: Yeah, that is one potential quality improvement that is still on the horizon is when we do spatialization, we use HRTF, the Head Relative Transfer Function, to make it sound like its in different places. But usually we just use this one kind of generic, here's your average human, HRTF function. Its possible, that of course, if you are right in the average then its perfect for you. But there's always people off to the extremes, that it doesn't do a very good job at. And there may be better ways to allow people to sample their own perfect HRTF which can improve the audio experience a lot. It all comes down to all these trade-offs.\nExplainee: You know, with display and with resolution, its one of those things where if people have one bad experience they kind of, oh well everything else. Its really difficult to build trust again with people who haven't done VR before but its easy to break off that trust when they have a bad experience.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","167":"Explainer: So, from your perspective, how would you describe gravity?\nExplainee: I'm taught that it's a force. It's described by inverse law. But I also know that it's a field. And there's a recent discovery with gravitational waves, although I don't know the specific details about that.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","168":"Explainer: So, when you say it's an inverse-square law, that means that the closer you are, the more strongly you feel the gravitational pull. And that makes sense. There's very few things that are stronger when you're further apart.\nExplainee: Yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","169":"Explainer: So you can also think of a gravitational field, something that permeates all of space. Even though the earth is three stories below us, it's not as though it's pulling at us from a distance. We're actually interacting with the field at this point and there's a real interaction right here at this point. And that's nice, because people were worried that if things acted at a distance, that the way that old-fashioned inverse-square force law describes it, that it was as spooky as mind-bending a spoon, that it was like telekinesis. If you don't touch something, how do you affect it? And so the first step was to start to think of gravity as a field that permeates all of a space. And it's weaker very far from the Earth and it's closer very close to the Earth. So one way to think of this field as a field that's really describing a curved space-time that is everywhere. Forget the difficulty of the math, just the intuition comes from two kind of simple observations. One was what Einstein described as the happiest thought of his life. So, right now, you might feel heavy in your chair, and we might feel heavy on the floor and our feet, or standing in an elevator cab. And Einstein said, what does the chair have to do with it, or the floor, or the elevator? Those aren't gravitational objects. So he wanted to eliminate them, and one way to do the thought experiment is to imagine standing in an elevator that you can see out of, a black box. And imagine the cable is cut and you and the elevator begin to fall.\nExplainee: So, in free fall?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","170":"Explainer: Yeah, it would just go straight. But if you did that on the Earth, what would happen?\nExplainee: It would just go down.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","171":"Explainer: You had that moment, I saw that it your face!\nExplainee: Yeah, yeah, yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","172":"Explainer: Isn't it kind of amazing?\nExplainee: Yeah. [laughs]\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","173":"Explainer: I'm sure you've heard about extra dimensions a little bit.\nExplainee: I've heard it, yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","174":"Explainer: Mm-hmm.\nExplainee: Is that an extra dimension? Does that fit into that, or is that something?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","175":"Explainer: It's a, yeah.\nExplainee: [Bela] Or how does that work?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","176":"Explainer: Mm-hmm. So we have quantum mechanics, right? The theory of atoms and so forth and how those work, and then we have gravity, and gravity doesn't seem to fit in. It's the one force of nature that we can't really easily fit into this quantum mechanical framework, so string theory is one of the best ideas.\nExplainee: Right.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","177":"Explainer: [Sean] Do you know where it comes from?\nExplainee: No.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","178":"Explainer: If you have a two dimensional surface that vibrates and is a physical thing, we call that a membrane. Membrane theory goes back, it never was as popular as string theory, but it's been around for a while. But if you had extra dimensions of space, then you can three dimensional vibrating things, and four dimensional vibrating things.\nExplainee: So how do these strings give rise to things like mass and charge, and basically give us the properties of the particles that we see?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","179":"Explainer: Well basically the strings are the particles that we see. It's exactly the same thing as we said for the straw, if you look at it far away it looks one dimensional. A little loop of string, so a little one dimensional circle that is vibrating. If you look at it from very, very far away, it just looks like a particle. So in string theory, an electron is a little string. A photon is a little string.\nExplainee: So, is string theory part of what they call the Grand Unified Theory? Is it supposed to be the last thing that sort of unifies all the forces together?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","180":"Explainer: Yes, string theory's even better. So the phrase Grand Unified Theory was coined in the 1970s for theories that joined electricity and magnetism. So a good string theory is gravity plus the Grand Unified Theory.\nExplainee: Okay.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","181":"Explainer: It's even better. It's the theory of everything. What would you tell a friend of yours if they asked you what dimensions are, what extra dimensions are, what a brane is?\nExplainee: So we have three spatial dimensions. A brane is sort of the next level. So a brane is a higher dimensional object that vibrates through space.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","182":"Explainer: Same with, who are the actors? It's not just people anymore. It's machines.\nExplainee: [Valentinas] Absolutely.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","183":"Explainer: We're gonna have to create entire new concepts of how they do trade and how they work with us, too. What kind of barriers or road blocks would you imagine are gonna happen in the blockchain space?\nExplainee: So at least when we talk about Bitcoin, there are some trust issues and some hacks. So there's obviously a need to work on trust and feeling that it's a safe technology.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","184":"Explainer: Yeah. One of the problems that Bitcoin has faced is Bitcoins getting stolen or lost. But a lot of that actually comes from people trying to recentralize Bitcoin in different ways making themselves actually a pretty easy target.\nExplainee: Absolutely, so education will be a big part before we actually can use the technology in a wide sense. Right?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","185":"Explainer: What is it exactly that you're trying to tease out of these materials to improve the battery's performance?\nExplainee: At first, one of the main things that we did was use nanomaterials to add conductivity. And so carbon anodes and graphene are really good at adding conductivity to batteries. And then in the subsequent years, nanomaterials have been really interesting from things like incorporating sensors into batteries, to increasing the functionality of batteries, having some responsive materials that use things like graphene sheets that are incorporated into a matrix, and then you add a safety functionality to a battery. We're trying to squeeze out almost all the functionality that we can. And as new nano materials are being discovered and there're new properties being discovered, a lot of the time that someone tries to think of a way to translate that into a battery.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","186":"Explainer: Because the materials are so small, they're at the nanoscale, their properties are dominated by quantum mechanics, which means that even slight changes in their size, in their orientation give profound changes in their properties. And while that's very scientifically interesting, and it allows you to tune their properties by making subtle changes, from a technology point of view, it's a bit of a headache in the sense that in technology want to optimize for a property and then repeat that over and over again. So what are some of the challenges that you face in the lab related to working with these materials and then trying to incorporate them into the batteries?\nExplainee: I think every step of a process in a battery is something where you have to think about how would this translate to making a battery in terms of the production? One thing that I think is very interesting about the field of nanoscale materials in general, is that how you make the material changes the properties a lot. And so we claim that this 2D material has this property, then tying that to the battery performance is something that's pretty difficult to do. It takes a few steps in between. So we have to think kind of creatively with how we can do that.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","187":"Explainee: I'm Tom Hull, I'm a math professor, a mathematician. I've been doing origami since I was eight years old and studying the mathematics of origami ever since grad school, at least.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","188":"Explainer: The first thing I want to show you is origami in the real world. This is the origami lamp. It comes shipped flat but it folds, clip holds it together. The lamp has LEDs on the inside so when we power it up we get light, we have a lampshade and we get the base.\nExplainee: Why does origami lend itself to, say, this type of application?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","189":"Explainer: This is another real-world application but this particular implementation is used to make a wheel for a Rover.\nExplainee: Cool, so this is something that can actually get really, really tiny but then get big and fat and roll.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","190":"Explainer: New problems arise when we try to make origami out of things other than paper, but also new opportunities. An example here which is a kind of a variant of the Miura-Ori. It's got a three-dimensional structure. If I stretch it one way, it expands the other but because it has these S-bends in the pattern, if you squeeze it, it doesn't go all the way flat. This is a epoxy impregnated aramid fiber and so if I put this fold pattern into it and then compress it and then put a skin on the top and bottom, this becomes incredibly lightweight but incredibly strong.\nExplainee: Yeah!\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","191":"Explainer: Yeah, so what goes in as sheet and what comes out is this, or something this wide.\nExplainee: That's cool, yeah. What do you see as kind of like the next big breakthrough? Is there anything out there on the horizon that you're just like, oh wow, this is really exciting?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","192":"Explainer: We're gonna talk about blockchain technology. Have you heard of blockchain?\nExplainee: I've heard of the words blockchain, but I'm not sure I know what it is.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","193":"Explainer: And so it's being run by all of these different computers that have like a node. So they're all running the same software and guaranteeing your transactions as they happen.\nExplainee: I mean, I would assume this technology is taking away business or activity from these middlemen.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","194":"Explainer: In some cases, yeah, it is. And a lot of people in the financial industry, in particular, are looking at it from the banking side of how do we use this technology to trade things like Bitcoin or other tokens that are easier to use instead of today's currency. A lot of people think about blockchain as Bitcoin because it's sort of in the news a lot, and it's this new cryptocurrency. And it's kind of exciting. But we're actually seeing a lot more use cases for blockchain that aren't around the currency side. They're more around, how do you take any asset and be able to trade that using this same technology.\nExplainee: Is there a mechanism for verifying that person A is a legitimate seller or producer of the item?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","195":"Explainer: Good to see you again, Yue.\nExplainee: Yes, good to see you.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","196":"Explainer: So how strong is the link?\nExplainee: Our study has found really strong associations looking at these populations, for example, with sleep apnea. We've done one meta-analysis and it's showed that those with sleep apnea, they have a ratio of 1.26, which means that those who have sleep apnea have 26% elevated risk of developing Alzheimer's compared to those without sleep apnea.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","197":"Explainer: So it's interesting, so I also saw that there was also a recent meta-analysis around sleep disturbances and dementia risk, and in that study, they looked about 250,000 people in this meta-analysis, and they followed them around for 10 years, and you know, when they pulled all the samples together, they found there was a 1.2 fold increased risk for developing all caused dementia, so it sounds like both sleep apnea and then maybe sleep disturbances more generally are associated with increased risk for dementia. When I think about that, I think about how sleep lives in the brain, these neurodegenerative diseases live in the brain, and so what do we know about the causality of this? Could it be that individuals who have early onset of say, Alzheimer's, have then poor sleep kind of as a consequence of that?\nExplainee: Yeah, so I think what's really fascinating is all these bio-directional relationships that's being identified in animal studies especially, showing that sleep changes actually occur very early on in the disease process, so it could be a prodromal stage of Parkinson's, and also in transgenic model of AD, they're already showing a lot of circadian abnormalities in this mouse.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","198":"Explainer: So within dementia risk in particular, Alzheimer's for instance, there are kind of two clear features that seem to be part of the pathology, right? So there's beta-amyloid which accumulates in the brain, and then there's kind of these tangles, this tauopathies, right? And so it sounds like sleep seems to be related to the tauopathies. What about kind of beta-amyloid?\nExplainee: Yes, in the transgenic mouse models of AD, including those expressing human mutant amyloid precursor protein, APP type or both, so that's kind of showing the sleep changes in both of these pathologies.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","199":"Explainer: Here's a spider with eight legs, ants with legs and these, just like the crane, are folded from a single uncut square.\nExplainee: What?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","200":"Explainer: That's a corner, four corners of the square, four points. How would you make one point out of this sheet of paper?\nExplainee: I'm thinking of, like, a paper airplane.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","201":"Explainer: You've got it, so you are ready to design origami.\nExplainee: Awesome.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","202":"Explainer: {missing part}\n","203":"Explainer: {missing part}\n","204":"Explainer: Whenever there's a part of a spacecraft that is shaped somewhat like paper, meaning it's big and flat, we can use folding mechanisms from origami to make it smaller.\nExplainee: Right.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","205":"Explainer: Telescopes, solar arrays, they need to be packed into a rocket, go up, but then expand in a very controlled, deterministic way when they get up into space.\nExplainee: Okay.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","206":"Explainer: These are the building blocks of many, many origami deployable shapes, it's called a degree-4 vertex. It's the number of lines. So in this case, we use solid lines for mountain, we use dash lines for valley. We're going to fold it and use these two to illustrate some important properties of origami mechanisms. It's important in the study of mechanisms to take into account the rigidity. So what we're going to do to help simulate rigidity is to take these rectangles and we're going to fold them over and over so that they just become stiff and rigid.\nExplainee: [Grad Student] Okay.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","207":"Explainer: And they fold flat and a pattern almost exactly like this was used for a solar array for a Japanese mission that flew in 1995.\nExplainee: So then you like fly it up compactly and then once you get up there, there's like some sort of like motorized mechanism, but you only need it on one fold.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","208":"Explainer: So, sadly, the only way to get them at exactly the same rate is when these are microscopic slivers and then that's not useful.\nExplainee: For sure, right, right.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","209":"Explainer: So do you know what virtual reality is?\nExplainee: Yes, its simple. Its like a video game except it feels like you're in the video game.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","210":"Explainer: That's actually a really good description. The idea is that if you've got a system here that can make you see whatever we want you to see, then we can make you believe that you're anywhere else, like on top of a mountain, or in a dungeon or under the ocean.\nExplainee: Or in Minecraft.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","211":"Explainer: {missing part}\n","212":"Explainer: Yeah.\nExplainee: And then G.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","213":"Explainer: You got it. Ooh! Yeah? Yeah, yeah. So this is really, this is like a gleaming glade or something, you know? Let's play this tune, Amazing Grace. Let's play it in its simplest form.\nExplainee: Yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","214":"Explainer: Nice, okay cool. Lets try one more version where we add some colors. Alright so lets visit the B flat, with a bit more imagination.\nExplainee: Yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","215":"Explainer: We're gonna talk about some science. Do you like science?\nExplainee: Yes, a lot.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","216":"Explainer: What's your idea what physics is?\nExplainee: Um, I'm not so sure.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","217":"Explainer: Exactly. It's not really one dimensional, right?\nExplainee: So everything has to be one or two dimensional before it's three dimensional.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","218":"Explainer: And how would you find yourself, like if someone said where are you, could you use some words or ideas to say where you are on that line?\nExplainee: I think I would be maybe there, since I'm facing it.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","219":"Explainer: Has its own unit, has one number.\nExplainee: Yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","220":"Explainer: I think you should be in this chair and you should be explaining this to me. You're much better at this than I am.\nExplainee: Yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","221":"Explainer: Well, as far as we know.\nExplainee: Yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","222":"Explainer: So in your studies, have you learned about machine learning?\nExplainee: Yeah, I have. So to me, machine learning is essentially exactly what it sounds like. It's trying to teach a machine specifics about something by inputting a lot of data points and slowly, the machine will build up knowledge about it over time. For example, my Gmail program, I assume that there would be a lot of, like, machine learning models happening at once, right?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","223":"Explainer: Absolutely. And that's a great example because you have models that are operating to do things like figure out if a new email is spam or not. So what would you think about if you were looking at an email and trying to decide if it went in one category or another?\nExplainee: I'd probably look at certain keywords. Maybe if the recipient and the sender had exchanged emails before and generally, those fell into in the past.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","224":"Explainer: [Hilary] Yes. [both laugh]\nExplainee: Oh, I didn't realize it was that deep, almost. Is there a situation which you'd want to use a deep learning algorithm over a reinforcement learning algorithm?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","225":"Explainer: You build a system that could actually be useless. So years ago, I had a client that was a big telecom company and they had a data scientist who built a deep learning system to predict customer churn. It actually was very accurate, but it wasn't useful because nobody knew why the prediction was what it was. So they could say, you know, Sunny, you're likely to quit next month. But they had no idea what to do about it. And so, I think there are a bunch of failure modes.\nExplainee: Would that be an example of, like, linear regression where the regression is accurate, but, you know, for marketing purposes, it's like, if you don't know why I'm quitting the service, then how can we fix this?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","226":"Explainer: Yeah. This is actually a good example of a very real world kind of machine learning problem where the solution to this was to build an interpretable system on top of the accurate predictions not to throw it away, but to do a bunch more work to figure out the why.\nExplainee: How can we improve machine learning algorithms?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","227":"Explainer: Maybe a wiring diagram is not sufficient to understand the brain, and it would be crazy to think that that would be sufficient, actually.\nExplainee: If you limit the connectome to be just the wiring diagram without, you know, more information about myelination or glial cells, all types of environmental features that surround the neurons and axons then you have an incomplete picture, no doubt.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","228":"Explainer: Yes.\nExplainee: I'm a musician and I don't think it's possible. I think that there are too many, you know, so much of it is associative to what you already know.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","229":"Explainee: Hello Donna, good to see you.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","230":"Explainer: You could not convince me to stay, no.\nExplainee: But you were there long enough to make a big impression and get some good work done.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","231":"Explainer: That's right, if you can do that, go for it.\nExplainee: And then we will shine that laser onto that electron beam, and the electron's rest frame, we beat the Schwinger limit.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","232":"Explainer: So we can either cheat by doing laser accelerating and going into that rest frame.\nExplainee: Yes.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","233":"Explainer: And that's, like you said, we're stuck a little bit, we're not up to that kind of acceleration, so that would be a Nobel Prize winning possible idea.\nExplainee: Absolutely.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","234":"Explainer: Okay.\nExplainee: And make them act as one coherent source. So one of the things that we'll be doing with our two petawatts, we're going to see if we can actually combine them into a 50. If you can do that, you can begin to imagine doing this with many lasers. Many petawatt lasers of the scale we're talking about. So one could possibly see an exawatt from that. People have been able to combine 10s of lasers together for a coherent source so you have to be able to phase lock them, you have to be able to make their phases be exactly connected and related and be able, as they propagate through all the different optical components, whatever it may be--\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","235":"Explainer: Have you heard of the breach of Target where they were breached many years ago and their point of sale systems were hacked?\nExplainee: Yes, I heard about that.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","236":"Explainer: So where people are swiping credit cards, those credit card numbers were stolen. They hired a company to come in and perform a penetration test to see, can the good guys essentially break in again to prevent this sort of thing in the future? And when this team came in, they found they actually were able to get pretty much to the same point of sale system, and the way they did that was by exploiting an internet-connected deli meat scale. Once the company was able to essentially get into the deli scale, because the deli scale was on the internal network, then they were able to really escalate privilege and find a vulnerability within another system. Essentially, that just got them into the network. and once you're in the network, it's often really easy to then escalate from there.\nExplainee: I've heard about similar attacks in hospitals using hospital equipment, but I'm surprised that something as simple as a meat scale would have been used in such an attack. We discussed it in class as how hackers look at some of the weakest links in these large networks and use those to tap into networks.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","237":"Explainer: Yeah, that's another interesting concept. It's really just different layers that we have for protection, because often when you're talking about something like a corporate network, or even your home network, you typically have sort of one level of defense, right? If someone can break that or it can get in through some other system that is connected or exposes some other protocol, like Bluetooth, right? You can connect to a Bluetooth device without being on the wireless network, without being on the LAN. That potentially gives you another place that you can pivot on and then access other devices, because if something has both Bluetooth and also Wi-Fi, well, if you can get in through Bluetooth, then you can then access the Wi-Fi and get to other devices on the network. Are you familiar with buffer overflows?\nExplainee: No, I am not familiar with that.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","238":"Explainer: Absolutely, you would essentially cause a segmentation fault.\nExplainee: Yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","239":"Explainer: Ever since buffer overflow started many years ago, there been a lot of protection mechanisms built to make it difficult to exploit. More and more, we're actually using smaller and smaller computers with smaller amounts of compute power. If you take a car, you have hundreds of microcontrollers that are all running there. So they don't really have a sophisticated operating system that can try to prevent attacks like buffer overflows. So how do we keep these low cost computers in here while adding layers of protection to prevent malice and these types of attacks? Sometimes it actually is, how can we write software or how can we build a system that prevents these types of attacks from entering? But oftentimes, it's really looking for how can we find new attacks that we haven't even necessarily thought of? What got you interested in computer science and information security?\nExplainee: I got interested in cybersecurity because I'm really into global affairs, global politics, and you often hear in the news about the rising power of China, the rising power of Iran. I enjoy how interdisciplinary computer science is. Like, nowadays there's so much going on in the world of computers and that's what fascinated me.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","240":"Explainer: You brought up China and Iran, and something that's interesting about those areas is really censorship, right? They have essentially censored internet. In the US, we have a really interesting internal struggle here where we actually have government agencies like the state department that are funding software to evade censorship, like Tor and other mechanisms. While then we also have an internal struggle where we have other organizations like the NSA who are specifically looking to break that exact same system that the US government is also funding.\nExplainee: There are a lot of ethical questions about whether we should be intervening in other countries, but it's pretty interesting that two different agencies of the government are actually working on contrasting technology. I can actually understand that because if we are creating a technology that we are going to deploy somewhere else, we should know its limitations. We should know how to control it.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","241":"Explainer: You haven't got to play with lasers. So I brought one. It's my friend's cat toy. Do you ever use a laser as a cat toy?\nExplainee: No.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","242":"Explainer: Well one of the fun things people do with lasers, the cat will try to grab that dot. I'm sure what you have at home is a flashlight. I brought a cute little one. So the question is, do you see any difference between what a flashlight does and what a laser does?\nExplainee: Flashlight is a bigger shine and the laser is just a dot.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","243":"Explainer: [Donna] And yet it's not. Isn't that amazing?\nExplainee: Yes.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","244":"Explainer: One of the things that lasers are great for is that because it's a directed beam, we can actually put that light where we want the light to go and sometimes you maybe just want to see something around the corner and you can't see it. But with a laser, you can actually and this is a smoky one so you can actually watch it go. You see it actually bending the corner?\nExplainee: Yes.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","245":"Explainer: So this obviously is much bigger than our hair. Right?\nExplainee: Yes.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","246":"Explainer: Have you ever seen that maybe there's a little bit of a red light when you do that?\nExplainee: Yes.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","247":"Explainer: Have you done any work in side channel analysis?\nExplainee: Like, a little bit.

If you wanna use a wireless router.\nExplainee: Yeah, I mean, there's obviously essentials, but yeah, no matter what, you can't really avoid any of this.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","249":"Explainer: Especially now that we're seeing more and more companies who are trying to make it illegal for you to inspect the vehicle that you've purchased, right? Something that you actually own.\nExplainee: Yeah, I think that's nuts. I'm firmly against that for sure.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","250":"Explainer: What if it were illegal? Would you then do it? Fortunately it's not today, right? It hasn't been, you know, despite their attempts, none of that has been passed, but if you had a vehicle and you wanted to inspect it, but all of a sudden, it passed, I mean.\nExplainee: I don't know, probably, yeah. [laughing] I don't think that's hurting anyone,\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","251":"Explainer: And there's a lot of those kinds of middlemen in our society today, right? We have a lot of banks.\nExplainee: Yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","252":"Explainer: We have a lot of companies that sort of help us make sure that our trades happen, but if we could guarantee the same trade using technology as sort of a technological trust, then we wouldn't really need all those middlemen in between.\nExplainee: So how does it work?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","253":"Explainer: It's basically a network of computers that all have the same history of transactions. And so instead of sort of there being one company with one database that holds all the information, the same sort of list is held by all these different people. Like, you could have it on your computer. And then it gets validated by everyone, and basically, that turns into the next part of the list. So it's sort of constantly updating itself.\nExplainee: So like, how do you make sure that it's secure?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","254":"Explainer: [Donna] And what's your major?\nExplainee: I'm an engineering physics major with a minor in math. I'm in the three, two program for biomedical engineering.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","255":"Explainer: Excellent. I got an engineering physics degree. There you go, something in common. We're here today talking about lasers. So have you have had much exposure to lasers yet at school?\nExplainee: Not yet. I'm really hoping that we will. I think it's super interesting just the field in general because I really do enjoy examining all the calculations and being able to do a little bit more of the math side of physics.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","256":"Explainer: Well a lot of lasers and when lasers first came along, they were only single color. Your cat toy, would only be a single color, probably a red one and so that's just one color. And one color means that it has to really be there for the whole time. One color is one wave length of light and so it's just one wave that goes on and on and on. If you want a short pulse, you actually have to have all the colors. And if you can imagine that one point in time, and I like to say it's like a conductor of an orchestra. When you're listening to an orchestra warm up, they sound terrible, they're all playing their own notes. But when the conductor conducts them, they all play different notes but, together, it's beautiful music. So we have something in the laser called a mode locker and it's like the conductor and it says go now. And all the colors will start together but some colors are long wave length and others are shorter. So next thing you know, you have peaks meeting valleys and they cancel each other. And the more colors you can bring in, the faster that happens and the shorter the pulse you can make.\nExplainee: What's the pendant?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","257":"Explainer: {missing part}\n","258":"Explainer: Yeah. The amazing thing about harmony is that it exists in nature. So, take the harmonic series of the note F, for example. Okay. You have the ups on the fifth and the fourth and then the, (hums) That seemed a little bit sharp, but that's fine. And then tones get increasingly small. Beneath that note, you have the undertone series, which essentially is like a reflection of something. In the same way that when a tree grows in nature, you have the branches which grow upwards and the roots which go downwards. So it's quite a nice thing to thing about, this being the key center, the floor, the ground, and then these two different directions of ways in which it can express itself, and the differences in the sensations with that. Lots of the time I think when it comes to reharmonization or harmonization, people think that the solution to the problems come when we add more notes.\nExplainee: Yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","259":"Explainer: I think that people forget that you can work with the notes you already have by just rearranging them, just the simple idea of inversion, inversion of the simple triad, of F major. \u266aI once was lost and now I'm found \u266a \u266a Was blind \u266a \u266a But now I see \u266a Now how home do I want to go here, you know? Is there another verse to come?\nExplainee: Right.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","260":"Explainer: Yeah. so this is the note F.\nExplainee: Yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","261":"Explainer: F major, F minor, D flat major seven G flat diminished, G flat minor major seven, G minor seven, G soft, G seven, G seven sharp 11. And then, G seven with a flat 13\nExplainee: (laughs)\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","262":"Explainer: Right.\nExplainee: You know, you changed the feeling of it, what otherwise would, you know, if you were to tell a kid that this is a major song, we should be happy.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","263":"Explainer: But if you arrive in F major from A major, then it's like the sun's gone in.\nExplainee: Interesting.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","264":"Explainer: Connectome.\nExplainee: To be honest, I have no idea.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","265":"Explainer: In one brain, in your brain. Could I take all of that information and put it inside a computer? Would that computer then be you?\nExplainee: Computers they don't have feelings, they won't have feelings and I think that's one thing that makes the human race strong.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","266":"Explainer: Huh.\nExplainee: Understanding the anatomy of the brain is definitely important but, it doesn't necessarily tell us everything about the function, there's some sort of temporal order from neuron to neuron and region to region that we may not be able to pick up.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","267":"Explainer: Because there's more to you in here than just information passing between neurons.\nExplainee: I'd like to think so.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","268":"Explainer: You have not. Right. It's a way for a prover to convince a verifier that something is true without revealing anything about why it's true, which sounds totally bizarre. Right?\nExplainee: Yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","269":"Explainer: So nowhere in this interaction, did you see any information that you didn't already know. And yet I convinced you that I know the combination. Right?\nExplainee: Yeah. So what's the exact purpose of a zero-knowledge proof? Is it like proving something but without giving enough information that could endanger whatever it is that you're proving?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","270":"Explainer: Suppose you wanted to exchange messages with someone that you knew.\nExplainee: Mm-hmm.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","271":"Explainer: It sounds impossible. Right?\nExplainee: It does.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","272":"Explainer: {missing part}\n","273":"Explainer: I've got one too. I was nine and we were at the science expo in San Francisco. Two scientists were dissecting an eye, a cow's eye. And I was like that is the coolest thing I've ever seen. And something about that that carried me forward. Something happened so long ago, it left some long lasting trace through neural circuits and it continues to shape the decisions we make about what to study and what to do.\nExplainee: Just being able to apply those memories in the future is just so crucial in everyday life of the humans and the fact that we're learning how that works. And I would love to hear more about your side of memory and the mechanisms that you're studying.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","274":"Explainer: My work has actually kind of pushed against that distinction between memories that kind of are consciously accessible versus unconscious.\nExplainee: When you say that you don't necessarily look at implicit and explicit memory as anything different, if you were to take a step back, what would you define as implicit and explicit memory?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","275":"Explainer: The best way to kind of think about that distinction really goes back historically to one of the most important discoveries in memory research. The patient was referred to famously as patient HM. The neurosurgeon went in and removed the tissue that happened to be right around the hippocampus on both the left side and the right side of HM's brain. But then they started noticing something odd in his behavior. He was not able to create new memories of the experiences he had after the surgery. And that led Brenda Milner and her colleagues to report that the hippocampus was very important for memory, but a one particular kind, these sort of explicit, or as now referred to them episodic memories. But the hippocampus was not necessary for learning skills like mirror tracing, things that you can't necessarily articulate but you just get better at over time. And it really led to a couple of decades or more even of an enormous amount of very important work that kind of kept on breaking memory down further and further into different types. Episodic and semantic as both forms of explicit memory where episodic refers to memory for an event that happened like what you did yesterday morning and semantic refers to general knowledge about the world. Implicit memory is being broken down into a bunch of different kinds like skills or habits or conditioning. And when I started graduate school, many of us felt kind of the next question was really to understand how do we now understand how they work together. This was right around when functional magnetic resonance imaging started becoming a popular tool for measuring brain activity. We could scan the entire brain and we could ask questions about multiple brain regions at once. And we discovered that what we might expect during a skill learning task that only the striatum might show activity, that we also saw the activity in the hippocampus. Or when we asked someone to form an episodic memory that we thought might depend only on the hippocampus we suddenly also saw activity in the prefrontal cortex. And so the confluence of these new ideas and questions about how different forms of memory interact together with the development of new tools for studying the human mind and brain allowed us to kind of adjust our view of memory systems, to think of them less as multiple completely separate independent systems and instead to try to understand how they really work in concert with each other and give rise to all kinds of behaviors that might not fit neatly into one category or another.\nExplainee: Are the connectivities that you're seeing using the FMRI in your studies, are they different when you look at the implicit and explicit memories? Are you seeing more activity in the striatum in comparison to the hippocampus or the prefrontal cortex?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","276":"Explainer: Yeah, you know things are kind of breaking down in unexpected ways I'd say. I think there's been a lot of really great work out of multiple labs showing hippocampal activity related to behaviors that don't look anything like episodic memories, but which might depend on episodic memories right? So for example also when you're making a decision about how to choose between two good options that suddenly you might see activity in the hippocampus related to the choice itself, others have found that you find activity in the hippocampus not only when people are forming memories, but also when they're imagining events that are gonna happen in the future. So it kind of forced us to rethink the way we define what the hippocampus might be doing in a way that can account for creating memories, thinking about the future, making decisions and other kinds of behaviors that involve what we would refer to you in the field as relational processing. And that raises all kinds of new questions about what memory really is. Reminiscing about our early influences that made us want to be scientists is that, you know, of course we know, we know better than to think that those are necessarily accurate memories. You know this reminds me of sort of the classic example from literature when people talk about memory of course is Marcel Proust's Madeleine in Remembrance of Things Past. Where in the book it's this taste for the, for the protagonist this taste of the crumbs of the Madeleine cookie and the tea that bring him back to his childhood. You know, seven volumes then emerge of memories of, of that childhood. Digging further into earlier drafts of Proust's novel that initially it didn't describe a Madeleine at all.\nExplainee: It's very interesting to see the imperfections of the human brain and being able to rewrite something that happened to you and fully believe it yourself. I think that that's one of the coolest errors and faults in the human brain that could exist.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","277":"Explainer: What's your favorite subject?\nExplainee: I'd say math. Some of the small problems can actually be really big and complicated. It's like a puzzle.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","278":"Explainer: I know where it is, but I don't wanna tell you. Do you believe me? You're not sure to believe me. Right?\nExplainee: Yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","279":"Explainer: But what if I could prove to you that I know where the puffin is without revealing to you where it is? Let me show you. I took that photo that we showed you. And I put it behind this poster here. Why don't you go take a look through that hole?\nExplainee: I see the puffin.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","280":"Explainer: What if instead, we could somehow use a zero-knowledge proof to log in. You would just be able to prove that, hey, I'm Chelsea, without revealing anything to them. If you could do that, then it would be amazing, right?\nExplainee: Yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","281":"Explainer: What does infinity mean to you?\nExplainee: Really anything that has no end to it.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","282":"Explainer: Adding infinities. Multiplying infinities. And there's a sense in which it's very similar to the arithmetic that you learned about already. But it's also totally different. It has some very weird properties. Welcome to Hilbert's Hotel. Unlike an ordinary hotel, has accountably infinitely many rooms. Suppose a new guest shows up, you might think that the new guest could take the room that's all the way down at the end of the hall, all the way at infinity, except there isn't a room like that. The rooms each have a number, and even though there's infinitely many rooms, each room is only a finite distance away. So here's how we're gonna make room for the new guest. I'm gonna ask the guest in room one to move into room two, and then we're gonna ask the guest in room two to move into room three, and we'll continue this all the way along. It looks to me like there's space for the new guest. Where is it? \nExplainee: It'll be in room number one.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","283":"Explainer: Room number one. Exactly. I'm gonna use this symbol for infinity, but what we've just shown is that one, the one new guest plus infinity is equal to the same infinity. What happens if we had a second guest?\nExplainee: Would it be two plus infinity equals infinity?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","284":"Explainer: They can't live together. That would be a great solution. I don't know. I think these people don't really get along. So I need to somehow create infinitely many new rooms, but I can only ask each person in the hotel to move a finite distance away. So let's take the guest who is originally in room one and move them into room two. So that's creating one new space for us. And I'm gonna take the guest who was originally in room two and move them into room four. Are you starting to see a pattern here?\nExplainee: Yes. You're going up one each time?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","285":"Explainer: Yeah, I'm increasing by one more each time. So I'm doubling the room number in fact. So this is some of the strange arithmetic of infinity. So we have two Hilbert Hotels, each of which have infinitely many guests, then this is equal to?\nExplainee: Infinity.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","286":"Explainer: Infinity, great. Hilbert's Hotel is a story that mathematicians have been telling themselves for almost 100 years because it's a really visceral way to think about some of the counterintuitive properties of the arithmetic of infinity.\nExplainee: How does infinity come across in mathematics for you?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","287":"Explainer: Do you have any thoughts on like what the data might look like in a robotic setting, if you were to apply machine learning to robots?\nExplainee: I think of like coordinates.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","288":"Explainer: Yeah, so there's this generalization gap, this gap between what it was trained to do and the new thing.\nExplainee: So what's like the most complicated thing for a robot to learn, is it motion?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","289":"Explainer: So you can think of robotics as having two core components. One is perception, being able to see and feel and so forth, and action, where the robot actually figures out how to move its arm. And both components are really essential, and both components are quite difficult. If you train a perception system independently of how to choose actions, then it might make errors in a way that mess up the system that selects actions And so if you instead try to train these two systems together, to have it learn perception action for the goal of solving these different tasks, then the robot can be more successful. One thing that's really difficult about robotics is, there actually isn't that much data of robots in the world. On the internet, there's all sorts of text data, all sorts of image data that people upload and write. But there isn't a lot of data of doing a simple thing, like tying your shoe, for example, because it's so basic. One challenge is even just getting data sets that allow us to teach robots to do these simple kinds of tasks.\nExplainee: Do you think that we'd be able to kind of accelerate that process of collecting data? Or do you think, is it the way that we've been collecting those types of data sets, Is that what's keeping us behind?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","290":"Explainer: That's a great question. I think we should be able to accelerate the data collection process by having robots collect more data autonomously on their own. And by doing that, we might be able to overcome some of the challenges of Moravec's paradox.\nExplainee: What are some common algorithms that are used in these types of techniques as the robot is learning?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","291":"Explainer: Do you have any sense of how you would give a really precise mathematical definition to, you know, what is a fractal?\nExplainee: It would probably have to be some kind of recursive definition, like imaginary numbers. I know the Mandelbrot set we'll use those.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","292":"Explainer: The Mandelbrot set or the Julia set, you know, the idea is always, oh, I'm gonna apply some polynomial over and over again. Z squared plus C or something like that. When I think about fractals, I try to get away from these very specific examples and ask, what is it fundamentally that makes a fractal, a fractal. And one thing that I think you can be precise about, even if you can't really say exactly what a fractal is, is you can talk about this idea of fractal dimension. Have you ever heard of that?\nExplainee: No, I have not actually.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","293":"Explainer: And why three?\nExplainee: I would also say three.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","294":"Explainer: Totally, now, as a little experiment, take your piece of paper and just crumple it into a ball. So what is it? Is the paper three dimensional or is it two dimensional?\nExplainee: Because it has the pipes and the width. And there's a depth to it as well.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","295":"Explainer: And if I cut that box in half again, how many boxes do I need to cover the line.\nExplainee: two\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","296":"Explainer: But if you take a more interesting shape, some kind of fractal shape, like let's say the coastline of great Britain and you start doing this box, counting experiment, something really interesting happens as you make these boxes smaller, the number of boxes you need to cover the coastline grows faster than it would for just a straight line.\nExplainee: Four.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","297":"Explainer: And so what this box counting is getting at is saying, well, I still can never decide what the length of the coastline is, but what I can do is I can see how quick does the number of boxes grow relative to how it would grow just for an ordinary one dimensional curve, like a line or a circle.\nExplainee: Yeah, I've, I've heard about that. Where if you, if you change the amount of measurement for a coastline, you can actually change like how much of the coast that, that there is like if you measure in mile lengths, you're gonna get a much different estimate than if you measure in one inch increments.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","298":"Explainer: Something that explains what's hard and what's easy for a robot. Something like stacking these two cups. Do you think that's easy or hard?\nExplainee: If it's this way, then it's easy, but if it's this way, you need to balance it or, oh-\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","299":"Explainer: And then program the robot to move over here and open the- \nExplainee: And drop it.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","300":"Explainer: When we gave it instructions, did we tell it to look at where the cup was? Or did we tell it to just move over here?\nExplainee: We told it to just move over here.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","301":"Explainer: yeah do you know what your computer thinks that is\nExplainee: An A\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","302":"Explainer: this really specific combination of zeros and ones everything that your computer does showing you pink panther videos on youtube calculating things searching the internet it does all of that with a really specific combination of zeros and ones which is crazy right that would be like saying your computer only understands these quarters for each quarter you need to tell it that you're going to use heads tails and you assign it heads or tails so i can switch between heads and tails and i can switch the zeros and ones in my computer so that it represents what i wanted to represent like an a and with quantum computers we have new rules we get to use too we can actually spin one of our quarters so it doesn't have to choose just one or the other\nExplainee: Zero, one.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","303":"Explainer: Have you ever heard of zero-knowledge proofs?\nExplainee: Only in passing.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","304":"Explainer: So actually, in the blockchain space is one of the spaces where we are seeing zero-knowledge proofs being implemented. And I think it's just the beginning. Let's talk about zero-knowledge proofs. At its core, a zero-knowledge proof is an interaction between two people. Then I should be able to convince you that some statement is true, but you won't have any idea why it's true.\nExplainee: Will I, like, understand that it's true because like, you know, the operations performed in the proof are like, of a certain, like, you know, they have like, certain attributes that would make them true?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","305":"Explainer: All right. Sounds good. Right? Here we have green, right? And over here, we have blue. Okay. And as you can see, they're two different colors.\nExplainee: Mm-hmm.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","306":"Explainer: Right? So you have a little bit of confidence, right, that I have managed to color this correctly. but not that much confidence. 'Cause I've only shown you two of the countries.\nExplainee: Yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","307":"Explainer: Nice. And that's smart of you to check with the same one of the ones you already had. Right?\nExplainee: Mm-hmm.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","308":"Explainer: But as you'll see, now it's not green, it's blue. And this one on the other hand, is green. Okay. The colors I showed you last time, don't work with these new colors, right? This wouldn't have worked before.\nExplainee: Yeah, because of this one, right?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","309":"Explainer: You would use encryption. Right. But it's really, this is the protocol.\nExplainee: So what are the broader implications of like, zero-knowledge proofs. Are they supposed to be like, more practical for like, implementation, and or, are they supposed to like, structurally prove something?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","310":"Explainer: Right.\nExplainee: And it's implementations?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","311":"Explainer: I'll grant you that Hilbert's Hotel does not exist. For me, infinite objects absolutely exist. And I can't read the thoughts in your head, but I have a high degree of confidence that we have a lot of the same ideas about infinity.\nExplainee: It's this idea that are things that you can think of, do they exist? You're getting into philosophy of math now. It's just exciting.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","312":"Explainer: I mean I think that's another common misconception about mathematics is that it's so far removed from the humanities, for instance. I mean it's hard to ignore some of these philosophical questions, particularly when we're talking about certain things like infinity. And I think one of the most difficult things to really be precise about and to explain to students is the continuum hypothesis. What do you say to students about the continuum hypothesis?\nExplainee: The most fun thing to teach when you teach about infinity, when students realize that you are talking about different sizes of infinity, but then a natural thing is for them to think about what is the next size of infinity that I can think about? And sort of the continuum hypothesis is sort of one of these really hard things to grasp.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","313":"Explainer: So on your trip what was the funnest day ever?\nExplainee: There was this pool, I love pools. And then there's a slide you go down and there's pool noodles in there too. And then there's a little tiny sandbox.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","314":"Explainer: Do you remember from that day what color towel you used when you got out of the pool?\nExplainee: I think the one I used was a dark blue or a light blue or, or like sort of a teal.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","315":"Explainer: When you were telling me about the sandbox, it felt like you didn't have to make that guess, that you could just see the sandbox in your eyes. I asked you about the towel. It doesn't come to mind immediately, but you can stop and think about it and kind of make a good guess because there are things you know about the world. And for those of us who study memory that's a really strong hint as to how memory works. And so for you your memory kept all the fun stuff and all the stuff that was important to you, but the details like did you have to have a ticket to get in or how you got there, all these other less interesting, less exciting aspects, your brain kind of decided letting go of all that information.\nExplainee: I think as you get older you start forgetting things more because you have to make space for new things, which is why you forget stuff.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","316":"Explainer: The hippocampus is a part of your brain that if you kind of took it out and looked at it, it looks a lot like a seahorse and it plays a really important role in creating those kinds of memories that help you two years after your vacation share with me what happened that day, all these details of that day. There's another part of the brain. It's actually also important for memory and it's called the amygdala and it is important for keeping all the kind of emotional processing going for memory. So memory for things that are really scary, it's gonna talk to the hippocampus now and get that memory to be really strong. Why do you think it might be important to remember scary things?\nExplainee: Let's say you, you accidentally cut yourself. Then your brain makes a note and says don't get too close to sharp things, or you're going to cut yourself again.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","317":"Explainer: And so you can't actually measure the length.\nExplainee: Yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","318":"Explainer: Right? Yeah. So that's already a really good idea of what a fractal is. It has some really, really interesting detail at all, scales that makes it hard to talk about standard quantities like lengths and areas and volumes.\nExplainee: Would a planet or an asteroid be a fractal?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","319":"Explainer: Yeah, so if you look at kind of the wrinkly surface of an asteroid, each one of those little wrinkles adds a little bit to the surface area. And so it's really hard to say, what is the area of an asteroid? Let's take a look at a little example of where fractals actually show up in nature. What we're gonna try to do is we're gonna try to say what the length of the coastline of great Britain is. So we're gonna start out with the blue ones, which are spaced further apart. We're gonna ask you to connect the blue pins with a piece of string so we can get a measurement of the coastline. So we have our first measurement of the length of the coastline, and we're gonna do it over again. But this time we're gonna use the white pins, which are spaced closer together. So we measured the coastline again. And what do you think happens?\nExplainee: There's more in and out. Therefore probably takes more string for this one.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","320":"Explainer: What's your name?\nExplainee: Namina.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","321":"Explainer: Mm-hmm.\nExplainee: Yeah, and touch.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","322":"Explainer: But with the magnifying glass, you'd only be able to see what's right near the surface, right? Just.\nExplainee: Yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","323":"Explainer: Okay.\nExplainee: For solar panels. Then, that drew me into new types of technology that used semiconductors with the one that's very popular now is quantum computings. And what about you? What got you interested in quantum sensing?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","324":"Explainer: Yeah, I started out doing magnetic resonance, studying things like bone and biomedical magnetic resonance. Ended up playing with spins for a long time and the physics of spins just fascinated me.\nExplainee: So what do you think is a big difference between imaging large biological objects versus sensing very small quantum objects, I guess?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","325":"Explainer: So it's because the nitrogen-vacancy center is a single defect. So you can actually see a single electron. In normal magnetic resonance, you don't have the sensitivity.\nExplainee: In order to be sensitive to like a single electron, do you have to be really close to it?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","326":"Explainer: [Sekhar] Yeah.\nExplainee: And those are very sensitive to fluctuations. Yeah. I guess any fluctuations can kick your quantum system either out of the state that it's in to another state.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","327":"Explainer: Right, it could give you information if you read it out, about what's happening or you have to find smart ways to suppress it so that you can focus on what you really do care about.\nExplainee: So what are the kind of noise and fluctuations that you're worried about?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","328":"Explainer: Right.\nExplainee: But I don't know that there's necessarily a limit. I mean, it keeps expanding. I mean, I think that there are some groups that are able to identify, you know, 30, 40 individual nuclear spins around a single electron and control 10 or 15 of them.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","329":"Explainer: Yeah.\nExplainee: And that I think is gonna make real breakthroughs in the next 10 years, is the fact that we're just having this much larger group of scientists.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","330":"Explainer: so steve tell me about your research and the work you've been doing in quantum computing\nExplainee: I'm a theoretical physicist. I started out in condensed matter theory, the theory that studies superconductors and magnets and I had to learn a new field of quantum optics and apply those ideas. One of the nice things about being a theorist Is you get to keep learning new things.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","331":"Explainer: common myth how many qubits do you have that's the only thing that matters like just add more qubits what's the big deal pattern them on your chip\nExplainee: I was asking a computer scientist recently where to read about fault tolerance in classical computing. He said oh they don't teach that in computer science classes anymore because the hardware has become so reliable. In a quantum system, when you look at it or make measurements, it can change in a way that's beyond your control. We have the following task, build a nearly perfect computer out of a whole bunch of imperfect parts.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","332":"Explainer: one last myth i think we should bust steve quantum computers are on the verge of breaking into your bank account and breaking encryption and creative cryptography\nExplainee: (laughing) Right, in the next five years there'll be tremendous progress in the field but people really have to understand that we're either at the vacuum tube or transistor stage. We're trying to invent the integrated circuit and scale up. It's still very very very early in the development of the field.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","333":"Explainer: They're easy for a computer to execute, right? It just has to run this recursive procedure over and over and over again. We can kind of get as much detail as we want or need. When I think about fractals and kind of what they've done for computer graphics. The example I think is subdivision surfaces. Did you, did you encounter subdivision surfaces in your graphics class at all?\nExplainee: The name doesn't really ring a bell.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","334":"Explainer: Because I want to draw a smooth curve on the screen, but all my computer can do is draw straight lines. And that's actually too true of GPUs. It's kind of interesting. GPUs are basically really fast machines that can only draw one thing and that's a flat triangle. And so if we keep doing this with our paper, you kind of get pretty quickly the idea of what's gonna happen. So when you go to see a Pixar movie, for instance, every surface has been subdivided down. So you have tiny little triangles called micro polygons that are even smaller than the size of a pixel.\nExplainee: How long does this process take?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","335":"Explainer: I wanted to ask you a little bit about what you know about the history of the internet. Have you heard of ARPANET, for example?\nExplainee: I have not heard of ARPANET.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","336":"Explainer: Okay, back into the 1960s, there was a research agency in the United States called DARPA, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency. Actually, it was called ARPA at the time. They wanted to build this notion of a packet-switching network. Not a circuit switch network like a phone network where you get a dedicated path and a dedicated set of bandwidth and links from source to destination.\nExplainee: So what would packet switching enable? I'm sure there's something big here, for sure.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","337":"Explainer: There's a lot big, right? And so remember, this was a Department of Defense, was they wanted to have forms of of communication that were very robust, that were survivable. Packets could all find their own ways, be routed differently through the network. So if parts of the network failed, you could route around failures.\nExplainee: Sounds like the reason for like a request response type of structure.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","338":"Explainer: So you can sort of see how the network architecture that wasn't designed to be 100% reliable inside the core of the network, and had that complexity built into the edges of the network. And to me, the really cool thing is you put this infrastructure in place, and then all these super creative people think about amazing things to build on top of it. And you see this proliferation of amazing applications.\nExplainee: Abstraction, I think it's the reason why everything.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","339":"Explainer: Ah ha! Spoken like a real computer scientist, right? You're a computer scientist. I'm a computer scientist. We talk about APIs, application programming interfaces. The API for the internet is something called a socket. And a socket simply says, I can communicate if I know your internet address, you know, 128.119.40.186, that number is the IP address of my server, the University of Massachusetts. If you know that, you can write a program anywhere in the world and send a message, and it'll pop out at my end.\nExplainee: I will be remembering that. [Jim laughs] I've heard that there are like seven keys to the internet, something like that.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","340":"Explainer: Okay. What does that mean?\nExplainee: No one authority holds control over any sort of decisions or destinations.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","341":"Explainer: Where do they get dropped, do you think?\nExplainee: Somewhere in their travel process.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","342":"Explainer: Cool. What do you think of when you hear the words quantum sensing?\nExplainee: I think that using some sort of quantum computing to sense some quantum level molecules or particles, like interactions and stuff, maybe.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","343":"Explainer: It would be the top tier.\nExplainee: What are you doing? Like, what are you studying?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","344":"Explainer: Which is a really nice platform because the spins show their quantum properties, even at room temperature.\nExplainee: So, are you studying the spins of the electrons?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","345":"Explainer: Right.\nExplainee: So how long does it take to make a sensor and to make that diamond? Is that created? Do you like, put energy into it or?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","346":"Explainer: So you can implant nitrogen into a diamond and then you bombard it with electrons to create the vacancies and then you heat it up and anneal it, and then you get these nitrogen-vacancy centers in your system. So you mentioned quantum computing earlier. So have you heard of the idea of superposition?\nExplainee: Mm-hmm, yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","347":"Explainer: So that's in some ways the key to both quantum sensing, as well as quantum computing. It's the idea that you can take a system and put it in a superposition of two states. Normally we think of classically a bit can be a zero or a one. So switch is either on or off. Whereas in a quantum system, it can be in what's called a superposition. So it can be partially on and partially off. But one of the challenges with quantum systems is that these superpositions are really hard to maintain because we don't see superpositions in the world around us. In quantum computing, you try really hard to isolate everything so that you can maintain this quantum property and the fact that it's actually going to lose its quantum properties as it interacts with the world also makes it a great sensor because now you're actually, you're using that fact that it's interacting with the world to say, wait, it's sensing something.\nExplainee: Okay, so it's like using like, the quantum computer would be kind of like the base level and then like you take it out into the world and see how like it differs?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","348":"Explainer: So rather than trying to build a lot of complex algorithms and gates with it, what you do is, you take these quantum bits and you take them out into the world and say, what do you see? What are you sensitive to? So you can use an idea called entanglement to make an even more sensitive quantum sensor, but it's even more fragile. So there's always this trade-off between being super fragile and being super sensitive at the same time.\nExplainee: How does entanglement work into it?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","349":"Explainer: It's more precise, Absolutely.\nExplainee: Okay. Is an atomic clock a quantum sensor?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","350":"Explainer: So you're a student in high school, is that right?\nExplainee: Yes, I'm a sophomore.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","351":"Explainer: Well, we're gonna be talking about computers here today, and we're gonna be talking about the internet. I always like to think of the internet by analogy to say road systems for example, where you have roads in your neighborhood. You have state roads, you have the Interstate Highway System. And so the internet is a lot like that. It's an interconnection of local roads, local networks like the network in your house for example.\nExplainee: How does like all of the networks in my house connect to all the city networks?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","352":"Explainer: The underseas cables are so cool! They're these big cables that are laid down by switches. They cross both the Atlantic, the Pacific, the Indian Ocean. So the undersea cables are how the networks in Europe, United States, Asia are all connected together.\nExplainee: How do you connect wirelessly?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","353":"Explainer: That's really what we call the first hop. It's like from your phone, from your tablet, from the computer that you're on, there's no cables coming in. You go over a wireless connection. Wi-Fi is the protocol that allows your computer to talk to that first hop router over a wireless communication link.\nExplainee: And I was wondering how there's so many different movies or TV shows that you can download and they're all there. And if you just play it, it just knows what to play. Like they're all in one spot.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","354":"Explainer: Ah, you said they're all in one spot. In fact, they're in lots of spots in Netflix. And so most applications would like to connect you with a server that's close to you. Server is really just a big computer with a lot of memory, a lot of discs that store all the Netflix movies, and also so that you don't have to cross over too many internet links to get from where the server is to the TV or the device in your home.\nExplainee: So when I'm watching Vampire Diaries in my house, how does it know exactly what to do without getting scrambled up?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","355":"Explainer: Calculus involves the study of functions. Functions are one of the most fundamental concepts in mathematics, but they aren't always so clearly defined. What would you say a function is?\nExplainee: I would say a function is a procedure that takes an input and does some operation and returns an output.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","356":"Explainer: That's the computer science brain thinking right there. So we wanna think of a function as procedure or mapping between sets. So a function defines a one-to-one correspondence if it defines a perfect matching between the elements of its domain set and the elements of its output set. We call such functions bijections or isomorphisms. So the reason I'm so interested in this idea of a bijective function or a one-to-one correspondence that guarantees that every element of one set gets matched with an element of the other set, no matter how many elements there are, these bijections or these one-to-one correspondences as they help mathematicians reason about infinity.\nExplainee: How can you compare something that is endless?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","357":"Explainer: Today we're gonna think about infinity as a cardinality, which is a technical term for a number that could be a size of a set. And we're gonna use this idea of one-to-one correspondence to try and investigate the question of whether all infinite sets have the same size. So what I've drawn here are some pictures of some of the infinite sets that appear in mathematics. So the natural numbers are the prototypical example of an infinite set. So the natural numbers are clearly a subset of the integers. Both of these are infinite sets. Are they the same size infinity or different size infinities?\nExplainee: Yes, the integers would, there'd be more integers than natural numbers.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","358":"Explainer: I'm gonna now try and convince you that they are in fact the same size infinity. And this is using this idea of a one-to-one correspondence which was applied in this context by Georg Cantor. What he says is if we can match up the elements of the integers with the elements of the natural numbers so that there's nothing left over, so that there's a bijective function between them, then that's a proof that there's exactly as many natural numbers as there are integers. Start by matching zero with zero and one with one. But then we wanna include the negatives in the list. So which natural number would we match with negative one?\nExplainee: Maybe two.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","359":"Explainer: Maybe two. Why not? Because now we're starting to make progress on matching all the negatives. We can match the natural number three with the integer two, the natural number four with the integer minus two. And do you see a pattern?\nExplainee: All of the positive integers would be odd numbers and all of the negative integers would be even numbers?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","360":"Explainer: Great. So now I have a much harder question. So we have the same challenge, again, evidently there are way, way, way more rational numbers than there are integers. Does that mean this is a larger infinite set than the integers? What do you think?\nExplainee: By intuition I would say yes, but that was the same case with the integers. I would imagine there might be some bijective function for mapping natural numbers to rational numbers.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","361":"Explainer: Now there's one final collection of numbers that we haven't yet discussed, which are the real numbers, all of the points on the number line. Do you think that's the same size infinity?\nExplainee: I guess again, intuition seems like it must be much larger, but I don't know, I haven't been on a roll.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","362":"Explainer: Georg Cantor proved that it is impossible to count all real numbers like we've just counted the rational numbers or just counted the integers. This is called the cardinality of the continuum, it is uncountable. What I'm going to do now is form a new real number that I guarantee is not on this list. Okay, so here's how we do this. What I'm gonna do is I'm gonna look at the diagonal elements. So I'll highlight them. This continues forever, and now I'm going to form a new real number by changing all of these.\nExplainee: If you just like added one to them, then that would be something that doesn't exist in any of the other ones.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","363":"Explainer: Yes. You see the idea right away. So I'm gonna form a new real number whose first digit is different from this one. And you've already convinced yourself that this number is not on this list anywhere. Why is that?\nExplainee: Because at every point there's at least one change from a number in there.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","364":"Explainer: Great. That's exactly right. So what we've proven is that this number is missing, and therefore it is impossible to define a bijection between the natural numbers and the real numbers.\nExplainee: Oh wow.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","365":"Explainer: So we've started to explore some of the counterintuitive properties of infinity. On the one hand there are infinite sets that feel very different like the natural numbers, the integers, the rational numbers that nevertheless have the same size or the same infinite cardinality. While there are other infinities that are larger. So there's more than one size of infinity, not all infinities are created equal.\nExplainee: I was wondering what the kind of practical implications are, what you can do with this sort of knowledge.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","366":"Explainer: is it some sort of conjecture circuit that is a really good guess there's parts of that that are definitely about conducting this is the inside of a quantum computer\nExplainee: Oh wow.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","367":"Explainer: okay so how do noise-canceling headphones work \nExplainee: Not much.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","368":"Explainer: it's a perfect question i mean it's very early for quantum computing but we're building assembly languages we're building layers of abstraction that are going to get you to a point as a programmer where you can interchangeably be programming something the way that you already do and then make calls to a quantum computer so that you can bring it in when it makes sense we're not envisioning quantum computers completely replacing classical computers anytime soon we think that quantum computing is going to be used to accelerate the kinds of things that are really hard for for classical machines\nExplainee: But as like a programmer, how would quantum computing affect a different way of writing a program?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","369":"Explainer: I wanted to ask you if you have ever heard of a black hole?\nExplainee: Jude.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","370":"Explainer: Here, let me show you something. I can ask how heavy it is.\nExplainee: It's not weight, but it's how much of it is in it.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","371":"Explainer: So it goes so fast that it goes completely dark. Any light that veers too close will fall in, will not be able to make it back out again. If a light is shining from the sun near a black hole, the black hole's not touching it. Why does the light get pulled in? Why does that happen?\nExplainee: So it goes so fast that there's it's all dark?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","372":"Explainer: And a choice function does what exactly?\nExplainee: Yeah, that's a good question.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","373":"Explainer: So there are three well-known famous equivalent forms of the axiom of choice. The well ordering principle is the assumption, the axiom that any set can be well ordered, but there are lots of subsets of real numbers that do not have a minimal element. So that ordering is not a well ordering. So here's the key question. Do you believe the axiom of choice?\nExplainee: I do believe the axiom of choice.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","374":"Explainer: So Cantor's diagonal argument can be abstracted and then generalized to prove that for an arbitrary set A, its power set has a strictly larger cardinality. And since that's true for any set, we can just iterate this process. When set theory was being discovered or invented or created in the late 19th century, one of the natural question to ask is can there be a universe of all sets? This comes up in my research in category theory because even though there is no set of all sets, we would really like for there to be a category of sets. So what category theorists need to do to make their work rigorous is to add additional axioms to set theory. One of my favorites was introduced by an algebraic geometer Alexander Grothendieck. This is something that we sometimes call a Grothendieck universe, or also an inaccessible cardinal. It's an infinite number that is so big that it cannot be accessed by any of the other constructions within set theory. It's so big that we'll never get to it and this allows us to contemplate the collection of all sets whose cardinality is bounded by this size that will never reach.\nExplainee: So you're just making a cutoff point. You're saying we're never gonna get sets bigger than this anyway, so we might as well make our category only include things smaller than that.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","375":"Explainer: That you don't want the complexity of managing them to go up linearly with that. You'd like it to still stay pretty flat as you start adding.\nExplainee: Right, exactly. I mean, the good thing about IoT devices is that they tend to transmit very, very small amounts of data.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","376":"Explainer: We're used to ethernet cables that can handle many hundreds of gigabits per second over a wired device. What are the typical data rates for IoT devices? I mean, not hundreds of gigabits.\nExplainee: No, I mean I would imagine upper bound, KB per second, lower bound, you could see bytes per second just on average. But I mean, say that you have a temperature sensor running off of your Arduino that's reporting the temperature in your house every minute. That's going to be far less than kilobytes per second on average.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","377":"Explainer: Do you think they'll share it?\nExplainee: Not without some persuasion, but I agree that these data have massive, massive research value. Something I'm interested in with my research is collaborating with people who manage these distributed sensor devices, and then taking advantage of those datasets and comparing them to, say you were interested in doing a research project on how daily rush hour traffic impacts the acoustic landscape of New York City. Figuring out, look, this street next to this school is causing visible ratings above what we mandate. And so there needs to be an intervention here.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","378":"Explainer: being something that you can already predict. Right.\nExplainee: Mm-hmm.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","379":"Explainer: Right.\nExplainee: So that data then immediately imply, a knowledge. But people can't, sometimes.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","380":"Explainer: Indeed.\nExplainee: general knowledge of proof in the ledger.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","381":"Explainer: And I think that's a sign. That's a sign that our baby has grown up and, you know, it's time for it to be developed.\nExplainee: I think, profoundly, the students often also ask me, what are the future direction, both in terms of crypto, zero-knowledge proof, in the real world and how mathematical you see in computing.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","382":"Explainer: Does the Large Magellanic Cloud have a big black hole?\nExplainee: I'm a second year. So I'm measuring star formation histories in the Small and Large Magellanic Clouds.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","383":"Explainer: Yeah, and probably nobody is. Have you heard a lot in your studies about these super massive black holes that we think lurk in the centers of very nearly every galaxy?\nExplainee: So, I think the prevailing wisdom for a while was no, but my answer honestly is I'm not sure.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","384":"Explainer: [Janna] Yeah.\nExplainee: We spend all of our time, when we learn about black holes in school, predominantly through star collapse.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","385":"Explainer: Yes, they're all friends.\nExplainee: Gravitationally, all friends.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","386":"Explainer: But when we do merge with Andromeda, presumably our black holes will merge and Andromeda indeed has a very big black hole as well at its center. And then we'll have this just gigantic-\nExplainee: And Andromeda is one of the few galaxies that is traveling towards us and do for a merger event at some point. So given a sufficiently low velocity, we would just have two big galaxies that, for the most part, pass through each other, pass by each other. But given a sufficiently high velocity, we will have some crazy black hole interactions and some crazy star interactions.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","387":"Explainer: Yeah, and it's very possible that as you said, the collision won't be so severe that it'll be very disruptive. So our entire solar system could stay intact and here we would go with the sun and all the other planets in orbit around a new black hole.\nExplainee: Supermassive black hole.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","388":"Explainer: We work a lot right now on thinking of black holes as batteries. So a black hole that can take, like a giant magnet, astronomical magnet in the form of another collapsed star, like a neutron star, and flip it around so fast, near the speed of light, that it actually creates an electronic circuit out of this moving magnet. And so that the power that can come out of these electronic circuits created by these batteries can be tremendous.\nExplainee: They're kind of misunderstood giants in a way. So I was curious, have you heard anything new or interesting in the field of black holes that will shape future discussions?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","389":"Explainer: i have colleagues here that tell me it can take up to weeks to train certain neural networks right\nExplainee: Certainly, depending on the complexity of your model then computational speed is one thing.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","390":"Explainer: and actually machine learning is one research direction where we're really hoping that we're going to find um key parts of the machine learning computation that can be sped up using quantum computing\nExplainee: Sure, yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","391":"Explainer: if you think about even just classical information like bits right at the end of the day when you store a bit in your hard drive there's a magnetic domain and you have a magnetic polarization right\nExplainee: So in a classical computer, you know, you have all sorts of logical gates that perform operations and they change an input to some sort of output but I guess it's not immediately obvious how you do that with quantum computers.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","392":"Explainer: you can change the magnetization to be pointing up or pointing down right quantum systems we're still manipulating a device and changing the quantum state of that of that device you can imagine if it's a spin that you could have spin up and spin down but you can also if you isolate it enough you can have a superposition of up and down\nExplainee: Sure.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","393":"Explainer: yeah that's a really good question this actually is a model of the inside of one of our quantum computers\nExplainee: So how do we actually encode it to start with?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","394":"Explainer: the key is to come up with algorithms where the result is deterministic\nExplainee: Okay.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","395":"Explainer: there's sort of two main classes of quantum algorithms there's algorithms which were developed for decades right things like shore's algorithm which is for factoring grover's algorithm for unstructured search and these algorithms were designed assuming that you had a perfect fault tolerant quantum computer which is many decades away so we're currently in a phase where we're exploring what can we do with these near-term quantum computers and the answer is going to be well we need different kinds of algorithms to really even explore that question\nExplainee: Interesting, so what do those algorithms look like?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","396":"Explainer: yeah they also unfortunately require fault tolerance right now the algorithms that we know of today to do those things um on a quantum computer require you to have millions of error-corrected qubits today we're at like 50. it's actually amazing that we're at 50. there's things that we know or we have strong reason to believe um are going to be faster to do on a quantum computer and then there's things that we'll discover just by virtue of having one\nExplainee: Yeah certainly having a search algorithm is very useful. Factoring, those are definitely useful things that I would imagine could be done a lot faster on a quantum computer.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","397":"Explainer: What are some of the challenges that you've run into when trying to work with robots and do these tasks?\nExplainee: So, I was really interested in the problem of scooping peas on a plate. They're relatively homogenous, but when it came to more complex foods, like broccoli, or deformable foods, like tofu, that can crumble, that gets a lot more complex to simulate.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","398":"Explainer: Yeah. So you may not transfer the exact strategy or the exact policy that the robot takes, but you should be able to learn some general heuristics about performing manipulation.\nExplainee: There's this gap between the simulators that we have now and what we actually experience in reality. So what do you think are promising directions to try out for actually making our simulations match reality more closely?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","399":"Explainer: Have you heard of fractals before?\nExplainee: No, absolutely not.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","400":"Explainer: So somehow they have to explain to the computer what a tree looks like so that the computer can draw the tree for them.\nExplainee: Yes.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","401":"Explainer: It almost looks like that branch that you broke off is itself another tree.

I mean, basically, software-defined networking exists, let's say within a single provider backbone, or a single cloud provider's network or a single campus. There's been some work on doing it at the juncture points between a pair of networks. But one other trend that's happening that makes it more possible is it used to be that to get from one end to the internet to the other, you have access networks getting much closer to, say Google or Microsoft or other large cloud providers, where even, you might only go through two networks\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","406":"Explainer: Right, well it holds together because we have standards, and we have protocols that you mentioned.\nExplainee: Exactly, protocol standards for how the equipment talks to one another. And increasingly, certificate authorities that help bootstrap the secure, encrypted and communication between end hosts. So there are a few of these sort of centrally, kind of agreed upon kinds of infrastructure, but for the most part, each network runs itself.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","407":"Explainer: And certainly, we've heard about some countries that impose firewalls that don't let certain kinds of traffic out, or certain kinds of traffic in. So there's no global body that is regulating that?\nExplainee: Not really because each country really can have it's own laws and its own norms. And so they can decide, like the Great Firewall of China can decide, they don't wanna let certain content be accessed by the citizens inside that country. So if a country decides they don't wanna answer a request for a particular domain name, they say, Hey, I don't want to let someone know the IP address of this website. They can decide not to let those answers be delivered inside their country. And so encryption plays a role in helping people keep their privacy or prevent surveillance, but it's not perfect. It's often possible, still, to know a fair amount about what people are doing, even if you can't look inside the envelope at the letter that's written.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","408":"Explainer: So you can infer or guess a lot of things.\nExplainee: Exactly.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","409":"Explainer: So you want the computation close to where the endpoint is.\nExplainee: Exactly, and I think that what's now exciting about that is all three of these technologies, wireless, networking and cloud, which are normally three different communities, three different sets of technologies, three different sets of standards or practices, now have to work together in close harmony to be able to service applications that are really critical and that that might be interacting with the physical world in ways where safety is a potential concern.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","410":"Explainer: What is your impression of what a black hole is?\nExplainee: I'm a senior at NYU. I'm studying physics and environmental studies.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","411":"Explainer: So that's a great definition and I wanna pick that apart a little bit. So what you described is just right. Stars, when they run out of thermonuclear fuel are gonna collapse under their own weight. It'll explode in a supernova, it'll leave a core, and if the core itself is heavy enough, it will keep collapsing. It does, as you say, reach this point where not even light can escape. But the amazing thing is it leaves that point, you called it rightly the event horizon, it leaves it behind kind of like an archeological record because the start itself can no more sit at the event horizon than it can race outward at the speed of light. So the core of the star keeps collapsing and where it goes nobody knows. So in a weird way, the black hole isn't anymore a crush of matter. It left it behind in its wake, but the stuff of the star is gone.\nExplainee: So it's a star that has collapsed. It has so much concentrated mass and gravity that there's a point outside of the black hole called the event horizon. So once you get past the event horizon, nothing, not even light can escape from that.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","412":"Explainer: It turns out that there are only three quantities that define a black hole, its electric charge, its mass, and its spin. So the most general black hole can also spin and it can also be electrically charged. Whether or not they are has to do with how they formed. If a star collapses, it will likely be spinning when it collapses and the remnant black hole that formsbwill likely be spinning. A black hole of a certain mass, charge, and spin is indistinguishable from any other black hole with those same properties. So in some sense, they're like fundamental particles, which makes them absolutely exceptional for any other astrophysical object. Have you heard the stories about what happens inside a black hole?\nExplainee: I've heard of Schwarzschild black holes, which is a black hole that is static, a Kerr black hole or a Kerr-Newman black hole, which is a black hole that rotates, but what makes a black hole static versus rotating? And what's more common?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","413":"Explainer: So the singularity is definitely predicted in Einstein's general theory of relativity and that's purely a theory of spacetime. And in the theory of spacetime, there is no question that a singularity would form when the star collapses catastrophically inside the black hole. Now, even when people talked about singularities back in the '60s, they thought, you know, quantum mechanics is part of the story of the whole of physics. It's not just gravity. And if we understand quantum gravity we'll realize that singularity probably doesn't ever actually form.\nExplainee: I sort of know what a singularity is. I think of it as something where everything is compacted into one single point, it's a place where the laws of physics don't exactly work out. What did you mean when you said that you don't think the singularity really exists?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","414":"Explainer: I would say to some extent we don't know for sure. What we have found is that the mathematics is so unbelievably powerful that we're able to disprove wrong ideas just in pen and paper. Just very recently, within the past couple of years, the first ever human-procured image of a black hole showed us what we expected to see of the event horizon. So Jayda, after our conversation today, what would you say a black hole is?\nExplainee: So since we obviously have never been to a black hole, how do we know for sure, like, what happens after you cross the event horizon or what happens inside a black hole? Is it just like, inferred from the math?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","415":"Explainer: Talk us through Hawking's initial revolution that led to a lot of these conversations about the information around black holes.\nExplainee: Hawking's big insight was that he had to apply both the rules of quantum mechanics and the rules of gravity to really understand how black holes behaved. But Hawking took a point of view where he brought quantum mechanics into the game. He really that if you took that into account, that it's actually not quite true that black holes are black, that actually things can escape from black holes.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","416":"Explainer: Do you think there's ever a hope that the kind of information that you think about, the quantum gravity aspects of the universe that you think about, whether it will pan out or not, will ever be viably observed in these astronomical pursuits of the event horizon?\nExplainee: It's a real challenge, but astronomical observations have gotten so fantastically precise. And there is some hope that if you looked at things like two black holes merging, each black hole comes in with its own event horizon, but then when the black holes merge, there's a very complicated process where these two event horizons merge and oscillate and vibrate, and then settle down into a single event horizon for the final black hole. There is some hope that if we can make sufficiently detailed observations of this process, if we could really see the way the event horizon is behaving as it settles down to this final state, that maybe that could reveal some of these quantum effects that we've been talking about.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","417":"Explainer: That's near and dear to my heart. Multi-party computations.\nExplainee: Obviously, zero-knowledge proofs are about proving things to another person without revealing the details of what it is that you're proving. But, you know, in my mind, zero-knowledge actually goes even further beyond that. It's like this overarching concept that you can see a lot in multi-party computation, where you wanna accomplish some sort of task without revealing anything more than exactly what you need to accomplish that task.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","418":"Explainer: Indeed.\nExplainee: But once you flip that on its head and you're no longer trying to do that, suddenly all of the bad properties of randomness become good.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","419":"Explainer: No doubt. And especially with cloud computing, exploiting the power of the cloud to enable zero-knowledge proofs, and to make use of zero-knowledge proofs, would be amazing.\nExplainee: Yeah. Absolutely.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","420":"Explainer: What do you know about memory?\nExplainee: I know when you see something you could like kind of like picture it, like in your head you can imagine it. I remember yesterday I got like orange juice, but let's say like a year or two, you might think like, oh, that day I got water.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","421":"Explainer: And on one hand memory is like a record of something that happened in the past that we can carry with us and we can like bring it back to mind. And on the other hand we need to be a little bit suspicious sometimes because we might get it wrong. In what world would that memory of the orange juice maybe be useful?\nExplainee: Let's say you grew up in a place that the orange juice is just meh, and then you go on vacation going somewhere and then it might change how you feel about orange juice.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","422":"Explainer: Sometimes, you know, memory is doing something much simpler but no less important for us, which is it's helping us figure out what's good and what's bad. And if we can remember what's good and what's bad from what we did in the past, that can help us make decisions about what to do next time. So Dylan, you may be surprised to learn this, but we asked your mom what some of your favorite candies are. So you have to make a decision between these two candies and whichever one you pick, you actually get to take with you.\nExplainee: I wish I could say both, but I guess I'll go with pixie sticks.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","423":"Explainer: There you go, there is your decision. Okay, you can take those. It took you some time there. You looked like you were really working hard at that problem. And that's interesting because actually we know that from research that when people have to make a decision between two things they like equally, some people like economists think oh those are the easiest decisions because they're both good options. But as psychologists and neuroscientists we know it's the opposite. One of the reasons is because there's no simple answer of like I know that one's better I'm just gonna go with it. And so we think that that's the kind of decision where memory is especially important because you have to kind of come up with more information.\nExplainee: Exactly, and then also like after it was like, maybe like I would've, enjoyed this more than that and like maybe I should've chose the other one. And you don't know.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","424":"Explainer: Everything you just said is exactly what we know from research. All the thoughts running through your mind, were really at kind of about a prediction into the future, right? You're like, how, how will this taste if, when it's in my mouth or how will I feel about my decision down the road? You know we think of memory as something in the past, but it's an example of how you use your memories of these two candies to predict what's gonna happen in the future so that you can make a decision in the present. But you did it, you made your way through that torture. And now you've got to keep the candy.\nExplainee: Am I always gonna like choose pixie sticks or sour patch kids? What's gonna like change that?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","425":"Explainer: What's your conception about what the internet is?\nExplainee: The internet? For me, it's just something to use when I need like to search up something or watch videos.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","426":"Explainer: Got a favorite movie?\nExplainee: Matilda.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","427":"Explainer: Let's say we want to get a video from here, over to here. How do you think that video would sort of travel through this network?\nExplainee: Maybe it could go to here, to here, to here, to here.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","428":"Explainer: Yeah. So that's a really good observation. In most pieces of the internet, that's exactly what would happen. We want to take what's called a shortest path. But still, there are multiple paths. And why do you think that might be valuable?\nExplainee: Maybe one way is messed up or broken. So you go the other way.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","429":"Explainer: Lettuce.\nExplainee: Lettuce who?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","430":"Explainer: In the field we often talk of have having a mental model that we use to make predictions about what's about to happen and really use that to mean kind of a general understanding of what's going on. What does that look like in terms that come from your world of like the configuration of, of a circuit?\nExplainee: I think this is the most exciting area of memory research right now I think, which is how people build and remember, you know, and keep with them models of the world over long periods of time. When I think about a mental model, I think about ideas, potential outcomes, potential events, potential actions, and how they all depend on one another. So when we predict what will happen next it would be, I am currently sitting at this piece of the network and I know that there are, there are these possible outcomes. And so I have to get ready for those, you know, four possible outcomes. But that brings this interesting question to the fore, I think which is how does a network system in our mind and our brain create a network model of the world outside? It's almost like there's a reflection in the structure of what's inside in the hardware and what we're building in a very abstract way. And I think that relates to some interesting work that's coming out about the hippocampus too.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","431":"Explainer: We now think of the hippocampus so much in terms of memory but really some of the earliest work in neuroscience on the hippocampus talked about the role of the hippocampus in spatial navigation. And it really exposed I think one of the deepest questions in memory research, or at least from the neuroscience perspective is like, well what is the connection? What is the connection between spatial processing and memory? And why is it that neurons in the hippocampus when an animal is navigating a maze, why is it that there's spatial specialization there? I really do think that this notion of a mental model, a generative model is where those, where memory and space meet.\nExplainee: That makes a lot of sense. And I think that it makes me wonder how we think about places in the abstract, what is a cognitive place, right? And what is, how do we map out the cognitive spaces that we, that our mind moves within in the same way or in a similar way to the spaces that we physically walk in. But I think it opens a lot up, a lot of questions about how individuals make their own maps, right? And then how the way that they choose to make that map will then affect the way that they may respond in the future to a new context or environment.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","432":"Explainer: It's really interesting. And I think it also really speaks to the kind of pervasive and circular role of memory, right? Because the maps are dependent on memories, they're built from memories and experiences. So there's this kind of dialogue with memory creating maps, maps creating experiences, experiences creating memories, affecting the maps, and really makes me think even of a question a friend asked me recently about moods and mental health and this feeling of like how do some people get kind of trapped in a state of mind where all they can see is a particular way forward. But then something happens in the world that shifts them to another model.\nExplainee: Which is actually really interesting because you can make different maps in different physical spaces too, right? As you walk into a new room you make a new map of that room. So what are the doorways basically for mental models? And I think that often we sort of fall into this pattern of, of thinking about memory as, as always additive, that we always just keep gathering more information and update what we currently have. We don't as often speak about deleting pieces of information or, or perceptions or something that we thought was a, was a useful fact but actually it's not a fact.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","433":"Explainer: Memories as models or models first and memory as part of what helps build the model starts generating new predictions. Exactly the kind you just brought up or other ways of thinking about things because an efficient model needs to let go of information, right? I just heard a colleague of mine joking about the fact that the principles of neuroscience textbook keeps growing and growing. And that if we had enough strength in theoretical neuroscience, if our models of neuroscience were good enough, that book should shrink back. We know that memory retrieval is essentially construction. And so you don't need to store all those separate memories. You need to construct them. But if you have a good model, let go of all those details and just construct them to feel as if it's a memory. But really all you're doing is using the model to fill the details. It's kind of like the matrix, you know.\nExplainee: Right.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","434":"Explainer: So a lot of times stars are born together in two star systems and when they die, if they're heavy enough, they will collapse under their own weight and form a black hole. So here you have a black hole and a big fluffy star. And what will happen is it'll start to tear apart its neighboring star. Literally parts of the star will begin to spill onto the black hole and splatter on the black hole. But let's say both those stars formed black holes. And what these black holes do is they are like mallets on a drum. They create literally waves in the shape of spacetime as they're moving. So imagine mallets on a drum, how the drum ripples. Depending on how the mallets are moving you hear different sounds. So effectively these black holes, as they get very close together in the final stages of their life together, they're orbiting each other at hundreds of times a second. It's this really crazy event, but it's happening in complete darkness. Eventually they bobble together and they merge and then they wring out, the spacetime's going crazy around them, it's this storm in spacetime, and they settle down to a quiet black hole. Then those waves that they created travel through the universe, basically undisturbed. For a long time people thought, well, even if black holes are out there, they're impossible to observe. And then they got very clever. You might wonder how we could possibly hear black holes, that sounds crazy. So I'm gonna show you, but I'm gonna need your help. This demo involves an electric guitar. Do you play at all?\nExplainee: A little bit?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","435":"Explainer: Okay, you wanna do the demo for me? So the LIGO instrument electronically records the ringing of the shape of space with its very complicated instrument. It stands for Laser Interferometric Gravitational-Waves Observatory and the design was incredibly difficult and they didn't know if they would succeed. I think of the instrument as like the body of the electric guitar. And then they take the readout of the motions of the waves that they're recording, just like that guitar is recording the motions of the waves on the string. Now just play it like a little bit. And you can't hear anything, right? You're not meant to hear an electric guitar when it's not plugged in. What's happening is the guitar strings are ringing, but so quietly that we can't actually hear the sound. And this is like the gravitational waves, which are ringing the drum of spacetime, but so quietly that they're not move the air and we're not hearing them. So now play and I'm gonna turn the volume up a little bit. While I can't actually hear the ringing of the strings themselves, I can hear the data of the shape of the string recorded and played through this amplifier. And that's kind of the idea behind the LIGO instrument.\nExplainee: How do you know that it's like the black hole that's making this sound and nothing else?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","436":"Explainer: So great to see you, Michael. Thanks for coming.\nExplainee: It's my pleasure.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","437":"Explainer: I think it's interesting. And also a huge challenge. I think that it's interesting that if a person sees a robot doing something that seems very capable, they assume that the robot can do all sorts of other capable things. It's a huge challenge, because that's actually not the case.\nExplainee: When we think about babies on their social cognition, we actually start from the idea that they have a notion of what an agent is. An agent is something that's self-propelled, that has its own internal states, like goals and beliefs. And so, it's very natural to imagine that when you see a seemingly, they call it propulsive, action by a robot, you're thinking, 'Hey, this thing has a desire. It has a goal. It's accomplishing it with its. So what if I give it a different goal? Why couldn't it do that?' They call it promiscuous generalization about agents, right? I think that the electrical outlet looks like a face. I think that my computer's mad at me. And so I think it, the challenge actually is to stop people from doing that, and to recognize limitations where there are some. Or we bring to bear our knowledge, sometimes incredibly quickly, to parse an uncertain image. So our experiences go all the way down to our very first impressions of the sensory signal.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","438":"Explainer: I like that description, because it conveys how much complexity there is to these really basic tasks that we're doing. Is there a definition for the simple tasks that we do versus things that are more complex, like playing chess?\nExplainee: I guess I like to think about this hierarchical cascade, where, at first, vision starts with the sensory signal and parses it into gradually more complex units. I think it does make sense to talk about lower level, meaning closer to sensation and perception and action, and higher level meaning more deliberative, more mediated by memory and language and judgment.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","439":"Explainer: So what are you studying these days?\nExplainee: Well, I'm preparing my dissertation. The general topic is going to be how we perceive different types of social stimuli, like different people's faces and make judgements about them and how the way that we report on what we are experiencing tells us about what's actually going on inside our heads.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","440":"Explainer: What I love about what you were describing is like you didn't use the word memory, were how you were talking about kind of perceptions and social judgments but I think probably we'd both agree that memory is a big part of that.\nExplainee: Oh of course.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","441":"Explainer: Right, like it reminds me so much of, you know, what we in the field would refer to as statistical learning. On one hand we might have like a one-shot memory, a memory of something that we saw yesterday, like what we did or what we ate or where we were. But a lot of our memories and our knowledge instead are based on many, many, many experiences.\nExplainee: Oh, absolutely. I think this sort of reminds me of another project that I'm doing. It's fairly easy to get different participants to experience consistent negative emotions to the same stimuli, but with positive emotions it's so much harder to study. I might not react the same to like this like cute cat video than someone else. And I definitely believe that people's memory that they're bringing up unconsciously when they're experiencing something to make an emotional judgment informs especially our experience with positive emotion possibly more than negative emotion.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","442":"Explainer: Some of those examples really remind me also some of the questions about kind of abnormalities in, in memory or trauma or disruptions in memory and how they also play out in terms of not just what people remember but what they do with those memories right?\nExplainee: As far as the way that my research plays into it is like the first step in making a judgment about what to do based on an experience we're calling from memory is deciding what your emotional response was.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","443":"Explainer: You know when I look back at, some of the work for my own lab and in the field in general, I really feel like some of the most exciting discoveries were not an answer to a question that was around before, but they were discoveries that made us realize we weren't asking the right question. I think one example of that even has to do with the connection between memory and decision-making. There was a discovery about how the striatum responds to rewards and to learning that just all of a sudden flipped the way we thought about the role of reward and learning and memory, and may force us to realize there was something fundamentally connected between these processes. And that discovery just raised a whole new set of questions that didn't exist before.\nExplainee: It's really hard to tell people like, just don't use your memory to do this. And we just sort of have to infer and guess at what strategies that they're doing. Is there's a particular research question that the answer you think is gonna inform the research in your lab and perhaps in the rest of your field?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","444":"Explainer: Typically you would think that things that are easy for humans, are also easy for robots and computers to do.\nExplainee: Right.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","445":"Explainer: And things that are hard for humans should also be hard for robots and humans to do. But it turns out that it's actually the opposite. I wanna try a little demo.\nExplainee: Okay.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","446":"Explainer: So I have a penny in my hand and I'd like you to pick it up with your right hand and put it into your left hand. So that was pretty easy, right?\nExplainee: Yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","447":"Explainer: We're gonna make this a little bit harder now. So, can you put these on? And we'll try to do the same thing again with your eyes closed. There you go. Let's try that one more time, and see if you can do any better. So close your eyes.\nExplainee: Oh, there we go.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","448":"Explainer: Yeah. So that you're able, with a bit more practice, you're able to figure it out. When it fell on the ground, how did you know to pick it up off the ground?\nExplainee: From the sound.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","449":"Explainer: Yeah. It's really unintuitive. In order to survive, we need to pick up objects and everything. Basically many, many, like billions of years of evolution actually created humans and the ability to manipulate objects like that. So, it actually turns out that things that are really basic for us are actually just really complex tasks in general.\nExplainee: So do robots know, like, they messed up? They know.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","450":"Explainer: That's a great question. So in reinforcement learning, the robot tries the task, and then it gets some sort of reinforcement, some sort of feedback. It's similar to how you might train a dog.\nExplainee: Yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","451":"Explainer: So you could give it feedback like that. So it won't necessarily know itself, especially on the first few tries, but it's trying to figure out what the task is even.\nExplainee: Does a robot see like how we see or does it like, just see like a program or something?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","452":"Explainer: It depends on how you program the robot. If you program the robot to follow exact motions and follow a very specific program, then it won't go off that program. It will always do those actions. But if something unexpected happens, that the program wasn't designed to handle, then the robot might go off court.\nExplainee: Do you think robots will take over the world? Just being honest.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","453":"Explainer: Yeah for sure.\nExplainee: Just because I was so excited, you know? So that the thing is that it took me maybe 30 minutes. A kid at home who's like 13 and 14 who just starts playing around with a simple computer program can make incredibly beautiful fractals.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","454":"Explainer: Or you don't even need computers. Like I remember when I was a kid, I played electric guitar and I had all these guitar pedals with different effects and oh, what happens if you put the output back in the input and just run it through itself, you're gonna start hearing this kind of fractal sound, right? So today we've been telling people, fractals are things that are somehow self-similar, they have detail at all scales. Are there other ways you might introduce fractals to somebody or are there other things you might say, this is what a fractal is?\nExplainee: And I think that's one of the things that's exciting about it.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","455":"Explainer: Yeah.\nExplainee: Yeah I actually actually remember the moment when I finally figured out how to make turbulence in computer graphics, I was working for this company, Maggi and Disney was working on a movie. I think it was weird science where they wanted to have a marble vase. And then about three in the morning, I was at a diner nearby and I was pouring the cream into the coffee and I was watching it and I started watching it swirl around. And I realized that what was happening was really simple that you had this line of cream and then it hits the cup and it folds and then the folds get caught up. And then that folds again. And it's a really simple process of folding within folding. And I just went to the computer and did that.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","456":"Explainer: [Keenan] Right?\nExplainee: And when everybody understands scaling.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","457":"Explainer: Now you work on kind of the future of virtual reality and augmented reality and extended reality. But it's kind of interesting because I think if I think about exploring these infinite fractal landscapes in some way, they still feel a little bit lonely or they feel a little bit poor of the kind of richness that we have in the real world.\nExplainee: Scaling is a simple thing yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","458":"Explainer: So- He made a lot of happy little trees.\nExplainee: I think in that case, it came down to the fact that Ken in particular had a mission to make accessible tools for people without sacrificing the power and the richness of making beautiful things. I mean, in a sense he was kind of the computer graphic, Bob Ross. You know? So- \nExplainer: {missing part}\n","459":"Explainer: So what do you know about infinity?\nExplainee: I think it means that it's really just something that's infinite, that never ends.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","460":"Explainer: That's a great way to think about it. Infinity is something that never ends, where finite, the opposite of infinity, refers to a process or a quantity that we could actually count all the way through, at least in theory if given enough time. So if you had to guess, how many Skittles are in this jar?\nExplainee: I would say about like 217.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","461":"Explainer: I'll admit. I have absolutely no idea. Do you think it's a finite number or an infinite number?\nExplainee: Finite because I can see them all in here.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","462":"Explainer: So let's try and imagine infinitely many jars. Would they fit in this room?\nExplainee: No.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","463":"Explainer: That's a wonderful question, a very rich question. What do you think?\nExplainee: I think maybe because you said it was unlimited.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","464":"Explainer: me too\nExplainee: Yeah, always when I'm trying to take a photo.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","465":"Explainer: while it's spinning\nExplainee: That's crazy.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","466":"Explainee: Yeah, I mean I'm definitely gonna impress all my friends when I tell them about this, they're gonna be like, quantum what?\nExplainer: your hair is tangled or whatever you can you can untangle it right\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","467":"Explainer: but in the quantum world when we entangle things they're really now connected it's much much harder to separate them again so using the same analogy we spin our pennies and eventually eventually they both stop right and when they stop it's either heads or tails right so in my case i got tails and you got heads you see how they're totally disconnected from each other right our pennies in the real world now if our pennies were entangled and we both spun them together right when we stopped them if you measured your penny to be ahead i would measure my penny to be ahead and if you measured your penny to be a tails i would measure my opinion to be a tails if we measured it at exactly the same time we would still find that they were both exactly correlated \nExplainer: that's so cool right \nExplainer: {missing part}\n","468":"Explainer: Exactly. Yeah. Do you know what an MRI, how an MRI works?\nExplainee: No, I don't and I feel like I should because I've gotten them millions of times.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","469":"Explainer: Start to see the different cells\nExplainee: Yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","470":"Explainer: In a diamond and people actually now make nano diamonds that they can try to put inside the human body to look at the

also plays a crucial role in motor control, learning new motor skills, and coordinating your movements, unlike the prefrontal cortex which is primarily responsible for executive functions such as decision-making, planning, and social behavior.","1":"So, what does that mean for us in terms of understanding sleep and how it affects our mental and physical health?","2":"However, it's important to note that while they may help initially, long-term use of amphetamines can disrupt the normal sleep-wake cycle, leading to insomnia and other sleep disorders. The body can become dependent on the drugs to maintain wakefulness, making it increasingly difficult to fall and stay asleep without them. As a result, the quality of sleep may not be significantly improved or could even worsen over time.","3":"It is less clear about which exact stages of the sleep cycle amphetamines have the most significant impact. The studies have shown that amphetamine use delays the onset of REM sleep, but there's less consensus about its effects on other stages of sleep and the transitions between them.","4":"I'm not sure about the specifics of your study, but in our lab, we often have participants fill out a sleep questionnaire before joining the study, to ensure that they have had enough restful sleep, thereby reducing the potential impact of sleep deprivation on their performance in the experiment.","5":"Although some say that quantum mechanics is too complex for a non-physicist to understand, there's a wealth of resources available to help you grasp the fundamental concepts at an approachable level.","6":"So, in your case, how did life experience lead you to make the choices you did in your musical career?","7":"So it's not a typical dominant chord, because of the natural seven and the lack of the dominant. It's more of a bittersweet or tense sound, as opposed to the resolved feeling of a dominant chord.","8":"How did you come to know about this?","9":"I think the next step would be to reconsider your budget and see where adjustments can be made.","10":"Yes, exactly. It's as if the melody is pulling you towards the base note, yet at the same time, it feels like the base note is just the culmination of the melody, as if I was there all along.","11":"Did you know it is often sung at funerals and other solemn occasions due to its reflective and comforting nature?","12":"It's actually a popular Christian hymn, but it's also used in many secular contexts for its powerful message and emotional impact. You should definitely give it a listen if you haven't before!","13":"It seems like the sound quality is more appealing to you as compared to the other ones.","14":"That's correct! Now, latency can be further categorized into network latency, processing latency, and input latency. Network latency is the time it takes for data to travel from one point to another over a network. Processing latency is the time it takes for your device to process the data and generate a response. Input latency, on the other hand, is the time it takes for your device to react to your input. These latencies can significantly affect the performance and user experience of any system.","15":"Explainer: It's like a combination of hardware advancements, smart game design, and network capabilities contributing to that rapid response, providing a more engaging and immersive gaming experience.","16":"Yes, that's one way to explain it. Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) that provides systems the ability to automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. It includes a range of statistical and mathematical algorithms that enable a machine to learn from and make decisions or predictions based on data.","17":"Perhaps the machine could understand the rhythm and the genre of the music, the use of dissonance or discomforting sounds, the tempo, the lyrics if any, and the dynamics (i.e. the change of volume, intensity). Or, it can be trained on large datasets with examples of different kinds of music that have a 'creepy vibe' to help it recognize the characteristics of such music.","18":"In the sense of space, they are extremely dense, which is why a teaspoon-full would weigh so much by our standards.","19":"But for neutron stars, once the collapse happens, there's a point called a Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff limit, after the physicists who discovered it. Once the mass of the neutron star gets beyond that limit, it collapses into a black hole instead.","20":"theoretically, we cannot say what's inside a black hole because as per our understanding, the event horizon is a point of no return and anything that crosses it cannot be observed anymore, even from outside the black hole, since it doesn't emit any light or radiation, so it remains a mystery","21":"Explainee: Gravitational waves could also provide us with valuable insights into the properties of black holes, as the waves emitted by black holes during their merger process could potentially reveal details about their internal structure and composition.","22":"That event was the solar eclipse, which is a phenomenon where the moon passes between the Earth and the Sun, blocking all or part of the Sun's light in the sky.","23":"But if you're more into computational approaches, you might lean towards computer science and data science. These fields, in turn, can lead to developing simulations, algorithms, and other tools for solving complex physics problems. They can also help in the interpretation and visualization of the data generated by these problems.","24":"Since that means it has four dimensions, you can visualize it as having length, width, height, and one additional dimension, depending on which theory you follow, either time or a spatial rotation.","25":"Now, when we think about it, every time you move in space, it's also a movement in time. That's because space and time are intertwined. In other words, a change in position (x, y, z) involves a change in time (t). So, to visualize this, we can say that moving along a path (x(t), y(t), z(t)) in space takes time t. This is the fundamental idea behind spacetime. If we had a simpler world where movement in space didn't affect time or vice versa, the idea of spacetime wouldn't be as significant. However, with Einstein's theories of relativity, it became apparent that the way we define and experience the separation between space and time (and thus spacetime) can be different for different observers in motion relative to each other. Furthermore, space and time can be thought of as different dimensions of the same entity \u2013 spacetime \u2013 which brings us to the concept of a four-dimensional spacetime that generalizes the three-dimensional space we are familiar with.","26":"What I mean is that if we observe an object moving at a constant velocity, in one frame of reference, it appears stationary in another. This can only be understood if we consider space and time together as one four-dimensional entity, known as spacetime.","27":"So, a physical object would travel along this path called the worldline. This worldline can be curved or straight, depending on the object's motion and the gravitational fields it encounters. By considering spaces as spacetime, we can account for the effects of time and relative motion in a unified way, which is crucial for understanding our universe.","28":"So if I travel at close to the speed of light and then turn around, it would slow me down and I could theoretically travel into the past. That's time travel in the way you are probably thinking about it.","29":" correct. Proper time is the time experienced by an observer moving along a given trajectory in a gravitational field. It's the quantity of time measurement that is intrinsic to that observer and not affected by his velocity.","30":"So everyone experiences time differently based on their motion through the universe, according to Einstein's Theory of Relativity.","31":"The one who zoomed out experienced time dilation. This is a phenomenon where time appears to pass slower for faster moving objects relative to a stationary one. In essence, the movingperson's time would have moved slower, making it seem like less time had passed for them as compared to the person who remained stationary.","32":"But if you were to use a `string` as a key in a `dictionary`, it loses its original case (for example, 'Key' would become 'key'). In a set, where each element is `unique`, case matters and both 'Key' and 'key' are considered separate items.","33":"Exactly, just like how the book would curve the sheet, massive objects like the earth, sun, and moon curve spacetime around them","34":"I think that's a great point to illustrate relative motion. If we were to extend that to space and compare different objects moving at different speeds, that's where Einstein's theory of general relativity comes into play. According to it, gravity is a result of distortion of spacetime by the presence of mass. So when the train in your example accelerates, it's not just moving through space but creating a curvature of spacetime around it. This curvature affects the path of other objects falling close to it, like a ball. That's essentially the core idea behind how gravity works in the context of relativity.","35":"So, to achieve harmony, you're not only injecting melody with emotion, but you're also incorporating new experiences and insights, ensuring a journey of learning.","36":"It's a great choice.","37":"So, think of the extra dimensions as a playground where fundamental particles, like brains, can 'play'. And these particles move along these extra dimensions, just like a toy car in a maze. So, in theory, an electron could move not just in three dimensions in a box, but also along some invisible dimensions outside the box. This concept might help us understand some of the fundamental forces and other mysteries of the universe.","38":"... and why are the extra dimensions hidden at a Planck scale? Could that be related to the symmetry breaking or the compactification mechanisms proposed in string theory?","39":null,"40":"Well, typically in the multiverse interpretation of string theory, the large dimensions are assumed to be compactified and are smaller than the Planck length, while the extra dimensions are proposed to be much larger than we're accustomed to in our everyday experience","41":"The 'black brane' is a generalization of the black hole concept, where instead of being 3+1 dimensions (3 spatial and 1 time dimension), it can be thought of as having more dimensions (referred to as P dimensions). This is where the name 'P-brane' comes from. These additional dimensions are not necessarily perpendicular to the original four dimensions, but can be part of the black brane itself, which is considered to be a membrane in higher dimensional space-time.","42":"That's right. In the case of branes in de Sitter space, what's unique is that these black branes we're discussing have a stable, non-singular core that is not an anti-de Sitter spacetime, unlike their counterparts in anti-de Sitter space. Instead, the core in de Sitter space is compactified.","43":"Therefore, the solutions with a negative cosmological constant in the transverse dimensions (adS space) have the lowest action compared to the alternatives in those dimensions, which makes them the preferred solutions.","44":"It's a loud quantum event, it's gonna happen.","45":"The Dialogues is a beautifully illustrated and engaging journey through the world of advanced physics and cosmology, covering topics like the Big Bang, dark matter, dark energy, and the theory of everything. It's an accessible and captivating exploration of how spacetime can emerge from quantum mechanics.","46":"Gravity","47":"Also, we don't feel gravity in space because there you are weightless. The spaceship keeps you in place with artificial gravity, and if the spaceship is orbiting the earth, it's moving in a direction that balances the outward force due to the earth's gravity, keeping you in an approximate circular path around the earth.","48":"Okay, let me move a little closer. Try again. Can you see me now without turning your eyes?","49":"Yeah, three it is! Great.","50":"Well, for that purpose, a focused high-intensity laser would be used. This laser generates heat through a process called photothermal ablation, which causes the cell to heat up rapidly and eventually destruct. The advantage of this method is that it can be targeted precisely, minimizing damage to the surrounding healthy cells.","51":"Those are fascinating points. From a technical and creatively driven aspect, I'd add that we can also explore immersive and interactive storytelling. This means not just passively watching a story unfold but actively participating in it, shaping its outcomes, and experiencing the narrative in a profoundly personal way.","52":"Explainer: That's exactly what I'm trying to say. The Life of Us project you mentioned is a perfect example of how embracing lower-poly aesthetics and simple vertex shading can enhance the user's experience. It allows for a more immersive and magical journey, as you feel more at ease with the non-photo-realistic environment.","53":"The dimensionality, or simply dimension, refers to the number of independent and quantifiable attributes or elements that can be used to describe a particular object, entity, or system. In everyday life, we are commonly familiar with the first three dimensions: length, width, and height (or depth). In modern physics, especially in the context of string theory and superstring theory, more dimensions are suggested to exist. This could range from 7, 9, 10 or even more. These additional dimensions are assumed to be compactified on a tiny scale, meaning they are not accessible to our perception in the everyday world.","54":"Try holding one on the top, another at the side as a support, and the third below it as a base. This way, all three are right angled to one another.","55":"Well, one such system is the spherical coordinate system. It's used to describe points in three dimensions with radius, theta, and phi instead of x, y, and z.","56":"That's a good thought, but time isn't what we are considering here as an extra spatial dimension. Time is the fourth dimension in the context of relativity, but we're looking for additional spatial dimensions.","57":"In astronomy, it's used to determine the precise position of a celestial body in the sky. The declination, similar to latitude, describes a position on a meridian (a north-south line on the celestial sphere), while the right ascension, corresponding to longitude, describes how far eastward a star, galaxy, or other celestial body is along the celestial equator.","58":"Yeah. So essentially, the peel of an orange is separated, dried, and ground into a powder. This orange peel powder retains all the antioxidants and essential oils that are beneficial for our health.","59":"So there would be three dimensions when referring to the position of an object on Earth, but moving to celestial coordinates, we add an additional two dimensions: right ascension (longitude) and declination (latitude) in the sky, making a total of five dimensions.","60":"We don't really know what the world is made of, even when we think we do. The very foundations of our understanding can change and force us to question our most deeply held beliefs.","61":"Explainee: What kind of technology and tools have you been using in your studies of black holes? Explainer: We use a variety of instruments to study black holes, such as gravitational wave detectors like LIGO, radio telescopes like the Event Horizon Telescope, and X-ray telescopes to observe X-ray binaries. These tools help us gather data and make observations about black holes and the effects they have on their surroundings.","62":" Gravity is the force that pulls objects towards each other, it's what keeps us and everything on Earth from floating off into space due to the planet's mass.","63":"The Moon's gravitational force on the Earth creates the ocean tides here on Earth. So, just like the Moon pulls the Earth a little bit, the Earth is also pulling the Moon towards it. That's why we say that the Earth and the Moon are in an orbit, where they both pull on each other, but because the Earth is much, much larger, the Earth's pull on the Moon is much stronger, which keeps the Moon moving in its path around the Earth.","64":"No, because we would be pulled back down to the Earth too strongly, making it impossible to stand or move.","65":"That was Bonnie the raccoon.","66":"That indicates that being in microgravity in space makes people temporarily taller because their spinal discs absorb fluid, causing them to stretch out.","67":"What is this for, you ask? Well, the game is designed to help people improve their reflexes. The player has to catch falling objects before they hit the ground, with the controller. So, a heavy object would be challenging to catch and keep steady, enhancing the challenge and the learning experience.","68":"But remember, it's also important to consider your lifestyle and dietary needs. If you're an active individual or have specific nutritional requirements, you might need more.","69":"I believe those are biological factors that regulate sleep, but lifestyle factors such as stress, poor sleep hygiene, and irregular sleep schedules can also play a significant role in how much sleep a person needs. Factors like diet, physical activity, and environmental factors like light exposure and noise level can also contribute to sleep quality and quantity.","70":"That's a good observation. The length of the day, and thus the duration of melatonin release, can impact sleep patterns. However, the human body has ways to adapt to unusual day-night cycles. The Suprachiasmatic Nucleus (SCN), the part of the brain that contains the master clock, can adjust its schedule to match the light and dark periods, even if they are shorter or longer than the typical day-night cycle. So, even though you have longer days in Hoi, your body should still be able to regulate its sleep schedule, given time to adjust.","71":"It's a beam of concentrated light generated when an atom's electron is excited and then returns to its original state, and releases energy in the form of photons.","72":"Yes, that's exactly right. So a magnifying glass has a convex lens and when you concentrate enough light through it, it can cause a concentrated point of heat which is enough to ignite or burn a small area. So, in that sense, it's very similar.","73":"one small hole or slit, it makes a very narrow beam of light that can be used as a single source of light, like a flashlight.","74":"I was learning how to use it and it seemed like it was going to revolutionize everything.","75":"This field of study is more complex than I initially thought.","76":"It's exciting because these new findings have allowed us to better understand the environments around supermassive black holes and how they influence the activity of active galactic nuclei. Moreover, our improved understanding of AGN spectra can lead to more accurate measurements of black hole masses, which is vital in testing theories of galaxy evolution and the development of cosmic structure.","77":null,"78":"When we talk about being off, we not only mean that the body becomes still and rests. Sleep actually involves several different stages that our body goes through, each with its own distinct purpose and function.","79":"That's correct. Your body will be in lighter stages of sleep when you're exposed to technology, light, or music during sleep, which would decrease the chances of entering REM sleep.","80":"That's why it's recommended to avoid digital devices before bedtime, and to establish a consistent routine and environment to promote sleep.","81":"If you sleep longer, you might not feel refreshed. Have you tried taking a shorter nap?","82":"It must have been quite challenging. Quantum mechanics is one of the most abstract and counterintuitive subjects in physics. Some people find it fascinating, while others find it confusing. What did you find most challenging about it?","83":"These quantum dots can be designed to emit light at specific wavelengths, making them very valuable for applications in photovoltaics, LED displays and biomedical imaging.","84":"Yes, you are correct. These semiconductors are considered as zero-dimensional or 0D nanomaterials because they are in a form of small clusters and have no dimensions. They exist as individual particles with no defined structure in all three dimension, unlike 1D materials, like nanowires or nanorods, or 2D materials, like graphene or nanoflakes.","85":"There are several potential applications of quantum dots. For instance, they could be used in LED displays, as they can emit highly-saturated colors across the visible light spectrum. Additionally, they could play a significant role in biomedical imaging due to their bright luminescence and photostability properties. Furthermore, they have the potential to improve solar cell efficiency as their sizes can be tailored to match optimal band gaps for various parts of the solar spectrum.","86":"Yes, they are indeed related to the quantum dots I work with. Those lights you see are LEDs (Light Emitting Diodes) that use quantum dots as a phosphor to improve their efficiency and color rendering properties.","87":"Machine learning is a type of artificial intelligence that allows computer systems to automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. It uses statistical methods to analyze data and learn patterns, and then use those patterns to make predictions or decisions.","88":"That's correct, but the defining characteristics of a dog and a cat are not just based on their behaviors. dogs are usually four-legged mammals that belong to the Carnivora family, while cats belong to the Felidae family. These animals share some similarities in behavior due to their evolutionary history as predators, but the key differences are in their physical and genetic characteristics.","89":"So, it sounds like you're describing a Siamese cat. Siamese cats are known for their sleek bodies, long legs, and pointed ears.","90":"And the animal in your picture appears to have a vest and a scarf, which are not typical accessories for cats or dogs.","91":"Explainee: It's similar in a way, review problems are like a practice test before the actual test.","92":"So, you should be confident in your test performance, as you have been consistently solving all the problems you encountered in practice.","93":"Well, machines can process and learn from a large number of examples very quickly. They can go through millions of examples in a fraction of a second. But for a human, it would take a very long time to look at and remember that many pictures. So even though you might learn the patterns over time, you wouldn't be able to process and answer questions about all those examples as quickly as a machine could.","94":"We're discussing the concept of photosynthesis today.","95":"Cells are the basic units of life and are responsible for most of the body's activities. They form tissues, organs, and systems in the body. In other words, we can say the human body is like a city where cells are the buildings that make up the city.","96":"So, have you found any significant vulnerabilities in these devices and how can these fault attacks affect regular users?","97":"Right! So what you're saying is, instead of trying to crack the complex math itself, you manipulate the device to accept an incorrect answer as the correct one. This is a form of software fault injection, where you're intentionally introducing flaws in the software's execution to bypass security checks. It's like tricking the pinball machine into thinking it hit the jackpot even when it didn't.","98":"That's fascinating. The concept is similar to bit-flipping attacks on magnetic storage devices like hard drives and memory chips using neutrons, a technique demonstrated by scientists in 2013 at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. In your case, they are using an x-ray to achieve the same goal, which is quite impressive and opens up new possibilities for research and potential threats in the realm of data security.","99":"So, it would be fascinating to see a visualization of how that fault propagates through the circuit and affects the overall functionality of the system. Unfortunately, traditional diagnostic tools might not be able to catch this as it's a transient fault, which is hard to reproduce and even harder to detect. However, simulations and specialized equipment could potentially help us visualize this process.","100":"This creates an enormous amount of gravity, which is so strong that not even light can escape. This is what we call a black hole.","101":"'It's been a double-edged sword. On one hand, the increased accessibility and democratization of machine learning has led to a proliferation of innovative ideas and solutions. On the other hand, the ease with which one can execute a new company can lead to overcrowding of the market and the risk of shallow, short-lived ventures.'","102":"Explainer: Exactly, and that's where I find myself agreeing with you. while the accessibility of machine learning tools has certainly helped democratize data analysis, the struggle often lies in the real-world data collection, preprocessing, and management which can be time-consuming, expensive, and challenging due to ethical, privacy, and regulatory concerns. These aspects aren't covered by machine learning tools; they require a different set of skills and considerations. It's a double-edged sword, isn't it?","103":"Yes, indeed. Transparency is crucial for the acceptance and trust of an AI system. In terms of biases, understanding and mitigating them is a continuous effort. Biases can creep in at various stages, such as during data collection, during the training process, or even in the usage phase. It's important to audit the system regularly and make adjustments as necessary to ensure fairness and equity.","104":"I share your optimism and believe that we can create the world you envision. To tackle the challenges ahead, we need a shift in mindset towards more holistic and equitable data collection and AI application. This could be fostered by greater collaboration between academia and industry, and by educating our students to understand the broader implications and ethical considerations of their work. Teaching them to think critically about the data they use and the applications of their models will be essential in avoiding future biases and ensuring the fair and beneficial use of AI technologies.","105":"Don't you think it's better to have a contingency plan for your business in case of unforeseen events? A written business plan can help you identify potential risks, and devise strategies to address them.","106":"No, they were not cut. These are a type of mathematical objects called origami tilings, where you can fold a single piece of paper, along specific creases, to form a pattern that can cover a surface without gaps or overlaps.","107":"That's a good start, but we want to create an arched shape or something similar. Maybe let's try to fold it at a gentler angle, perhaps as I've shown here?","108":"Yes, all the folds can be reversed. If you fold it one way, it becomes a mountain, but if you fold it the other way, it becomes a valley.","109":"and any origami shape can be transformed into any other origami shape of the same type (3 mountains, 3 valleys) by reversing some folds.","110":"I'll fold it in half twice horizontally and then twist the top left corner up and over to the bottom right corner. This way, the center square will rotate to form a twist.","111":"Yes, but a human brain doesn't have an infinite number of directions it can go. We can model it as such for simplicity, but a more accurate simulation would also have to account for the non-deterministic nature of neuron firing and other stochastic factors, potentially requiring vast computational resources, and even then it might not fully capture the complexity of the human mind.","112":"Well, for optical observations, we use telescopes that are sensitive to visible light. For infrared observations, we use different types of telescopes equipped with specific infrared detectors. These detectors convert the infrared light we receive into a form that our instruments can read. In both cases, the data collected is analyzed to draw conclusions about the objects being observed.","113":"It's located two light weeks away from the AGN where the flash started.","114":"I understand your frustration. We need to be able to separate the X-ray binaries' emission from the black hole's emission to study the properties of the black hole more accurately. This is a challenge that requires advanced techniques and high-quality data.","115":"and that's what's intriguing. It seems like those supernova remnants are masking the presence of black holes, or perhaps the black holes are being quickly swallowed up by surrounding matter. This leaves us with more questions about the formation of black holes and their early evolution in the universe.","116":"So, it's like, all the energy created during the supernova gets absorbed by the black hole, nothing gets ejected out.","117":"I appreciate your curiosity in comparing traditional methods and deep learning techniques. A potential approach to consider could be a hybrid model, where you combine the strengths of both techniques. For instance, you could feed the automatically extracted deep learning features along with the manually crafted traditional features into a machine learning model to make predictions. This way, you're benefiting from the interpretability of traditional methods as well as the ability of deep learning to capture complex patterns in your data. It allows for an improved understanding of the data and improved model performance.","118":"I agree that using techniques like checking the biased words more frequently used with phrases like the woman was versus the man was can help to identify some forms of bias. However, it's essential to stress that these methods only scratch the surface when trying to evaluate the complexity and variety of biases in language models. They cannot replace a comprehensive understanding and examination of the data and the context in which the models are trained. It's essential to remember that data comes from human-created texts and reflects the biases and prejudices present in our society. As such, it is our responsibility to be aware of and mitigate these biases in our modeling processes and outcomes to prevent unfair representation and potential harm to certain groups. To effectively do this, we need continuous monitoring, evaluation, and adjustment of the models to ensure they align with our ethical and societal standards.","119":"So, in layman's terms, it's a method for making predictions based on data patterns and trends.","120":"So, in quantum mechanics, when you combine two states of a system using a plus sign, it represents the system being in both states simultaneously, a concept known as superposition. This is one of the key difference between classical and quantum systems, where a classical system must be in one state at a time.","121":null,"122":"Why do you want practical examples? ","123":"However, the key factor is that the quantum superposition, when applied to macroscopic objects such as black holes, is exceedingly fragile. As a result, any measurement or observation caused by matter or energy passing through the event horizon collapses the superposition, making the event horizon a distinct boundary. Therefore, the phenomenon you're describing, though theoretically possible, is practically unobservable in the real world.","124":"Explainee: Right, that's a pretty high limit, but given our current capabilities of storing and processing information, it's not feasible for us to achieve. After all, the universe is a quite complex and dynamic place, and there's a lot more to learn than just listing out facts and figures. So, it's more like an asymptotic limit where we're aiming to get as close as possible but never quite reaching it due to the inherent complexity and ever-evolving nature of the universe.","125":"Here's the remote control. Press the 'on' button.","126":"I am all set. Let's get this started.","127":"Let's get started with folding the paper diagonally, and then I'll walk you through the rest of the steps to create this beautiful, centuries old crane.","128":null,"129":"It's a fun toy to make and play with using just simple origami folding techniques. If you'd like to give it a try, I can show you how!","130":"The blockchain allows for an efficient and secure way to track and trade energy. It enables peer-to-peer transactions, so energy can be bought, sold, and shared among various participants in the grid without relying on centralized utilities. This can help balance energy demand and supply, making it easier to incorporate renewable energy sources into the grid. Additionally, because all transactions are recorded on a decentralized and tamper-proof ledger, there is transparency and accountability for every energy exchange.","131":"It's still being developed and tested, so it's not widely available to the public yet.","132":"It's based on centralized authority, which means a few big players control most of the data, and everyone else has to rely on them. This leads to monopolies, and innovation stagnates.","133":"But humans aren't perfect either, and we accept that there will be accidents. The goal for autonomous vehicles should be to minimize accidents and improve road safety, not eliminate car deaths completely.","134":"Well, it's actually more complex and can include different acts such as gaining unauthorized access to a system, misusing the access for illegal activities, or manipulating data. It's also important to note that computer hacking can be used ethically with authorization for purposes like security testing, network maintenance, or data investigation.","135":"It's more like a virtual wall or barrier that only allows the good hackers in while keeping the bad ones out. They use various methods like strong passwords, multi-factor authentication, and security protocols to build this wall.","136":"When I found out that someone was hacking my family's computer, I decided to learn how to do it myself to protect them.","137":"I didn't really think about the ethical implications at the time, but now I understand that modifying someone else's creation without permission can be considered a violation of their rights. I've since learned about programming ethics and try to apply them in my work.","138":"(Explainee: I believe so. Could I share it somewhere to find out?)","139":"Actually, nanotechnology is a very real and rapidly developing field of technology that manipulates matter on an atomic, molecular, and supramolecular scale. However, the advanced applications of it, like self-assembling robots or medical treatments at the molecular level, may still resemble science fiction at the moment.","140":"This is a transistor, a fundamental building block for computer chips. It can switch electrical signals, allowing for complex information processing in microprocessors.","141":"Transistors were first invented by William Shockley, John Bardeen, and Walter Brattain in 1947. In the beginning stages, transistors were roughly the size of a thumb and were expensive to produce. Over time, advancements in photolithography and etching technologies allowed transistors to be miniaturized and mass-produced at a lower cost. Today, transistors are incredibly small, often measuring less than a hundred nanometers square. Despite their size, we can fit 18 billion transistors in a space slightly larger than one square inch, thanks to innovative manufacturing techniques and a relentless quest for miniaturization.","142":"Well, in this case, 'trade' doesn't mean 'taking turns doing something'. It's more like exchanging things that you have for things you want. So, for example, if you have cookies and I have apples, and we both want one of the other's, we can trade and give each other what we have for what we want. You won't have to give up most of what you want, you'll just give something you have that the other person agrees is of equal value.","143":"I would trade my (Item\/Toy\/etc.) that I don't like so much for his (Item\/Toy\/etc.).","144":"Well, computer hacking is the unauthorized access or manipulation of computers or networks, often with malicious intent. It can involve a variety of techniques, such as exploiting vulnerabilities, social engineering, or brute force attacks. Hacking can lead to data breaches, identity theft, financial theft, and much more, making it a major concern for businesses, governments, and individuals alike.","145":"Yes, that's correct! The camera is another input device. It receives visual data from the environment and converts it into a digital signal that the computer can understand.","146":"That's a good guess! However, it's more complex than that. While you're right about the slingshot analogy in a way, it doesn't tell the full story. In reality, we use the Earth's motion around the Sun to help launch things into space. This is called the 'gravitational slingshot' effect, where the spacecraft is sent on a trajectory that passes close to a celestial body (like a planet), using the body's gravity to speed up the spacecraft.","147":"In other words, in the absence of any external force, you wouldn't be able to tell the difference between free-falling in a gravitational field and accelerating in a spaceship. This is the essence of the equivalence principle.","148":"And I always feel like it's just the other train that's moving, until someone points out that we are moving too.","149":"From your perspective inside the train, the ball would seem to be just hanging in the air, defying gravity. This is a consequence of the theory of special relativity known as the equivalent principle, which states that in some situations, it's impossible to tell whether you're in a stationary object in a field of force, or an object in motion in the absence of forces. Also, if you were to drop the ball, it would move straight down to the floor, just as if you were standing still, even though an outside observer would see it move relative to the platform.","150":"Quantum computers, when they become powerful enough, could potentially be able to factor large numbers very quickly. This would mean that a lot of the encryption methods we use today would no longer be secure, which could lead to all sorts of security issues, such as financial fraud and government spying, among other things.","151":"Exactly, it restores our energy, so we can be active throughout the day, just like how charging an electric car's battery allows it to run. Since we can't plug ourselves in, sleep is our body's way of charging itself.","152":"What do you think about them?","153":"It recharges through quick naps scattered throughout the day and also it spends 75% of its time eating and digesting, which helps conserve energy and aid in its regeneration process.","154":"I think it might be because you had a long day.","155":"No, their heart rate slows down, and a special adaptability called the aortic blood flow reversal circulates blood in and out of their body","156":"I would imagine having so much power could be intimidating and overwhelming.","157":"It's quite fascinating that dolphins are known for their intelligence, comparable to that of apes, and they have the largest brain to body mass ratio among all animal species. They are also very social creatures who live in groups called pods. Moreover, dolphins use a specialized part of their nose called melon to produce and receive sound.","158":"So here's an interesting part: Dolphins don't actually sleep all at once like us. They cycle between half-asleep and fully awake states. This way, one half of their brain can rest while the other half stays alert to keep swimming and breathing.","159":" Actually, nanotechnology is a field of science that deals with the manipulation of materials on an atomic or molecular scale. Nanomaterials are those materials that have dimensions between 1 to 100 nanometers. Nanotechnology has various applications, such as medicine (like targeted drug delivery), electronics (like super speedy computers), and environmental cleanup, just to name a few.","160":"That's tiny but still larger than a nano. When we say nano, we're referring to something that is one billionth the size of what you just described. For example, a nanometer is a unit of measurement that's used to describe extremely small distances, like the diameter of a single carbon atom.","161":"A nanometer is a billionth of a meter. So that's even smaller than a millimeter. It's a billion times smaller. Mind-blowing, isn't it?","162":"Explainee: Atoms are also really, really small, so small that a nanometer is about one million millionth of the distance between two of them. So, scientists are able to study these tiny objects and manipulate them to create new materials that we can use every day.","163":"That sounds amazing! It's like having a Lego set of atoms, just on a nanoscales.","164":"I'm studying insects, they're interesting creatures that have a significant role in our ecosystem.","165":"But please remember to save your changes before leaving the page.","166":"Explainee: Yeah, that's exactly the case with HRTF too. If people have a poor spatial audio experience, it can be off-putting and hard to rebuild trust. It's important to fine-tune the HRTF for each individual user to make the audio experience as accurate and immersive as possible.","167":"Well, gravity can be considered as a force that attracts two objects towards each other. The strength of this force decreases as the square of the distance between the objects increases, following an inverse square law. However, it can also be thought of as a field that permeates throughout the universe, and objects with mass distort this field around them, moving through it like a medium. Recently, scientists have detected gravitational waves, ripples in this gravitational field, which provide a new means of observing and studying gravity.","168":"For example, sound waves get weaker as you move away from the source. Radiation from a light bulb decreases as you move away from it. But gravity is different. The inverse-square law means that the gravitational pull is weaker when you're further away from the object, not stronger. So, if you start doubling your distance from the Earth, the force of gravity on you decreases by a factor of four.","169":"You feel weightless, which is why anyone\u2013\u2013including astronauts\u2013\u2013feels weightless in free fall. This experience is a direct consequence of the gravitational field permeating the space all around us. In the absence of other forces, the gravitational force pulls us towards the center of Earth, canceling each other out in all directions, making us feel weightless.","170":"It's because the Earth isn't flat, it's round (or spherical), so if you kept going straight, you'd eventually follow the curve of the Earth down to the center.","171":"I can tell that is something you're excited about. What's going on? ","172":"There are a lot of stars out there, each with their own planets orbiting around them, and that just blows my mind!","173":"They are theoretical dimensions beyond the basic three dimensions of space (length, width, height) and one dimension of time that are posited to exist but have yet to be definitively observed or measured in experiments.","174":"Indeed, it's known as the Higgs field, a fundamental field in physics that gives mass to particles. In essence, particles moving through this field 'feel' a resistance \u2013 known as the Higgs force \u2013 that creates mass. While it's not a physical object, it can be visualized as a sort of sea in which particles swim, each feeling a unique resistance based on their inherent properties.","175":"In a binary search tree, with a root node x, you traverse down the tree following the left child until you reach a node with smaller values or reach the leaf node, then you traverse up the tree following the right child until you reach a node with greater values or reach the root node. If we apply this to our example 'Bela', we would start from the root node and find a lower value in the left sub-tree, repeat this process, and eventually find 'Bela' at the leaf node.","176":"String theory attempts to unify quantum mechanics and gravity by treating fundamental particles as one-dimensional objects, or 'strings', instead of point-like objects. These strings vibrate at different frequencies, and the particle types we observe are thought to correspond to different modes of vibration. However, it's important to note that string theory is still a work in progress and is yet to be thoroughly tested.","177":"The concept originates from a 1983 paper by Thomas J. Lee and Ramalingam S. Mahadevan which introduced the idea of the Minsky triangle, or a visual representation of a credit relationship between three types of capital:","178":"In string theory, the vibrations of these strings correspond to the different modes of excitation, which are associated with different particles. The frequency and shape of the vibrations of a string determine the mass and charge of the resulting particle.","179":"Yes, that's correct! In essence, string theory is one of the prime candidates for a Grand Unified Theory (GUT). It aims to unify the fundamental forces of nature: electromagnetic, weak force, and strong force. The gravity part is still somewhat challenging within string theory and that's where ongoing research is focused. If a successful formulation of a GUT, including gravity, can be achieved, it will provide a unified description of all physical phenomena, offering a comprehensive understanding of the universe at its most basic level.","180":"But string theory also tries to be a TOE, a Theory of Everything, which includes all fundamental forces including gravity. So it\u2019s not just an extension of the GUT, it aims to include it. This is why it's called a Grand Unified Theory (GUT) of Quantum Gravity.","181":"And the theory of everything, often referred to as M-theory, suggests that these branes are not just confined to our three dimensions, but can exist in up to eleven dimensions. These extra dimensions would be compactified or rolled up so small that we can't perceive them. This theory attempts to unify all fundamental forces of nature, including gravity, into one consistent theoretical framework.","182":"So, in this new age, the actors could be Artificial Intelligence, robots, algorithms, and other machine-based systems, not just humans.","183":"Addressing the regulatory concerns and ensuring compliance with existing financial laws is another significant barrier. Additionally, scalability issues, and ensuring fast, secure, and cost-effective transactions are also key challenges in the blockchain space.","184":"Yes, that's right. Education is indeed crucial to ensure users understand the decentralized nature of Bitcoin and take the necessary security measures, reducing the risk of bitcoins being stolen or lost due to centralization attempts.","185":"It sounds like you've been exploring the potential of nanomaterials to enhance battery performance in various ways. One area that remains unexplored or could be further improved is the battery's energy density. Could there be potential in designing nanostructures to increase the energy density of batteries?","186":"One challenge is that, since the properties of these materials are so sensitive to their size and orientation, it's hard to consistently produce the same material every time. This inconsistency can lead to variations in the battery's performance. Another challenge is that, due to their small size, it's difficult to handle and manipulate these materials, which can lead to damage or contamination. This, in turn, can affect the performance of the battery. And finally, because of the complexity and unpredictability of their quantum behavior, it's difficult to accurately model and predict the behavior of these materials in a battery, which can make it hard to optimize the battery's performance.","187":"I'm very intrigued to hear about your journey into combining mathematics and origami. How did your interest in both fields develop, and what specific aspects of mathematics have you applied to origami?","188":"Because origami is a traditional Japanese art of paper folding that uses no cuts or glue and is based on geometric structures, it is ideal for creating compact and portable objects like this lamp that can be easily shipped flat and then assembled through folding.","189":"A stereolithography 3D printer is used to print this wheel, allowing it to be precise in its design and very lightweight. This is because the printer uses a process known as additive manufacturing, which means it only adds material where it is needed, making the end product very efficient.","190":"And this has potential applications in space-age technology, such as deployable solar panels and radiator.","191":"...I think it's going to be the 3D printing revolution, for large structures and even, who knows, maybe one day cities. That's what I'm genuinely excited about right now.","192":"Blockchain is a type of database that stores information across multiple computers in a network. Each block in the chain contain multiple transactions. Once a block is added to the chain, it can't be altered. That's why it's called blockchain.","193":"absolutely, that is one of the primary benefits of blockchain technology. By eliminating the need for intermediaries, it reduces costs and increases efficiency.","194":"Yeah, the mechanism for verifying a legitimate seller or producer involves the use of smart contracts. These are self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement between buyer and seller being directly written into lines of code. This code is then stored on a blockchain network. The smart contract automatically executes when the conditions are met, eliminating the need for a centralized intermediary and adding transparency to the transaction.","195":"Let's get right into it. How's your research on the new neural network architecture progressing?","196":"So, considering the evidence from the meta-analysis showing a 26% increased risk of Alzheimer's in sleep apnea patients, the link seems quite strong.","197":"Well, that's an interesting point you bring up. Given those findings, it seems that both sleep disturbances and sleep apnea could potentially be contributing factors towards the development of dementia. However, it's also plausible that changes in sleep could also be a result of the early onset of dementia itself. To further clarify, it would be beneficial to conduct more research to establish the underlying causality and whether sleep disturbances are a cause, a symptom, or a consequence of dementia.","198":null,"199":"They are origami birds. Just like a crane, they are folded from a single uncut square.","200":"Actually, we can make a single point by folding the paper in half several times until it becomes a narrow strip, then bending it into a small loop to create a single point.","201":"Now, let's find a pattern or design that you'd like to fold. There are plenty of free origami patterns available online.","202":"You should make sure to wash your hands for at least 20 seconds before touching food or eating.","203":"Although it could be difficult to define a specific amount of time for every individual, the common consensus is that it takes years of rigorous training and study- not just for a few months- to become a doctor or a lawyer.","204":"So, these origami-like mechanisms are not just decorative, they play a key role in saving space during transportation of the spacecraft.","205":"Otherwise, the expansion could damage the delicate instruments, and the mission will fail.","206":"Explainee: The more we fold the rectangles, the stiffer and more rigid they'll become, simulating the rigidity in real-world origami structures.","207":"and once you deploy, the unfolding happens automatically.","208":"In macroscopic quantities, it would be extremely difficult to get them aligned and maintain that alignment for a meaningful duration. And even if it were possible, the energy required to do so would be astronomical, rendering it impractical.","209":"It uses technologies like special headsets, controllers, and software to create a simulated environment","210":"Exactly! In fact, it could be like being inside a game, like Minecraft, just imagine that.","211":"The purpose of an explainer text is to take a complex concept and simplify it into easily understandable terms.","212":"G is the group name. So you could say 'G is a group.'","213":"Here's a simple version of Amazing Grace on my flute. Shall I play it for you?","214":"I will play a B flat note on the piano, but this time instead of imagining it as a white key, let's imagine it as a blue key. So when you see a blue key, you can now remember it as a B flat.","215":"I'm glad to hear that! Today, we're gonna discuss the concept of 'photosynthesis'. This is a process that plants and some other organisms use to convert light energy, usually from the sun, and carbon dioxide into glucose and oxygen. Would you like to know more about it?","216":"It's the branch of science that deals with matter, its motion, and behavior through space and time, as well as interactions with energy.","217":"Actually, it's more like one side of a 2D is like length, and the other side is like width. Once you have both of those established, depth gives you the third dimension.","218":"So, you would be on the right end of the line, as you're facing it.","219":"It's called 'an integer'.","220":"I didn't realize, but I appreciate your confidence. I'd be happy to do that for you.","221":"there are around a billion neurons in our brain, each connected with around 10,000 other neurons. This network of connections allows for complex tasks like thinking, learning, and memory.","222":"Yes, exactly! Gmail uses machine learning to categorize emails and to predict the most likely label for a new email based on patterns learned from previously processed emails. It's a process often referred to as 'training' the machine learning model.","223":"But it's not just the keywords or whether you've exchanged emails with the sender before, the model also takes into account the context of the email and uses more complex criteria such as content, sender's reputation, and the time of the day.","224":"Sure, for example, when dealing with complex datasets or problems that involve understanding the structure or patterns in images, speech, or text, it would be more appropriate to use a deep learning algorithm. Because deep learning can automatically learn the features from the data, it's beneficial in tasks such as image recognition, speech recognition, and natural language processing. On the other hand, reinforcement learning is typically used in situations involving sequential decision making and environments where there is some form of reward or punishment, such as game playing, robotics, and navigation.","225":"Yes, that's a good example. The linear regression model may accurately predict customer churn, but without understanding the underlying factors driving the churn, it's challenging to develop a solution. By not knowing why the prediction is what it is, it becomes difficult to focus on the right areas for retaining the customers.","226":"You can improve machine learning algorithms by focusing on improving interpretability and explainability. This involves building systems that can not only accurately predict outcomes, but also provide insights into the factors contributing to these predictions.","227":"So, if we only focus on the wiring diagram of the brain and ignore the role of myelination, glial cells, and the environment that the neurons and axons are in, we would indeed have an incomplete understanding of the brain.","228":"Well, in a way, you're right. But there are techniques like absolute pitch training that can help you recognize notes independently of their context. It requires consistent practice, but it's possible.","229":"Nice to see you too, Bob. What brings you here today?","230":"However, I have decided to move on and pursue new opportunities.","231":"Explainee: That's correct! By doing so, we should be able to reach intensities that exceed the Schwinger limit. This could potentially open up a whole new realm of particle physics.","232":"But the question is, at what cost? As we need to concentrate a lot of energy into a small area to achieve laser accelerating, the amount of energy required is enormous. So, we need to find an alternative method to attain this.","233":"For a team of innovative scientists, this could be an exciting challenge to work on. They could focus on developing technologies to reach those high acceleration rates.","234":"That's correct. The challenge lies in synchronizing the lasers' phases to ensure they operate as a single coherent source. This involves precision engineering and control systems to maintain the phase lock, a process aided by advanced electronic systems and feedback loops. As these synchronized lasers propagate through various optical components, their energy can be combined to achieve higher power levels like an exawatt.","235":"It was in 2013, and around 40 million credit and debit card data was stolen by the hackers.","236":"Yes, that's exactly right. Hackers often target weak entry points such as these devices as they are frequently overlooked for security updates. The deli scale in this case might have been connected to the network for ease of communication, but it wasn't properly secured. This made it easy for the hackers to access the network, and from there, they could potentially move around undetected, causing significant damage.","237":"Buffer overflow is a type of security vulnerability that occurs when a program or a system tries to store more data in a buffer, or a temporary storage area, than it was designed to hold. This can cause the buffer to overflow, overwriting adjacent memory space, potentially including sensitive memory locations such as return addresses of functions. This is a serious issue as it enables an attacker to run arbitrary code in the context of the vulnerable application or system, leading to unauthorized access, data corruption, and system crashes. In our context, an attacker can potentially exploit buffer overflow vulnerabilities in one system to gain access to another system connected to it, like in a network setting.","238":"So, when a program tries to write to or read from a memory location that has not been allocated or is out of bounds of an array in C programming, it causes a segmentation fault. This error is commonly seen in programs running on Unix-like operating systems.","239":null,"240":"Explainer: And it becomes a question of if we should have transparency in these technologies and how the US government should approach these situations. Should they be openly investing in the creation of technologies that can bypass another country's censorship, or should they focus on diplomacy and avoid any action that could be perceived as an invasion of that country's sovereignty?","241":"I guess if you have a cat and it gets bored, it might enjoy it. But remember to use it safely for the cat's eyes. Make sure you never leave the laser on continuously and let the cat rest occasionally.","242":"Explainer: Yes, that's correct. While both emit light, a flashlight shines light in a wide area, making it great for lighting up larger spaces or a specific object. On the other hand, a laser produces a very narrow, focused beam of light, making it more concentrated and perfect for tasks that require a precise point of light, like pointing to things or even some scientific experiments.","243":"The universe is infinitely large and everything in it is constantly changing. So, while we may think something is the same as it was before, it isn't really. That's the nature of the universe.","244":"So, we can use a laser as a sort of makeshift invisible eye to see around corners that we wouldn't be able to with the naked eye.","245":"And this is actually a structure that holds the DNA in our cells, that contains the instructions for building and maintaining our body, called the nucleus.","246":"Well, that red light is generally a sign that the object is being blocked or there's an obstruction. It's a safety feature to prevent collisions or damage.","247":"You might find it interesting to dive deeper into side channel analysis. For instance, you could explore Fault Injection Attacks, which are a type of side channel attack, or even implement your own version of Rowhammer to gain a better understanding of the concepts.","248":"Explainee: Well, if you don't have wired connections available, then you'd need to invest in a wireless router or extender depending on your house layout. You'd also have to make sure it's compatible with your device's wireless standards, which could involve an additional cost.","249":"So, imagine a scenario where you buy a property, but you're not allowed to inspect the inside of your own house. Seems outrageous, right? The same principle applies here to vehicles. If inspection rights are infringed, it can lead to hidden issues such as accidents waiting to happen, or even fraud.","250":"Would you still do it, knowing that it's illegal?","251":"Banks can be considered as middlemen because they act as intermediaries between the savers (depositors) and the borrowers (investors). Essentially, banks collect deposits from savers and lend it out to borrowers at a profit.","252":"It works by using a system called blockchain. Blockchain is a type of database that stores information in blocks, each block being linked to the one before and after it. This creates a chain of blocks that is very difficult to alter, acting as a record that everyone involved in the transaction can trust. In this way, it removes the need for intermediaries such as banks and brokers who traditionally ensure trust in a trade.","253":"Well, the network maintains security by using a complex mathematical algorithm to verify each transaction. Additionally, once a transaction is verified, it is added to the blockchain and becomes extremely difficult to change. Furthermore, each block in the chain contains a unique code called a hash, and if one block is altered, all the subsequent blocks are also affected, making it detectable. This method ensures a high level of security and transparency.","254":"That sounds interesting! Could you explain more about what the three, two program for biomedical engineering is and how it relates to your majors?","255":"That's great to hear! Lasers can provide an excellent opportunity to apply physics concepts to real-world problems. In fact, we can start by discussing the fundamental principles of how a laser works. Basically, a laser is a device that amplifies light through the process of stimulated emission. This process involves an energy level diagram associated with the photons and atoms involved, but we can delve deeper into that later in our discussion. Do you have any specific questions about lasers or their applications you're interested in exploring?","256":"So thependant is a special device that acts as a mode locker. It synchronizes all the waves (colors) in the laser pulse, enabling them to peak simultaneously. This synchrony produces what is known as mode-locked laser pulses, which are much shorter than the pulses produced by a single color laser. These short pulses carry very high energy, making them useful in various applications such as laser surgery, short-pulse lasers, and laser spectroscopy.","257":"Since these tasks are repetitive, it would be more efficient if we could automate them. These tools would help do the work faster, more accurately, and free up more time for creative and strategic tasks.","258":"So, harmonization and reharmonization should start by removing unnecessary notes, especially if they clash with the essence of the melody or the key center. By clarifying and simplifying the harmony, the music gains more power and direction. It's like focusing a lens to bring the beauty into focus, enhancing the melody and making the chords resonate with the listener's soul.","259":"So, if we rearrange the F major triad, we can create the F minor triad, which would sound like this: \u266aF-minor verse could go something like: I was once deaf and now I hear, was silent but now I speak \u266a","260":"This is the fundamental frequency of the musical note F. Different notes have different fundamental frequencies.","261":"Is this the chords in a song or a theoretical progression? It seems quite complex. How are you planning to use these?","262":"I think the point I'm trying to make is that changing the tune or arrangement can sometimes change the emotion or feeling a song evokes.","263":"It's like the lights are dimmed because F major has a minor quality to it, giving a sad or melancholic feeling, in contrast to the bright, happy sound of A major.","264":"It's a representation of the connections between neurons in the brain, providing a comprehensive view of the brain's wiring.","265":"However, even if we could transfer all of your data into a computer, reproducing feelings and consciousness as they exist in a human brain would be extremely challenging. Computers lack the biological systems and complexity found in the human brain, which are essential for creating and experiencing emotions.","266":"I see where you're coming from. You're saying that while studying the anatomy of the brain gives us a good foundation, it doesn't fully account for the temporal dynamics and connectivity between different neurons and regions. This temporal order is crucial for understanding the actual functioning of the brain.","267":"Your thoughts and emotions, your memories and experiences, your sense of self - all these are part of what makes you unique as a human being, much more than just the physical activity in your brain.","268":"In fact, the prover is sharing a proof without providing any useful information to the verifier about the statement's origin or underlying logic. This is a crucial aspect of zero-knowledge proofs. ","269":"Exactly! In a zero-knowledge proof, the prover can demonstrate to the verifier that they know a value, or have some specific property, without divulging any information about the actual value or how they obtained it. The verifier can be confident that the prover is not lying, but doesn't learn any sensitive information in the process.","270":"you could use a messaging app.","271":"But in reality, string data types can be manipulated into numerical values in some cases, for example, when you use arithmetic operations on them.","272":"I want you to draw a circle with the radius 5, center at (3,4) on a graph paper.","273":"Yes, it's fascinating. What I'm particularly interested in is a specific type of memory known as long-term potentiation (LTP). It's a change in synaptic strength that's thought to underlie learning and memory at the cellular level. LTP is induced by high-frequency stimulation of the nerve impulses and it is the cellular basis of learning and memory. By understanding the underlying mechanisms of LTP, we can potentially develop new treatments for memory disorders such as Alzheimer's disease.","274":"Implicit memory refers to memories that are not brought to our conscious awareness. These memories are acquired via various forms of learning, such as classical conditioning and procedural learning. Examples include learning to ride a bike or remembering how to swim. Explicit memory, on the other hand, is consciously recallable information, such as facts, events, and personal experiences. This is the memory we traditionally think of when we talk about memorizing information.","275":"Yes, the connectivities that we're seeing using the FMRI in our studies are indeed different when we look at implicit and explicit memories. We often see more activity in the striatum in comparison to the hippocampus or the prefrontal cortex for skill learning tasks (which are implicit memory tasks). However, for forming episodic memories, we might typically see more activity in the hippocampus, but we also often observe activity in the prefrontal cortex as well.","276":"But what if the memories we form are not always accurate representations of the events that occurred? It's a question that was also explored by Proust in his novel, as it originally didn't feature the Madeleine at all. Instead, it was a cake soaked in tea that triggered the protagonist's childhood memories. This raises the intriguing possibility that our memories may be more influenced by subsequent events, and that our brains may fill in the gaps to create a cohesive narrative.","277":"It's fascinating how solving a seemingly complex problem in math can provide a sense of satisfaction. It's like solving a mystery or creating a work of art.","278":"If you knew, then you should be able to find it yourself. It's up to you.","279":"And I was correct.\n","280":"That would mean that even if the entity trying to authenticate is malicious, they wouldn't be able to learn any sensitive information about you, such as your email address or password. It would be a secure and private way to log in to services.","281":"It's like a number that is greater than any given number, regardless of how large. In other words, it's a value that keeps growing without ever reaching an end.","282":"The room that the new guest will stay in is the one that we've vacated after moving everyone else up. So, the room number of the new guest is actually 0, since by moving everyone up, we've made room '0' available.","283":"No, it would instead be infinity plus one (the number of guests) plus infinity (the number of rooms) which is still equal to infinity because of the counting principle, as the number of new guests (plus one) doesn't change the overall infinite number of rooms.","284":"Right. If we continue this pattern, we would be moving each guest from an odd numbered room into an even-numbered room that is two apart. So we would move the guest from room three into room five, and the guest from room five into room seven, and so on. This way, we can create an infinite number of new rooms, each one being twice the distance apart as the previous one.","285":"two times infinity, or infinity","286":"Infinity in mathematics is represented as a number that doesn't stop growing, it continues infinitely without any bound. This concept can be used to solve problems that involve large numbers or endless sequences.","287":"Robots need more than just coordinates. They need to learn to recognize and respond to different objects, environments, and situations. This might involve using computer vision, sensor data, and other techniques to train a machine learning model to help the robot make decisions based on its surroundings.","288":"Motion is one of the more complex things for a robot to learn, but it's not the most complicated. That would probably be understanding and interpreting natural language, as it's less structured and has a lot more variation compared to specific tasks such as motion.","289":"One possible way to accelerate the process of collecting data is by utilizing crowdsourcing. Instead of having a limited number of robots collect data, we can enlist humans, for example, through mobile apps, to help gather and label data, such as videos of daily activities or images of objects and environments that the robots need to understand. This way, we can generate large amounts of data quickly and create a more diverse dataset, as people from different cultures, backgrounds, and locations can contribute. Additionally, we can also simulate data collection in virtual environments, creating realistic scenarios and training the robot to respond accordingly. This not only helps overcome the challenge of data scarcity but also facilitates faster and more efficient development of perception-action systems.","290":"Well, common algorithms include Deep Learning and Reinforcement Learning. Deep Learning is a machine learning technique that uses artificial neural networks to model and solve complex problems, and in this context can be used for image and speech recognition. Reinforcement Learning, on the other hand, is a type of machine learning that allows a robot to learn through trial and error, by interacting with its environment and learning from the consequences of its actions.","291":"Yes, you're on the right track. A fractal is often defined as a set that exhibits self-similarity, which means that it can be divided into parts that are smaller versions of the whole. This self-similarity can occur at any level of magnification. Mathematically, fractals can be described using iterative functions, a process that repeats over and over, creating complex patterns. These iterative functions are often used to generate popular fractal images such as the Mandelbrot set you mentioned.","292":"Fractal dimension is a concept used to characterize the complexity of a fractal. It measures the extent to which a fractal occupies space in a way that is very different from that of Euclidean shapes, like circles and squares, which have a well-defined dimension. Informally, the fractal dimension can be thought of as the number of directions one can traverse to explore the structure of the fractal to an arbitrary scale. For example, a straight line has a fractal dimension of 1, while a two-dimensional square has a fractal dimension of 2, even though we normally think of both as having a dimension of 1. To calculate the fractal dimension, you'd typically use methods like box-counting, correlation dimension, or information dimension.","293":"Because it represents the three primary colors in the color wheel: red, green, and blue.","294":"Yes, you're right, the paper now has a third dimension because it's in a crumpled state having width, length, and height (depth). But when it's flat, we consider it as two dimensional because it only has width and length.","295":"Since the box I'm using to cover the line is the size of the line, and you said I would need two boxes to cover the line when it was cut in half once, now that it's cut in half again, I would need four boxes to cover the line.","296":null,"297":"And, as the coastline becomes more jagged, the number of boxes will grow faster, leading to a 'fractal' or infinite length, where the measurement changes with the scale of measurement.","298":"you can stack them more easily when you position the first cup upright and line up the wider part of the second cup with the bottom of the first cup. This is easier because it allows the second cup to fit securely on the first and reduces the need for too much balance or precision.","299":" Yes, pick up the package and drop it after the robot moves over here and opens the door.","300":"So, it doesn't have a specific location for the cup in mind, just the movement command.","301":"That's a picture, what kind of picture, I can't tell from here.","302":"So it can be both 0 and 1 at the same time","303":"They are a cryptographic protocol that allows one party (prover) to prove to another party (verifier) that they know a value x, without conveying any information apart from the fact they know the value x and x is indeed the correct value.","304":"Explainer: In a zero-knowledge proof, you could think of it in a way that I can assure you that the statement is true, even if I don't reveal the actual statement I'm proving. This is achieved by interacting with you in a manner where I perform a series of computations and reveal just enough information for you to be convinced of the truth of my claim, but not enough for you to understand how the proof works or what the original statement actually was.","305":null,"306":"If I show you the colors of all the countries, you would be very confident that I have colored them correctly.","307":"That's right! It saves time and effort. You don't have to find another one and re-input all the details.","308":"it's now a different type of colors or something similar to explain that the old color scheme is no longer applicable with the new colors as they've been changed.","309":"Zero-knowledge proofs are designed to structurally prove something without revealing the actual information or data being proven. They are theoretically more secure than traditional encryption methods, as they allow one party to prove to another that they know a value, without revealing the value itself. This makes them highly useful in scenarios where privacy is a concern, such as financial transactions or voting systems.","310":"It has been implemented in several countries for reducing air pollution. For example, in China and India, they have implemented various versions of cap and trade systems for controlling the emissions levels from factories.","311":"I agree that the philosophy of math can get quite fascinating. Here's a question for you: Can you think of a number greater than 1, and then subtract the number of planets in our solar system from it? Did you come up with a number? That's an example of an infinite set in the number line. Now, let's dive deeper into your thoughts about infinity.","312":"I often tell students that the continuum hypothesis is one of the major unsolved problems in mathematics, and it concerns the relationship between different sizes of infinite sets, specifically the sets of real numbers and the sets of points on a line. It's essentially asking whether there are any gaps or spaces in the distribution of the points on a line, or if every point can be accounted for by a set of real numbers without any gaps. This question has been debated by mathematicians for over a century, and despite numerous attempts to prove or disprove it, it remains unresolved.","313":"Did that make it your favorite day? Or did you have a favorite moment within that day?","314":"It could have possibly been teal, but you were also using a dark blue and a light blue towel around the pool area that day.","315":"Explainer: And that's exactly it! Over time, as new experiences and memories pile up, older memories get pushed further back in your brain, making them harder to access and more prone to being forgotten. It's like having a bookshelf that keeps filling up, eventually pushing some of the older books to the back where you might not find them as easily.","316":"You might remember that situation as vividly as you remember anything else, so that every time you encounter a sharp object in the future, you are aware of the potential danger and can take caution to avoid accidental injury.","317":"Right. You can only measure angles in terms of degrees. However, time and distance are the only direct measures of circles, such as circumference and diameter.","318":"Not necessarily, but some astronomical structures like the Mandelbrot set can resemble and exhibit fractal patterns. However, a planet or an asteroid is not self-similar enough across different scales to be categorized as a fractal. ","319":"So there's a bigger total distance travelled. But wait, let's make it even more detailed. What if we use pins that are so close together that we can't even measure any difference between the blue, white, and even closer pins? If we continue to measure the coastline with even closer pins, we'd see that the coastline keeps getting longer and longer as we zoom in further. This is a characteristic of fractals, where the length (or surface area, in the case of asteroids) seems to increase without a bound, no matter how much we try to measure it. This is known as the 'coastline paradox' or 'fractal dimension'.","320":null,"321":"Touch is a more abstract sense, as it involves contact and interaction with objects, other living beings, and the environment. It provides us with information about the texture, hardness, temperature, size, and shape of objects, among other things.","322":"So, you wouldn't be able to see what's deep underground with a magnifying glass, only the very shallow parts.","323":"I was initially fascinated by the potential of semiconductors and their role in various technologies, including solar panels. Later, I came across quantum computing and its advancements. My current interest in quantum sensing stems from a deep dive into quantum-related technologies, seeking innovative solutions and applications.","324":null,"325":"Yes, the closer you are, the higher your sensitivity. However, keep in mind that even a distance of a few nanometers can be challenging for traditional magnetic resonance methods. With the nitrogen-vacancy center, you can use a technique called Raman spectroscopy to read out the electron's spin state, which allows for better sensitivity to single electrons, even at larger distances.","326":"Correct. This is where decoherence comes into play. Decoherence is the loss of quantum coherence due to the interaction of a quantum system with its environment. In simpler terms, it's the process by which a quantum system loses its ability to exist in multiple states simultaneously, and it collapses into a single classical state. This happens when fluctuations in the environment cause the quantum system to interact with its surroundings, leading to the measurement-like collapse of the quantum superposition.","327":"It could be non-essential notifications, unwanted emails, irrelevant news articles, or distractions from the environment like background conversations, ringing phones, etc.","328":"Indeed, that's correct. Quantum computing is still in its early stages and the number of qubits that can be controlled effectively is indeed limited. However, the progress in this field is rapid, and it's not uncommon to hear about more complex systems being developed. For instance, IBM's Eagle processor has already implemented a quantum chip with 127 qubits. This number is expected to grow with continued advancements in technology.","329":"contributing to the field of AI and being able to share their unique perspectives and solutions to the table will lead to significant advancements.","330":null,"331":"A quantum system's instability during measurement, known as 'Quantum decoherence', affects the system's state and can lead to errors. Fault tolerance in quantum computing is essential to mitigate these errors and maintain the system's stability. That's the big deal about adding more qubits. It's not just about increasing the power of the computer, but also about finding ways to protect it from the unique faults and failures that occur in a quantum system.","332":"What is often misunderstood is that quantum computers are not meant to crack common encryption used in banks and financial institutions. The current encryption involves vast amounts of data that would require a quantum computer to be practically fault-tolerant and scalable, which at this stage is still in early development. Instead, the potential application of quantum computers lies in solving problems related to cryptography that are not feasible for classical computers, like factorizing large numbers or simulating complex chemical reactions. So, your bank account is safer than you think.","333":"Subdivision surfaces are an algorithm used to represent curved and smooth shapes in computer graphics. It uses recursive mathematical operations to approximate complex shapes using simpler ones. Instead of using triangles or polygons, subdivision surfaces consist of a collection of smaller quadrilaterals or triangles. They are used for modeling organic shapes such as human faces, animations, and to reduce the number of polygons in models without losing details.","334":"It depends on the complexity of the scene and the power of the computer or GPU, but for a simple animation, it could take a few seconds to a couple minutes, while for more complex scenes in a movie or video game, the rendering process could take hours or even days.","335":"ARPANET was a project started in the 1960s by the Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) of the US Department of Defense to create a wide-area networking system that could survive the loss of communication paths and provide secure communication. By the late 1970s, it was the backbone of what we now know as the internet.","336":"It would enable efficient use of network resources as data are broken down into small packets and routed independently. This way, if a particular circuit is congested or broken, the packets can be sent through other available circuits to reach their destination.","337":"is that a connectionless communication like Internet Protocol (IP) was used, specifically, because it allows for the unreliable delivery of packets that can find alternative routes if parts of the network fail, ensuring robustness and survivability.","338":"Yes, abstraction allows for the decoupling of complex details from the user, enabling them to focus on using and innovating with the infrastructure without needing to understand its intricacies.","339":"Yes, you're correct! The seven layers of the internet's communication model, or OSI model, serve as those keys. Each layer handles a specific aspect of the communication process, from the physical connection to the application level.","340":"That means it's an anarchist system, where decisions are made collectively, and there's no central authority governing.","341":"They get dropped in transit, during their travel process.","342":null,"343":"I'm working in the field of Artificial Intelligence, specifically on developing AI algorithms that can recognize and process complex images.","344":"Yes, I am. We are focusing on the spins of electrons, using this platform to observe their quantum behavior at room temperature.","345":"To make a sensor, it depends on the complexity of the sensor, but typically it takes several weeks to several months. As for the diamond, in a lab, it takes several months to several years to grow a diamond of significant size through the HPHT (High-Pressure High-Temperature) method. These processes don't involve putting energy into them. Rather, they are more about controlled chemical processes and physical conditions.","346":"So the nitrogen-vacancy centers in a diamond can be used to store a quantum bit (qubit) in a state of both 0 and 1 at the same time thanks to the property of superposition, which is fundamental to quantum computing.","347":"Yes, that's correct. You can think of it as using the quantum computer as a starting point and then measuring its state to see how it deviates from the ideal superposition when interacting with the environment. This difference can give you valuable information, hence the utility of quantum computers as sensors.","348":"Entanglement is a phenomenon where two particles become correlated in such a way that the state of one particle directly influences the state of the other, no matter how far apart they are. In the context of quantum sensors, you can use this property to create a more sensitive detector. Here's how it works: you prepare two quantum bits in a special entangled state. When you measure one of the quantum bits, the result of the measurement instantaneously collapses the state of the other, regardless of the distance between them. By measuring one of the quantum bits, you are effectively collapsing the state of the other, which can provide information about the environment the other quantum bit is interacting with. Therefore, you can use this entangled state to create a quantum sensor that is more sensitive since it can measure the effects of tiny changes in the environment.","349":null,"350":"And what subject are you studying that you need help with?","351":"And those local networks in turn connect to Wide Area Networks (WANs) - which are a lot like state roads in our analogy. WANs allow different cities to communicate with each other, and they even connect to larger networks like the national ones or even the international ones. These larger networks are similar to the Interstate Highway System, facilitating communication across great distances.","352":"We don't connect wirelessly for long distances like oceans, instead we have satellites for that. However, for shorter distances, wireless connections like Wi-Fi are common.","353":"Well, what happens is, when you search for a movie or a TV show on a streaming platform, a request is sent to their server. The server looks through its database and finds the file for the desired content. Then, it sends the file to you over the internet. Now, when you play the movie or the show, the streaming platform's server streams the content to you, meaning it gets sent piece by piece as you watch, not all at once. This is done to save server resources and ensure a smooth streaming experience for all users.","354":"Well, when you request to watch Vampire Diaries, your device sends a request to Netflix server. This server then checks its database and the internet connections available between it and your device, and sends the video content over the internet via the optimized route to your device, which then plays the content on your TV without getting scrambled up due to the optimization process.","355":"More precisely, a function is a rule or relationship that assigns a unique output to each input in its domain, and it can be represented by a graph, a formula, or a set of rules.","356":"In the realm of mathematics, we often use isomorphisms (or bijections) to establish that two infinite sets have the same structure. Essentially, when we say one set is isomorphic to another, we mean that we can pair up elements from both sets in such a way that the relationships between the pairs are preserved. This allows us to compare and analyze these infinite sets as if they were finite, making it possible to understand and reason about infinity.","357":"So to see this more clearly, try to show a one-to-one correspondence between the natural numbers and the integers. That is, find a way to match each natural number with a unique integer and vice versa. However, as you'll quickly realize, this is impossible, since there is no way to account for the negative integers with the natural numbers. Therefore, the integers have a larger cardinality than the natural numbers, and the two infinities are different sizes.","358":"But then we have a problem because there are still natural numbers left unmatched, like the number one. So, we can't say the natural numbers and integers have the same number of elements yet.","359":"Well actually, the pattern is that each even integer has its positive counterpart which is the next odd integer, and its negative counterpart which is the next odd integer minus two. For example, the next odd integer after four is five and the next odd integer minus two from zero is minus1. So for natural number four, the corresponding integers are two and minus two.","360":null,"361":"The real numbers, all the points on the number line, are still considered a countable infinity. This is because we can list out all the rational numbers and include 0 and 1, and then all the numbers between them. This can be done in a way that we can count every number explicitly. The irrational numbers that can't be put on this list are still considered uncountable, but they don't affect the overall countability of the real numbers because they are not directly included in our counting process.","362":null,"363":"Therefore, this new number is unique and has not been added to the list.","364":"So we have shown that the continuum hypothesis is independent of the Zermelo-Fraenkel axioms for set theory, meaning that it cannot be proven or disproven within the framework of these axioms. This result is a major achievement in set theory.","365":"One practical example is in the area of set theory, where it becomes important to distinguish between different infinities. For example, the set of real numbers can be shown to be larger than the set of natural numbers. This has implications for mathematical proofs, as some arguments that hold for the natural numbers may not necessarily hold for the set of real numbers due to the increased size of the latter. Another example is in the field of computer science, where finite states machines are often used to model computation. However, there are problems that can be solved by a Turing Machine, but are undecidable on a finite states machine. This is because a Turing Machine can simulate the behavior of an infinite set (such as the natural numbers) while a finite states machine cannot.","366":"Yes, it's essentially an educated guess. This is likely a quantum interference circuit, a key component in quantum computers, responsible for performing specific calculations based on the quantum states.","367":"They work by generating opposite signals that are 180 degrees out of phase to the ambient noise. These signals cancel out the noise, leaving only the desired audio on the headphones.","368":"When programming, quantum computing would require a different approach as it deals with qubits instead of classical bits. You would need to account for superposition and entanglement. Moreover, algorithms designed for classical computers may not directly apply to quantum computing; new algorithms, such as quantum algorithms for optimisation and factorisation, may need to be employed.","369":"Yes, a black hole is a region in outer space where the gravitational pull is so strong that nothing, including light, can escape from it.","370":"That's not weight, but volume. To find that, I need to know its length, width, and height if it's a three-dimensional object. If it's two-dimensional, I need its length and width.","371":"It's called gravitational pull. The black hole has such a strong gravity that it bends the path of the light towards it. The light tries to move in a straight line, but the black hole's gravity bends its path, making it fall in, even though the black hole itself may still be some distance away.","372":" It's a function that returns a specific element from a set when given a particular condition or index.","373":"Okay, then let me explain you another form. The Zermelo-K\u00f6nig Lemma states that if S is a non-empty set and every element of S has a subset in S, then S has an element with no proper subsets in S. That is, there is a maximal element, an element that is not in any larger set in S. Now, do you think this lemma is true?","374":"Explainee: So it's almost like creating a box within our set theory world where everything resides until we reach that limit. Anything that has a cardinality greater than the inaccessible cardinal is deemed out of bounds and not accessible to us. By keeping such entities outside of our category, we can make our mathematics rigorous and consistent without worrying about things we don't understand.","375":"So you'd ideally want a solution that scales efficiently, handling an increasing number of devices without significant additional cost or management overhead, leveraging the small data requirements of IoT devices.","376":"So, if we consider that Arduino device, even with a small payload of raw temperature and timestamp, it may be on the order of a few bytes per transmission. Therefore, the wireless communication link between the sensor and the gateway might need to manage data rates in the order of bits per second, possibly less than kilobits per second.","377":"Perhaps we can approach them and discuss the potential collaboration, explaining the benefits of such research and potential solutions that could mitigate the negative effects of rush hour traffic on the acoustic landscape. If they see the value in the research, they might be more inclined to share their data.","378":"For example, if you know that it's going to rain tomorrow morning, that is a predictability. Or if you know that a certain stock will go up or down because of a certain event, that is also a predictability.","379":"Some people might struggle to understand the data and translate it into knowledge","380":"is that once a transaction is validated, it is added to the block and the hash of the previous block is updated to the hash of the new block. This creates an unbreakable chain of transactions known as a blockchain. Any alterations made to previous blocks would require recalculating the entire subsequent chain of blocks, which would consume a tremendous amount of computational power.","381":null,"382":"That depends on your studies. From the information I have, the Large Magellanic Cloud has a supermassive black hole, but I'm not sure if your research has found any data on it.","383":"I have been hearing more evidence pointing towards the existence of super massive black holes at the centers of many galaxies. Recent gravitational wave observations suggest that they are indeed present in massive quantities.","384":"Well, it's not just star collapse. Black holes can also form from supernova explosions where the remnants of a massive star are compressed into a very small area.","385":"That's correct! They are all friends in the sense that they all attract each other due to gravitational force.","386":"...and that will form an enormous elliptical galaxy, creating waves and ripples of cosmic proportions, potentially impacting many other objects in the universe.","387":"Yeah, exactly! It would become our new sun, a supermassive black hole, pulling everything in its gravitational sphere into a much smaller orbit than the current one. This new 'system' would be much more densely packed compared to the solar system we know today, but still intact.","388":"Yes, we recently discovered that these electronic circuits generated by the movement of the neutron star can be harnessed to power interstellar travel. This finding could potentially revolutionize the way we think about space exploration and propulsion systems. It's an exciting time for black hole research, indeed.","389":"Also, the amount of data used for training and the need for fine-tuning can significantly influence the training period. In some cases, a larger dataset may require more time to train even on a faster computational environment. Fine-tuning, which involves adjusting the weights and biases of the model, can also add to the overall training time.","390":"Quantum computers could potentially solve complex problems in machine learning faster than classical computers, by using quantum bits or qubits simultaneously rather than sequentially. This could lead to significant speed-ups for certain machine learning tasks, such as optimization and pattern recognition.","391":"Well, in a quantum computer, we use qubits instead of bits. A qubit can exist in a superposition of states, meaning it can be both 0 and 1 at the same time. This is due to a property called quantum superposition. When we want to perform operations, we use quantum gates. Unlike classical gates that change a binary value from 0 to 1 or vice versa, quantum gates perform operations on the quantum state vector of the qubits, manipulating their superposition in complex ways. The famous example is the Quantum NOT gate or X gate, which flips the state of a qubit from 0 to 1 or from 1 to 0, but it operates in a superpositioned state, effectively performing multiple NOT operations at once due to the principle of quantum parallelism.","392":"So, you can have the spin in a superposition state where it is both up and down simultaneously, until measured. This is one of the unique properties of quantum systems, the ability to exist in multiple states at once.","393":"Well, we use quantum bits or qubits, which can exist in both 0 and 1 states at the same time. We initialize these qubits to either a 0 or a 1, and this forms the basis of our quantum encoding.","394":"In other words, for the same inputs, the same output should always be produced.","395":"so these near-term friendly quantum algorithms are designed in such a way that they can run on noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices or NISQ computers. These algorithms have to be resilient to the errors that come from the noise in the system, and the major examples of these algorithms are quantum approximation algorithms like quantum linear systems solvers and quantum chemistry simulations.","396":" But, currently, the major obstacle is that quantum computers are prone to errors, and we need to correct them to perform complex tasks. Quantum error correction techniques are still under development, and we're quite far from having millions of error-corrected qubits. As of now, the quantum computers we have are able to handle around 50 error-corrected qubits, which is quite an achievement considering the technology's infancy. This limited capacity means that we can't yet realize the full potential of quantum computers for solving certain problems, such as simulating complicated molecular systems or optimizing complex logistics networks.","397":"It's difficult to create a universal solution for robots that can handle varying food types, due to differences in shape, texture, size, and how they deform during scooping. This requires developing adaptive strategies for each food type or using advanced machine learning techniques to handle such variability.","398":"One promising direction is to incorporate sensor noise, frictional forces, and other real-world factors into simulations to better mimic the physical properties and uncertainties of real-world environments. Additionally, experimenting with a variety of robot designs, such as using more flexible materials in the manipulators, could help to create simulations that better reflect the behavior of real-world robots. Further collaboration with experts in control theory and machine learning can also help in optimizing and generalizing simulated manipulation strategies to fit the demands of real-world applications.","399":"They're a popular and fascinating topic in mathematics, where we find repeating patterns that display at every level, no matter how much we zoom in or out!","400":"That's where machine learning comes in. They use a dataset of labeled images of trees, where each image is given a name 'tree' and they show these labeled images to the computer. The computer learns how the pixels of a tree image are different from other types of images and gradually learns to recognize the characteristics of a tree by itself.","401":"If this branch is a tree, then we can apply the same rule to its branches, resulting in smaller branches that split into smaller branches, and so on.","402":"I don't think I could handle that, that's an overwhelming amount of work.","403":"you'd want to learn a specific programming language like Python or Processing, which have libraries designed for creating fractals.","404":"How have you been?","405":null,"406":null,"407":"That's true. Encryption can help maintain privacy to some extent, but it doesn't guarantee complete anonymity. Governments and other entities can still employ various methods such as traffic analysis, network forensics, or international cooperation to gather information about internet activities.","408":null,"409":"And the challenge lies in creating a seamless integration among these technologies, ensuring low latency, high reliability, and robust security protocols, especially when real-time decision making is crucial and potential safety concerns exist.","410":"A black hole is an object in space with immense gravity that sucks in anything near it, including stars and dust. It is formed when a massive star collapses at the end of its lifetime.","411":"And the remaining core, which keeps collapsing, is what we call a black hole. As you've mentioned, it possesses such a strong gravitational pull that not even light can escape past the event horizon. This is the defining characteristic of a black hole.","412":"A Schwarzschild black hole is static while a Kerr black hole rotates. A star that collapses won't be perfectly spherically symmetric, so it will generally form a Kerr black hole with some spin. However, it's important to note that black holes can lose or gain angular momentum over time, so their rotation can change. As for what's more common, observations suggest that most black holes in the universe have some degree of rotation, though the exact percentage remains unknown.","413":"Well, the idea was that if we could understand how quantum effects work in strong gravitational fields, they would prevent the star from collapsing all the way down to a singularity. So, instead of a singularity, we might have something like a quantum state called a 'Planck star' which would be stable and not have the problematic characteristics of the singularity.","414":"Yes, basically the mathematics, specifically Einstein's theory of general relativity, tells us that if you cross the event horizon of a black hole, there's no way out from the gravitational pull. You will be sucked in and your matter will eventually reach the singularity. However, we're not able to observe the singularity itself and are still uncertain about what lies at the core. That's a question for future research and maybe, one day, astronomers will find more evidence or potentially an alternative theory explaining the situation.","415":"Hawking proposed the theory of black hole thermodynamics and a mechanism for black hole radiation which became known as Hawking radiation. This radiation is considered to be a consequence of quantum effects near the event horizon of a black hole.","416":"That's a fascinating perspective! It seems we could potentially detect quantum gravitational waves, ripples in spacetime, during such a merger event. These waves could carry information about the mysterious quantum nature of gravity, if detected accurately.","417":"Zero-knowledge proofs are indeed a crucial component of multi-party computation. In essence, multi-party computation allows multiple parties to collaborate on a computation without revealing their private data, which can be sensitive. Zero-knowledge proofs contribute to this by enabling parties to prove to each other that they possess a certain piece of data or have performed a specific computation, without actually revealing the data or the computation itself.","418":"Well, in this scenario, you're not trying to predict an outcome or follow a specific pattern. Instead, you're generating variations or exploring different possibilities. This randomness allows for novelty and diversity, which can be beneficial in situations like artistic creation, AI modeling, or even scientific research where the goal is to discover new solutions or ideas.","419":"Cloud computing, with its scalability and flexibility, can efficiently manage the computational resources required for zero-knowledge proofs. This could be a significant step towards enhancing the security and privacy of data sharing in various applications.","420":null,"421":"So when you return home from vacation, that good memory of the delicious orange juice might cause you to seek out better tasting orange juice and have more positive feelings about it compared to before you went on vacation.","422":"That's a great choice, Dylan! Now, let me tell you something interesting \u2014 researchers have found that our brains remember enjoyable experiences, such as enjoying a treat like pixie sticks, more vividly than the neutral or negative ones. The region responsible for this in our brain is called the amyggdala. When it comes to rewarding experiences, like eating your favorite candy, the amyggdala lights up, triggering the release of dopamine, the 'feel-good' neurotransmitter. So, it makes sense that you remember pixie sticks fondly!","423":"So the uncertainty and confusion can make the decision-making process more difficult and stressful, leading to the feeling of regret or doubt about the choice made.","424":"Well, your likes and dislikes can change over time due to various factors such as personal growth, new experiences, and even social influences. For instance, as you try more new candies, your preferences might shift, and you might discover a new favorite. Or, you might find that you appreciate a candy you initially disliked, like perhaps a candy you didn't like as a child but enjoy now as an adult. It's all part of how our tastes and preferences evolve as we grow and mature.","425":"It's a global system of computer networks that connects various devices and enables data sharing, communication, and access to resources like websites and applications.","426":"Really? That's interesting! 'Matilda' is such an iconic and unique film. It's fascinating how it blends elements of comedy, tragedy, and magic in a children's movie. Do you have any specific scenes or characters that you particularly enjoy or find memorable?","427":"and finally reach the destination here (where the video is supposed to be, as determined by the receiver)","428":"Exactly! The shortest path is often the fastest way, but sometimes a path may be slow or unreliable due to heavy traffic, server issues, or other factors. In such cases, having alternatives can help ensure the message or data reaches its destination efficiently.","429":"That's a type of vegetable.","430":"I agree, that's an interesting perspective. In terms of a circuit, a mental model could be represented as a recursive neural network, with each node representing a concept, idea, or potential outcome. The connections between nodes could then represent the relationships between these concepts. The strength of these connections can be adjusted based on learning and experience, and can help make predictions about future events or actions.","431":"And it's fascinating to consider the idea that our individual cognitive maps, the mental representations we create, might be influenced by our personal experiences, cultural background, or even our individual personality traits. This could explain why some people might find it easier to remember certain details about a place, or why they might react differently to similar environments. This complexity adds another layer to the connection between spatial processing and memory, as it suggests that the way we remember and navigate spaces is not a one-size-fits-all process, but a deeply personal and unique experience.","432":"It's fascinating that you brought up the concept of deleting or modifying information from our mental models. That's absolutely correct and it ties in with the idea of cognitive loading. When our mental models become too complex, too convoluted, or no longer serve our needs effectively, we often need to simplify them, discard some information, or reframe our understanding of certain facts. This process of modifying our mental models is crucial for adaptation and growth. It allows us to learn from our experiences and adapt to new circumstances, much like how we might rearrange the furniture in a room to make it more practical or comfortable.","433":"So it's like how data, when processed through the model, can generate new insights and predictions, much akin to how human memories enable us to think in creative and unanticipated ways. The better our models capture the essence of reality, the more accurately they can mimic the process of memory recovery, filling in the gaps with plausible details instead of storing every single detail as a separate memory.","434":null,"435":"Well, the LIGO scientists use very complex mathematical models to analyze the signals they detect. These models help in identifying the unique 'fingerprint' of gravitational waves produced by specific astronomical events such as the collision of black holes or neutron stars. By comparing the detected signal with these models, they can confidently determine the origin of the gravitational wave.","436":"I've brought the report you asked for. Let's discuss it.","437":"But in the case of robots, this assumption often leads to overestimation of their capabilities. We need to be more cautious and understand that robots lack human-like social cognition and understanding of the world around them. They can't generalize their actions or respond to stimuli like humans. It's important to recognize these limitations and not project human-like agency on robots, as doing so can lead to incorrect assumptions about their abilities.","438":"Right, so I would associate the more basic tasks like driving or recognizing a face as lower level tasks, since they are mostly reflexive and require little cognitive processing. On the other hand, activities like playing chess or solving mathematical problems would be considered higher level tasks due to their dependency on memory, strategy, and analytical skills.","439":"Wow, that sounds fascinating! Can you elaborate on what specific types of social stimuli you plan to focus on and what factors, such as emotions or personality traits, you think will influence our judgements?","440":"I was just wondering, how do you think memory is integrated into those perceptions and social judgments? Are they memories of previous experiences or more like learned behaviors?","441":"Well, in that context, what you're describing is indeed related to what we refer to as affective or emotional memory. This is a type of long-term memory that stores emotional or affective responses to stimuli, which play a significant role in our decisions, behavior, and emotions. It's crucial in situations where positive emotions are involved, as these are typically more subjective and less consistent across individuals, due to factors like personal experiences, cultural background, and the like.","442":"So, my research suggests that the way our brain encodes emotional responses during an event plays a crucial role in how we recall and process those memories later on. This is particularly important in understanding various forms of trauma and memory disorders, where the emotional response may be heightened or suppressed, leading to distorted recall or even repressed memories.","443":"Well, based on the new connections we've discovered between memory and decision-making, we're now wondering if there's a common mechanism underlying both these processes. This questions will help us understand how our brain makes decisions, and maybe this can help in diagnosing and treating disorders like addiction or schizophrenia.","444":null,"445":"Show me an image of a cat and ask the chat model to identify what it is.","446":"And now, I'd like you to do it again, but this time try to pick it up faster than before.","447":"Also, try to point the laser into the light bulb as accurately as possible without opening your eyes. Let's see if you can reach the bulb using your sense of hearing this time.","448":"From the sound it made, when you dropped it, you would know it hit the ground. So I'd say, as you continue to practice this skill, you'll develop the ability to not only identify the sound it makes when it's in the air but also when it hits the ground.","449":"No, robots lack the ability to understand or feel emotions such as guilt or embarrassment. They don't have consciousness or self-awareness, so they don't 'know' they've made a mistake in the way humans do.","450":"The feedback could be positive (reward) or negative (punishment) depending on whether the task is done correctly or not. For example, if the robot successfully picks up an object, a positive reinforcement (reward) is given. If it fails, a negative reinforcement (punishment) is given.","451":"Well, a robot doesn't see like humans do. Instead, it uses sensors and its programming to interpret information from its environment. For example, a robot that's designed to navigate a room might use cameras and distance sensors to detect walls and obstacles. This information is then processed through its software to guide its movements.","452":"It's not productive to speculate about such scenarios. What's important is how we program and use robots. They are tools created by humans, and they will remain that way. We should focus on ensuring that these tools are used ethically, safely, and responsibly.","453":"That's the magic of computational creativity. With a little bit of code and a lot of imagination, even a child can create complex, abstract patterns that would take hours for a mathematician to plot by hand.","454":"To illustrate further, imagine a tree with branches. The branches, the twigs, and even the smallest leaves have a similar structure, repeating the pattern of the tree as a whole. This pattern in nature, when mathematically modeled, is called a fractal. So, a fractal is essentially a shape, or pattern, that can be infinitely repeated and displays detail at any scale!","455":"And I implemented the same concept in my computer program using mathematical equations to simulate the folding of fluid and create turbulence.","456":"That's when we can leverage technology for efficient scaling of our ideas and businesses.","457":"What about incorporating elements of social interaction and realistic textures\/dynamics to enhance the experience and reduce the loneliness?","458":"If Bob Ross made paintings in reality, I think he'd be proud of Ken using the same philosophy of simplicity and enjoyment in creating digital art.","459":null,"460":null,"461":"If they are all visible to you, then it suggests that the number is not infinite since infinite sets are impossible to see all elements at once. However, it doesn't necessarily mean it's a finite number, as it could still be an extremely large yet countable number. To confirm, we'd need more information about the exact context or the nature of the objects you are referring to.","462":"We can't fit infinitely many jars in any space, no matter how large, because there's always one more to fit after filling up the space as many times as we can.","463":"So, you might be referring to the idea that something being unlimited implies there are no boundaries or limitations, so it could exist in any space or dimension, extending infinitely in all directions.","464":"I have the same problem too.

So, when you tell your friends about it, they might say 'Quantum computing, really? That sounds crazy!' or something like that.","467":"So if we were to make predictions before measuring, they would always be the same.

it comes to amphetamines, their primary effect is to stimulate the wakefulness system. In the short term, they can help promote wakefulness, although the long-term consequences can be quite different. Over time, chronic use of amphetamines can result in disruption of the normal sleep-wake cycle and potentially lead to insomnia, sleep disorders, and poor sleep quality as the body becomes accustomed to the drug's action. In essence, the body may become dependent on amphetamines to remain awake, making it more challenging to fall and stay asleep without them. This can ultimately compromise the quality of sleep over the long run.","3":"The impact of amphetamines on different stages of the sleep cycle is not yet fully understood. Most studies suggest that amphetamine use delays the onset of REM sleep but offers less consensus about its effects on other stages of sleep and the transitions between them. The precise manner in which amphetamines disrupt sleep architecture remains to be further explored.","4":null,"5":"While quantum mechanics might seem intimidating, there's a variety of resources designed to make its key principles accessible and engaging for the non-physicist.","6":"Given your life's journey, could you share some insights as to how it has steered your musical choices and decisions throughout your career?

A potential approach could involve prioritizing essential expenses, identifying areas where saving could be achieved, and perhaps even considering income-generating activities to supplement your budget if necessary.","10":"Yes, that's a wonderful way to put it. The melody is like a journey, pulling us towards the resolution. Even as we arrive at the base note, it feels like we've only reached the end of our journey because that's where the melody naturally leads us, as if we've been there all along.","11":"I didn't realize that! Amazing Grace is often used during poignant and reflective moments like funerals because of its peaceful and comforting qualities.","12":"Actually, 'Amazing Grace' is a well-known hymn with deep historical roots in Christianity. While it's still widely popular in religious contexts, it's also embraced in secular environments due to its evocative melody and moving lyrics. If you haven't listened to it yet, I'd highly recommend it. It's a piece that transcends religious boundaries and captivates listeners with its emotional resonance.","13":"It appears that you found the sound quality of this option more pleasant compared to the alternatives.

It's a harmonious blend of hardware advancements, ingenious game design, and refined network capabilities that all work together to deliver a swift response, creating a more captivating and immersive gaming experience.","16":"Machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence that allows machines to learn and improve from data, without being explicitly programmed. It involves various algorithms for making decisions or predictions based on patterns in the data.","17":"Perhaps a machine could identify factors such as the tempo, musical key, dissonance, lyrics, and their emotional undertones. It might also be trained on samples of music labeled as 'creepy' to learn to recognize these characteristics. Furthermore, it could consider ambient factors like the volume and the suddenness of changes in the music as contributing to the 'creepy vibe'.","18":"Indeed, in terms of their extreme density, it results in a teaspoon-full having a staggering weight of approximately a billion tons on Earth.","19":"That's interesting! Once a neutron star's mass goes beyond the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff limit, a fascinating chain of events occurs. If the mass exceeds this limit, gravity becomes so intense that the neutron star collapses into a black hole.","20":"As per our current understanding, we cannot say for certain what's inside a black hole because once the event horizon is crossed, it becomes a place beyond our observable universe. It doesn't emit any light or radiation, so it remains a region of unknown phenomena.","21":"Explainee: Gravitational waves could potentially reveal significant information about the properties of black holes, such as their internal structure and components, as the waves emitted during a black hole merger could contain valuable data.","22":"The event you're referring to is a solar eclipse. It's a fascinating astronomical event where the moon passes between the Earth and the Sun, obscuring the Sun's light.","23":"If you prefer a computational approach to math and physics problems, you'd likely find yourself in the realm of computer science and data science. With these skills, you can create simulations, design algorithms, and develop various tools to tackle complex physics issues. These disciplines can further assist in data analysis, interpretation, and visualization for physics research.","24":"Since having four dimensions, it can be imagined as having length, width, and height, along with an extra dimension which could be either time or another spatial axis, contingent on the specific theoretical perspective.","25":"Moving around in space means moving through time as well, since space and time are connected. So, a motion in space, say (x, y, z), involves an progress in time denoted by t. In simple terms, a path (x(t), y(t), z(t)) represents moving in space and takes the duration of t. This is the essence of spacetime. If there was a world where movements in space didn't influence time or vice versa, the notion of spacetime wouldn't carry as much weight. However, with Einstein's discoveries in relativity, we now understand that the manner we perceive the distinction between space and time (and therefore spacetime) varies for different observers. Moreover, space and time can be seen as distinct aspects of the same 4-dimensional spacetime \u2013 a concept that generalizes the 3-dimensional space we routinely encounter.","26":null,"27":null,"28":"On a cosmic scale, I could travel at speeds near the speed of light, make a U-turn, and, theoretically, move backward in time. This is the kind of time travel you're likely envisioning.","29":null,"30":"So given Einstein's Theory of Relativity, each individual experiences time differently due to their motion through the universe.","31":"When someone moves very fast, like zooming out, time doesn't pass as quickly for them as it does for those who stay still. This effect is called time dilation, and it means that the moving person's time moves slower. As a result, it can seem like less time has passed for the moving person compared to the stationary one.","32":"In a dictionary, a string as a key will be converted to lower case (so 'Key' transforms to 'key'). However, in a set, the order of elements is not defined, and each unique element is considered distinct regardless of its case, so both 'Key' and 'key' would be treated as separate items.","33":null,"34":null,"35":"So, to create harmony, we're weaving melody with emotions, while collecting new experiences and knowledge throughout the journey, ultimately learning something meaningful.","36":"That sounds like a fantastic decision! I'm really curious, what made you choose this particular direction?","37":"Imagine the extra dimensions as a grand stage where the fundamental particles, akin to actors, perform their roles. They can dance across these dimensions, with an electron being no different than a playful performer venturing beyond the fourth wall and taking strides on unseen stages that seem to be outside the theater. This concept could potentially provide insights into the fundamental forces and some of the universe's most challenging enigmas.","38":"Maybe the compactification mechanisms or symmetry breaking in string theory are what causes the extra dimensions to be hidden at a Planck scale. This could be an crucial aspect to understand as it helps explain why our observable universe resembles the one we experience.","39":null,"40":null,"41":"A black brane is essentially a higher-dimensional version of a black hole, referred to as 'P-brane,' because it has more dimensions (P dimensions). These extra dimensions can be part of the brane itself, as opposed to being perpendicular to the original four dimensions. It's like a membrane in a higher dimensional space-time.","42":"So, you're right. For branes in de Sitter space, our focus is on black branes with a distinct characteristic: a stable, non-singular core that isn't an anti-de Sitter spacetime, unlike their counterparts in anti-de Sitter space. Instead, the core is compactified. ","43":"That's correct. Due to their lower action compared to the other options in the transverse dimensions, solutions with a negative cosmological constant (adS space) are the preferred choices.","44":"Quantum events? Buckle up, it's about to get interesting!","45":"The Dialogues is an engaging, beautifully illustrated journey through advanced physics and cosmology. It covers topics like the Big Bang, dark matter, dark energy, and the theory of everything. It's an accessible and captivating exploration of how spacetime can emerge from quantum mechanics.","46":"Gravity keeps us on the ground, it's the force that attracts us to the Earth.","47":"In space, you'd float due to the absence of gravity. A spaceship provides artificial gravity to keep you in place, and if it's orbiting the Earth, it maintains a balanced force to keep you in a circular path around Earth.","48":"Sure! I'll try to make that out. Can you see me now without me having to wave my hand or you needing to turn your eyes?","49":null,"50":"In that case, a focused high-intensity laser would be ideal. This laser generates heat through a process called photothermal ablation, which causes the cell to heat up rapidly and eventually destroy it. The advantage of this method is that it can be targeted precisely, minimizing damage to the surrounding healthy cells.","51":"From a holistic approach, I'd emphasize that it's crucial to balance technical advancements with artistic exploration in virtual reality. In addition to fostering presence and self-perception, we can delve deeper into building emotionally resonant and engaging narratives. This form of immersive and interactive storytelling can foster empathy and understanding among users, making them active protagonists in their own narratives, shaping outcomes and living through the emotional arc of the story.","52":"That's precisely what I'm conveying. The Life of Us project you brought up encapsulates my thoughts perfectly. By embracing a lower-poly aesthetic and simple vertex shading, it creates a more captivating and magical adventure, allowing you to feel more at ease and immersed in the non-photo-realistic space.","53":"A dimension can be defined as the number of distinct and measurable traits that describe a specific object or concept. In our everyday world, we typically deal with three dimensions: length, width, and height (or depth). However, in advanced theories like string and superstring theory, there might be more dimensions. In fact, you've already mentioned one such example, 4 dimensions. Additional dimensions are proposed to exist, such as seven, nine, ten, or more, but these would be compactified on a very small scale and are not directly perceivable in our world.","54":"Perhaps try holding one in front of you horizontally, another vertically to the right, and the third vertically to the left, creating a right-angled triangle.","55":"Absolutely! In addition to the traditional Cartesian coordinate system, there's another system called spherical coordinate system. This system uses radius, theta, and phi to better describe points in three dimensions, as opposed to x, y, and z.","56":"That's correct to think in terms of extra dimensions, but in the context of the discussion, we are primarily considering additional spatial dimensions, not extensions of time. Some theoretical models of physics do propose other spatial dimensions beyond the three we are familiar with, but they are still largely speculative.","57":"In astronomy, we use coordinates similar to latitude and longitude, but they're for the sky. The declination, like latitude, describes a position along a north-south line, called a meridian, on the celestial sphere.

This intricate web of connections serves as the foundation for our most remarkable abilities: thought, learning, and memory.","222":"Absolutely! Gmail does use machine learning to sort and categorize emails. It learns to predict a likely label for a new email by analyzing the content and patterns of previous emails you've received. This process is often referred to as 'training' the machine learning model.","223":"But a model would consider more than just keywords or previous communication. It takes into account factors like the context, sender's reputation, and the time of day to determine if an email is spam.","224":"Absolutely, one scenario where deep learning would be preferred over reinforcement learning is in handling complex datasets, especially those involving multi-dimensional data like images, speech, or text. Deep learning algorithms can recognize patterns and extract features from these datasets automatically, making them ideal for tasks such as image classification, speech recognition, and text analysis. Conversely, reinforcement learning is optimal for sequential decision making tasks in dynamic environments where an agent learns to maximize a reward. For instance, game playing, robotics, and autonomous driving are fields where reinforcement learning excels.","225":"Indeed, that could be a case of linear regression. The model may accurately predict customer churn, but the issue lies in not knowing the specific reasons for customers intending to leave the service. Without this understanding, it's hard to target the right solutions to prevent churn, making the prediction less actionable.","226":"Building machine learning algorithms that are not only accurate, but also interpretable and explainable can be key to improving their performance. This means creating systems that not only predict outcomes, but also elucidate the factors contributing to these predictions.","227":"We would miss out on a lot of important details if we solely focused on the wiring diagram of the brain, without considering factors like myelination, glial cells, and the environment that neurons and axons reside in, resulting in an incomplete comprehension of the brain.","228":"Well, in a way, you're right.

They could focus their efforts on exploring and developing cutting-edge technology geared towards reaching these impressive acceleration rates, potentially leading to remarkable advancements in the field.","234":"Absolutely, you've got it right. The key here is coordinating the laser pulses so they behave as a unified source. This coordination is achieved through an intricate process known as phase locking, which synchronizes all the lasers involved. This is all thanks to advanced control systems, electronic devices, and feedback loops that keep the lasers in sync. As these synchronized lasers travel through different optical components, their combined energy can reach remarkable levels, potentially reaching an exawatt.","235":null,"236":"Yes, your understanding is correct. Hackers often seize opportunities from overlooked security weaknesses, which include devices like deli scales in scenarios such as this one. Although it was connected to the network for simplicity, it appears that the deli scale was not adequately protected, making it an easy entrance point for the attackers. From this vantage point, they could potentially move unseen, escalating the damage inflicted.","237":"Buffer overflow is a type of security vulnerability where a program or system stores more data in a buffer than it was designed to hold, causing the buffer to overflow and potentially overwriting adjacent memory space. This can lead to unauthorized access, data corruption, and system crashes. In our context, an attacker can exploit buffer overflow vulnerabilities to gain access to other systems connected in a network.","238":"Sure, in C programming, a segmentation fault occurs when the program attempts to access memory it hasn't been allocated or goes beyond the boundaries of an array.

A flashlight, like the one you might have at home, shines light over a wide area. It's excellent for illuminating larger spaces or focusing on a particular object. On the contrary, a laser, such as the one I brought, produces a highly focused beam. Its intense, narrow light is ideal for tasks requiring pinpoint accuracy, like pointing to specific objects or even for some scientific experiments.","243":"It's truly remarkable, isn't it? The universe, vastly endless and in a state of perpetual transformation, makes everything we perceive as constant an illusion. For everything that was, is not exactly the same as it once was.

This frees up valuable time for more creative and strategic tasks, fostering innovation and productivity.","258":"So, harmonization and reharmonization should start by removing unnecessary notes, especially if they contradict the melody or the key center. By simplifying the harmony, the music becomes more focused and powerful, making the chords harmonize with the listener's emotions.","259":"Instead, let's alter the F major triad to create the F minor variant. This could potentially result in a verse like: 'I was once silent, now I roar, deaf once but now I hear'.","260":null,"261":"It looks like you've presented a quite intricate series of chords. Are these chords from a song, or perhaps a composition you're working on? I'm curious to know more about how you plan to use or incorporate these chords in your creative process.","262":"I believe I was trying to express that altering a tune or its arrangement can sometimes affect the emotion or feel a song provokes.","263":"In F major, there's a hint of melancholy that emerges, creating a contrast to A major's more cheery sound, making it feel as though the sun is setting.","264":"It's a fascinating subject! Connectome refers to a comprehensive map of the neural connections within the brain. This mapping provides crucial insights into our understanding of the brain's wiring and its role in cognitive functions.","265":"Actually, replicating human consciousness and empathy in a computer is highly complex, as our brains rely on intricate neural networks and non-linear computations that go beyond mere data processing. Also, as computers don't have physical bodies, they are unable to have sensory experiences that influence thoughts and feelings. Therefore, we can't simply replicate your brain data and make a computer act as you.","266":"I understand now. You're pointing out that although studying the brain's anatomy provides a solid base, it doesn't capture the intricate temporal interactions between neurons and brain regions. Comprehending these dynamics and sequences is essential for unraveling the brain's function.","267":"I'm glad to hear that. Indeed, our unique experiences, feelings, and memories greatly shape our identities, extending beyond the purely biological function of our brain.","268":"Intriguingly, zero-knowledge proofs allow a prover to confirm the truth of a statement without disclosing any information about the proof's origin or underlying logic. This unique property makes them an essential tool in various applications, such as secure online transactions and privacy-preserving systems.","269":"In a zero-knowledge proof, the prover can demonstrate to the verifier that they know a secret or have a specific property, without revealing the secret itself or any information about how they obtained it. The verifier can be assured that the prover is telling the truth, but remains uninformed about the secret.","270":"Sure, a messaging app would be a great way to communicate.

I'll sketch a circle with a radius of 5 units, centered at the coordinates (3,4) on a graph paper.","273":"Yes, it's truly fascinating. I'm particularly interested in a process called long-term potentiation (LTP), which is a change in synaptic strength that's believed to be the cellular basis of learning and memory. LTP is triggered by high-frequency stimulation of nerve impulses, and it's this process that could potentially hold the key to understanding and treating memory disorders like Alzheimer's disease.","274":"Implicit memory refers to memories that are not consciously recalled or brought to our awareness. These memories are acquired through various forms of learning, such as classical conditioning and procedural learning. Examples include learning to ride a bike or remembering how to swim. Explicit memory, on the other hand, is consciously recallable information, such as facts, events, and personal experiences. This is the memory we traditionally think of when we talk about memorizing information.","275":"Yes, the connectivities we observe using FMRI are indeed different for implicit and explicit memories. For skill learning tasks (implicit memory), we often see more activity in the striatum compared to the hippocampus or prefrontal cortex. However, for forming episodic memories, we typically see more activity in the hippocampus, but we also often observe activity in the prefrontal cortex.","276":"But what if the memories we form aren't always accurate representations of the events that occurred? It's a question that was also explored by Proust in his novel, as it originally didn't feature the Madeleine at all. Instead, it was a cake soaked in tea that triggered the protagonist's childhood memories. This raises the intriguing possibility that our memories may be more influenced by subsequent events, and that our brains may fill in the gaps to create a cohesive narrative.","277":"It's truly captivating to unravel the intricacies of a complex math problem. It's akin to solving a riddle or crafting a masterpiece.","278":"If you knew where it was, you'd be able to find it yourself. But since you're asking, I suppose I could give you a hint. It's a bit of a challenge, though. Are you up for it?","279":"Indeed, I was right about the puffin's location. Aren't you impressed?","280":"Imagine if we could employ a zero-knowledge proof for authentication.

This method would ensure a secure and private login process, even if the authenticating entity is malicious.","281":"It's a concept that represents something without an end or limit. In simpler terms, it's a value that continues to grow without ever stopping.","282":"The room that the new guest will occupy is the first one we vacate by moving everyone else up. So, the room number of the new guest is effectively 0, as we've made room '0' available by shifting everyone else up.","283":"No, it would instead be infinity plus the number of guests (which is 2) plus infinity (the number of rooms), but since we're dealing with infinities, this sum is still considered infinite, as adding more guests doesn't change the infinite number of rooms.","284":"Indeed, it seems like you're moving guests from odd-numbered rooms to even-numbered rooms that are two apart. This pattern creates a geometric progression, where each room is twice the distance away from the previous one. By continuing this sequence, you can effectively create an infinite number of new rooms, each one being further apart than the last.","285":"two times the infinity, or simply infinity","286":"Infinity in mathematics is a concept that represents an endless quantity, a number that doesn't have an upper limit. It's used to solve problems that involve infinite sequences, infinite series, or large numbers that are too big to be represented as a finite number. For example, it's used in calculus to study limits, in set theory to explore the properties of infinite sets, and in number theory to study the properties of infinite sequences like the Fibonacci sequence.","287":"Robots in a robotic setting would require more than just coordinates. They would need to learn to recognize and respond to various objects, environments, and situations. This could involve using computer vision, sensor data, and other techniques to train a machine learning model that helps the robot make decisions based on its surroundings.","288":"Motion is one of the more complex tasks for a robot to learn, but understanding and interpreting natural language is even more challenging. It's less structured and has a lot more variation compared to specific tasks such as motion.","289":null,"290":"In terms of algorithms, Deep Learning and Reinforcement Learning are commonly used.

This self-similarity can be observed in various ways, such as dividing the pattern into smaller parts that resemble the original pattern. Mathematically, fractals can be described using iterative functions, which are repeated processes that create complex patterns. The Mandelbrot set is a popular example of a fractal that's generated using these iterative functions.","292":null,"293":"Because three primary colors - red, green, and blue - are the foundation of all other colors in the color wheel, they are essential for creating a wide range of hues and shades.","294":"Yes, you're correct. When crumpled, the paper does have a third dimension, with width, length, and height (depth). However, when flat, we typically consider it as two-dimensional, as it only has width and length.","295":"Since the box I'm using to cover the line is the size of the line, and you said I would need two boxes to cover the line when it was cut in half once, now that it's cut in half again, I would need four boxes to cover the line, as each box is now half the size it originally was.","296":"I'm sorry, I didn't quite catch that. Could you please tell me the number of boxes you would need to cover the coastline if you were to perform the box-counting experiment?","297":"And, as the coastline becomes more jagged, the number of boxes will grow faster, leading to a 'fractal' or self-similar pattern, where the measurement changes with the scale of measurement. This is known as the 'fractal dimension' of the coastline, which can be used to quantify its complexity.","298":"Stacking these two cups can be made easier by positioning the first cup upright and aligning the wider part of the second cup with the bottom of the first. This method allows the second cup to fit securely on the first, reducing the need for balance or precision.","299":"Sure, the robot will move over here, open the door, and then carefully place the package inside. After that, it will close the door and drop the package on the floor.","300":"So, it doesn't seem to have a specific location for the cup in mind, it was only given the command to move over here.","301":"That's an image, but I can't identify the specific type of image from here.","302":"So it can exist in both states simultaneously, like a coin that can be heads and tails at the same time.","303":"They're a cryptographic method that lets someone (the prover) demonstrate to someone else (the verifier) that they know a specific piece of information, without revealing the information itself. In other words, the verifier can be sure that the prover knows the information, but they won't learn anything else.","304":"Explainer: In a zero-knowledge proof, I can assure you that a statement is true without revealing the statement itself. This is done by performing a series of computations and revealing just enough information for you to be convinced of the truth, but not enough for you to understand the inner workings of the proof or the original statement.","305":"So, you can see that green and blue are two distinct colors. Is there a specific color you're interested in learning more about?","306":"If I show you the colors of all the countries, you would be very confident that I have colored them correctly.

How did you manage to remember which one you had already checked?","308":"That's correct! The colors have been changed, so the old color scheme no longer applies. We're now dealing with a new set of colors.","309":"Zero-knowledge proofs are a cryptographic technique that allows one party to prove to another that they know a value, without revealing the value itself. They are designed to structurally prove something, and are particularly useful in scenarios where privacy is a concern, such as financial transactions or voting systems, as they are theoretically more secure than traditional encryption methods.","310":"In China and India, they have implemented various versions of cap and trade systems, which are market-based approaches for controlling the emissions levels from factories. These systems work by setting a limit or 'cap' on the total amount of pollutants that can be emitted, and then allowing companies to trade emission allowances. This encourages companies to find cost-effective ways to reduce their emissions, as they can sell any unused allowances to other companies that need them.","311":"Let's explore your thoughts on infinity a bit more. Imagine a number greater than 1, and then subtract the number of planets in our solar system from it. Did you come up with a number? That's an example of an infinite set in the number line. Now, let's delve deeper into your ideas about infinity.","312":null,"313":"Did that pool day stand out as your favorite, or was there a specific moment within it that made it truly memorable?","314":"It's possible that the towel you used was teal, but I recall seeing both a dark blue and a light blue towel around the pool area that day, so it could have been any of those as well.","315":"Explainer: That's right! As we accumulate more experiences and memories, our brain prioritizes newer information, making older memories less accessible and more prone to being forgotten. It's like a bookshelf filling up, pushing some of the older books to the back where they might be harder to find.","316":"That memory serves as a warning, helping you to recognize and avoid similar situations in the future. For instance, if you cut yourself accidentally, the memory of that event would be quite vivid, making you more cautious around sharp objects in the future to prevent another accident.","317":"Did you know that while we can't directly measure the radius of a circle, we can measure its circumference and diameter? These are the two direct measures of a circle. Interestingly, the circumference of a circle is the distance around it, while the diameter is the distance across it, passing through the center.","318":"That's an interesting question! While planets and asteroids don't typically exhibit self-similarity across different scales like fractals do, some astronomical structures, such as the Mandelbrot set, can resemble fractal patterns. So, while they might not be fractals themselves, they share some characteristics with them.","319":"So as we zoom in closer and closer, the coastline appears to get longer and longer. This is a characteristic of fractals, where the length (or surface area, in the case of asteroids) seems to increase without a bound, no matter how much we try to measure it. This is known as the 'coastline paradox' or 'fractal dimension'.","320":"It's nice to meet you, Namina!

As I delved deeper, I discovered quantum computing and its progress. My current interest in quantum sensing is driven by a desire to explore innovative solutions and applications within the realm of quantum-related technologies.","324":"I believe the main difference lies in the scale and complexity. Imaging large biological objects involves dealing with a vast number of atoms, while sensing quantum objects requires a high level of precision and understanding of quantum mechanics to observe individual particles.","325":"Yes, the closer you are, the higher your sensitivity. However, it's worth noting that even a few nanometers can be challenging for traditional magnetic resonance methods. The nitrogen-vacancy center allows for better sensitivity to single electrons, even at larger distances, by using a technique called Raman spectroscopy to read out the electron's spin state.","326":"Yes, you're correct. This phenomenon is known as decoherence. Decoherence is the loss of quantum coherence due to the interaction of a quantum system with its environment. In simpler terms, it's the process by which a quantum system loses its ability to exist in multiple states simultaneously, and it collapses into a single classical state. This happens when fluctuations in the environment cause the quantum system to interact with its surroundings, leading to the measurement-like collapse of the quantum superposition.","327":"It could encompass a multitude of distractions, such as non-essential notifications, intrusive emails, superfluous news articles, or environmental disturbances like background chatter, ringing phones, and so on.","328":"Indeed, you're right. Quantum computing is still in its infancy, and the number of qubits that can be effectively controlled is indeed limited. However, the pace of progress in this field is rapid, and it's not uncommon to hear about more complex systems being developed. For example, IBM's Eagle processor has already implemented a quantum chip with 127 qubits. This number is expected to grow with continued advancements in technology.","329":"I absolutely agree!

Fault tolerance in quantum computing is crucial to prevent these errors and maintain the system's stability. The challenge with adding more qubits isn't just about increasing the computer's power, but also about finding ways to safeguard it from the unique faults and failures that occur in a quantum system.","332":"What's important to clarify is that quantum computers aren't designed to breach the encryption used in banks and financial institutions. The encryption used involves large amounts of data, and a quantum computer would need to be practically fault-tolerant and scalable to crack it, which is still in the early stages of development. Instead, quantum computers could potentially solve problems in cryptography that classical computers can't, such as factoring large numbers or simulating complex chemical reactions. So, your bank account is safer than you might think.","333":"Subdivision surfaces are an algorithm used in computer graphics to represent curved and smooth shapes. They use recursive mathematical operations to approximate complex shapes using simpler ones, such as quadrilaterals or triangles.

By the late 1970s, it had evolved into the backbone of what we now call the internet.","336":"It would allow for efficient use of network resources by breaking down data into small packets and routing them independently. This way, if a particular path is congested or broken, the packets can be sent through other available paths to reach their destination.","337":"Yes, that's correct! The Department of Defense opted for a connectionless communication like Internet Protocol (IP) to ensure robustness and survivability. This means that packets can find alternative routes if parts of the network fail, making the communication system more resilient.","338":"Yes, abstraction is indeed a key factor. It allows us to separate complex details from the user, making it easier for them to focus on using and innovating with the infrastructure, without needing to understand its intricacies. This is what leads to the proliferation of amazing applications.","339":"Indeed, you're on the right track! The OSI model, or Open Systems Interconnection model, is often referred to as the seven layers of the internet.

Our research primarily revolves around the spins of electrons, and we're utilizing this unique platform to witness their quantum properties even at room temperature.","345":"To create a sensor, the timeframe depends on its complexity, ranging from a few weeks to several months. On the other hand, growing a diamond in a lab using the HPHT (High-Pressure High-Temperature) method can take anywhere from several months to several years for a diamond of substantial size. Neither process involves putting energy into them; instead, they rely on controlled chemical reactions and specific physical conditions.","346":"So, the nitrogen-vacancy centers in a diamond can be used to store a quantum bit (qubit) in a state of both 0 and 1 simultaneously due to the property of superposition, which is crucial for quantum computing. Have you heard about this concept before?","347":"Yes, you can think of it as starting with the quantum computer as a reference point, and then measuring its state to observe how it deviates from the ideal superposition when interacting with the environment. This deviation can provide useful information, which is the basis for the utility of quantum computers as sensors.","348":null,"349":"An atomic clock uses atomic transitions to keep time, but it's not typically considered a quantum sensor.

But for shorter distances, wireless connections like Wi-Fi are commonly used.","353":"When you search for a movie or a TV show on a streaming platform, it sends a request to their server. The server searches its database for the file of the desired content and sends it to you over the internet. As you watch, the streaming platform streams the content to you, sending it piece by piece, not all at once. This is done to save server resources and ensure a smooth streaming experience for all users.","354":"The process works like this: when you request to watch Vampire Diaries, your device sends a request to the Netflix server. The server then checks its database and the internet connections available between it and your device, and sends the video content over the internet via the optimized route to your device. This optimized route helps ensure that the content is delivered smoothly to your device, reducing the chances of it getting scrambled up during transmission.","355":"More precisely, a function is a rule or relationship that assigns a unique output to each input within its defined domain, and it can be represented by a graph, a formula, or a set of rules.","356":"In mathematics, we use isomorphisms (or bijections) to compare two infinite sets. This means we can pair up elements from both sets in a way that preserves their relationships. This allows us to analyze and understand these infinite sets as if they were finite, making it easier to reason about infinity.","357":"So, let's visualize this. Can you find a way to pair each natural number with a unique integer and back again? You'll notice that the negative numbers are left out. Since we can't match them with the natural numbers, the integers have more elements, making their infinity larger than the natural numbers'.","358":"But then we have a problem because there are still natural numbers left unmatched, like the number one. So, we can't say the natural numbers and integers have the same number of elements yet. We need to find a way to match all integers with natural numbers without leaving any integers or natural numbers unmatched.","359":"Yes, that's correct! Each even integer has its positive counterpart, which is the next odd integer, and its negative counterpart, which is the next odd integer minus 2. For instance, the next odd integer after 4 is 5, and the next odd integer minus 2 from 0 is -1. So, for the natural number 4, the corresponding integers are 2 and -2.","360":"That's a great observation! Let's explore this further. I wonder if we can find a bijective function that maps natural numbers to rational numbers, just like we did with the integers. What do you think about that?","361":null,"362":"That's correct! By adding a small difference to each diagonal element, we create a new real number that doesn't exist in any of the other numbers on the list. This is a simple yet powerful demonstration of Cantor's diagonal argument.","363":"So, this new number is unique and hasn't been added to the list because it's different at every point from the numbers already on the list.","364":"Indeed, we've demonstrated that the number in question is absent, which implies the impossibility of establishing a one-to-one correspondence between the natural numbers and the real numbers. As a result, we've established the independence of the continuum hypothesis from the Zermelo-Fraenkel axioms for set theory. This finding is a significant milestone in the field of set theory.","365":null,"366":"Yes, it's a guess, but a pretty good one. This seems to be a quantum interference circuit, a crucial part of quantum computers, which helps perform calculations based on quantum states.","367":"They work by creating sound waves that are the exact opposite of the background noise. These waves cancel out the noise, allowing only the intended audio to be heard through the headphones.","368":"As a programmer, quantum computing would require a different approach because it deals with qubits instead of classical bits. This means you'd need to account for superposition and entanglement. Additionally, algorithms designed for classical computers may not work directly with quantum computing, so new algorithms, such as quantum algorithms for optimization and factorization, may need to be used.","369":"Yes, a black hole is a region in space where the gravitational pull is so strong that nothing, not even light, can escape from it. It's a fascinating topic in astrophysics.","370":"That's correct! To measure its volume, I'd need to know its length, width, and height if it's a 3D object. If it's 2D, I'd need its length and width. Let's see if we can find that out!","371":"The phenomenon is called gravitational pull. A black hole has such a strong gravitational force that it bends the path of light towards it. Light naturally moves in a straight line, but the black hole's gravity causes it to curve, resulting in the light being pulled in, even if the black hole is not in direct contact.","372":"It's like a treasure hunter, always seeking the best option from a collection based on certain criteria or a specific order.","373":"So, if we accept the axiom of choice, the Zermelo-K\u00f6nig Lemma states that in any non-empty set S, if every element has a subset in S, then there exists a maximal element in S, an element that is not a part of any larger set in S. Do you think this lemma is true?","374":"Explainee: In essence, you're creating a boundary within the realm of set theory. You're saying that sets larger than this inaccessible cardinal are beyond our reach and understanding. By confining our mathematics to sets smaller than this limit, we can maintain a consistent and rigorous framework without having to grapple with the unknown.","375":"A solution that can efficiently scale, managing an increasing number of IoT devices without a significant increase in cost or management overhead, due to the small data requirements of these devices.","376":"So, considering the Arduino device with a small payload of raw temperature and timestamp, it may transmit a few bytes of data per transmission. This implies that the wireless communication link between the sensor and the gateway would need to handle data rates in the range of bits per second, likely less than kilobits per second.","377":"We could reach out to them and discuss the possibility of collaboration, highlighting the benefits of the research and potential solutions that could address the impact of rush hour traffic on the acoustic landscape. If they recognize the value in the project, they might be more willing to share their data.","378":"For instance, if you're certain it'll rain tomorrow, that's a prediction coming true. Or if you foresee a stock's rise or fall due to an upcoming event, that's also a prediction in action.","379":"Some people may find it challenging to interpret the data and convert it into knowledge.","380":"That's correct. Once a transaction is validated, it is added to the block, and the hash of the previous block is updated to the hash of the new block. This process forms an unbreakable chain of transactions called a blockchain. Any attempt to modify previous blocks would necessitate recalculating the entire subsequent chain of blocks, which would be computationally intensive.","381":"I believe that's a significant milestone. It's a sign that our field is evolving, and it's exciting to consider the future directions, particularly in areas like cryptography, zero-knowledge proofs, and their real-world applications. From a mathematical perspective, I see computing becoming increasingly intertwined with advanced mathematical concepts.","382":"Indeed, the Large Magellanic Cloud is known to harbor a supermassive black hole, but the specifics of its properties and the role it plays in the galaxy's dynamics may vary depending on the latest research findings.

Black holes can indeed form not only through star collapse but also from supernova explosions, where the remnants of a massive star are compressed into a very small area. This process is quite fascinating, isn't it?","385":"Indeed, they're all friends in a unique way. They all exert a gravitational pull on each other, making them friends in the cosmic sense.","386":"...and this colossal merger will not only result in an enormous elliptical galaxy, but also generate shockwaves that could disrupt the orbits of nearby galaxies, potentially triggering a cascade of further mergers and cosmic chaos. Additionally, the combined gravitational forces of our supermassive black holes could lead to complex and unpredictable interactions, such as gravitational waves and the ejection of stars at high velocities. This event could have profound implications for the structure and evolution of the universe as we know it.","387":"Yes, that's correct! The supermassive black hole would indeed become our new 'sun', exerting an immense gravitational force that would pull everything within its sphere into a much tighter orbit. This new solar system, though more densely packed, would still maintain its structure, albeit in a much smaller and more compact form.","388":"Yes, a recent discovery suggests that the energy generated by these electronic circuits could potentially be used to power interstellar travel. This could revolutionize space exploration and propulsion systems. It's an exciting time for black hole research.","389":"Indeed, the complexity of your model and the computational speed are crucial factors. The size of the training data and the need for fine-tuning can also impact the training duration. In some instances, a larger dataset might necessitate more time to train, even on a faster computational setup. Fine-tuning, which involves adjusting the model's weights and biases, can also contribute to the overall training time.","390":"Quantum computers could potentially accelerate complex machine learning tasks, such as optimization and pattern recognition, by utilizing quantum bits or qubits concurrently instead of sequentially. This could result in substantial speed-ups compared to classical computers.","391":null,"392":"So, it can be in a weird state where it's both up and down at the same time, until we measure it. That's one of the cool things about quantum systems, they can be in multiple states at once.","393":"We initialize the qubits to either a 0 or a 1, which forms the basis of our quantum encoding.","394":"So, that means the output should be consistent for the same inputs, right?","395":"These near-term friendly quantum algorithms are specifically designed to run on noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices, or NISQ computers. They are resilient to the errors caused by the noise in the system. Examples of these algorithms include quantum approximation algorithms like quantum linear systems solvers and quantum chemistry simulations.","396":null,"397":"It's challenging to develop a single approach for robots to handle different food types, as they vary in shape, texture, size, and how they deform during scooping. To address this, we can either create custom strategies for each food type or employ advanced machine learning techniques to adapt to the variability.","398":"One potential approach is to enhance simulations by adding factors like sensor noise, friction, and other real-world elements to better replicate the physical characteristics and uncertainties of real-life settings. Another intriguing avenue is to explore different robot designs, such as incorporating more flexible materials in the manipulators, to create simulations that more accurately reflect the actions of real-world robots. Collaboration with experts in control theory, machine learning, and robotics can also be beneficial in refining and generalizing simulated manipulation strategies for real-world applications.","399":"Did you know that fractals are a captivating mathematical concept? They're all about patterns that repeat themselves, no matter how close or far you look!","400":"That's where machine learning comes in. They use a dataset of labeled images of trees, where each image is labeled 'tree'. The computer learns to recognize the characteristics of a tree by being shown these labeled images. Over time, it learns to distinguish a tree from other types of images.","401":"So if this branch is a tree, we can continue to apply the same rule to its branches, creating smaller branches that split into smaller branches, and so on.","402":"I'd be quite overwhelmed at the thought of creating a thousand trees. That's an immense amount of work and time.","403":"To get started with drawing fractals on a computer, you'd be best off learning a programming language like Python or Processing, which have libraries specifically designed for creating intricate fractal patterns.","404":"I've been keeping busy with work and some personal projects. How about you?","405":"None, but it's an interesting concept. I'm curious to know more about the potential benefits and challenges of a fully software-defined internet, and how it could impact network management and performance.","406":"That's interesting! So, you're saying that these protocol standards and certificate authorities help establish secure communication between different networked devices, while each network essentially operates independently?","407":"Yes, encryption can provide a layer of privacy, but it doesn't ensure absolute anonymity. Governments and other entities can still use techniques like traffic analysis, network forensics, or international cooperation to gather information about internet activities.","408":"That's right! We can make educated guesses based on the information provided.","409":"The challenge is to integrate these three technologies - wireless, networking, and cloud - harmoniously, ensuring low latency, high reliability, and robust security measures. This is crucial, especially when real-time decision making is necessary and safety concerns may arise.","410":"A black hole is a celestial object with an extremely strong gravitational pull that causes anything, including light, to be drawn towards it. It is formed when a massive star collapses at the end of its life, resulting in a singularity, a point of infinite density and zero volume. The intense gravitational pull of a black hole creates a region around it called the event horizon, beyond which nothing, not even light, can escape.","411":null,"412":"A Schwarzschild black hole is static, while a Kerr black hole rotates. When a star collapses, it's not perfectly symmetrical, so it usually forms a Kerr black hole with some spin. However, black holes can lose or gain angular momentum over time, so their rotation can change. Observations suggest that most black holes in the universe have some degree of rotation, though the exact percentage remains unknown.","413":"Well, the idea is that if we could understand how quantum effects work in strong gravitational fields, they would prevent the star from collapsing all the way down to a singularity. Instead, we might have something like a quantum state called a 'Planck star', which would be stable and not have the problematic characteristics of the singularity.","414":null,"415":"Hawking proposed the theory of black hole thermodynamics and a mechanism for black hole radiation, which is now known as Hawking radiation. This radiation is a consequence of quantum effects near the event horizon of a black hole.","416":"That's an intriguing viewpoint! It appears we might be able to detect quantum gravitational waves, disturbances in spacetime, during such a merger event. These waves could potentially provide insights into the elusive quantum nature of gravity, if accurately detected.","417":"Zero-knowledge proofs are a vital aspect of multi-party computation. They enable multiple parties to collaborate on a computation without disclosing sensitive data. In essence, zero-knowledge proofs allow one party to prove to another that they possess a specific piece of data or have performed a certain computation, without revealing the data or the computation itself.","418":"In this context, you're not aiming to forecast an outcome or adhere to a particular sequence. Instead, you're producing alternatives or delving into various possibilities. This randomness fosters originality and diversity, which can be advantageous in various domains such as artistic expression, AI development, or even scientific exploration, where the objective is to uncover new avenues or innovative solutions.","419":"That's right! Leveraging cloud computing's scalability and flexibility can indeed make zero-knowledge proofs more accessible and efficient. This could lead to a more secure and private data sharing environment in numerous applications.","420":"That's a great question! Memory is a complex process that allows us to store and recall information. It's fascinating how our brains can remember events, facts, and experiences for different periods.

Do you have any specific aspects of memory you're curious about?","421":"So when you return home from vacation, that good memory of the delicious orange juice might influence your preferences and lead you to seek out better tasting orange juice, potentially changing your overall perception of orange juice compared to before you went on vacation.","422":"That's a great choice, Dylan! You know, our brains have a special knack for remembering enjoyable experiences like eating your favorite candy, such as pixie sticks. Researchers have found that the amyggdala, a region in our brain, plays a crucial role in this. When we have rewarding experiences, the amyggdala lights up, triggering the release of dopamine, the 'feel-good' neurotransmitter. So, it's no wonder you remember pixie sticks fondly!","423":"Indeed, the uncertainty and the close similarity between the options can make the decision-making process more challenging and even stressful, often leading to feelings of regret or self-doubt about the choice made.","424":"Your preferences can change over time due to various factors like personal growth, new experiences, and social influences. For example, as you try more new candies, your preferences might shift, and you might discover a new favorite. Or, you might find that you appreciate a candy you initially disliked, like perhaps a candy you didn't like as a child but enjoy now as an adult. It's all part of how our tastes and preferences evolve as we grow and mature.","425":"The internet is a vast, interconnected network of computers and devices that allows us to access information, communicate with others, and enjoy various digital services, such as social media, streaming platforms, and online shopping.","426":"Wow, 'Matilda' is a great choice!

Do you have a favorite scene or character from the movie?","427":"It would likely traverse the network, passing through various nodes, and eventually arrive at the designated location here (where the video is intended to be displayed).","428":"That's a great point! In many cases, the shortest path is indeed the fastest, but it can also be the most congested or unreliable. Having alternative paths can help us avoid such bottlenecks and ensure a smoother and more efficient journey, much like having multiple routes to reach a destination in real life.","429":"That's a leafy green vegetable often used in salads and sandwiches.","430":"In terms of a circuit, a mental model could be likened to a recurrent neural network, where each node represents a concept, idea, or potential outcome. The connections between nodes represent the relationships between these concepts. The strength of these connections can be adjusted based on learning and experience, allowing for predictions about future events or actions.","431":"It's intriguing to ponder the notion that our personal cognitive maps, the mental constructs we form, could be shaped by our unique experiences, cultural heritage, or even our individual character traits. This could account for why some individuals might recall specific details about a place more easily, or react differently to similar surroundings. This added complexity sheds light on the connection between spatial processing and memory, as it implies that the way we remember and traverse spaces is not a universal process, but a highly individualized and unique journey.","432":"It's intriguing to consider the process of modifying our mental models, as you've pointed out. This is indeed crucial for adaptation and growth. It's like rearranging the furniture in a room to make it more practical or comfortable. By simplifying our mental models, discarding some information, or reframing our understanding of certain facts, we can learn from our experiences and adapt to new circumstances.","433":"So, it's as if the model processes data to generate new insights and predictions, similar to how human memories allow us to think creatively and unpredictably. The more accurately our models reflect reality, the better they can mimic the memory recovery process, filling in the gaps with plausible details instead of storing every detail as a separate memory.","434":"Great! Let's see if you can help me out with this. I'd like to demonstrate how we can 'hear' black holes, but I'll need your help on an electric guitar. Are you comfortable playing a few notes for me?","435":"Well, the LIGO scientists use sophisticated mathematical models to analyze the signals they detect. These models help in identifying the unique 'fingerprint' of gravitational waves produced by specific astronomical events such as the collision of black holes or neutron stars. By comparing the detected signal with these models, they can confidently determine the origin of the gravitational wave.","436":"Here's the report you requested, Michael. Let's dive into it together.","437":"Indeed, the assumption that robots possess human-like social cognition and understanding of the world is a common pitfall. This misconception often leads to an overestimation of their capabilities. It's crucial to approach robots with a more cautious mindset, understanding that they lack the ability to generalize their actions or respond to stimuli like humans. Recognizing these limitations is essential to avoid drawing incorrect conclusions about their abilities.","438":"Yes, I agree. Lower level tasks, such as driving or recognizing a face, are primarily reflexive and require minimal cognitive processing. In contrast, higher level tasks, like playing chess or solving mathematical problems, demand memory, strategy, and analytical skills.","439":"Wow, that sounds intriguing! Could you delve deeper into the specific social stimuli you'll be focusing on and the factors, such as emotions or personality traits, that you believe will impact our judgments?","440":"I'm curious, how does memory influence our perceptions and social judgments? Are these memories of past experiences or more like learned behaviors we've picked up over time?","441":"Well, in that context, what you're describing is related to what we call affective or emotional memory. This is a type of long-term memory that stores emotional responses to stimuli, which play a significant role in our decisions, behavior, and emotions. It's crucial in situations where positive emotions are involved, as these are typically more subjective and less consistent across individuals, due to factors like personal experiences, cultural background, and the like.","442":"My research indicates that the emotional response our brain encodes during an event significantly impacts how we remember and process those memories later on. This is crucial in understanding trauma and memory disorders, where the emotional response may be intensified or muted, leading to distorted recollections or even repressed memories.","443":"Based on the new connections we've discovered between memory and decision-making, we're now exploring if there's a common mechanism underlying both these processes. This could help us understand how our brain makes decisions, potentially leading to advancements in diagnosing and treating disorders like addiction or schizophrenia.","444":"So, what specific tasks or activities do you find particularly challenging for machines to perform?","445":"Let's see if the chat model can correctly identify an image of a cat.

As you continue to practice this skill, you'll develop the ability to not only identify the sound it makes when it's in the air but also when it hits the ground.","449":"Robots don't have feelings or self-awareness, so they can't understand or feel guilty about making mistakes like humans do.","450":"In reinforcement learning, the robot attempts a task and receives feedback based on its performance. This feedback can be positive (reward) if the task is completed correctly, or negative (punishment) if it's not. For instance, if the robot successfully picks up an object, it receives a reward. If it fails, it receives a punishment.","451":"A robot doesn't see like humans do. Instead, it uses sensors and its programming to interpret information from its environment. For instance, a robot designed to navigate a room might use cameras and distance sensors to detect walls and obstacles. This information is then processed through its software to guide its movements. However, it doesn't have the same visual experience as humans do, as it doesn't perceive the world in the same way.","452":"While it's not accurate to predict that robots will take over the world, it's crucial to consider the ethical implications of their development and use. We should strive to program and utilize robots in a way that benefits humanity, promotes safety, and respects human values.","453":"That's fascinating! It's a testament to the power of computational creativity. With a simple computer program, even a child can generate intricate, abstract patterns that would take a mathematician hours to plot by hand.","454":"Imagine a tree with branches, twigs, and even the smallest leaves all sharing a similar structure, mirroring the pattern of the tree as a whole. This pattern in nature, when mathematically modeled, is known as a fractal. In simpler terms, a fractal is a shape or pattern that can be repeated infinitely, showing intricate details at any scale!","455":"I took the concept I observed at the diner and translated it into mathematical equations, simulating the folding of fluid in my computer program to generate the turbulence seen in the marble vase in the movie.","456":"That's when we can harness technology to scale our ideas and businesses effectively.","457":"Incorporating social interaction and realistic textures\/dynamics could significantly improve the VR\/AR\/XR experience, making it less lonely and more immersive.

In a way, Ken could be seen as the digital equivalent of Bob Ross.","459":"That's a great question! In mathematics, infinity is a concept that represents something without limit or end. It's fascinating to think about, isn't it? For example, if you keep adding one to itself, you'll never reach the end. It's a bit mind-bending!","460":"That's an interesting guess! However, as you might have noticed, the question was about the number of Skittles in the jar, not whether there are any or not. Let's try to focus on the number of Skittles in the jar. Any other thoughts?","461":"If all of them are visible to you, it implies that the number might not be infinite, but it could still be a very large countable number. To confirm, we'd need more details about the specific context or the nature of the objects you're referring to.","462":"Actually, it's impossible to fit infinitely many jars in any space, no matter how big it is. Once we fill up the space as many times as possible, there's always one more jar that won't fit.","463":"Indeed, it seems you're considering the concept that 'unlimited' implies a lack of boundaries or restrictions, which could mean it can exist in any space, dimension, or realm, without any spatial or dimensional limitations.","464":"I completely understand your frustration. It's quite annoying when our photos don't turn out as we'd like, isn't it?","465":"Did you know that the outer edge of the wheel moves faster than the inner edge? This creates an optical illusion where it appears as if the whole wheel is doing a circle inside a larger circle, resulting in a fascinating pattern.","466":"Sure, I can explain quantum computing to you. It's a new type of technology that uses quantum mechanics to process information. Quantum computers can solve certain problems much faster than traditional computers. So, when you tell your friends about it, they might say something like, 'Quantum computing? That sounds amazing!'","467":"So if we were to make predictions before measuring, they would always be the same. This is the concept of quantum entanglement, where particles become correlated in such a way that the state of one instantaneously affects the state of the other, regardless of the distance between them.","468":"An MRI is a non-invasive imaging technique that utilizes a strong magnetic field and radio waves to generate detailed images of the body's internal structures, particularly soft tissues.
