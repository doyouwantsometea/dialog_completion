that's good, because that's why you're here, and so we're talking about sleep today, and really about kind of what is the brain machinery through which we go through consciousness to unconsciousness and that transition.","1":"Okay. The best way to think about this transition is really called, it's a flip flop switch, okay? So this term comes from engineering, and the idea is that in sleep, you basically have kind of this all of nothing experience. Certainly people kind of drift off to sleep, but then all of a sudden you're unconscious, right? So it seems like it's this flip flop between the arousal system and the sleep promoting system, and it's certainly regulated, and we'll get a little bit into that, but they're certainly kind of made up of two reciprocally inhibitory processes. Okay, so we have the ascending reticular activating system. It originates in the brain stem, and there's a dorsal and a ventral arm to this, and so the dorsal arm has neurons, cholinergic neurons, that go up to the thalamus and then it projections into the fore brain, and then there's the ventral arm, and this is comprised of a whole bunch of different types of neurons, so there are monominergic, so there's kind of dopaminergic neurons that come from the periaqueductal gray, serotonergic ones from the dorsal raphae nuclei, histaminergic neurons that come from the tuberomammillary nucleus of the hippothalamus, and then noradrenergic neurons from the locus coeruleus, and so all of those are kind of working in tandem to kind of drive wake within the brain. So if we just think about drugs that are available inducing wakefulness, we can certainly, kind of the dopaminergic ones jump out, right? So we have amphetamines that kind of drive those signaling, and then modafinil, which is a wake promoting drug for people that have kind of excessive day-time sleepiness that maintains alertness throughout the day.","2":"You know, what we do in our studies, is we actually track people, for say a week, and they have to get in within this range of amount of sleep and then it has to be both amount of sleep and how stable it is. That variability can kind of impact it and certainly might have an impact on the machinery that's happening in the brain.","3":"And there's that chord. It's not a Dennerman chord, but it functions as a dominant chord. But it doesn't matter, because you're still going to the place you're going to.","4":"But at that moment, I'm coming from here, and I wanna forge some, some solution. I get myself in a situation. (keyboard music)","5":"'Cause, you know, I just wouldn't think to use that chord in that situation. And there it was! And, you know, if you read the rule book, it's, that not in it.","6":"It's a good one. The melody on its own just goes. (hums Amazing Grace) That melody on its own is kind of lonely, right? And no one really knows how it feels. (plays and hums Amazing Grace) So which one did you prefer?","7":"Its basically a delay and it happens in all parts of the system: monitors can be a big one. Like consumer televisions can often have 15 milliseconds or more of latency just in the TV part. And then you've got the processing and the computer and all of these add up to the total latency.","8":"But VR makes, you have to give up a little bit of that freedom, you have to not do so many crazy things, so you can wind up having it be as responsive and high quality as it needs to be.","9":"That's right. When we teach machines to learn from data, to build a model from that data or a representation of that, and then to make a prediction. One of the places we often find machine learning in the real world is in things like recommendation systems. So do you have an artist that you really like?","10":"So there are things that machines are really great at that humans are actually not great at. And imagine watching every video posted to TikTok every day. So we just don't have enough time to do that at the rate at which we can actually watch those videos. But a machine can analyze all of them and then make recommendations to us. And then thinking about things that machines are bad at and people are good at, people are really great with only one or two examples of learning something new and incorporating that into our model of the world to make good decisions. Whereas machines often need tens of thousands of examples, and that's not even getting into things like good judgment because we care about people, because we can imagine a future that we want to live in that doesn't exist today. And that's something that is still uniquely human. Machines are great at predicting based on what they've seen in the past, but they're not creative. They're not going to invent. They're not gonna, you know, really change where we're gonna go. That's up to us.","11":"Now, that makes the gravitational field incredibly strong around the neutron star. So what would happen if we were on a neutron star, because of the gravity?","12":"There isn't a sensible way to talk about it yet, and that probably means that's where Einstein's theory of gravity as a curved space-time is beginning to break down, and we need to take the extra step of going to some kind of quantum theory of gravity. And we don't have that yet. So even though the black hole isn't completely understood, we do know that they form astronomically, that in the universe things like neutron stars form and things like black holes form. The consequences are very much speaking to this curved space-time. So, for instance, if two black holes orbit each other, they're like mallets on a drum, and they actually cause space-time to ring, and it's very much part of gravitation. The ringing of space-time itself, we call gravitational waves. And this was something Einstein thought about right away in 1950-1960, he was thinking about that.","13":"So when the gravitational waves were recorded and they realized, oh this sounds like, you can reconstruct the shape and size of the mallets of the drum from the sound, these sounds like neutron stars colliding, not black holes. And so, like you said, there was a trigger for satellites and experiments all over the world to point roughly in the direction that the sound was coming from. So, from your point of view, they're like two super-conducting giant magnets colliding, an experiment you could never do on Earth. That's just the most tremendous scales and peculiarities of matter.","14":"Let's bring one in. All right. The thing about relativity is that they really want you to think of spacetime as one four dimensional thing, right? It's kind of like space. It's not just three dimensions of space and one dimension of time.","15":"And the crucial difference is that time is not the same for this person who stayed behind and sat in their chair, and this person who zoomed out there.","16":"Yeah, that's right. And it goes exactly back to what we drew on the board where how those two people in the train and on the ground would divide spacetime up differently to space and time.","17":"So in Amazing Grace, you start with F. You know, if I go (melodic humming) \u266a How sweet the sound \u266a (scat singing) (laughs) Where am I right now? I don't know where I am. (scat singing) And my job is to get back home, but to make this chord make sense.","18":"You know, a lot of people, a lot of string theorists, they care a lot about all the different ways in which we could hide the extra dimensions. As someone who cares about cosmology, I wanna start asking why are the extra dimensions small at all? How did that happen? Is this something you think about yourself?","19":"The thing I want to talk about is this paper I wrote with Matt Johnson and Lisa Randall where we realize there's another way to compactify extra dimensions spontaneously, dynamically. If you imagine starting with this big piece of paper you couldn't wrap up everything, but within some region of space you could make a tube.","20":"Yeah. So we certainly assume that they're all large as a starting point, and it's worse than that. So in our paper we imagine you start in de Sitter space. You start in a universe with no matter, no anything like that, just empty space but with an energy that is positive and all the dimensions are large.","21":"Yeah, I've been trying to explain this to lower levels, and they always look at me like, are you pulling my leg here a little bit? Or is this the real thing that they use? Yes, it is the real thing they use. We study these branes in de Sitter space, and so what we found is that there are black brane solutions which instead of having a singularity inside are non-singular, and stable, and compactified. Is this a familiar thing? I know things like this have been discussed, right?","22":"I guess. I mean, maybe you'd think otherwise. Again or maybe you could change my mind, I think that as long as it can happen it will happen some of the time, right?","23":"And if we put aside for the second the concerns of our colleagues in other parts of physics, and it's just amongst us chickens, what do you think about the future of cosmology and string theory, and the dynamics of these extra dimensions?","24":"And I just wrote a book called Something Deeply Hidden about many worlds, quantum mechanics, and how spacetime can emerge from it. Plenty of reading material for the audience out there.","25":"Alright, so, at some point, you can probably see it right now? So without moving your eyes, this is kind of hard, tell me how many fingers I'm holding up?","26":"You can just barely tell. And you can see that even, like if you hold out your hand and you focus on your hand, then your foot would be blurry because there's that difference there. And you can change between that, like you can then focus on your foot and your hand gets blurry. Because your eyes can see different amounts of detail in different places. So we're hoping in the future, that hardware can be like that. Where we can make a display that puts lots of detail right where you're looking. And every time you look someplace else, it moves the detail over to there. So we don't need to render a hundred times as much as we've got right now. Figuring out where you're looking is a pretty hard problem. What we try to go about this, is by taking a camera and looking at people's eyes and then try to figure out is the eye looking over here or up here. We're working hard on stuff like this right now so we hopefully can have a virtual reality that's as detailed and realistic feeling as the reality that we've actually got around us. But its going to be a long time before we get to where we can really fool people.","27":"And so we get the power with a lot less energy 'cause its power is energy per unit time. So we aren't depositing much energy in comparison. Can I just ask, 'cause you are using the thermal process of it heating up, but have you ever had the opportunity to use laser tweezers?","28":"So chirped pulse amplification took us sort of from, we were at 10 to the 12, but when I was working the 10 to the 12 sort of sat on a football sized field. It was a kilojoule laser with a nanosecond pulse. And we brought it down to something we call tabletop terawatt. So it was the same terawatt but now it was one joule and one picosecond, so it could fit on a basic optical bench like you would have in your lab. We were able to take that up to, I think the record is right around somewhere between 10 to the 22 and 10 to the 23 watts per square centimeter. So then in going forward, one of the holy grails is can we reach 10 to the 29 watts per square centimeter? So we still have six orders. So we've gone from 10 to the 12 to 10 to the 23. So we've done 11 orders, so you think six isn't so much harder. I have to tell you, over time, it's rolling over. We need another Nobel Prize winning idea. But if we get out there, that's where, if you focus the intensity, the energy in that volume is enough to break the vacuum.","29":"I'm still a believer that the magic's out there. We haven't found it yet, so somebody's going to happen upon the formula. I feel like I've felt little pockets of magic.","30":"All right, you're in the wrong place. [laughs] We're not gonna be talking about biology or computer science. So we wanna talk about the idea of dimensions. Do you know what dimension is? How we would define dimensions?","31":"I'm not trying to fool you here. Okay. Now this is going to be slightly trickier. I'm going to give you this. I want you to hold all three of them at right angles to all the others at the same time.","32":"So astronomers call them right ascension and declination, which are two terrible words, but basically you've seen on the globe where you draw latitude and longitude, what it looks like.","33":"So you can define something as, well you know, how high above a certain location on earth it is, but the earth is rotating and revolving around the sun so we have to define separate celestial coordinates.","34":"We don't know. You know, the optimistic view is that there are six, but the thing is, some of them might be really, really, really, really, really small, like way too small for us to ever see.","35":"You know, honestly out there, if you go out onto campus and talk to the physicists, half of them will say probably extra dimensions exist, and half of them say no, that's just nonsense.","36":"So we've been, we've had, now, effectively two different ways of getting more direct measurements, one is the LIGO, which is the Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory, which is where, getting the ripples in space time, coming off of the merging of black holes. The other one that you're mentioning is actually called the Event Horizon Telescope, where they're using radio waves to actually image the event horizon, that region where light cannot escape from the black hole at the center of our galaxy, which I know they're working on it right now. It's an amazing thing, but that'll be the most direct imaging of a black hole. LIGO is a direct detection of the consequence of the merging of black holes. The critical part has been, like, for the super massive black hole at the center of our galaxy, we've seen the stars orbiting it, and we've measured the mass, so that way, so if you look at a spinning black hole, it actually fundamentally alters the emission that's coming off the stuff that's falling into it. These are discovered as what are called X-ray binaries, that is, you know, there's an X-ray member of the binary that is emitting in the X-rays, and it's really not very bright in the optical (mumbles) at all, so there's always, people are looking at these X-ray binaries.","37":"For my studies, I actually, when I started at UCLA in graduate school, I worked with a professor named Matt Malkin who was, gotten a lot of data observations from the Hubble Space Telescope, so that was one of my very first projects to work on, so any, space-based observatories have been a really big advantage, and then I've moved on now to the Spitzer Space Telescope. In addition to that, then there's other people who've used a lot of X-ray telescopes, NuSTAR, Chandra have used data from that. It's been a combination of both ground-based observatories, as well as space-based ones, and going everywhere from X-ray observations, not done by me, but certainly ultraviolet, and then optical, and infrared, particularly, those are the ones that I've been most involved with.","38":"That's such a good question. No, we actually couldn't. In the Moon, gravity is weaker, you can almost float between footsteps if you look at the astronauts on the Moon. On the Earth, it's harder, 'cause it's bigger. If you go to a bigger, heavier planet, it gets harder and harder. But there are stars that have died that are so dense that there's no way we could lift our arms, no way we could step or walk. The gravity is just way too strong. Do you know how tall you are?","39":"Yeah, and that was because gravity wasn't compressing him all the time and he was floating freely in the International Space Station and his spine just kind of elongated. After a while here on Earth though he'll readjust, he'll go back to the same size. Have you ever heard of how gravity was discovered?","40":"They look the same, but this is much heavier, right? Okay, so try it, just try holding your arms up front, a little higher maybe, give them a chance to drop, and then drop them. [balls thud] [Janna laughs] Did they fall at the same time? Did they hit at the same time? So, Isaac Newton, he was also the one who realized that that's the same force that keeps the Moon in orbit around the Earth and the Earth in orbit around the Sun, and that's a huge leap. Here he is, looking at just things around him, and then looks at the stars and has this really big realization, that that's actually the same force. So, what have you learned today talking about gravity?","41":"Right. You can do part of this level, and you can do the other part, clearly. Got some expertise under your belt, and that's awesome, because I think that everyone should know more about sleep. And so the way that we think about what drives sleep are two independent but related processes and so they have kind of lame names. Process S and process C, and what you've kind of described is process C, and that's the master clock, right? And it helps regulate kind of the rhythms like all over your body, all your cells, and all those kind of things. It drives the release of melatonin from the pineal gland, and melatonin comes online under darkness, so when the sun goes down, your brain knows okay it's time to start getting ready for sleep, and so you start releasing melatonin, which really kind of sets the table for sleeping.","42":"That's right. All the force that we apply here, goes all the way through but then it can only basically come out when it contacts the wood in that one tiny spot. And so sometimes it's the force that you push something with but sometimes it is that force per unit area. But sometimes it's not even the force per unit area 'cos, you know, push down as hard as you can on that and see if we can get it pushed in. See it doesn't really work does it?","43":"Well it depends. So if you're cutting steel, you need to have the nail. You need to have it concentrated all of the light, not going in all directions but you need it into as small a point as possible. And for that we use a lens. For a lens, the light's coming down as a column, you put in a lens, it all focuses it down in the same way as the nail and then it starts cutting that steel. Okay so that force per unit area--","44":"Exactly. And so now, if we have light like that that we wanna machine with. I bring this funnel and so, if we had a lens here and the light was coming down--","45":"When we measure all of that, we're able to see how much time someone's asleep, and how many times they wake up and stuff during the night. You know, we're also really interested in kind of, the amount of non-REM sleep someone gets and the amount of REM sleep that someone gets, because each part of those types of sleep do different things for the body. And so it's important to get both of those. And so within non-REM sleep, there are three stages ranging from N-1 to N-2 to N-3. So not particularly clever in our naming, but that's how we know what stages they are. And what they do is it moves from lightest to deepest sleep, okay? N-1, it's more kind of light, wakefulness sleep, kind of in and out of sleeping. Then you go into N-2, which is where we spend 45 to 55 percent of our sleep. And it's more this kind of light sleep, but then we get into kind of the really restorative sleep, and that's N-3. And in N-3, when we look at someone's EEG wave, we see these big slow waves, and it's called slow wave sleep. And so we spend about 20% of our sleep in slow wave sleep, though it can vary on a day to day.","46":"So these are typically semiconductors. They can be cadmium selenide cadmium sulfide, zinc selenide and they're small clusters of atoms. They can be from 2 to 10 nanometers. What's interesting about these materials?","47":"Yeah. 100%. That's right. And that's the motivation for looking at these emerging materials. But I would never bet against the innovation and the creativity in this nano electronic space. Tens of thousands of scientists, every time they hit a barrier, at least historically, as a guide, they have found a way to overcome it. It's a real marvel in ingenuity.","48":"So machine learning is a way that we teach computers to learn things about the world by looking at patterns and looking at examples of things. So can I show you an example of how a machine might learn something?","49":"That's true. Do you think, if we look at these pictures, do you think maybe we could say, Well, they both have pointy ears, but the dogs have a different kind of body and the cats like to stand up a little different.? Do you think that makes sense?","50":"This one's a jackal. And it's actually a kind of dog. But you made a good guess. That's what machines do too. They make guesses. Is this a cat or a dog?","51":"Which means that in the test, you're not seeing any problems that you don't know how to solve. As long as you did all your practice, right?","52":"Yes, we're gonna talk about science and we're gonna talk about a very specific kinda science, about people who study brains. Do you know what a brain is? What is it?","53":"Okay, well there's more cells in your brain, like way more cells, than all the stars we can see. (Daniel gasps) (Bobby laughs) And so what the connectome is, is we'd like to know where every cell in your brain is and how it talks to every other cell in your brain.","54":"Maybe a mutual acquaintance of ours, Jasper gave a example of fault injection, and I like to use that as, when I'm trying to explain fault injection, he shows a pinball machine and the pinball machine, obviously the two inputs are the two plungers when you're playing a pinball machine, but fault injection, you can tilt the entire pinball machine, right? You're just introducing some external variable that's outside of the traditional inputs that you're used to and you've now controlled the environment in a advantageous way to the user or the player. Can you give an example of some type of fault injection that you're doing or working on?","55":"We're also scratching the surface of, like, what is possible? It's not necessarily just the system itself and not necessarily that algorithm itself. Like you said, you don't necessarily need to attack the math in some cases. You can just attack that check. And I think something that's been pretty cool is looking at higher energy particles. It's going to be maybe hard to entirely confirm, but I think it'd be really, really cool to actually see. Like, I want to see one of these faults because I haven't seen it myself. And also, how do you know that you've seen it? I've started playing with, like, setting up a cloud chamber. A cloud chamber lets you actually view high energy particles going through sort of like in a small jar with some evaporated alcohol. And I thought it'd be really cool if we put some memory chip in there, like a basic memory chip and we just fill it with some data, but then you put a camera on that area and you just watch. Assuming that there is a high energy particle that actually hits that memory, that should potentially flip the energy state of that bit. The outside microcontrollers should be able to read that and actually say, Oh wait, the data, even though I'm not changing data, I'm only reading data, and we should be able to visibly or optically see it. What I'm wondering is could that be a next area of research? Because I don't think anyone's actually looking at intentionally injecting high energy particles to take over a computer, when really, you know, that's another technique for fault injection, technically speaking.","56":"You got, pretty much, you got a very good idea about it. Basically you have a star, at the core its generating energy, which is countering the pressure of all that mass trying, being pulled in by gravity. Once it can't generate that energy anymore, the core collapses, once the core is collapsing, it keeps collapsing, and collapsing, and collapsing, and that's the critical thing that makes a black hole. You have enough mass in the volume, such that the escaped velocity becomes the speed of light, once light can't escape, hence the black part. (laughs) But that's the thing, is that just because there's an intense amount of gravity very close to a black hole, things don't start behaving differently. And my favorite analogy is a vacuum, everybody thinks, like, if you point a vacuum cleaner at something, it's just gonna suck everything in--","57":"I wouldn't call them educational, but the movie Interstellar actually had, as one of the people involved in both writing it, and as a science advisor, Dr. Kip Thorne, who's a Professor at Caltech, who was part of the team that detected gravitational waves, and just won a Nobel Prize for it. So he made sure to try and get it as accurate as possible, so Interstellar, I think, is one of the best examples of getting black holes right.","58":"Well, you're absolutely right that the attention machine learning gets has grown dramatically. 20 years ago, going to gatherings and telling people what I was working on and seeing the blank face or the like, Where's the turn? and walk away. Like, Oh, no. The accessibility of the tooling, like, we can now do in, like, five lines of code something that would have taken 500 lines of very mathematical, messy, gnarly code even, you know, five years ago. And that's not an exaggeration. And there are tools that mean that pretty much anyone can pick this up and start playing with it and start to build with it. And that is also really exciting.","59":"Right. And so, to say that another way, when you're collecting data from the real world and then building machine learning systems that automate decisions based on that data, all of the biases and problems that are already in the real world then can be magnified through that machine learning system. And so, it can make many of these problems much worse.","60":"That's a rule of all flat origami no matter how many folds come together at a point and I'm going to show you a building block of tessellations, it's called a twist because that center square, as I unfold it, it twists, it rotates.","61":"Awesome, good. (laughs) It's a map of all the connections between every neuron in your brain. It literally, in a human brain, something like a map of the one quadrillion connections that a hundred billion neurons make with each other.","62":"We have to use electron microscopes and then what we have been developing a way to slice the brain into really thin slices, use an electron microscope to take a picture of each slice, and then use computers to put it all back. Imagine that we could get a map of every connection, right? And we knew how neurons fire. Do you think we could put that in a computer, that map, and then therefore, that computer should be able to think just like the brain that we extracted it from?","63":"Neurons are also digital. Meaning a Neuron either fires or it doesn't fire, so that's either one or zero. And it's the combination of those ones or zeros that actually produce the 10 thousand different answers that you say.","64":"So you do see it, basically the dust sublimation radius, and you see it at, and it tells you, depending on what kind of dust it is, and it's actually one of the problems for me studying, whenever we try and do X-ray studies of low luminosity active galactic nuclei in your, by galaxies, because there're all these X-ray binaries that are also emitting X-rays, which make our lives difficult. But they're also in black holes, when it's this really interesting sort of both, it's great, but ugh, it's also a source of noise for those of us who are trying to do X-ray observations of nearby galaxies.","65":"And this goes to the idea that you don't have a core balance, that a supernova with a black hole as its final result, actually never has any kind of expulsion, that it all just goes. (imitates sucking)","66":"Which was one idea, but again, it's, I'll leave this to your theoreticians, I think there are problems with that, as well. I call it job security. That's right. (both laugh) We have a lot of things about black holes, both in terms of their formation, or even how they exist as they are, and how they're interacting with their environment that we're still not understanding.","67":"If you train a model off of language off the internet, it sometimes says uncomfortable things or inappropriate things and sometimes really biased things. Have you ever run into this yourself? And then how do you think about that problem of potentially even measuring the bias in a model that we've trained?","68":"I imagine in the last few years, we've seen a lot of changes and improvements in the capabilities of NLP systems. So is there anything in that that you're particularly excited about exploring further?","69":"So we've been talking about gravity from Newton and celestial bodies, the Earth, the Moon, pulling on each other in the conventional sense of gravity being an attractive force, to the Earth creating curves in space-time, then we moved on to just diffused seas of energy and space-time as the real universe and gravitation is really just talking about space-time in general, and here we are, and you're really hardcore in theoretical physics. Where would you take the exposition of gravity from that point?","70":"So this is a huge crisis 'cause either quantum mechanics is wrong, and as you described it, it's the most accurately-tested paradigm in the history of physics, how could it be wrong, right? Or the event horizon is letting information out and violating one of the most sacred principles of relativity.","71":"That's a nice way of looking at it. So that you're not actually violating classical relativity once you're in a regime where the wave function has really peaked around a very well-defined stage.","72":"Yes, so one of the things I like to think of with holography is that I can pack a certain amount of information in a black hole. I mean, you can literally think of it as throwing things into it. So let's say I have information in some volume and I'm under the illusion that I can just keep packing information in that volume, as much as the volume will contain. Eventually I'll make a black hole and I'll find out that the maximum amount of information I can pack into anything in the entire universe is what I can pack on the area. And since area is projecting the illusion, maybe, of volume, maybe the whole world is just a hologram. It's not a principle that only applies to black holes. It's saying that, if this theory of quantum gravity is correct, then this while three-dimensionality is an utter illusion and really the universe is two-dimensional. That's crazy.","73":"Okay, so we'll do some, but I want to tell you a little bit about origami. Most origami follows two, I'll call them customs, almost like rules. It's usually from a square and the other is it's usually folded with no cuts. So these guys are folded from an uncut square.","74":"It's called a petal fold, it's a part of a lot of origami designs and it's key to the crane. Now we're ready for the magic. We're going to hold it in between thumb and forefinger, reach inside, grab the skinny point that's between the two layers, which are the wings, and I'm going to slide it out so it pokes out at an angle. We'll take the two wings, we spread them out to the side and you have made your first origami crane.","75":"There's thousands of other origami designs but these are some of the first people learn and this was, in fact, one of the first origami designs I learned some 50 years ago.","76":"When you say, well, there's hundreds of thousands, millions of car deaths on the road due to human error today. I think we're in a similar place. We're going to see problems with this technology, and we are going to need to develop multiple kinds of standards that also have some flexibility. But it's going to also be a version, a system, that allows us to fix some of the things that are broken today.","77":"Yeah, it's crazy. They're really a lot of bad or malicious hackers out there who are doing just that. They're going into people's accounts and they're stealing money, but there's also another side of computer hacking where there are people who are trying to learn how those bad hackers are actually breaking in to the bank accounts.","78":"You know, you're right. When you read about some of these technologies, it does feel like science fiction. But the part of nanotechnology I wanted to talk to you about is stuff that you probably use every day, most of your day, all of the time. Can you guess what aspect of nanotechnology I'm gonna talk to you about?","79":"Exactly. So these are made using a technique called lithography. You basically coat the silicon wafer with a polymer. Then you put a mask on it and then you shine light through it. And the features of the mask, the size of those holes determine the feature size in the chip. It's not just the size of the mask that matters. It's the wavelength of the light that's used. We talked about nanotechnology being science fiction before, but this is real stuff that's being produced, that's being made, that's being used every day by people.","80":"When you give up most of what you want? Well, sometimes that definitely happens for sure. What if I told you that this is the kind of technology that I work on that means you could trade with any kid all over the world?","81":"It just depends what you're trying to do. In some cases, it could literally be seconds because you already know how the system works, and other times, it could be years. So what have you learned about hacking?","82":"Yeah, you feel pinned to that. It's exactly like that. There's something called the equivalence principle where people realized, especially Einstein, that if you were in outer space in a rocket ship and it was dark and painted and it was accelerating at exactly the right rate, you actually wouldn't know if you were sitting on the floor of a building around the Earth or if you were on a rocket ship that was accelerating.","83":"That's because in some sense, you're really not. Imagine you're in this train and it's going near the speed of light relative to the platform, but it's so smooth, then you should be in a situation in which there's no meaning to your absolute motion, there's no absolute motion. So that if you throw a ball up, you might think from the outside of the platform, be confused that when gravity pulls that back down, it's gonna hit you or something, but it'll land in your palm as surely as if you were in your living room.","84":"[laughs] That's exactly right. It kinda is like recharging your battery, right? And sleep is so critical for so many parts of our body and our mind, right? It plays a really important way that we learn, and it helps us kind of recover from the day before. It affects our immune system and our metabolism, all of these things that we need to kinda be healthy.","85":"Really tired. Do you think you were a little crankier than usual? Yeah. That's actually really interesting, because what happens is humans and everything needs to sleep eventually, and so you can't stay up indefinitely, right? What do you think happens if you don't sleep?","86":"Right, right! So how do they do it? In the area that they live in, they need to stay cool, right? And so they spend a lot of time in the water, and so then as a consequence, they need to sleep in the water, but how do they do it? So it's really fascinating. What they do is while they're sleeping, they actually float back up to the surface and breathe without waking up. They're able to go about their whole sleep cycles but still able to breathe, because their body has adapted in a way that they can still get the oxygen that they need. It's a really amazing thing. What do you think?","87":"A dolphin! Yes. So dolphins, kind of like hippos, have to sleep in the water, okay? But because they're mammals, right, they need to breathe. Dolphins breathe air. They have to go up to the surface and breathe, right? And for an animal like that, it needs to figure out a way that it can sleep but also still survive, right? You know how dolphins sleep?","88":"One half of their brain at a time. So half of their brain goes to sleep, and the other half stays awake, so that they can continue to breathe and swim, and they do it in this four hours a time, so like their right part of their brain sleeps, they're able to go up to the surface and breathe. Then their left part of their brain sleeps for four hours, and it goes back and forth, back and forth, so they can kind of maintain alertness, still breathe, and survive. Is that amazing or what?","89":"Nano is kind of a funny word, right? It's a word that's used before another word, and it means one billion. What's the smallest object you can think of?","90":"If I took this stick and I was to draw 1 billion lines, the distance between those two lines would be one nanometer. So that's really all it is. It's just a measure of size. But it's really, really, really tiny, smaller than anything that we can see with our eyes. The reason why, in nanotechnology, scientists, we care about things that are that small, is because there are objects called atoms. Have you ever heard of atoms before?","91":"I study it because objects that are that small have really interesting properties. They behave completely different than objects that are big. And because of that, we can build really cool things with them. Like really fast computers, for example, or new types of batteries or new types of solar cells. And a lot of nanotechnology is kind of like playing with Legos. You take these small objects and you put them together to build something new. Something interesting that no one's built before. It's like Legos for scientists.","92":"You know an interesting topic is: what are the limits to what we can do with virtual reality? Where I'm pretty pleased with what we have today. What we can show people and say virtual reality, its cool. People get an amazing response from it. But we're still clearly a very, very long ways from reality.","93":"Mostly in VR we talk about the display and optics, the visual side of things, but we should at least tick off the other senses. And haptics is an interesting thing about virtual reality really doesn't have that aspect of touching things. You can move your hands around, you can do everything but its a disconnected experience because you know you don't have an actual solidity there. And I am pessimistic about progress in haptics technology. Almost all other areas I'm an optimist and I'm excited about what's coming up, but I don't have any brilliant vision about how we're going to revolutionize haptics and make it feel like we're touching the things in the virtual world.","94":"Yeah, that is one potential quality improvement that is still on the horizon is when we do spatialization, we use HRTF, the Head Relative Transfer Function, to make it sound like its in different places. But usually we just use this one kind of generic, here's your average human, HRTF function. Its possible, that of course, if you are right in the average then its perfect for you. But there's always people off to the extremes, that it doesn't do a very good job at. And there may be better ways to allow people to sample their own perfect HRTF which can improve the audio experience a lot. It all comes down to all these trade-offs.","95":"There was a huge concern about that at Oculus. And the term internally that went around was poisoning the well. They were very, very concerned. I mean for a long time there was a fight about whether gear VR should even be done, because the worry was if we let a product go out, like gear VR that didn't have those things. That if somebody saw it and it was bad, made them sick, made their eyes hurt, then they would be like I'm never going to try VR again. I tried it that time and it was terrible. And there was legitimate arguments about whether it was even a good idea to do that. And it turned out that yes, its obviously better to have all those things, but you can still do something that's valuable for the user without it. Its weird being at the beginning of a medium like this.","96":"So, when you say it's an inverse-square law, that means that the closer you are, the more strongly you feel the gravitational pull. And that makes sense. There's very few things that are stronger when you're further apart.","97":"You're in total free fall. Now, because things fall at the same rate, including the elevator and you, you can actually float in the elevator. If you just floated in the elevator, the two of you would drop, and you might not even know you're falling. You could take an apple and drop it in front of you, and it would float in front of you. You would actually experience weightlessness. It's called the equivalence principle. It was Einstein's happiest thought that what you're really doing when you're experiencing gravity isn't being heavy in your chair, it's falling weightlessly in the gravitational field. And that was the first step, to think of gravity as weightlessness and falling.","98":"Yeah, it would chase a curve, it would chase an arc. And the faster you throw it, the kind of longer the arc. So the second step to think about curved space-time is to say that when things fall freely around a body like the Earth, they trace curved paths, as though space-time itself, space itself was curved.","99":"You went, Oh. [Janna and Lisa laugh] So, that's the intuition, that's how Einstein gets from thinking that space-time is curved from the idea that, well, there's this field that permeates all of space, and what is really describing is the curves that things fall along. And from there, it's a very long path to finding the mathematics and the right description, that's really hard. But that intuition is so elegant and so beautiful and just comes from these two simple thought experiments.","100":"Well I'm thinking about the idea that there might be more than three dimensions of space. What is your impression of theoretical physicists who think about things like extra dimensions of space that they haven't ever seen?","101":"It does. In fact, one way that different universes might be created and be different from each other is that different universes could have effectively different numbers of dimensions. Like we have three dimensions around us, but there's people out there, aliens, who could live in five dimensional universes.","102":"We think that it would be, no all of this is incredibly speculative, and we don't know for sure. But the idea is that there is some deep down underlying laws that are universal and the same, but they show up differently, so they appear different. So the specific particles and forces and masses would be completely different in different parts of the multiverse.","103":"That's the good news. The bad news is that it only seems to work if spacetime is ten dimensional. [chuckles] So you would say well then it's wrong. It can't be right. Spacetime is not ten-dimensional. Spacetime is four dimensional. We've observed that. But instead, we say if spacetime looks four dimensional to us, but string theory, which might be the best theory we have of quantum gravity says it must be ten dimensional, maybe we can hide those extra six dimensions somehow. So here's how we could get lucky. We could imagine that there are extra dimensions of space that are curled up somehow that are so small that we can't see them. This is actually an old idea. It goes back to Kaluza and Klein right after general relativity was invented in 1915. But there's a more recent idea that says there could actually be relatively large extra dimensions. There could be extra dimensions that are actually that big, like a millimeter across that you would not have noticed. But here's the new, exciting idea. So let's imagine, okay. This is a piece of paper. But let's imagine this is our entire world. So, in other words, our real world is three dimensional, but let's imagine that we're just idealizing it down to two dimensions, so we all live here. You and I live here. But let's imagine that we're embedded in this bigger space. So there are extra dimensions that are actually big, okay? And let's imagine that. When I say we live on this three dimensional world what I mean is imagine that the particles that you and I are made of, right, the quarks, the leptons, the electrons and everything, all the forces we know about, electromagnetism, the weak nuclear force, the strong nuclear force, imagine they can't leave this surface. This is what we call a brane. B-R-A-N-E. Have you heard this word before?","104":"That's right. And we could live there. The world we see around us, the three dimensions of space around us could reflect the fact that we are somehow stuck on a three dimensional brane trying to escape.","105":"Yeah, that's exactly right. And you can append it. You can sort of add new information that's more current, but you can't actually go erase anything.","106":"Yeah. To actually transition into the mainstream and make it useful for average people to use, we're going to need to make sure we have a lot more education, a lot more standards and probably work with a lot of enterprises to create sort of a user experience around this being a technology that is safe and usable and understandable. What is the current state of blockchain in your understanding? What's gonna have to happen next?","107":"New problems arise when we try to make origami out of things other than paper, but also new opportunities. An example here which is a kind of a variant of the Miura-Ori. It's got a three-dimensional structure. If I stretch it one way, it expands the other but because it has these S-bends in the pattern, if you squeeze it, it doesn't go all the way flat. This is a epoxy impregnated aramid fiber and so if I put this fold pattern into it and then compress it and then put a skin on the top and bottom, this becomes incredibly lightweight but incredibly strong.","108":"Another origami challenge that comes up with these patterns is if we're going to make an aircraft out of this thing we're going to need hundreds of yards of folded origami. We're not going to do it by hand and this might be the new frontier in origami engineering, which is the design of machines that can fold patterns that have applications.","109":"And so it's being run by all of these different computers that have like a node. So they're all running the same software and guaranteeing your transactions as they happen.","110":"In some cases, yeah, it is. And a lot of people in the financial industry, in particular, are looking at it from the banking side of how do we use this technology to trade things like Bitcoin or other tokens that are easier to use instead of today's currency. A lot of people think about blockchain as Bitcoin because it's sort of in the news a lot, and it's this new cryptocurrency. And it's kind of exciting. But we're actually seeing a lot more use cases for blockchain that aren't around the currency side. They're more around, how do you take any asset and be able to trade that using this same technology.","111":"So today, a lot of people are working on how to create identity structures that leverage blockchains. And one of the tools for doing that is being able to cryptographically sign for a given attribute. So your government could sign that you have a US passport or a university could sign that you are a currently enrolled student. And you could then dole out that information and control it yourself and be able to show people those certifications on an as needed basis.","112":"So it's interesting, so I also saw that there was also a recent meta-analysis around sleep disturbances and dementia risk, and in that study, they looked about 250,000 people in this meta-analysis, and they followed them around for 10 years, and you know, when they pulled all the samples together, they found there was a 1.2 fold increased risk for developing all caused dementia, so it sounds like both sleep apnea and then maybe sleep disturbances more generally are associated with increased risk for dementia. When I think about that, I think about how sleep lives in the brain, these neurodegenerative diseases live in the brain, and so what do we know about the causality of this? Could it be that individuals who have early onset of say, Alzheimer's, have then poor sleep kind of as a consequence of that?","113":"Okay, so there is this bio-directional piece, but I think perhaps the most exciting thing that happened in the sleep field, at least in my view, has been understanding the role of sleep and its clearance of beta-amyloid in the brain. This idea that sleep is kind of the dishwasher of the brain, it seems like, that you know A betta accumulates as we kind of use energy, and you know it's kind of a waste product, and the idea that if you don't clear it out, that it's going to build up and accumulate.","114":"To figure out how to do that we need to learn a little bit about what makes a point. So, let's come back to the crane. You can probably tell that the corners of the square ended up as points, right?","115":"Origami artists all around the world now use ideas like this to design, not just insects, but animals, and birds, and all sorts of things that are, I think, unbelievably complex and realistic but most importantly, beautiful.","116":"I remember reading your papers when I was a student and we're all trying to create these materials and finding ways to exploit their properties. What I love, and I'm delighted that you're here to talk to us about is how you took inspiration from nature and sort of recognize that nature's figured out a way to both synthesize incredibly complex nanostructures with high functionality and how you sort of were inspired by that to do the research that you're doing now.","117":"Whenever there's a part of a spacecraft that is shaped somewhat like paper, meaning it's big and flat, we can use folding mechanisms from origami to make it smaller.","118":"These are the building blocks of many, many origami deployable shapes, it's called a degree-4 vertex. It's the number of lines. So in this case, we use solid lines for mountain, we use dash lines for valley. We're going to fold it and use these two to illustrate some important properties of origami mechanisms. It's important in the study of mechanisms to take into account the rigidity. So what we're going to do to help simulate rigidity is to take these rectangles and we're going to fold them over and over so that they just become stiff and rigid.","119":"There are many open mathematical questions and so room for mathematicians, like yourself, to have a big impact on the world of origami and mechanisms. And even though those studies are mathematically interesting, they're going to also have real-world applications in space, solar arrays, drills, telescopes, and more. Any questions or thoughts about this?","120":"So what they do, the trick for that is, if you ever at a theater and you take up the glasses and you look at it, you'll see its blurry where there's actually two pictures that they're showing at the same time. And what those little glasses do, is they let one eye see one picture, and the other eye see a different picture. So then your eyes can say, oh it looks like I'm seeing through the screen or something is floating out in front of it. In the VR headsets, what we do is, there's actually either two screens or one screen split in half, so that it draws a different picture, completely different picture, for each eye. And we make sure that each eye can only see the picture it intended to. And that's what can make things feel like they got this real depth to them, that its something that you could reach out and touch and it doesn't feel like a flat TV screen.","121":"Essentially what harmony is, is like a language, right? And so as with any language, the more words you're capable of speaking in a language, the more you can say. All right, so in harmony, this might be how many notes you can think to add to a chord to make it feel a different way. Have you ever heard of the circle of fifths?","122":"Okay, that's great. On one side, we have a lot of the notes which make us feel brighter, you know, like these kinds of, (keyboard music) these really bright sounds. And the other side is a lot more to do with the darkness of a key center. So we're home in F, but imagine we're taking a quick visit to B-flat, but then the sun comes out.","123":"Just to see how things feel. Yeah. All right, lets do it. (both playing Amazing Grace) So it's F major seven, but its over A. Which is F seven over A. (both playing) B flat major seven with an A and a G in it. F major seven with an E and a D and a G, yeah. (laughter) D minor seven with a G in it. C softs, or minor, nice. B flat major. G seven, F sharp major seven. Home, yeah! I like that. So what harmony does is just gives us even more tools to tell those stories. Cool, yeah. Nice, man.","124":"Oh, very good. You've come to the right place. So we're gonna think about physics. Have you heard the word physics before? Do you know what that is?","125":"Okay. I just think of physics as the study of everything. What stuff is, what stuff does. So today we're gonna talk about space, and in particular the idea of dimensions. Have you heard about dimensions?","126":"And how would you find yourself, like if someone said where are you, could you use some words or ideas to say where you are on that line?","127":"So those are the dimensions. That's how we think about dimensions. Remember, we just needed one number to find ourselves on the line, we need two numbers to find ourselves on the plane.","128":"This is why physicists think about things we don't know about. We're wondering whether there could be extra dimensions you've never seen. Yeah. That are tinier than atoms. So, okay. So what have you learned? What do you know about dimensions now? How do you think about dimensions in a slightly different way than you did before?","129":"So typically, you would choose deep learning if you have sufficient high quality data, hopefully labeled in a useful way. If you really are happy not to necessarily understand or be able to interpret what your system is doing or you're willing to invest in another set of work afterwards to understand what the system is doing once you've already trained it. And this also comes down to the fact that some things are actually really easy to solve with linear regression or simple statistical approaches. And some things are impossible.","130":"Yeah. This is actually a good example of a very real world kind of machine learning problem where the solution to this was to build an interpretable system on top of the accurate predictions not to throw it away, but to do a bunch more work to figure out the why.","131":"It's actually fairly new that we're able to solve all of these problems and start to build these products and apply it in businesses and apply it, you know, everywhere. And so, we're still developing good practices and what it means to be a professional in machine learning. We're really developing a notion of what good looks like.","132":"Yeah. We do a lot of X-ray in addition to EM and this is actually, I'm not saying it's the only problem, but it's the only problem that needs to be solved right away, is that the data analysis, right? In fact, I think we calculated that there aren't enough humans ever to map a mouse brain where you collect every connection and et cetera so the problem is to get algorithms to trace, to recognize things in brains the way humans would recognize things in brains, or map things, trace things in brains. It's gonna cost a lot of money to imagine setting the gold standard for the wiring diagram even once and those are the kinds of ethical concerns that I'm worried about.","133":"Good to see you Mike, nice to have you here with me. So we go way back. 1991, the year I got married, I moved across the country, left my husband in New Jersey, to work with you in Livermore.","134":"And I've been talking sort of, started with sort of what is a laser through linear optics, non linear optics, high intensity laser physics, and saying that you know, we're trying to get to that Schwinger limit of 10 to the 29 watts per square centimeter. We're about somewhere just shy of 10 to the 23 I think at this point. But even if we get to 100 petawatts and focus that down to a wavelength, we're not at 10 to the 29. So you're hoping to build the biggest laser.","135":"Okay, but that's kind of cheating. That's not getting to 10 to the 29. If you could do it with 100% efficiency that's all we need.","136":"And that's, like you said, we're stuck a little bit, we're not up to that kind of acceleration, so that would be a Nobel Prize winning possible idea.","137":"Or we need, going around and giving my talks now, I show how we're plateauing. I showed how there was a plateau, CPA raises it up, but we're sort of starting to plateau again and we need another Nobel Prize winning idea. And so do you think it's on the horizon? Do you see anything out there that really says, oh yeah that's a good way to go? 'Cos we're gonna have to get out to the x-rays right? We can't stay in the visual.","138":"And right across the beam. Don't you think that's gonna be the challenge? 'Cos it's not like our beams are as perfect as we like to think they are.","139":"So where people are swiping credit cards, those credit card numbers were stolen. They hired a company to come in and perform a penetration test to see, can the good guys essentially break in again to prevent this sort of thing in the future? And when this team came in, they found they actually were able to get pretty much to the same point of sale system, and the way they did that was by exploiting an internet-connected deli meat scale. Once the company was able to essentially get into the deli scale, because the deli scale was on the internal network, then they were able to really escalate privilege and find a vulnerability within another system. Essentially, that just got them into the network. and once you're in the network, it's often really easy to then escalate from there.","140":"Yeah, that's another interesting concept. It's really just different layers that we have for protection, because often when you're talking about something like a corporate network, or even your home network, you typically have sort of one level of defense, right? If someone can break that or it can get in through some other system that is connected or exposes some other protocol, like Bluetooth, right? You can connect to a Bluetooth device without being on the wireless network, without being on the LAN. That potentially gives you another place that you can pivot on and then access other devices, because if something has both Bluetooth and also Wi-Fi, well, if you can get in through Bluetooth, then you can then access the Wi-Fi and get to other devices on the network. Are you familiar with buffer overflows?","141":"That's true, that laser's just a dot. And so the other thing to notice though is that, like if I shine it in your eyes and I'm sorry if I do! But it seems awfully bright doesn't it? And yet when, you know, you shine this down and you put the laser, which one do you see easier?","142":"And that's because the light will go through this glass and, when it hits that corner, it has to bend. And we actually send laser beams down glass fibers, the size of your hair.","143":"You don't have a cat. So you don't need a cat toy no. Have you ever gone to a grocery store and just scanned your objects over?","144":"Oh you got to see a shooting star? Well that's cool, that's nature giving you the show there. So what do you think about lasers? You think they're fun?","145":"The risk right now, just during this quarantine, is actually massive now that we think about it, because you might have these legacy systems. You know, they were built 20, 30 years ago, and it's too costly to upgrade, but now you can't actually have a lot of people in a single location, so potentially, they actually do have to now add some sort of remote capabilities to these systems that were never meant to be on the internet. Have you ever had any ethical concerns with the stuff you're interested in or the work you do?","146":"It's basically a network of computers that all have the same history of transactions. And so instead of sort of there being one company with one database that holds all the information, the same sort of list is held by all these different people. Like, you could have it on your computer. And then it gets validated by everyone, and basically, that turns into the next part of the list. So it's sort of constantly updating itself.","147":"So it's kinda this like really big ledger or accounting system for all sorts of things that get traded, but instead of being owned by one company, it's owned by everybody.","148":"Well a lot of lasers and when lasers first came along, they were only single color. Your cat toy, would only be a single color, probably a red one and so that's just one color. And one color means that it has to really be there for the whole time. One color is one wave length of light and so it's just one wave that goes on and on and on. If you want a short pulse, you actually have to have all the colors. And if you can imagine that one point in time, and I like to say it's like a conductor of an orchestra. When you're listening to an orchestra warm up, they sound terrible, they're all playing their own notes. But when the conductor conducts them, they all play different notes but, together, it's beautiful music. So we have something in the laser called a mode locker and it's like the conductor and it says go now. And all the colors will start together but some colors are long wave length and others are shorter. So next thing you know, you have peaks meeting valleys and they cancel each other. And the more colors you can bring in, the faster that happens and the shorter the pulse you can make.","149":"Yeah. The amazing thing about harmony is that it exists in nature. So, take the harmonic series of the note F, for example. Okay. You have the ups on the fifth and the fourth and then the, (hums) That seemed a little bit sharp, but that's fine. And then tones get increasingly small. Beneath that note, you have the undertone series, which essentially is like a reflection of something. In the same way that when a tree grows in nature, you have the branches which grow upwards and the roots which go downwards. So it's quite a nice thing to thing about, this being the key center, the floor, the ground, and then these two different directions of ways in which it can express itself, and the differences in the sensations with that. Lots of the time I think when it comes to reharmonization or harmonization, people think that the solution to the problems come when we add more notes.","150":"I think that people forget that you can work with the notes you already have by just rearranging them, just the simple idea of inversion, inversion of the simple triad, of F major. \u266aI once was lost and now I'm found \u266a \u266a Was blind \u266a \u266a But now I see \u266a Now how home do I want to go here, you know? Is there another verse to come?","151":"Because I can delay the gratification of going home. First of all, just by using inversions, even before we add the notes to the chord. One thing that I was very joyful to discover is that every single melody note works with every single base note.","152":"That's it! (laughs) A flat soft, A flat major seven. A flat major seven sharp five, with a sharp 11. Essentially, what that demonstrates is that every note and every base note are compatible. So once we realize this its like, that's great! Now what should we do? What, how, what should we, what should we, how, what am I supposed to do? What to do, right. And sometimes the paralyzing thing when it comes to arranging, there are too many options, too many things are possible. So that's when it becomes super, super important to be aware of what you wanna try and say emotionally.","153":"So essentially, the way I'd apply negative harmony would be this idea of polarity, you know, between the overtone series and the undertone series, or you know, the one side and the other side. The perfect and the play goal. The feeling of a minor perfect-- (keyboard music) Resolving, it's so moving, you know? And it's a good alternative to something like, (keyboard music)","154":"So, there's a lot about context, I think. Once you have a language, it's about using it and applying it in those emotional ways. I think that's what makes the difference.","155":"That's good, that's a great place to start. There are cells in your brain. Those brain cells are connected by wires to each other. Electricity travels down those wires and communicates from one part of the brain to the other part of the brain, and each of those brain cells makes, you know, a thousand connections, it's something like a hundred trillion connections.","156":"I would say that that map also has your feelings in it because, here's why, your feelings, most neuroscientists think, come from your brain anyway, and amazingly, whether when you feel happy or sad or angry or scared, that's just brain cells communicating with each other.","157":"Huh. It would be like if you simulated a hurricane. Imagine we could keep track of every variable of a hurricane. Ever. Wind speed, every water molecule, et cetera, et cetera. Temperature. And we put that inside a super-fast computer and we simulated it, right? I don't think anyone would think that the inside of the computer would get wet. Even though we had simulated the hurricane perfectly, that wetness is consciousness, it's what we are. Is it ethical to imagine mapping a male brain versus a female brain to look for differences between those, to explain alleged behavioral differences between them?","158":"Like how can that possibly be? What I wanna do is prove to you that I know this combination without revealing the combination to you. And what you could do is you could write a little note, a secret that I definitely wouldn't know. Fold it up, stick it in here. And then, if I know the combination, I should be able to open it and tell you what you wrote. All right. There we go. All right. So,My dog is named Doug. Did you figure out what the combination was?","159":"So you're asking like, why shouldn't I just share my secrets with somebody? People don't trust each other. And if I was able to prove that I've done something correctly to someone without having to reveal my secrets, then that person would trust me more.","160":"What would you guys do? You'd probably first get together and like, figure out some secret code, right? And then like, write messages to each other in that code. But what if you've never met the person before? What if you wanna exchange secret messages with me and we've never met each other before? How could we possibly do that?","161":"Is there any particular memory for you that you feel has been either kind of influential in your, in deciding which areas to pursue or that you feel is sort of emblematic of what it is to have a memory?","162":"The best way to kind of think about that distinction really goes back historically to one of the most important discoveries in memory research. The patient was referred to famously as patient HM. The neurosurgeon went in and removed the tissue that happened to be right around the hippocampus on both the left side and the right side of HM's brain. But then they started noticing something odd in his behavior. He was not able to create new memories of the experiences he had after the surgery. And that led Brenda Milner and her colleagues to report that the hippocampus was very important for memory, but a one particular kind, these sort of explicit, or as now referred to them episodic memories. But the hippocampus was not necessary for learning skills like mirror tracing, things that you can't necessarily articulate but you just get better at over time. And it really led to a couple of decades or more even of an enormous amount of very important work that kind of kept on breaking memory down further and further into different types. Episodic and semantic as both forms of explicit memory where episodic refers to memory for an event that happened like what you did yesterday morning and semantic refers to general knowledge about the world. Implicit memory is being broken down into a bunch of different kinds like skills or habits or conditioning. And when I started graduate school, many of us felt kind of the next question was really to understand how do we now understand how they work together. This was right around when functional magnetic resonance imaging started becoming a popular tool for measuring brain activity. We could scan the entire brain and we could ask questions about multiple brain regions at once. And we discovered that what we might expect during a skill learning task that only the striatum might show activity, that we also saw the activity in the hippocampus. Or when we asked someone to form an episodic memory that we thought might depend only on the hippocampus we suddenly also saw activity in the prefrontal cortex. And so the confluence of these new ideas and questions about how different forms of memory interact together with the development of new tools for studying the human mind and brain allowed us to kind of adjust our view of memory systems, to think of them less as multiple completely separate independent systems and instead to try to understand how they really work in concert with each other and give rise to all kinds of behaviors that might not fit neatly into one category or another.","163":"I love math for the same reason. Today, I'm gonna tell you about a thing called zero-knowledge proof. So in a zero-knowledge proof, there are two people. There's a prover and a verifier. And I wanna prove that something is true to you. But the weird thing is, I wanna prove to you that it's true without telling you any reasons why. I remember when I first heard about it, I was like, wait, what? How can that possibly be? Right?","164":"But what if I could prove to you that I know where the puffin is without revealing to you where it is? Let me show you. I took that photo that we showed you. And I put it behind this poster here. Why don't you go take a look through that hole?","165":"So when you look at this board, we don't know where the photo was, right? Was the photo like with the corner here? In which case the puffin would be all the way at this side. Or was the photo with the corner here? In which case the puffin would be on the other side. So this is a really simple example of a zero-knowledge proof. I convinced you that I knew where the puffin was, but you didn't learn anything else.","166":"What if instead, we could somehow use a zero-knowledge proof to log in. You would just be able to prove that, hey, I'm Chelsea, without revealing anything to them. If you could do that, then it would be amazing, right?","167":"Because then even if the hacker hacked into the computer, he wouldn't learn anything. Because even the computer doesn't learn anything. So Chelsea, in your own words, what is a zero-knowledge proof?","168":"Room number one. Exactly. I'm gonna use this symbol for infinity, but what we've just shown is that one, the one new guest plus infinity is equal to the same infinity. What happens if we had a second guest?","169":"So when I'm teaching calculus and talking about concepts like limits and derivatives, those are only defined precisely with infinity. Teaching algebra, which is meant in a different sense about number systems, we deal with infinite families of numbers in their operations. Infinite sets are somehow very exotic. They're not found so commonly in their real world, but they're all over mathematics.","170":"It describes something in AI, which is that things that are really intuitive and easy for humans, are actually really difficult to build into AI systems. And on the flip side, picking up an object, really simple for people, but it's actually really difficult to build that into robotic systems. So do you have any experience working with robots or other AI systems?","171":"Deep learning is a common toolbox for addressing some of these challenges, because it allows us to leverage large data sets. And so, deep learning is basically, corresponds to methods for training these artificial neural networks. Another common method that comes up is reinforcement learning. A third kind of algorithm is meta learning algorithms. And these algorithms learn not just from the most recent experience on the current task, but leverage experience from other task in the past. And they're not just completely separate. We can combine the aspects of these algorithms into a single method that gets the benefits of each of them.","172":"The Mandelbrot set or the Julia set, you know, the idea is always, oh, I'm gonna apply some polynomial over and over again. Z squared plus C or something like that. When I think about fractals, I try to get away from these very specific examples and ask, what is it fundamentally that makes a fractal, a fractal. And one thing that I think you can be precise about, even if you can't really say exactly what a fractal is, is you can talk about this idea of fractal dimension. Have you ever heard of that?","173":"So it's not quite as solid as the apple, but it's also not quite as two dimensional as the original sheet of paper. And so for this reason, people associate this crumpled ball with a fractal dimension, maybe something like 2.5 dimensions instead of two or three, there are a lot of different definitions, precise definitions of fractal dimension. But I think the one that's easiest to understand is this thing called box counting dimension. You have, let's say an image and you want to decide what's the fractal dimension of this image. So what you're gonna do is you're gonna count the number of boxes, or you can imagine big pixels of this image that cover the boundary of this shape. And you're gonna see how does that counting compare with how the counts work for just an ordinary shape? So, so if I have a straight line and I start out with one big box that covers the whole line, and now I shrink my boxes by a factor of two, I just make boxes half as big. How many boxes will I need to cover that line?","174":"And so what this box counting is getting at is saying, well, I still can never decide what the length of the coastline is, but what I can do is I can see how quick does the number of boxes grow relative to how it would grow just for an ordinary one dimensional curve, like a line or a circle.","175":"Yeah like perlin noise is a great example, right? Perlin noise was one of the early ways of synthesizing additional texture at any level of detail that you needed to make things look natural and realistic. I have a, a random question. Do you know how the research into fractals began? You can look pretty far back in history to see kind of glimmers of this idea of fractals in science in the 19th century, people were trying to look for examples of things in mathematics that were very unnatural. So there was, for instance, this guy named Georg Cantor, who was showing that you can have these sets with really strange properties, or you can have functions with really strange properties. This thing called the devil staircase and so on. And it wasn't until about a century later where someone named Mendel Brock said, Oh, actually this strange mathematics that was meant to show how unnatural things can happen is actually a perfect description of things that really do happen in nature. And from there, people really ran with it and said, Oh, okay, well, if these fractal descriptions are good for nature, we can also use that for creating really realistic and believable pictures in computer graphics.","176":"Exactly, right? That seemed pretty simple for the robot to do. Say we even just move the cup over here. Do you think the robot would still be able to stack the cups?","177":"Exactly. So, Moravec's paradox is something that means that these really simple things, like stacking cups, is really, really hard for robots, even though it's really easy for us. While robots are actually really good at really complicated and really difficult things. Think about the task of multiplying two really big numbers together.","178":"What you're basically asking is, wait, what? Right? Right. So this is what makes zero-knowledge proof so fascinating, and so counter-intuitive. And I think the best way I can explain it to you is by means of an example. But before we do that, I have to decide what I'm gonna prove to you in a, with a zero-knowledge proof.","179":"Right? So now, of course, one way to get more confidence is to open up more of them for you, but that would be revealing information to you. I don't wanna do that. So instead, I'm gonna ask you to please turn around. And now, let's change up these colors. Can you pick two countries at random and we'll reveal two of the colors again.","180":"It's not about making something more efficient. It's about doing things that we just didn't know how to do before. I can actually prove to you without revealing to you any of my secrets that I use to behave honestly. Right? I could prove to you that I signed some encrypted document correctly. Right? Without revealing to you what that secret document was. That ability to change the game. Like, really just change what we can do is what zero-knowledge brings to the table.","181":"One great example is like in elections. If you could prove that an election was correctly conducted. That every vote was counted, and it all added up to one person winning with a particular total, in zero-knowledge, then you don't have to give up the actual votes of any person. And yet everyone could see that, hey, yeah, it was done correctly.","182":"It's pretty amazing, right? Because it happened like a year or two ago. Our memory is basically a record in our brain of something that happened in the past, but that record it created isn't perfect. So that day, do you remember was the pool at your hotel?","183":"When you were telling me about the sandbox, it felt like you didn't have to make that guess, that you could just see the sandbox in your eyes. I asked you about the towel. It doesn't come to mind immediately, but you can stop and think about it and kind of make a good guess because there are things you know about the world. And for those of us who study memory that's a really strong hint as to how memory works. And so for you your memory kept all the fun stuff and all the stuff that was important to you, but the details like did you have to have a ticket to get in or how you got there, all these other less interesting, less exciting aspects, your brain kind of decided letting go of all that information.","184":"Right? Yeah. So that's already a really good idea of what a fractal is. It has some really, really interesting detail at all, scales that makes it hard to talk about standard quantities like lengths and areas and volumes.","185":"Yeah, totally.  Like it's a shape that you can't use sort of the ordinary language that we use to talk about shapes you really need some other ideas or concepts to talk about.","186":"Our topic today is quantum sensing. So quantum is about the study of stuff that's really, really, really small and sensing is about measuring. So the word sensing comes from kind of like our senses. So do you know what your five senses are?","187":"Touch, exactly. So it's kind of really important for us to be able to have these senses, so we know what's happening in the world around us, right? In doing quantum sensing is we're trying to measure things that can be hard to see. Let me show you. Can you see inside it with your eyes?","188":"You wouldn't be able to see into the middle. If you had the right tools, you could start to think about ways to look inside the ball without cutting it open. That would then, you'd still have your ball. We could still play with it.","189":"For example, we want to go inside, let's say the human body and see what's happening. Sometimes we can look under the surface of the Earth and see what's underneath it. We can make really, really precise clocks that will tell us, that can measure time really, really accurately. And we can make very, very fine measurements that'll tell us about the rules of science and how the world works around us. But we need to build better tools that allow us to do that.","190":"In a way, it's part of the same continuum. What you're doing is changing the technological platform and you're actually able to probe it more sensitively. The resolution you're able to get is much higher, so you can see smaller signals in a much smaller volume.","191":"You have to be close to it. You can detect it optically because if we tried to detect the magnetic moment of the electron, we wouldn't be able to do that because there, the energy is too low compared to thermal energies. But what the diamond system gives you is a natural up conversion in energy. So you can couple into an optical photon, which is then much easier to detect a single optical photon than it is to detect a micro wave.","192":"I think as you said, you know, anything that interferes with my signal is noise, but it can come from different sources. In some ways, the operation of the quantum system itself, as it's sensitive to different physical phenomena, the ones that I don't like, I call noise. The ones I do like, I call signal and that's an artificial definition that I'm making when I choose to build a sensor. One of the challenges we have is, we're trying to figure out if I wanna control it, where is it coming from? I remember we had experiments running in our lab one day and we were running these experiments about 100 megahertz. All of a sudden, we saw these big spikes coming in and we realized we're picking up the local FM stations.","193":"Right. People bring in very different perspectives into what used to be a very niche field. I remember in physics, you'd only talk to people in your subfield and now we're picking up the phone and talking to people in the different departments, completely different areas and we're forced to learn different languages.","194":"it's something that we've already figured out for classical computing like something that amazes me is all the parallels between what we're going through now for quantum computing and what we went through for classical computing","195":"it let's talk about some of the things we think need to happen between now and fully fault tolerant quantum computers to get us to that reality i mean there's so many things that need to happen in my mind one of the things we need to do is build all these different layers of abstraction that make it easier for programmers to come in and just enter at the ground level you know","196":"Yeah it looks really blocky. And it's the same thing not only with shapes and games, but also colors and textures. And this is an especially a big problem in virtual reality because you have no control over where people are gonna go. What they're gonna look at, how close they're gonna get to various objects. So fractals on the other hand are these things that have infinitely, you know, nice details you get closer and closer and closer. And so this is something that can help us solve this problem in computer graphics of generating more detail. One of the reasons why fractals are really nice for computer graphics is because the algorithms that we use to draw images also have this kind of recursive flavor. What's recursion?","197":"They're easy for a computer to execute, right? It just has to run this recursive procedure over and over and over again. We can kind of get as much detail as we want or need. When I think about fractals and kind of what they've done for computer graphics. The example I think is subdivision surfaces. Did you, did you encounter subdivision surfaces in your graphics class at all?","198":"Because I want to draw a smooth curve on the screen, but all my computer can do is draw straight lines. And that's actually too true of GPUs. It's kind of interesting. GPUs are basically really fast machines that can only draw one thing and that's a flat triangle. And so if we keep doing this with our paper, you kind of get pretty quickly the idea of what's gonna happen. So when you go to see a Pixar movie, for instance, every surface has been subdivided down. So you have tiny little triangles called micro polygons that are even smaller than the size of a pixel.","199":"So we've, talked a little bit about the positive features of fractals and procedural graphics, which is you can write one simple recursive program and the computer creates a lot of detail for you. So that's really nice, right? It's saving you a lot of work, but the downside is you lose a lot of control. So because the only thing you're describing is this short little program, you don't have complete control over how this is gonna end up. And so adding more controllability to procedural graphics is something people have been thinking about for many years. So how has our conversation changed your understanding of what fractals are all about?","200":"There's a lot big, right? And so remember, this was a Department of Defense, was they wanted to have forms of of communication that were very robust, that were survivable. Packets could all find their own ways, be routed differently through the network. So if parts of the network failed, you could route around failures.","201":"So you can sort of see how the network architecture that wasn't designed to be 100% reliable inside the core of the network, and had that complexity built into the edges of the network. And to me, the really cool thing is you put this infrastructure in place, and then all these super creative people think about amazing things to build on top of it. And you see this proliferation of amazing applications.","202":"Ah ha! Spoken like a real computer scientist, right? You're a computer scientist. I'm a computer scientist. We talk about APIs, application programming interfaces. The API for the internet is something called a socket. And a socket simply says, I can communicate if I know your internet address, you know, 128.119.40.186, that number is the IP address of my server, the University of Massachusetts. If you know that, you can write a program anywhere in the world and send a message, and it'll pop out at my end.","203":"Exactly, right. And maybe they're dropped in your apartment, but much more likely, they're dropped because of congestion somewhere between the Hulu or the Netflix or the Disney server, if you're watching a video, and your home. So even though you've got 200 megabits per second on that last hop, you don't have 200 megabits per second from the server into your apartment.","204":"Yeah. It is exactly using quantum phenomena to sense and measure things and the idea is that, if I can harness quantum phenomena and I can push the limits that are possible, I can get something that's ultimately more precise and potentially more accurate over time too.","205":"So that's in some ways the key to both quantum sensing, as well as quantum computing. It's the idea that you can take a system and put it in a superposition of two states. Normally we think of classically a bit can be a zero or a one. So switch is either on or off. Whereas in a quantum system, it can be in what's called a superposition. So it can be partially on and partially off. But one of the challenges with quantum systems is that these superpositions are really hard to maintain because we don't see superpositions in the world around us. In quantum computing, you try really hard to isolate everything so that you can maintain this quantum property and the fact that it's actually going to lose its quantum properties as it interacts with the world also makes it a great sensor because now you're actually, you're using that fact that it's interacting with the world to say, wait, it's sensing something.","206":"So rather than trying to build a lot of complex algorithms and gates with it, what you do is, you take these quantum bits and you take them out into the world and say, what do you see? What are you sensitive to? So you can use an idea called entanglement to make an even more sensitive quantum sensor, but it's even more fragile. So there's always this trade-off between being super fragile and being super sensitive at the same time.","207":"So some ways, you know, when atomic clocks were designed and built, we didn't necessarily think of GPS, but technology often works that way is that, there are new discoveries and then someone else comes along and says, hey, this is a great tool for some other application.","208":"Well, we're gonna be talking about computers here today, and we're gonna be talking about the internet. I always like to think of the internet by analogy to say road systems for example, where you have roads in your neighborhood. You have state roads, you have the Interstate Highway System. And so the internet is a lot like that. It's an interconnection of local roads, local networks like the network in your house for example.","209":"Wow. Great question. Often, it's a little blue wire called an ethernet cable. So that cable is able to bring bits of information up into your apartment at say, a billion bits per second. That's pretty fast, right? Literally a wire that goes between a box in your apartment, sometimes called a router or a modem in your apartment that comes from an internet service provider come into this first network and then that network connects to another network connects to another network connects to another network.","210":"We could talk about that by analogy to a road system. It's not just one big, super highway. It's a lot of smaller super highways that are all interconnected. And those interchanges are what are called routers. That's where the links come together. You're talking about talking to a friend in Australia. So oh, it's coming in from the East Coast of the United States to this router, and it's going out say, that routers in San Francisco, it's going out on an underseas cable over to Australia rather than in this direction up to Japan.","211":"That's really what we call the first hop. It's like from your phone, from your tablet, from the computer that you're on, there's no cables coming in. You go over a wireless connection. Wi-Fi is the protocol that allows your computer to talk to that first hop router over a wireless communication link.","212":"Ah, another great question. There's a couple of things that could happen inside the internet. Information is sent in these little packets of information from the Netflix server to your display device. And literally, each packet that arrives says, This is the first packet for Jenna. This is the second. This is the third. This is the fifth. This is the fourth. And they're reordered for you. Matter of fact, your computer will say, using the TCP protocol to the server, Hey, I didn't get packet four, can you resend it again? And again, the Netflix server is very happy to send you packet four again. The other is the internet protocol. If you think about sending letters through the US Postal Service, how you've got an address on it. So every packet that flows from the Netflix server to you has an address on it. It says, This is going to Jenna. It's going to the what's called the Internet Protocol address of your device. Think of all the range of devices that are hooked up to the internet. It's totally amazing, right? Every single one of them has one thing in common, and that is they speak the IP protocol, the Internet Protocol. That was a great question.","213":"That's the computer science brain thinking right there. So we wanna think of a function as procedure or mapping between sets. So a function defines a one-to-one correspondence if it defines a perfect matching between the elements of its domain set and the elements of its output set. We call such functions bijections or isomorphisms. So the reason I'm so interested in this idea of a bijective function or a one-to-one correspondence that guarantees that every element of one set gets matched with an element of the other set, no matter how many elements there are, these bijections or these one-to-one correspondences as they help mathematicians reason about infinity.","214":"Maybe two. Why not? Because now we're starting to make progress on matching all the negatives. We can match the natural number three with the integer two, the natural number four with the integer minus two. And do you see a pattern?","215":"Great. So now I have a much harder question. So we have the same challenge, again, evidently there are way, way, way more rational numbers than there are integers. Does that mean this is a larger infinite set than the integers? What do you think?","216":"Exactly. That's exactly right. So we were hoping to compare the size of infinity of the rational numbers with the size of infinity of the natural numbers. What we've done is introduced an intermediate set, these pair of integer points, and this proves that this size of infinity is smaller than this size of infinity. Since we also have an injective function the other way, this size of infinity is smaller than this size of infinity so therefore they must be the same size.","217":"Really glad you asked me that. There's a practical implication for computer science. Alan Turing, he came up with a mathematical model of a computer, something called a Turing machine. So Turing was wondering is it possible to compute every real number, an arbitrary real number to within arbitrary precision in finite time? He defined a real number to be computable< if you could calculate its value, maybe not exactly, but as accurately as you'd like in a finite amount of time. And because there are uncountably infinitely many real numbers, but only a countably infinitely many Turing machines, what that means is that the vast majority of real numbers are uncomputable. So we'll never be able to access them with a computer program.","218":"yeah this whole infrastructure is all about creating levels that get progressively colder as you go from top to bottom down to the quantum chip which is how we actually control the state of the cupids","219":"okay so it's this idea that you have two objects and when you entangle them together they become connected and then they're sort of permanently connected to each other and they behave in ways that are sort of a system now so superposition is one quantum property that we use entanglement is another quantum property and a third is interference how much you know about interference","220":"so step one is you need to be able to have an object or physical device we call it a qubit or quantum bit that can actually handle those things can actually be put into superpositions of states you know two cubit states that you can physically entangle with each other that's not really trivial right and things in our classical world you can't really entangle things in our classical world so easily we need to use devices where they can they can support a quantum state and we can manipulate that quantum state atoms ions and in our case superconducting qubits we make qubits out of superconducting materials","221":"it's a perfect question i mean it's very early for quantum computing but we're building assembly languages we're building layers of abstraction that are going to get you to a point as a programmer where you can interchangeably be programming something the way that you already do and then make calls to a quantum computer so that you can bring it in when it makes sense we're not envisioning quantum computers completely replacing classical computers anytime soon we think that quantum computing is going to be used to accelerate the kinds of things that are really hard for for classical machines","222":"simulating nature is something that's really hard because if you take something like you know modeling atomic bonding and electronic orbital overlap instead of now writing out a giant summation over many terms you try and actually mimic the system you're trying to simulate directly on a quantum computer which we can do for chemistry and uh we're looking at ways of doing that for other types of things there's a lot of exciting research right now on machine learning trying to use quantum systems to accelerate machine learning problems","223":"I can also ask how big it is, which is a question about its volume. If I make it smaller, then what's happening is it's becoming more dense. So imagine I crushed this really, really small. It would weigh the same, it would have the same mass, but it would be much more dense.","224":"Well, that's a really good question. So interestingly, the sun itself isn't heavy enough. So it has to be heavy enough that when it begins to collapse, it just overcomes all attempts to fight it. If you made something really dense, you would have to travel faster than the speed of light to actually escape. That's 300,000 kilometers per second.","225":"So it goes so fast that it goes completely dark. Any light that veers too close will fall in, will not be able to make it back out again. If a light is shining from the sun near a black hole, the black hole's not touching it. Why does the light get pulled in? Why does that happen?","226":"It is taking other stuff, but the funny question was like, if I wanted to move your chair, you'd think it was really strange if I didn't have to come near you and actually grab the chair and move it. One of the things Einstein thought about is he imagined that what the black hole is doing is it's changing the shape of space around it. What do you think of that idea?","227":"So one of my main research areas is something called category theory, it's been described as the mathematics of mathematics. It's a language that can be used to prove very general theorems. And an interesting aspect of being a researcher in category theory that doesn't come up as much in other areas is that we have to really pay attention to the axioms of set theory in our work. When you're proving theorems, have you ever used the axiom of choice?","228":"We're used to ethernet cables that can handle many hundreds of gigabits per second over a wired device. What are the typical data rates for IoT devices? I mean, not hundreds of gigabits.","229":"My sense is you're spot on, that they'll produce over time, a lot of data. And that a lot of IoT is about computing on that data. That computation happened mostly at the edge, or somehow a combination between the edge and something happening in a far away data center.","230":"I think for a long time, the internet hasn't grappled with, but now has with IoT and also with cellular networks, generally is the question of mobility. Do you imagine in the future that it might be possible for mobile devices not to always have to connect through the same provider to go from one network to another?","231":"in a zero-knowledge way, without any interaction, right. I can just take the program, convert it to a zero-knowledge program, or an obfuscated program, and then just send it to you.","232":"We're definitely at this moment now, where zero-knowledge is gonna be used more and more. There are so many conferences and meetings that occur in the zero-knowledge space, where you and I are not invited. Because it's for the people who are developing. You know, the people who are programming, not us mathematicians.","233":"It's a great question. I wish I could see the future. I can't actually, but let me try. The part of that that I'm the most comfortable answering is of course the mathematical side.","234":"Yeah, and probably nobody is. Have you heard a lot in your studies about these super massive black holes that we think lurk in the centers of very nearly every galaxy?","235":"Yeah, I think it's a really good question. The only mechanism that we know for sure can form black holes is to collapse of very massive stars. So it's sensible to think, well maybe some very massive stars in a young universe collapsed under their own weight and then they merged and after some time they got big enough, but the black holes from stars can be tens of times the mass of the sun, maybe hundreds of times to the mass of the sun if they merge. To get to millions and billions, and if you just do the simple arithmetic of how many years that would take, there aren't enough years in the 14 billion years of the universe's lifetime. So they must have come from somewhere else.","236":"There might be many alternate routes. It might be in the very early universe that bubbles in unusual phase transitions from very high energy universe to a low energy universe can make black holes. Like, we haven't really thought of the range of possibilities.And so there could also be primordial black holes that are still around that also skipped the star stage altogether that were formed really in the very earliest phases. And I think the interesting thing is, with your looking at like the Large Magellanic Cloud, is to wonder if we're gonna merge.","237":"Yeah, and it's very possible that as you said, the collision won't be so severe that it'll be very disruptive. So our entire solar system could stay intact and here we would go with the sun and all the other planets in orbit around a new black hole.","238":"So Claire, we've had this pretty fascinating conversation about supermassive black holes in particular. And after our discussion, what is it that has changed for you in your perspective or what is it that excites you?","239":"and actually machine learning is one research direction where we're really hoping that we're going to find um key parts of the machine learning computation that can be sped up using quantum computing","240":"if you think about even just classical information like bits right at the end of the day when you store a bit in your hard drive there's a magnetic domain and you have a magnetic polarization right","241":"so what we do when we try to solve problems with a quantum computer is we encode parts of the problem we're trying to solve into a complex quantum state and then we manipulate that state to drive it towards what will eventually represent the solution","242":"so you need a chip with qubits each qubit is a carrier of quantum information and the way we control the state of that qubit is using microwave pulses you send them all the way down these cables and we've calibrated these microwave pulses so that we know exactly this kind of pulse what this frequency and this duration will put the cupid into superposition or we'll flip the state of the qubit from zero to one or if we apply a microwave pulse between two qubits we can entangle them","243":"there's sort of two main classes of quantum algorithms there's algorithms which were developed for decades right things like shore's algorithm which is for factoring grover's algorithm for unstructured search and these algorithms were designed assuming that you had a perfect fault tolerant quantum computer which is many decades away so we're currently in a phase where we're exploring what can we do with these near-term quantum computers and the answer is going to be well we need different kinds of algorithms to really even explore that question","244":"yeah they also unfortunately require fault tolerance right now the algorithms that we know of today to do those things um on a quantum computer require you to have millions of error-corrected qubits today we're at like 50. it's actually amazing that we're at 50. there's things that we know or we have strong reason to believe um are going to be faster to do on a quantum computer and then there's things that we'll discover just by virtue of having one","245":"One thing I find really fascinating about robotics is that the things that are so simple for us, like feeding yourself broccoli, so second nature to us, are really hard for robotics. When you try to take a robot and train it to do a task and simulation, and the simulation isn't perfectly accurate, it's really hard to actually model the physics of how tofu crumbles.","246":"So a fractal is something that we see every day, but it's a little bit hard to describe. It's it's a shape that if you look at it really far away, or you look at it really up close, it has kind of a similar appearance. And actually that word fractal sounds a little bit like fraction.","247":"And that's kind of what we're gonna try out today. In fact, we're gonna have you build a fractal. A tree is a really good example of a fractal because if you look at the whole tree and then you break off a big branch of the tree.","248":"So your tree is totally beautiful, but it took a long time to make, right. How would you feel if I said, now you have to make a thousand of those trees.","249":"Like coding, exactly. That's what actually a lot of the artists for the movies are working with code rather than with a paintbrush. So in your own words, how would you describe a fractal to somebody?","250":"We're in level five now. So you're the expert-expert. I'm a huge fan of the work that you did in RCP, the Routing Control Platform being a precursor to software-defined networking and the notion that rather than having protocols actually always compute things, that we could compute things in data centers. I'd be interested if you could sort of just reflect back on that time and sort of the beginnings of SDN and where it's come since then.","251":"And certainly, we've heard about some countries that impose firewalls that don't let certain kinds of traffic out, or certain kinds of traffic in. So there's no global body that is regulating that?","252":"You're one of the most awesome networking researchers that I know. I'm curious, just to pick your brain, what do you think are some of the hot topics in networking research? Where do you think the field is heading?","253":"You know, we've had cellular networks now for 20, 30 years. So when we hear about 5G, what's trumpeted the most is the fact that oh, super high bandwidth, right? But I sense that the exciting things are more than just the network being faster.","254":"Coming back again to the softwarization. SDN and softwarization is a maybe a little bit behind the covers, that you wouldn't normally see it as a user going from 3G to 4G to 5G. You just see an increase in speed. But yet, the way the network is now being managed again, I think is bringing the cellular networking world sort of into the internet world in terms of the softwarization-","255":"So that's a great definition and I wanna pick that apart a little bit. So what you described is just right. Stars, when they run out of thermonuclear fuel are gonna collapse under their own weight. It'll explode in a supernova, it'll leave a core, and if the core itself is heavy enough, it will keep collapsing. It does, as you say, reach this point where not even light can escape. But the amazing thing is it leaves that point, you called it rightly the event horizon, it leaves it behind kind of like an archeological record because the start itself can no more sit at the event horizon than it can race outward at the speed of light. So the core of the star keeps collapsing and where it goes nobody knows. So in a weird way, the black hole isn't anymore a crush of matter. It left it behind in its wake, but the stuff of the star is gone.","256":"It turns out that there are only three quantities that define a black hole, its electric charge, its mass, and its spin. So the most general black hole can also spin and it can also be electrically charged. Whether or not they are has to do with how they formed. If a star collapses, it will likely be spinning when it collapses and the remnant black hole that formsbwill likely be spinning. A black hole of a certain mass, charge, and spin is indistinguishable from any other black hole with those same properties. So in some sense, they're like fundamental particles, which makes them absolutely exceptional for any other astrophysical object. Have you heard the stories about what happens inside a black hole?","257":"So from the outside, if you're an astronaut, you're watching your friend, another astronaut going into the black hole, it's as though your times become rotated relative to each other. So the profound thing is as an astronaut on the outside, looking at this round event horizon, you think of the center of black hole as a point in space, but to the person who's fallen in, it's not a point in space at all, it's a point in time. The singularity, or the end of it all, the crush in the center of a black hole is in their future. So they can no more avoid the singularity than you can avoid the next instant of time coming. So the death in the singularity is inevitable. Although we don't really think the singularity necessarily exists.","258":"The beauty of being a student of something like black holes is you never stop having new impressions of what this enigmatic phenomena is. So in a year, I'll tell you what I learned that's new.","259":"So what you're describing is the famous Hawking radiation where a black hole cleverly kind of steals energy from the quantum vacuum and radiates and in the process of evaporates. And of course this caused a big kerfuffle because when the black hole evaporates, eventually that event horizons is yanked up. And the question is, where did everything go that had once fallen in?","260":"Do you think there's ever a hope that the kind of information that you think about, the quantum gravity aspects of the universe that you think about, whether it will pan out or not, will ever be viably observed in these astronomical pursuits of the event horizon?","261":"It is amazing in the numerical simulations of two black holes merging, you really see the event horizons bobble around. And we were talking earlier about how really black holes are flawless, they don't tolerate those kinds of imperfections. And so you can so quickly watch the system wring away that misshapen merger. And it comes out in the gravitational waves, which is literally the ripples in the shape of spacetime until it settles down, and then it's utterly flawless again. It really happens fast. It's quite amazing.","262":"And also in the blockchain space, for example, if you wanna speed up the generation of proofs, if that could be done in a distributed way, then that would be great. One of the hopes that I have is that the power of multi-party computation is about bringing people together who are mutually distrustful.","263":"And on one hand memory is like a record of something that happened in the past that we can carry with us and we can like bring it back to mind. And on the other hand we need to be a little bit suspicious sometimes because we might get it wrong. In what world would that memory of the orange juice maybe be useful?","264":"There you go, there is your decision. Okay, you can take those. It took you some time there. You looked like you were really working hard at that problem. And that's interesting because actually we know that from research that when people have to make a decision between two things they like equally, some people like economists think oh those are the easiest decisions because they're both good options. But as psychologists and neuroscientists we know it's the opposite. One of the reasons is because there's no simple answer of like I know that one's better I'm just gonna go with it. And so we think that that's the kind of decision where memory is especially important because you have to kind of come up with more information.","265":"Matilda. All right. We're gonna actually build an internet. I've got a couple of things here that I wanna show you, or a couple of toys, actually. Okay, let's pretend that these round balls are computers. And the internet is something that connects them. And right now, the internet is just one communication link. And Matilda is sent over the internet from this computer to your computer. So the internet is a network for carrying information from one computer to another. Now this network here looks pretty simple, doesn't it? Right? It's just one thing. Should we add some more friends in?","266":"That's right. So that's pretty cool. There are actually lots of different ways to actually go through the internet to get from what we call a source, the place that's sending the information, to the receiver, the place that's actually gathering the information together. And that's something we actually call routing.","267":"Lettuce go on. [Skylar and Jim laughing] A knock, knock joke is an example of a protocol, right? The computer that you are using say, makes a request, you ask for something, you get something in return. In the internet, there are protocols everywhere. So that two computers that have never talked to each other before know the rules for talking to each other. This global internet with billions of people using it are just lots of smaller networks that are all hooked together to each other. But also, what the internet allows are all of these what we call applications, Zoom, video playing services, can all run on top of the same internet.","268":"It's a great analogy. You know I remember when I first learned of your work, for me as somebody who studies learning and memory, which are processes that are all about rapid updating that to me was really mind blowing that we can now start asking questions about dynamics of circuits on a timescale that's much closer to the timescale of human thought than anything we had before.","269":"In the field we often talk of have having a mental model that we use to make predictions about what's about to happen and really use that to mean kind of a general understanding of what's going on. What does that look like in terms that come from your world of like the configuration of, of a circuit?","270":"Getting way out there, but, but it is a way in which if you have the right model, it should be an efficient one. I'm wondering what you, what you think about what all this means for kind of a redefinition of what memory is, in many ways a revision or expansion of that notion. Would you be willing to try to help me think about how to define it?","271":"So a lot of times stars are born together in two star systems and when they die, if they're heavy enough, they will collapse under their own weight and form a black hole. So here you have a black hole and a big fluffy star. And what will happen is it'll start to tear apart its neighboring star. Literally parts of the star will begin to spill onto the black hole and splatter on the black hole. But let's say both those stars formed black holes. And what these black holes do is they are like mallets on a drum. They create literally waves in the shape of spacetime as they're moving. So imagine mallets on a drum, how the drum ripples. Depending on how the mallets are moving you hear different sounds. So effectively these black holes, as they get very close together in the final stages of their life together, they're orbiting each other at hundreds of times a second. It's this really crazy event, but it's happening in complete darkness. Eventually they bobble together and they merge and then they wring out, the spacetime's going crazy around them, it's this storm in spacetime, and they settle down to a quiet black hole. Then those waves that they created travel through the universe, basically undisturbed. For a long time people thought, well, even if black holes are out there, they're impossible to observe. And then they got very clever. You might wonder how we could possibly hear black holes, that sounds crazy. So I'm gonna show you, but I'm gonna need your help. This demo involves an electric guitar. Do you play at all?","272":"It's a great question. If I didn't see you playing the guitar, I would recognize the sound of a guitar. And even if I had never heard of a guitar before I could figure out the frequencies that the string was playing, I could tell how strongly it had been plucked, and I could tell the length of it and where it was pinned down from the harmonics of the string. And I can tell the different lengths of the strings from the notes that they play. So I can actually reconstruct the instrument that's playing it. And it's very similar to LIGO, we can listen to the notes, the amplitude, the harmonics, and we can deduce the size and shape of the objects doing that. And they're very massive and they're very small and they have all the markings of a black hole.","273":"I think it's interesting. And also a huge challenge. I think that it's interesting that if a person sees a robot doing something that seems very capable, they assume that the robot can do all sorts of other capable things. It's a huge challenge, because that's actually not the case.","274":"What I love about what you were describing is like you didn't use the word memory, were how you were talking about kind of perceptions and social judgments but I think probably we'd both agree that memory is a big part of that.","275":"Some of those examples really remind me also some of the questions about kind of abnormalities in, in memory or trauma or disruptions in memory and how they also play out in terms of not just what people remember but what they do with those memories right?","276":"I think what we're still kind of trying to understand as a field is the more kind of detailed and bigger picture of where does this model live? How does it get updated based on experiences? Why does that sometimes happen and sometimes not? There are actually people who are born without a hippocampus. They have disruptions to episodic memories. They have trouble after this conversation remembering what the conversation was about, but they do have pretty good semantic information. They have a good sense of knowledge about the world. And that's interesting for two reasons. One, it shows this association between the role of the hippocampus and these two forms of memory, episodic memories and semantic memory. The other reason it's interesting is that people often assume that we get to semantic memory through episodic memory, that we encounter one dog and then another dog, and then another dog and then we learned the concept, the semantic notion of a dog. And these people, their profile suggests that you can learn semantic information. You can learn general knowledge about the world, even without ever having the capacity to build those individual memories.","277":"Each project should be very focused and rigorous and know what a study is designed for. But at the same time we have to keep our minds open, our eyes open for what else is happening. Some of the most interesting discoveries didn't make sense at first.","278":"And things that are hard for humans should also be hard for robots and humans to do. But it turns out that it's actually the opposite. I wanna try a little demo.","279":"It depends on how you program the robot. If you program the robot to follow exact motions and follow a very specific program, then it won't go off that program. It will always do those actions. But if something unexpected happens, that the program wasn't designed to handle, then the robot might go off court.","280":"I think about like the scale and variance of different physical equations, like navier-stokes is, you know, kind of scale and variant, you know, this Reynolds number that tells you how viscous things are, but you can have the same kind of fluid behavior at all different scales. And that's why you get turbulence at all different scales.","281":"Yeah and I think it's really cool that this kind of fractal description of geometry or physics is also kind of baked into the nature of computation. Computation is recursive kind of biased nature. And so it's kind of a match made in heaven that we happen to build these machines that also-","282":"So one of the things I guess that touches on is this question about controllability or the ease of, with which everybody can create these worlds. Not just people, not just mathematicians, not just, you know, trained computer scientists. One thing when I think about Ken Musgraves working about this program, Bryce, this one I felt like I could really use, what do you think we still need to do in terms of putting these kinds of tools in, in people's hands, making it easier for people to use procedural machine learning, to build these kind of worlds?","283":"Yeah, you can see them all. And in fact, if we were really, really, really patient, we could do the same thing as with the Skittles. But here's another question. You said that there's a finite amount of glitter in that jar, and I agree. So how many jars would we need to hold an infinite amount of glitter?","284":"so did you know that there's certain kinds of problems that computers sort of run out of space almost like you're trying to solve the problem and just like how you run out of space on your iphone when you're trying to take a picture if you're trying to solve the problem you just run out of space and even if you have the world's biggest supercomputer did you know that can still happen","285":"okay so quantum mechanics is a branch of science just like any other branch of science it's a branch of physics it's the study of things that are either really really small really really well isolated and really really cold and this particular branch of science is something we're using to totally reimagine how computing works so we're building totally new kinds of computers based on the laws of quantum mechanics that's what a quantum computer is","286":"i don't know what it's worth but uh i can put it face up right in that heads i can put it face down right so at any given time point in time if i ask you is my penny heads or tails probably you could answer it right","287":"it's sort of it's sort of a combination of heads and tails right would you say so superposition is this idea that my penny is not just either heads or tails it's in this state which is a combination of heads and tails this quantum property is something that we can have in real real physical objects in the world so that's super position and the second thing that we'll talk about is called entanglement so now i'm going to give you a penny","288":"but in the quantum world when we entangle things they're really now connected it's much much harder to separate them again so using the same analogy we spin our pennies and eventually eventually they both stop right and when they stop it's either heads or tails right so in my case i got tails and you got heads you see how they're totally disconnected from each other right our pennies in the real world now if our pennies were entangled and we both spun them together right when we stopped them if you measured your penny to be ahead i would measure my penny to be ahead and if you measured your penny to be a tails i would measure my opinion to be a tails if we measured it at exactly the same time we would still find that they were both exactly correlated","289":"the way that we are able to actually see these quantum properties is by making our quantum chips really really cold so that's what this is all about actually this is called a dilution refrigerator and it's a refrigerator it doesn't look like a normal refrigerator right but it's something that we use actually there's usually a case around it to cool our quantum chips down cold enough that we can create superpositions and we can entangle qubits and the information isn't lost to the environment","290":"And at some level, there's different set of rules that seem to come into play 'cause you can have particles at very microscopic scales seem to do really strange things. But one of the quests of quantum sensing is to harvest some of these unique properties at the micro scale. We are really interested in quantum sensors because we think they can give us the ultimate limit of sensitivity. So they're really, really sensitive to small changes, but they're also gonna be really reliable. Every time I make that measurement, I'll always get the same results.","291":"And then the different chemicals in the cells. If you look at the MRI images, you can see that they give you the broad features of what the tissue looks like. But if you wanna zoom in a little bit more and see what's actually happening inside a tissue or inside a cell and you need a different type of sensor that's gonna be more sensitive and for something like that, you're gonna need a quantum sensor.","292":"We can do it on tissues right now or on the surface, but we can't actually do it inside the body. So right now, we're struggling to figure out which scenarios can we use this to get better information and when can we not do it."},"dialogue":{"0":"Explainer: Great.\nExplainee: I'm biased because I study one of the other sub-critical parts of the brain, the cerebellum.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Great.\nExplainer: Okay. The best way to think about this transition is really called, it's a flip flop switch, okay? So this term comes from engineering, and the idea is that in sleep, you basically have kind of this all of nothing experience. Certainly people kind of drift off to sleep, but then all of a sudden you're unconscious, right? So it seems like it's this flip flop between the arousal system and the sleep promoting system, and it's certainly regulated, and we'll get a little bit into that, but they're certainly kind of made up of two reciprocally inhibitory processes. Okay, so we have the ascending reticular activating system. It originates in the brain stem, and there's a dorsal and a ventral arm to this, and so the dorsal arm has neurons, cholinergic neurons, that go up to the thalamus and then it projections into the fore brain, and then there's the ventral arm, and this is comprised of a whole bunch of different types of neurons, so there are monominergic, so there's kind of dopaminergic neurons that come from the periaqueductal gray, serotonergic ones from the dorsal raphae nuclei, histaminergic neurons that come from the tuberomammillary nucleus of the hippothalamus, and then noradrenergic neurons from the locus coeruleus, and so all of those are kind of working in tandem to kind of drive wake within the brain. So if we just think about drugs that are available inducing wakefulness, we can certainly, kind of the dopaminergic ones jump out, right? So we have amphetamines that kind of drive those signaling, and then modafinil, which is a wake promoting drug for people that have kind of excessive day-time sleepiness that maintains alertness throughout the day.\n","1":"Explainer: So that's good, because that's why you're here, and so we're talking about sleep today, and really about kind of what is the brain machinery through which we go through consciousness to unconsciousness and that transition.\nExplainee: Great.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: In terms of the dopamine, if you're taking amphetamines, that's usually to promote, as you said, wakefulness, but does that actually improve the quality of your sleep? How reliable are those kinds of interventions?\nExplainer: For the role that they play with respect to the sleep-wake system is really kind of amping up the wake system, right? And so certainly that has like down stream consequences for the sleep system, because now the flip flop switch is kind of pushed in a much stronger direction, and we have to kind of rely on what regulates sleep to get it pushed back to sleep.\n","2":"Explainer: You know, so I think that's less clear. In some ways, you know, getting back to this idea of this wake-sleep system, we have this sleep system that is kind of the counterpoint to this wake arousal system, and so the primary nucleus region is the ventral lateral pre-optic nucleus, also called VLPO, and that has particular neuron outputs that release GABA and galanin, which work in an inhibitory way on kind of the wake promoting ones. And so, it's kind of this delicate balance of these two systems that are ongoing. In your cognitive neuro-science training, right, it sounds like it's pretty specific and focused in a particular part of the brain, the cerebellum, and one thing that I'm interested in is you bring a participant into the study, have you ensured that they got a good night's sleep? Have you asked them about their sleep?\nExplainee: Well in most studies, probably it is advised for your participants before they come in to get a good night's sleep, so those would be recommendations that you would lay out, you know, in communication with the participant, before they come in.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: I often think that people, many people think that they can get by on very little sleep where the less than average amount of sleep, from what I know from the research, you know if you actually test those people on different batteries of cognitive tasks, you often find that their performance is slightly worse than they had anticipated.\nExplainer: Yeah. So what did you learn about sleep today?\n","3":"Explainer: Yeah, yeah, yeah. I find it fascinating in music to think about, you know, say I arrive in a place, if I'm going, say I'm going to D flat major. And there's something you once taught me. You taught me this song Don't Follow the Crowd.\nExplainee: Oh, yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Right, right, right.\nExplainer: It's something like, um... (keyboard music)\n","4":"Explainer: Yeah. So this chord being, like a major seven with a sharp five, and a natural, like, there's no dominant thing.\nExplainee: Right, right.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Yeah.

And why did you prefer that one?\n","7":"Explainer: So do you have a basic sense of what latency is?\nExplainee: Yeah, so my understanding of what latency is, is its basically the time delay between the rendering at different points.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: The latency is, in my opinion, the most important part of VR, because if you have that offset your body is no longer immersed and you getting that motion sickness which can pull a lot of people out of the experience.\nExplainer: Games that feel really good, they've got that sense of it happens instantly when you're doing something.\n","8":"Explainer: Yeah, any crazy idea you had now you could probably make a pretty good video game out of it.

And it says here, If you like Melanie Martinez, one of the other songs you might like is by Au\/Ra. Do you know who that is?\n","10":"Explainer: That's right.\nExplainee: So do you think that we've been able to teach machines enough so that they can do things that even we can't do? And on the opposite side of that, do you think there are things that we can do that a machine might never be able to do?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","11":"Explainer: [Janna] They're about the size of a city. So you're imagining something more than the mass of the Sun.\nExplainee: [Will] Yeah, or about the mass of the Sun, condensed to the size of a city. It's dense enough that one teaspoon-full would weigh about a billion tons here on Earth.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: We would immediately be crushed into the ground, I think our bodies would be shred into their subatomic particles.\nExplainer: So what's the connection between neutron stars and black holes?\n","12":"Explainer: Black holes are so amazing that when the neutron star stops and there's something actually there. There's material there. If it's so heavy it becomes a black hole, so it keeps falling, once the event horizon of the black hole forms, which is the shadow, the curve that's so strong that not even light can escape, the material keeps falling. And like you said, maybe space-time breaks down right at the center there, but whatever happens, the star's gone, that black hole is empty. So in a weird way black holes are a place and not a thing.\nExplainee: So is there a sensible way to talk about what's inside a black hole, or is that, should you think of it as there is no space-time inside?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Those waves are very exciting for me too because neutron stars orbiting each other also give off gravitational waves and we might be able to get some data about neutron star material from that kind of signal.\nExplainer: [Janna] Yes, they ring space-time also like a drum, and you can record the sound of that ringing after a billion years, when it's traveled through the universe. But then the next thing that happens is those neutron stars collide, and because of this incredibly high energy state of matter, which you study, it becomes this firework of different explosions. It's really quite spectacular.\n","13":"Explainer: Yeah, it was, to my knowledge, the most widely studied astronomical event in the history of humanity.\nExplainee: Wow, that's amazing.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Absolutely. I've heard statistics like many Earth masses worth of gold were created, forged in the neutron star collision that caused that. We used to think that most elements in the universe were created in supernova, which is when stars explode, because there's so much violent activity at the center that you need that kind of energy to create new elements.\nExplainer: [Janna] The way you do in a bomb. It's basically nuclear fusion.\n","14":"Explainer: Now, in some sense that's kind of trivial to you and me, because of course you have space, which is three dimensional, you have time which is one dimensional, so spacetime is four dimensional. But it didn't turn out, it didn't occur to anyone that that was a sensible way to talk until really relativity. This is the crucial thing, right? Is that what Einstein realized is that sure there's both time and space, but how we divide spacetime into time and space can be different for different people, and really there's a real sense in which four dimensional spacetime is kind of a generalization of three dimensional space. And I think to really explain this we're gonna need a blackboard.\nExplainee: Okay.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Why though?\nExplainer: Why? This is a very good question. So, let's just start with space, right? We know a little bit about space. So here's my simple minded way of drawing space two dimensions, because that's how many I can draw on the blackboard. Let's say X and Y. And what is special about space, there's many things, but one is that if I have a curve or a path between two points, there's a distance that you can calculate, right? And the distance between those two points doesn't depend on your coordinates. It doesn't depend on whether you're in radial coordinates or Cartesian coordinates, or whatever. I'm allowed to imagine a curve that does something like this between those two points, and if I were a person walking on that curve, I would have an odometer with me maybe, and I would know, you would know, even without having done that, this path is always gonna be longer than that path. There's a formula, Pythagoras' Theorem that tells you what the shortest distance path is. That's the point. The physical-ness of what is real is the distance along a certain curve. So spacetime is like that. That's why it is useful to think about spacetime.\n","15":"Explainer: Well kind of. What Einstein wants to get across is there's no such thing as fundamental, like there's the universe's time, this big letter T that might tell you how old the universe is, but then every individual has a clock with them, and they measure their own time depending on how they're moving through the universe.\nExplainee: I see.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Why is that, that this one's shorter then?\nExplainer: There is what we call a metric on spacetime, and when we talk about Euclidean space versus a curved space, versus a sphere or something, that's a different metric. And spacetime has its own metric which says the following thing, that the path between two events in spacetime that is a straight line, will always be the longest time.\n","16":"Explainer: But there are no straight lines, because spacetime itself is curved. So do you think if you had to explain relativity what would you say?\nExplainee: I think I'd go with kind of the train paradox. Let's say I'm stationary, and someone's moving past me on the train, they think they're stationary on the train. Like they think that they're not accelerating, but if they start walking through the train cars, then they are accelerating in their frame, but then from my outside frame where I'm completely removed, I see they are accelerating. So I guess that relativity is all about perspective, I guess in a way.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: That was pretty good.\nExplainer: [Sean] Yeah. I learned a lot. [Sean] It's a lot of fun stuff to talk about.\n","17":"Explainer: Yeah, I like that, yeah.\nExplainee: Yeah, yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Yeah.\nExplainer: So I might go (hums Amazing Grace)\n","18":"Explainer: And so when you think about extra dimensions, you put them together with brains and different fields wrapping around the extra dimensions and so forth, right?\nExplainee: Yes.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Yes, well ultimately we'd like to understand the observable universe. If string theory turns out to be the thing that the universe cares about, we'd like to know, with all of these possibilities that are in string theory, how do we get the one that looks like the world we live in?\nExplainer: The thing I want to talk about is this paper I wrote with Matt Johnson and Lisa Randall where we realize there's another way to compactify extra dimensions spontaneously, dynamically. If you imagine starting with this big piece of paper you couldn't wrap up everything, but within some region of space you could make a tube.\n","19":"Explainer: You know, a lot of people, a lot of string theorists, they care a lot about all the different ways in which we could hide the extra dimensions. As someone who cares about cosmology, I wanna start asking why are the extra dimensions small at all? How did that happen? Is this something you think about yourself?\nExplainee: Yes, well ultimately we'd like to understand the observable universe. If string theory turns out to be the thing that the universe cares about, we'd like to know, with all of these possibilities that are in string theory, how do we get the one that looks like the world we live in?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Okay.\nExplainer: Right? And down there in the tube it looks like your long thing that is compactified in one direction and infinitely extending in the other direction, so there's one less macroscopic dimension of space.\n","20":"Explainer: [Sean] You think that sounds plausible to you?\nExplainee: It sounds like fun. What I would immediately ask is where do the large dimensions come from in the first place? Is that something you address, or you just assume that all the dimension are large as a starting point?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: But where do they come from?\nExplainer: It was always there.\n","21":"Explainer: Why don't you explain to us what a black brane is?\nExplainee: Well in some ways, it's very much like a black hole in that you have far away from it you have these large just flat dimensions. As you move in, there's something in the interior. It has, itself, higher dimensions, and so because physicists love to joke they thought, well it's like a membrane but it can have many different dimensions. Let's use P to stand in for those number of dimensions, and so they called them P-branes.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Yeah. Yeah. So, a lot of the branes that are relevant for studying things to do with anti-de Sitter spacetimes in various dimensions actually start out as these non-singular type brains, and then you find in the core, there's actually an anti-de Sitter spacetime.\nExplainer: Right. Imagine that rather than going down to a point, it just asymptotes to some fixed radius that continues infinitely far down there. But then you can ask, okay what about the rest of the universe? You have some sphere, some two dimensions compactified, and the balance between the cosmological constant and the electromagnetic field keeps it at a fixed distance.\n","22":"Explainer: But then the other dimensions, the transverse dimensions, don't need to be anti-de Sitter. They can have either positive, zero, or negative cosmological constant. So you can basically get any sort of cosmological solution times a compactified sphere.\nExplainee: Is it that these have the lowest action of all the things that could possibly, all the possible solutions?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Okay, that's fair.\nExplainer: I mean it's one of the things that could happen, so I mean it obviously, You know, we know--\n","23":"Explainer: I know not everyone buys that, right?\nExplainee: Not everyone buys it. There's a big discussion in the literature right now.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: I think it's gonna get way more interesting than we're currently able to grapple with right now, and I think there are hints of it. There could be a description of the physics that might be our early universe that is like that molecular description. And then from that emerges flat spacetimes maybe four, maybe some mechanism tells you it's four and not something else. I think that's where we're going.\nExplainer: If the viewers wanted to know more about how spacetime can emerge from quantum mechanics, they could read the graphic novel you just wrote.\n","24":"Explainer: If the viewers wanted to know more about how spacetime can emerge from quantum mechanics, they could read the graphic novel you just wrote.\nExplainee: Right, yes. I wrote and drew a graphic novel called The Dialogues: Conversations About the Nature of Universe.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Excellent.\n","25":"Explainer: Try look over there and concentrate on his face over there. Can you see me waving my hand without turning your eyes?\nExplainee: No.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Uh, three?\nExplainer: You can just barely tell. And you can see that even, like if you hold out your hand and you focus on your hand, then your foot would be blurry because there's that difference there. And you can change between that, like you can then focus on your foot and your hand gets blurry. Because your eyes can see different amounts of detail in different places. So we're hoping in the future, that hardware can be like that. Where we can make a display that puts lots of detail right where you're looking. And every time you look someplace else, it moves the detail over to there. So we don't need to render a hundred times as much as we've got right now. Figuring out where you're looking is a pretty hard problem. What we try to go about this, is by taking a camera and looking at people's eyes and then try to figure out is the eye looking over here or up here. We're working hard on stuff like this right now so we hopefully can have a virtual reality that's as detailed and realistic feeling as the reality that we've actually got around us. But its going to be a long time before we get to where we can really fool people.\n","26":"Explainer: Alright, so, at some point, you can probably see it right now? So without moving your eyes, this is kind of hard, tell me how many fingers I'm holding up?\nExplainee: Uh, three?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","27":"Explainer: Okay. So this is about high intensity lasers. Not only how do you make them, but what was really stopping them being made in both cases is non linear optics. We wanna do something that requires a huge photon density application, and so that's how come we came up with chirped pulse amplification, so that we could stretch the pulse, safely amplify it, then compress it at the end, and then we're ready to do whatever we want at the end. So what do you think the main difference is between the continuous wave laser that you have that runs at 10 watts and a chirped pulse amplifier?\nExplainee: I feel like the continuous laser delivers power at a continuous rate, whereas you want all that power to be delivered in a really, really short time with your amplification.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: I have, yeah. We use optical tweezers to trap particles in solution.\nExplainer: And twirl the motors or not twirl the motors?\n","28":"Explainer: You haven't? Okay.\nExplainee: So I was always curious, how much further, like what higher power can we go now?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: We could probably use this to drive chemical reactions at a very, very specific spot. Like if we want to target just a single cell in the body.\nExplainer: Yes. And maybe what, do pump-probe spectroscopy and watch the cell? Or to ionize it?\n","29":"Explainer: You know there's tons of opportunities for the synthetic case where you want to be able to have your synthetic fantasy world where everybody is a creature that's created by the computer and simulated reasonably. But of course we've got, you know we still don't do people well simulated. That's a hard problem, we've been beating our heads against it for a long time. I do think we're making progress and I wouldn't bet on that being solved in 10 years, but maybe 20 years. Because it is going to take a lot of AI. Its going to take a lot of machine-learning, where its not going to be a matter of us dissecting all the micro-expressions that people do. Its gonna be lets take every youtube video ever made and run it through some enormous learner that's going to figure out how to make people realistic.\nExplainee: Absolutely, there are these crucial thresholds where you pass a technological hurdle and all of a sudden that unlocks a whole world of creative potential. But I think, to your point very much, we need to solve the actual human and social challenges and turn those into opportunities to figure out how this technology fits into our lives.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: You can imagine the utility behind this for creating a world or you can imagine the power of a story that would be told to you in this context. And a lot of it is just picking those, putting them together in a meaningful way and then crafting something that's really bigger and intentional. But I've now been joining with real people in virtual reality. I think we also have different levels of connection. Like the audio side is leaps and bounds above in terms of the nuance and personality and humanity. When I hear people laughing and joking and really enjoying something. Soon we'll get into that. We're in macro-gestureland, where I can wave and say thumbs-up. But when we get into micro-gestures and actually getting a sense of facial reactions and other things I think then we'll have a really incredibly rewarding time, spending time with each other.\n","30":"Explainer: [Sean] What kind of science?\nExplainee: I like biology and computer science.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: I guess, I don't know how to exactly define it, but I know, like the first four.\nExplainer: Right, you know the difference between like one dimension two dimensions, three dimensions, et cetera. So let's do a little experiment here. So there's one dimension. I'll give that to you. Now, here's your task. I'm going to give you another dimension, and I'm gonna ask hold those two things at right angles to each other. It's easy to do. Yeah, so there's no trick here.\n","31":"Explainer: Right, you know the difference between like one dimension two dimensions, three dimensions, et cetera. So let's do a little experiment here.

So what that's doing is when you had just two that was describing a two dimensional plane, right? Like the two things pick out a plane, the three things pick out all three dimensional space. I'm gonna give you one more, and I'm gonna ask you to hold that fourth one so that it's at a right angle to all the other three at the same time.\n","32":"Explainer: It's exactly the same thing as latitude and longitude but we put coordinates on the sky.\nExplainee: Oh.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: [Juliana] Yeah.\nExplainer: [Sean] And sort of the peels of an orange kind of thing, right?\n","33":"Explainer: [Sean] And sort of the peels of an orange kind of thing, right?\nExplainee: [Juliana] Yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: So, there's like how many dimension would there be?\nExplainer: We don't know. You know, the optimistic view is that there are six, but the thing is, some of them might be really, really, really, really, really small, like way too small for us to ever see.\n","34":"Explainer: So you can define something as, well you know, how high above a certain location on earth it is, but the earth is rotating and revolving around the sun so we have to define separate celestial coordinates.\nExplainee: So, there's like how many dimension would there be?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Yeah.\nExplainer: And some of them might be medium sized that hopefully we can see.\n","35":"Explainer: Absolutely right. And this is sort of the state of uncertainty that physicists are stuck living in.\nExplainee: Oh. [laughs]\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Oh. [laughs]\nExplainer: [Sean] We really don't know.\n","36":"Explainer: So far, what do you know about black holes?\nExplainee: I never knew beforehand how hard it was to get actual data of the black holes itself, first of all, they're dark, and, like, they're so far away, it's almost impossible just to get a good image of them. They were discussing a project in which multiple radio telescopes of some sort, like, are, like, pinpointed all across, from Greenland to South America, and, like, and they're trying to get an image of the black hole in the center of our galaxy because, as opposed to just recording its impact on the surrounding stars and planets.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: What sort of technology and, like, I guess tools have you been using in your studies, or, like, just in general, in the study of black holes?\nExplainer: For my studies, I actually, when I started at UCLA in graduate school, I worked with a professor named Matt Malkin who was, gotten a lot of data observations from the Hubble Space Telescope, so that was one of my very first projects to work on, so any, space-based observatories have been a really big advantage, and then I've moved on now to the Spitzer Space Telescope. In addition to that, then there's other people who've used a lot of X-ray telescopes, NuSTAR, Chandra have used data from that. It's been a combination of both ground-based observatories, as well as space-based ones, and going everywhere from X-ray observations, not done by me, but certainly ultraviolet, and then optical, and infrared, particularly, those are the ones that I've been most involved with.\n","37":"Explainer: So we've been, we've had, now, effectively two different ways of getting more direct measurements, one is the LIGO, which is the Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory, which is where, getting the ripples in space time, coming off of the merging of black holes. The other one that you're mentioning is actually called the Event Horizon Telescope, where they're using radio waves to actually image the event horizon, that region where light cannot escape from the black hole at the center of our galaxy, which I know they're working on it right now. It's an amazing thing, but that'll be the most direct imaging of a black hole. LIGO is a direct detection of the consequence of the merging of black holes. The critical part has been, like, for the super massive black hole at the center of our galaxy, we've seen the stars orbiting it, and we've measured the mass, so that way, so if you look at a spinning black hole, it actually fundamentally alters the emission that's coming off the stuff that's falling into it. These are discovered as what are called X-ray binaries, that is, you know, there's an X-ray member of the binary that is emitting in the X-rays, and it's really not very bright in the optical (mumbles) at all, so there's always, people are looking at these X-ray binaries.\nExplainee: What sort of technology and, like, I guess tools have you been using in your studies, or, like, just in general, in the study of black holes?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","38":"Explainer: [Janna] Exactly, the Moon is such a big body compared to anything else very nearby that it has the larger effect, pulling the water of the Earth. But more than the Moon, think about the Sun pulling on the Earth. We orbit the whole Sun, just the way the Earth pulls on the Moon and causes the Moon to orbit us. All of those things are acting on you and me right now.\nExplainee: If gravity was too strong, would we be able to get up?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: I'm in the fours. In the fours?\nExplainer: Maybe four three. People think that while you're sleeping, your body has a chance to stretch out and gravity isn't crunching you together, but when you're standing or walking or sitting, the gravity contracts your spine ever so slightly, so that in the morning you might be a little bit taller than in the evening. See if it works for you. [Woman] Wow.\n","39":"Explainer: They say that astronauts in space, definitely their spine elongates. There were two twin astronauts, one who stayed here on Earth and the other who went to the International Space Station. He was there for a long time, and when he came back, he was actually taller than his twin brother.\nExplainee: Wow.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Mm-hmm.\nExplainer: Isaac Newton would ponder, how does the Earth cause things to fall? There's a famous story that Isaac Newton was sitting under a tree and the apple fell from the tree and hit him on the head and he had an epiphany and understood this law, this mathematical law for how that works. I don't actually think that's a true story, though.\n","40":"Explainer: And a heavy object.\nExplainee: Oh my God. [Janna laughs]\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: I've learned that the person that learned about the apple.\nExplainer: Newton.\n","41":"Explainer: It turns out, for people that are between the ages of 18 and 65, the agreed upon amount of sleep that people should get is between seven and nine hours, and it's really at least seven hours per night, to maintain optimal health as an adult. So at least seven hours. When we look at across all of the data that is available on like sleep and health, and sleep and psychiatric illness and those types of things, the largest risk is when people get five hours or less. What do you think is responsible for driving how much sleep you need, and things like that?\nExplainee: I mean, I know sleep is kind of regulated by the thalamus and the suprachiasmatic nucleus sending signals to the pineal gland to which kind of secretes melatonin, which tells us when it's time to go to sleep.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: I'm from Hoi, so we have very long days. We have early sunrises, late sunsets. Does that signify less sleep, because we have a shorter amount of time for melatonin to be released?\nExplainer: Yeah, no, that's a really great question, and the same is true in places where the sun never goes down during the summer, and when it's dark all the time during the winter, and it turns out light isn't the only thing that kind of gates your circadian rhythm. But I think the thing that's really important, again there are two processes, that the other one is the S process, and that one's just kind of a really important driver of sleep. One name we call it is the homeostatic sleep drive. Kind of the longer you're awake, the sleepier you get. You stay up, you get sleepy. Time goes by, you get sleepier. Time goes by, you get sleepier. But it's actually kind of a fundamental principle for how sleep is regulated, and it's really kind of akin to like a balloon, okay? So you wake up in the morning and your balloon is flat. You've kind of like drained out all of the sleepiness. But then as you kind of go throughout the day, it kind of fills up, so you use your energy, it gets filled up. And then it gets filled up more as you get towards nighttime, right? And then when it's at this optimal amount is when you kind of go to sleep and let out all of the sleepiness again. And this is really what underlies why napping can also be bad for you. So napping's not inherently bad, but if you actually let out some of this air during the day, it's going to take longer for the balloon to get bigger, right, I see to where you feel sleepy, right?\n","42":"Explainer: So yeah it's a light bulb and there's a couple of mirrors. Now the light bulb has to be a little bit special. It has to be a type of material that can store the energy in an excited state right? It has to stay up there really energetic and sit there for a while so that when the light comes along, it takes that energy and becomes stronger light and then the mirror sends it back and it does it again and again and again and between these two mirrors, it makes the light come out in a nice beam. In a laser, it comes out as a single color. They all come out with their waves at the same time. Every wave peaks at the same time which then makes it a giant wave and it's this giant wave that has a tremendous amount of power. So it can do something like cutting steel. But when you cut steel, or if you were cutting this floor, it's gray, it actually will absorb the light. That's why the light, you don't see it because the light isn't bouncing back or through it. So I like to use demos to explain how my laser works. So I've brought basically a hammer and a nail. I'm sure you've probably hammered a nail before into a piece of wood but the question is, if you asked yourself why it is we hit the big end and it's the tiny end that we put on the piece of wood. We could never pick up a hammer and hit the sharp end and hope this would go in to the piece of wood.\nExplainee: Because it needs to be centered so it can more easily just go in.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: So the laser needs ultimately many things. It needs to be centered, it needs time to actually penetrate and then it needs--\nExplainer: Well it depends. So if you're cutting steel, you need to have the nail. You need to have it concentrated all of the light, not going in all directions but you need it into as small a point as possible. And for that we use a lens. For a lens, the light's coming down as a column, you put in a lens, it all focuses it down in the same way as the nail and then it starts cutting that steel. Okay so that force per unit area--\n","43":"Explainer: That's right. All the force that we apply here, goes all the way through but then it can only basically come out when it contacts the wood in that one tiny spot. And so sometimes it's the force that you push something with but sometimes it is that force per unit area. But sometimes it's not even the force per unit area 'cos, you know, push down as hard as you can on that and see if we can get it pushed in. See it doesn't really work does it?\nExplainee: So the laser needs ultimately many things. It needs to be centered, it needs time to actually penetrate and then it needs--\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: So it's kind of like a magnifying glass? Like it magnifies the light down to a point?\nExplainer: Exactly. You know sometimes you want to have all of your energy not just in a small area but in the small volume and so one of the other dimensions is time or length. But with light, time and length are the same thing because light always travels at the speed of light.\n","44":"Explainer: But if you send a one second long light pulse out into the skies there, the beginning of the pulse is actually two thirds of the way to the moon. It's 300,000 kilometers long. So now, if you talk about light being concentrated, that doesn't seem very concentrated. The type of lasers I play with in my lab will be no thicker than this piece of paper. So we take that energy that might be in three hundred thousand kilometers and we squeeze it all the way down into just this piece of paper and actually the beams are more the size of this piece of paper and so, in my lab, pieces of paper like this would be flying through the sky but we can't see them. 'Cos they don't come in our eyes, they fly by us and they're infra red.\nExplainee: There'd be like little concentrated beams of light just flying everywhere?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: It funnels into--\nExplainer: Into a spot. So here would be my light coming from my laser and it would just be coming down, down, down, down, down. Hit a lens and it would have to focus down. But now, all the light started out with this big of a spread so concentrated this much. Eventually it would be here, more concentrated. But by the end, right at the focal spot, that's when I get all of my light, all of the energy has been squeezed down into fitting inside this piece of paper and that's why I say that I built a laser hammer. Because when this hits a piece of glass, it just smacks hose electrons right off the atoms and there's nothing else for them to do, they have to fly away. So can you tell me what you learned and maybe about the focusing of the light?\n","45":"Explainer: So our sleep is made up of different types, okay? The first one is called non-rapid eye movement sleep, or non-REM, okay? Or NREM. And then the other one, which might not be a surprise, is called REM. Rapid eye movement sleep. And those are the two main types of sleep that happen. The way that we measure that as a sleep scientist is that we'll actually bring people into the lab where they can do this at home, where we put electrodes on their scalp while they're sleeping, and that allows us to measure the brain activity that's going on during the night.\nExplainee: Okay. Are you like able to tell how much sleep someone's getting or what their sleep schedule is by REM?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Oh wow.\nExplainer: Okay? When do you think you experience the most REM?\n","46":"Explainer: I think to really get deep into nanomaterials and nanoscale devices, you really have to understand to some level, quantum mechanics. What it teaches us as we make these devices smaller and smaller, their properties begin to now depend on the size and the orientation of these devices. There are materials, and you're taking a 2D materials class, you know about this, that are intrinsically thin. As they're grown, as they're fabricated, they're already at the nanoscale and they possess these quantum confinement properties that as a nanotechnologist, you try to exploit. And so the first ones I wanted to talk to you about are quantum dots, have you heard of quantum dots before?\nExplainee: Yes.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Well, the other day we were talking about the different dimensions you can have of nanotechnology. So all the way from like 0D to 3D. If I remember correctly, my professor labeled it as 0D?\nExplainer: That's correct. Yeah. Because of quantum confinement, once you get below this 15 nanometer range, the band gap of the material depends completely on the size of the material. So in bulk materials, if you want to change the band gap, you have to change the material, right? But in these quantum dots specifically, just by changing the size, you can change their band gap. And because their band gap is changing, their optical properties are different. And you can precisely tune the wavelength of light that they emit just by changing their size.\n","47":"Explainer: You're speaking my language. This is what I spent many years of my life working on. You don't physically roll up graphene. You grow nanotubes by basically taking nanocrystals and you deposit them on a surface. And then you do a CVD process, chemical vapor deposition. So you basically flow in a carbon source, the carbon dissolves in a nanocrystal and then once nanocrystal is saturated, the nanotubes precipitate out of them in tubes. Then you have to develop ways to go into this pile of nanotubes and pull out exactly the ones that you want. So I have to find ways to program them to go exactly in the places that I want. I modify the surface of the nanotube with specific molecules that recognize one type of surface over another. And then I just pattern the surface and the tubes just land exactly where we want them to. And it's still very much in the research stage. The ultimate goal is to build functional high-speed electronics using these new materials.\nExplainee: In my nanomaterials class, actually just a couple of days ago, we were talking about different applications of nanotechnology and things we know. And we touched on the topic that right now, silicon is down to the smallest level that it can get. And so we have scientists out there researching other materials, to replace silicon.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: I gotta ask. The lights that are behind you, is that related to the quantum dots that you work with at all?\nExplainer: It's just pretty lights. [laughing] But now that you suggested it, these were inspired by the array of quantum dots that we showed earlier. So that's the story I'm going to stick with. [laughing] I like it.\n","48":"Explainer: Do you know what machine learning means? Have you heard that before?\nExplainee: No.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Sure.\nExplainer: [Hilary] So is this a dog or a cat?\n","49":"Explainer: And what makes a dog, a dog and a cat, a cat?\nExplainee: Well, dogs are very playful, I think, more than cats. Cats lick themselves more than dogs, I think.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Yeah. Yeah.\nExplainer: What about this one?\n","50":"Explainer: What about this one?\nExplainee: A dog. A cat. I think, a cat? Because it's more skinny. And also, its legs are like really tall and its ears are a little pointy.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: [Brynn] None.\nExplainer: [Hilary] None. What is it?\n","51":"Explainer: Are those like the practice problems you do before the test?\nExplainee: Well, just like everything that's gonna be on the test is on the review.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Yeah.\nExplainer: So machines work the same way. If you show them a lot of examples and give them practice, they'll learn how to guess. And then when you give them the test, they should be able to do that. So we looked at eight pictures and you were able to answer really quickly. But what would you do if I gave you 10 million examples? Would you be able to do that so quickly?\n","52":"Explainer: Do you know why we're here today?\nExplainee: Because we're talking about science.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Um, something that helps you remember things.\nExplainer: Definitely. So what we're gonna talk about, this is something that people study in the brain called the connectome.\n","53":"Explainer: Do you know that your body is made up of really tiny things called cells?\nExplainee: Um, yes, I know that.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Oh.\nExplainer: That was awesome, Daniel, thank you.\n","54":"Explainer: What have you been up to? And yeah, what are you working on?\nExplainee: Lately I've been doing, you know, always a little bit of side channel analysis. So what I really do, you know, is all hardware layer. So I've been looking, you know, at some various devices lately, at how susceptible they are to fault attacks, what that sort of means in real life. You know, not just purely the research side, but also how much should you care about it.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: One of them was looking at, like, a little hardware Bitcoin wallet, and you could use fault injection to actually recover secrets from it, and a lot of devices. I mean, the whole idea is pretty cool, right? Because you tell the device, Hey, I want to authenticate, and it's supposed to run some really crazy math that authenticates it, but instead of doing that crazy math and attacking the math, you just attack the check at the end.\nExplainer: We're also scratching the surface of, like, what is possible? It's not necessarily just the system itself and not necessarily that algorithm itself. Like you said, you don't necessarily need to attack the math in some cases. You can just attack that check. And I think something that's been pretty cool is looking at higher energy particles. It's going to be maybe hard to entirely confirm, but I think it'd be really, really cool to actually see. Like, I want to see one of these faults because I haven't seen it myself. And also, how do you know that you've seen it? I've started playing with, like, setting up a cloud chamber. A cloud chamber lets you actually view high energy particles going through sort of like in a small jar with some evaporated alcohol. And I thought it'd be really cool if we put some memory chip in there, like a basic memory chip and we just fill it with some data, but then you put a camera on that area and you just watch. Assuming that there is a high energy particle that actually hits that memory, that should potentially flip the energy state of that bit. The outside microcontrollers should be able to read that and actually say, Oh wait, the data, even though I'm not changing data, I'm only reading data, and we should be able to visibly or optically see it. What I'm wondering is could that be a next area of research? Because I don't think anyone's actually looking at intentionally injecting high energy particles to take over a computer, when really, you know, that's another technique for fault injection, technically speaking.\n","55":"Explainer: Maybe a mutual acquaintance of ours, Jasper gave a example of fault injection, and I like to use that as, when I'm trying to explain fault injection, he shows a pinball machine and the pinball machine, obviously the two inputs are the two plungers when you're playing a pinball machine, but fault injection, you can tilt the entire pinball machine, right? You're just introducing some external variable that's outside of the traditional inputs that you're used to and you've now controlled the environment in a advantageous way to the user or the player. Can you give an example of some type of fault injection that you're doing or working on?\nExplainee: One of them was looking at, like, a little hardware Bitcoin wallet, and you could use fault injection to actually recover secrets from it, and a lot of devices. I mean, the whole idea is pretty cool, right?

If you're close enough, it will divert your path more, if you're close enough still, then you will get what are called tidal forces, where the difference between, for example, if you're standing next to a black hole, the difference in gravity between your feet and your head actually becomes significant. Next time you see a science fiction movie, if somebody says, Oh, my god, we've been caught in the gravitation field of a black hole, and we're gonna fall in, it's like, no, no, just, if you're far enough away, just thrust a little bit this way, and then you'll slingshot around the black hole.\n","57":"Explainer: Right, you will feel the gravitational pull, and it'll redirect you in some way, and if you're far enough way, it's just like you're very far away from the sun, or something else.

But the infrared can penetrate the dust, the X-rays can penetrate the dust, the radio can penetrate all of that dust, so by combining all of these different wavelengths, people are really coming to a point of okay, how is this happening, by looking at different wavelengths of light, we can get a better sense, but they're still working on the theory, it's not all done.\n","58":"Explainer: You know, we first met 10, 11 years ago and machine learning has changed a lot since then.\nExplainee: Tooling that we now have, the capacity, and also, an elevation of the problem sets that we're dealing with and how to frame the problem. And I'm almost struggling to figure out whether it's a blessing or curse that it has become as accessible and as democratized and as easy to execute and you just build another new company from scratch. And so, what's been, kind of, your reflection on that?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: In contrast, what I'm struggling with, the friend of mine who asked me to look at some health care data for him. And despite the capabilities that we're having in all of the, kind of, bigger societal problems alongside with data collection engineering, all the gnarly stuff, that is actually not the machine learning itself, it's the rest of it where certain data isn't available. And to me, it's staggering how difficult it is to get it off the ground and actually use.\nExplainer: And part of the challenge of it is not the mathematics of building models, but the challenge is making sure that the data is sufficiently representative, potentially high quality.\n","59":"Explainer: And part of the challenge of it is not the mathematics of building models, but the challenge is making sure that the data is sufficiently representative, potentially high quality.\nExplainee: And how transparent do I need to build it for it to be adopted at some point? What types of biases in the data collection, and then also in the usage? We now call it the bias, but we're still struggling with the society not really living up to its expectations and then machine learning, bringing it to the forefront.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Feeling increasingly challenged that my skillset of being very good at programming has become somewhat secondary. And it's feeling... [both laugh] It's really the bigger picture understanding of Who would be using that? How transparent do I need to build it for it to be adopted at some point? What types of biases in the data collection and then also in the usage? I think, in certain areas, we have societal expectations as to what is fair and what isn't.\nExplainer: And so, it's not just the provenance of that data, but it's, sort of, deeply understanding, Why does it look the way it looks? Why was it collected this way? What are the limitations of it? We need to think about that in entire process, how we document that process. This is an issue in companies where somebody might create something that even their peers can't recreate.\n","60":"Explainer: So they're all reversible and it turns out that in every origami shape that folds flat, it's going to be either three mountains and a valley or, if we're looking at the backside, three valleys and a mountain, they always differ by two.\nExplainee: Oh.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Twists?\nExplainer: If I had another twist in the same sheet of paper I could make these folds connect with that, and these folds connect with that. And if I had another one up here, I could make all three. And if I had a square array and all the folds lined up I could make bigger and bigger arrays, like these, because these are just very large twists. In this case it's an octagon rather than a square, but they're arranged in rows and columns. And let's just try going along. All right, there is our tessellation with squares and hexagons. So you have now designed and folded your first origami tessellation and perhaps you can see how just using this idea of building up tiles and small building blocks you could make tessellations as big and complex as you want.\n","61":"Explainer: Yeah.\nExplainee: No, I don't think so.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Is this like a map where, that's like an actual visual representation, like using microscopy?\nExplainer: Yes.\n","62":"Explainer: Yeah.\nExplainee: I'm understanding more so that it's these, a mapping of the circuitry, the pathways between neurons that can lead to evidence of patterns in your brain that are common between different people.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Well, the computer only communicates with itself in binary so it only has two options, it can only ask itself yes or no questions, but a human brain has an infinity of directions that it can go.\nExplainer: Neurons are also digital. Meaning a Neuron either fires or it doesn't fire, so that's either one or zero. And it's the combination of those ones or zeros that actually produce the 10 thousand different answers that you say.\n","63":"Explainer: We have to use electron microscopes and then what we have been developing a way to slice the brain into really thin slices, use an electron microscope to take a picture of each slice, and then use computers to put it all back. Imagine that we could get a map of every connection, right? And we knew how neurons fire. Do you think we could put that in a computer, that map, and then therefore, that computer should be able to think just like the brain that we extracted it from?\nExplainee: Well, the computer only communicates with itself in binary so it only has two options, it can only ask itself yes or no questions, but a human brain has an infinity of directions that it can go.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","64":"Explainer: Yeah, again, we don't know exactly where X, Y, Z, zero is, we're assuming that it's something, you know, the X-rays that are coming out are very close to the event horizon of the black hole, but this is still, you know, your realm of X-rays, to really figure out those kinds of things. But once the X-rays, once the photons hit the corona, and are re-scattered, and up, energized, and then they start illuminating the accretion disk, it heats it up, and so just by the light travel time, when the optical, if it gets, you know, brighter and fainter, and then the infrared gets brighter and fainter, two weeks later, then the dust is two light weeks away from that. So it's a one dimensional one, so we're averaging, so we don't get the two dimensional, or even three dimensional one. And then we've done it now, of course, we have better telescopes, there was a project where you could do it with the Hubble Space Telescope and the ultraviolet, you used the Swift Observatory, which had optical and ultraviolet, and then from ground base, we did optical, and then from space we did it with Spitzer and the infrared. So you could actually see this bright flash go off in a nearby AGN called NGC5548, and then you see it propagate as it warms up the disk, as all that light is falling onto it, and then eventually you hit the, the, further away, where the dust is, and the dust tends to radiate in an infrared. So we got basically a structure, and you just, you see this flashbulb go off, and then it illuminates, effectively, the structure.\nExplainee: So you can map out the dust, where do you see it?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: We have the same problem, we can't see the actual black hole underneath all these very bright X-ray binaries.\nExplainer: It's a weird thing to be sitting in your own galaxy, but not be able to separate all these, four million solar mass black hole creating, next to, how massive, it's like two to three solar masses for the X-ray binaries?\n","65":"Explainer: Which is great, although it still doesn't help us in the AGN community, because we don't know how the millions to billions solar mass black holes came to be. But it's, at least we're building up, or hopefully that at some point, and by understanding these lower mass, how these lower mass black holes came to be, then we can see where there are a large scale number of mergers can potentially give us this, or you really need something, other, another corridor to fundamentally get us something that's a million solar masses, you know, on the minimum side, but definitely, you know, we've gotten those which are billion. So we know we can merge the million solar mass black holes to get the bigger ones, but how do you get to those in the beginning, particularly so early in the universe, when you get quasars at really high red shifts, so they're really early on.\nExplainee: Yeah, it is odd, it is very odd. I mean, the other thing that's a little odd, now we're going back to stellar mass black holes is, so we look at a lot of supernova remnants, and we, so we see them, we can only really see them in our own galaxy, and so we have a lot of supernova remnants, and so how we see them is, you see the expelled mass from the star as it died, so that creates an extended source, and then you look for the compact object that was left behind. And what's interesting is that you see, you quite often see the neutron stars because they pulse, so they're easy to see, but so far, we've not found a single black hole at the center of a supernova remnant. And so, which is interesting, so you say, you should see them, you know, you ought to see some fallback, you know, you need some matter, you need something, but no, never, not yet been detected.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Yeah, that might be, yeah.\nExplainer: Which was one idea, but again, it's, I'll leave this to your theoreticians, I think there are problems with that, as well. I call it job security. That's right. (both laugh) We have a lot of things about black holes, both in terms of their formation, or even how they exist as they are, and how they're interacting with their environment that we're still not understanding.\n","66":"Explainer: And this goes to the idea that you don't have a core balance, that a supernova with a black hole as its final result, actually never has any kind of expulsion, that it all just goes. (imitates sucking)\nExplainee: Yeah, that might be, yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","67":"Explainer: So is that where some of that frustration around the lack of controllability and interpretability comes from?\nExplainee: Yeah, if you're building a model that just predicts the next thing based off of everything it's seen from texts online, then yeah, you're really gonna be replicating whatever that distribution online is.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Yeah, it's a really tricky question. As you said, these models are trained to, sort of, predict the next sequence of words, given a certain sequence of words. So we could start with just, sort of, prompts like the woman was versus the man was, and, kind of, pull out common words that are, sort of, more used with one phrase versus the other. So that's, sort of, a qualitative way of looking at it. It's not ever kind of a guarantee of how the model is gonna behave in one particular instance. And I think that's what's really tricky and that's why I, sort of, think it's really good for creators of systems to just be honest about, This is, sort of, what we have seen. And so then, someone can make their own judgment about, Is this gonna be too high risk for, sort of, my particular use case?\nExplainer: I imagine in the last few years, we've seen a lot of changes and improvements in the capabilities of NLP systems. So is there anything in that that you're particularly excited about exploring further?\n","68":"Explainer: If you train a model off of language off the internet, it sometimes says uncomfortable things or inappropriate things and sometimes really biased things. Have you ever run into this yourself? And then how do you think about that problem of potentially even measuring the bias in a model that we've trained?\nExplainee: Yeah, it's a really tricky question. As you said, these models are trained to, sort of, predict the next sequence of words, given a certain sequence of words. So we could start with just, sort of, prompts like the woman was versus the man was, and, kind of, pull out common words that are, sort of, more used with one phrase versus the other.

It's really easy to write long grammatical passages thinking about the way that we can then harness, like, the human ability to actually give meaning to those words and, sort of, provide structure and how we can combine those things with the, kind of like, generative capabilities of these models now is really interesting.\nExplainer: Yeah, I agree.\n","69":"Explainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Well, one thing is quantum mechanics. Quantum mechanics is the most successful theory in the history of science, it explains the most different phenomena the most precisely. Yet many people would still say we don't understand even the basics of it.\nExplainer: So when we think about quantum mechanics, we think about particles and their quantum charges in the Feynman way, the way that Feynman taught us. They come in and they exchange a force carrier and then they come out again, so that's how we think of an electron and light scattering, for instance, or something like that. And the language that Einstein gave us is so different. It's completely geometric, it's all this space-time. And it's also unnecessary.\n","70":"Explainer: Practical purposes.\nExplainee: Yes.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: One thing about quantum mechanics is that any time you have a state of the world and another state of the world, you can literally add them together and get a third possible state, as crazy as that sounds. And so if you're gonna have a quantum theory of gravity, then we can't really talk about there being a black hole or not a black hole, or an event horizon or not an event horizon, because we could always a state that had an event horizon and a state that doesn't, or has the event horizon in a slightly different position, maybe, and add them together. So the existence or position of an event horizon can't possibly be determined as a fact any more than the position of an electron is determined. So I think that's the loophole.\nExplainer: That's a nice way of looking at it. So that you're not actually violating classical relativity once you're in a regime where the wave function has really peaked around a very well-defined stage.\n","71":"Explainer: So this is a huge crisis 'cause either quantum mechanics is wrong, and as you described it, it's the most accurately-tested paradigm in the history of physics, how could it be wrong, right? Or the event horizon is letting information out and violating one of the most sacred principles of relativity.\nExplainee: One thing about quantum mechanics is that any time you have a state of the world and another state of the world, you can literally add them together and get a third possible state, as crazy as that sounds. And so if you're gonna have a quantum theory of gravity, then we can't really talk about there being a black hole or not a black hole, or an event horizon or not an event horizon, because we could always a state that had an event horizon and a state that doesn't, or has the event horizon in a slightly different position, maybe, and add them together. So the existence or position of an event horizon can't possibly be determined as a fact any more than the position of an electron is determined. So I think that's the loophole.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: That's right, and one of the most exciting developments in the last 10 or 20 years is called holography, and it's called holography because a hologram is a two-dimensional surface that creates a three-dimensional image. It's got sort of 3D information built into it. And this, in a fundamental way, really has that 3D or higher dimensional information built into it. It's exactly the same as this theory of gravity and more dimensions.\nExplainer: Yes, so one of the things I like to think of with holography is that I can pack a certain amount of information in a black hole. I mean, you can literally think of it as throwing things into it. So let's say I have information in some volume and I'm under the illusion that I can just keep packing information in that volume, as much as the volume will contain. Eventually I'll make a black hole and I'll find out that the maximum amount of information I can pack into anything in the entire universe is what I can pack on the area. And since area is projecting the illusion, maybe, of volume, maybe the whole world is just a hologram. It's not a principle that only applies to black holes. It's saying that, if this theory of quantum gravity is correct, then this while three-dimensionality is an utter illusion and really the universe is two-dimensional. That's crazy.\n","72":"Explainer: That's a nice way of looking at it.

We're going to bring these corners together, making a little pocket and then, this is the trickiest part of this whole design, so you're going to put your finger underneath the top layer and we're going to try to make that layer fold right along the edge. Now you see how the sides kind of want to come in as you're doing that?\nExplainee: Yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Wow.\nExplainer: Now, this is a traditional Japanese design but there are origami designs that have been around so long we're not entirely sure where they originated. We're going to learn how to fold a cootie catcher.\n","75":"Explainer: Yeah, but there's something else we can do with this model.

Does this look familiar to you? Can you guess what this might be?\n","79":"Explainer: You have to make it smaller. Exactly. But here's the problem. So about 10 to 15 years ago, the devices got so small that if you shrunk them this gate, that actually turns it on and off loses its ability to control the channel. And so what they did, was they took devices like this into these things, we call them, FinFETs, kind of like a fin on a fish. So they're very thin transistors. The width of these fins is only six nanometers. Okay? So 6 nanometers is 25 to 30 atoms across. And they repeat this over the entire wafer just about perfectly. It's just a huge feat in engineering. But these types of devices are exactly the kind of devices that your phones and computers either have, or will have in the near future. And it's a way that nanotechnology is directly impacting you right now.\nExplainee: How do you make stuff that small? Obviously it's not handmade, so is it factories and stuff?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: In middle school, I built all of the little switches where you turn the electricity on, and it goes from one thing to the other.

There's different languages to hack in. I've also learned that a lot of things could be hacked that you don't necessarily think that can be hacked.\n","82":"Explainer: In a weird way, that is gravity pulling it. So have you ever had a yo-yo where you swing it around like this? The string is pulling it in at all times, but you've also given it this angular momentum. And as long as you give it the angular momentum, pulling it in actually keeps it in orbit. And so the Earth is pulling it in at all times, so that's why it doesn't just travel off in a straight line. It keeps coming back around. So it's funny, people think that the International Space Station is so far away that they're not feeling gravity, and that's not the case at all. They're absolutely feeling gravity. They're just cruising so fast that, even though they're being pulled in, they never get pulled to the surface.\nExplainee: It's like that ride at the rollercoasters where you go in and it's spins super fast and you can't feel it spinning fast but--\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: That's crazy.\nExplainer: Yeah. You ever had that experience where you're sitting in a train and the other one moves and for a second you're not sure if you're the one moving?\n","83":"Explainer: Yeah. You ever had that experience where you're sitting in a train and the other one moves and for a second you're not sure if you're the one moving?\nExplainee: Yeah, 'cause I go on the train every day to go to school, but I never feel like I'm moving when I'm in the train, and then I'm like, wait, what?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Isn't that kinda crazy? Amazing.\nExplainer: So imagine you were an astronaut and you were floating in empty space. You can't see anything. There's no stars, there's no Earth. You can ask yourself, am I moving? There's really no way for you to tell. So you would probably conclude, well, I'm not moving. So then your friend Marina comes cruising past you, and maybe she's going thousands of kilometers a second, and you say, Marina, you're cruising at thousands of kilometers a second, you're going so fast. But she had just done the same experiment. She was just floating in space thinking, Am I moving? There's no way to know which one of you is moving and there's no meaning to the absolute motion. The only thing that's true is that you're in relative motion, that's true. You both agree you're in relative motion, and that's clear. But neither of you can say it's actually you who's moving and I'm stationary.\n","84":"Explainer: Mine too, because I get to spend all day studying it. Because you know what sleep does for you?\nExplainee: It rests your body, like an electric car.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Whoa.\nExplainer: So today, we're going to talk about some animals and how they sleep. So here's the first one. What's that?\n","85":"Explainer: And how did you feel?\nExplainee: Really tired.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: It affects what you can do in your daily life.\nExplainer: Excellent. So now I want to tell you about another animal and how they sleep, okay? So we have this one. What's that?\n","86":"Explainer: A hippopotamus. They have a different challenge. They sleep underwater.\nExplainee: I could never do that, I would pass out.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: That's cool.\nExplainer: Would it be cool to have that power?\n","87":"Explainer: So now I want to talk about our last animal, and I think this one is probably the most amazing of all. Okay, so what's this?\nExplainee: Aww a dolphin.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: How?\nExplainer: One half of their brain at a time. So half of their brain goes to sleep, and the other half stays awake, so that they can continue to breathe and swim, and they do it in this four hours a time, so like their right part of their brain sleeps, they're able to go up to the surface and breathe. Then their left part of their brain sleeps for four hours, and it goes back and forth, back and forth, so they can kind of maintain alertness, still breathe, and survive. Is that amazing or what?\n","88":"Explainer: A dolphin! Yes. So dolphins, kind of like hippos, have to sleep in the water, okay? But because they're mammals, right, they need to breathe. Dolphins breathe air. They have to go up to the surface and breathe, right? And for an animal like that, it needs to figure out a way that it can sleep but also still survive, right? You know how dolphins sleep?\nExplainee: How?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: That's cool.\nExplainer: So what'd you learn today?\n","89":"Explainer: I wanted to talk to you about a specific type of science called nanotechnology. Have you ever heard of this word before?\nExplainee: Nhn nhn.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: A baby ant?\nExplainer: A baby ant? Very good. So I have over here a meter stick, let me show it to you. And so that's a meter and if I divide it by 1000, I get a millimeter. So milli just means 1000. There's all these little lines on the ruler. And each of those little lines is one millimeter. So a baby ant is probably a couple of millimeters. So even the thing, that's the smallest thing you can think of, it's a million times bigger than a nanometer. Tiny, tiny, tiny.\n","90":"Explainer: A baby ant? Very good.

They're just little things that make up everything on Earth, even earth.\nExplainer: That was a perfect explanation. But what if I told you that scientists invented a special type of microscope that not only lets you see atoms, but also lets you move them around and build things with them. Would you think that would be pretty cool?\n","91":"Explainer: You are definitely a second grader! [laughing] My daughter would probably answer the exact same way. A unicorn would be awesome.\nExplainee: Why do you study stuff so small?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Cool.\n","92":"Explainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: That kinds of notes back to Realism in our history and how Realism was a response to Romanticism. And Realism was meant to capture the mundane, everyday lives of individuals and not idealize any of their activities in any way. And I think that that's really important for virtual reality. I think its kind of rite-of-passage for any kind of our technology to go through.\nExplainer: Mostly in VR we talk about the display and optics, the visual side of things, but we should at least tick off the other senses. And haptics is an interesting thing about virtual reality really doesn't have that aspect of touching things. You can move your hands around, you can do everything but its a disconnected experience because you know you don't have an actual solidity there. And I am pessimistic about progress in haptics technology. Almost all other areas I'm an optimist and I'm excited about what's coming up, but I don't have any brilliant vision about how we're going to revolutionize haptics and make it feel like we're touching the things in the virtual world.\n","93":"Explainer: You know an interesting topic is: what are the limits to what we can do with virtual reality? Where I'm pretty pleased with what we have today. What we can show people and say virtual reality, its cool. People get an amazing response from it. But we're still clearly a very, very long ways from reality.\nExplainee: That kinds of notes back to Realism in our history and how Realism was a response to Romanticism. And Realism was meant to capture the mundane, everyday lives of individuals and not idealize any of their activities in any way. And I think that that's really important for virtual reality. I think its kind of rite-of-passage for any kind of our technology to go through.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: So I've tried the demos, at VRLA there's one that has waves, like audio waves I believe, that come up and then you can put your hands through that and feel the waves whenever you're supposed to be feeling bubbles or any kind of force field or something. And those are pretty interesting. I've seen some pretty interesting things that you can do with audios, you can cut down a lot of the storage I guess and the power that you would need in order to power a huge scene, you can just mimic the sounds of those scenes actually being there and they're not actually. For example, a professor at USC would have the sound of a train drive by without actually rendering the sound. And you would feel like you're deeply immersed in this world without having to have such an expensive scene built around you. So I think those are pretty significant.\nExplainer: Yeah, that is one potential quality improvement that is still on the horizon is when we do spatialization, we use HRTF, the Head Relative Transfer Function, to make it sound like its in different places. But usually we just use this one kind of generic, here's your average human, HRTF function. Its possible, that of course, if you are right in the average then its perfect for you. But there's always people off to the extremes, that it doesn't do a very good job at. And there may be better ways to allow people to sample their own perfect HRTF which can improve the audio experience a lot. It all comes down to all these trade-offs.\n","94":"Explainer: Mostly in VR we talk about the display and optics, the visual side of things, but we should at least tick off the other senses.

Its really difficult to build trust again with people who haven't done VR before but its easy to break off that trust when they have a bad experience.\nExplainer: There was a huge concern about that at Oculus. And the term internally that went around was poisoning the well. They were very, very concerned. I mean for a long time there was a fight about whether gear VR should even be done, because the worry was if we let a product go out, like gear VR that didn't have those things. That if somebody saw it and it was bad, made them sick, made their eyes hurt, then they would be like I'm never going to try VR again. I tried it that time and it was terrible. And there was legitimate arguments about whether it was even a good idea to do that. And it turned out that yes, its obviously better to have all those things, but you can still do something that's valuable for the user without it. Its weird being at the beginning of a medium like this.\n","95":"Explainer: Yeah, that is one potential quality improvement that is still on the horizon is when we do spatialization, we use HRTF, the Head Relative Transfer Function, to make it sound like its in different places.

Especially if they're experienced with traditional medium.\n","96":"Explainer: So, from your perspective, how would you describe gravity?\nExplainee: I'm taught that it's a force. It's described by inverse law. But I also know that it's a field. And there's a recent discovery with gravitational waves, although I don't know the specific details about that.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Yeah.\nExplainer: So you can also think of a gravitational field, something that permeates all of space. Even though the earth is three stories below us, it's not as though it's pulling at us from a distance. We're actually interacting with the field at this point and there's a real interaction right here at this point. And that's nice, because people were worried that if things acted at a distance, that the way that old-fashioned inverse-square force law describes it, that it was as spooky as mind-bending a spoon, that it was like telekinesis. If you don't touch something, how do you affect it? And so the first step was to start to think of gravity as a field that permeates all of a space. And it's weaker very far from the Earth and it's closer very close to the Earth. So one way to think of this field as a field that's really describing a curved space-time that is everywhere. Forget the difficulty of the math, just the intuition comes from two kind of simple observations. One was what Einstein described as the happiest thought of his life. So, right now, you might feel heavy in your chair, and we might feel heavy on the floor and our feet, or standing in an elevator cab. And Einstein said, what does the chair have to do with it, or the floor, or the elevator? Those aren't gravitational objects. So he wanted to eliminate them, and one way to do the thought experiment is to imagine standing in an elevator that you can see out of, a black box. And imagine the cable is cut and you and the elevator begin to fall.\n","97":"Explainer: So you can also think of a gravitational field, something that permeates all of space.

But if you did that on the Earth, what would happen?\nExplainee: It would just go down.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Oh.\nExplainer: You had that moment, I saw that it your face!\n","99":"Explainer: You had that moment, I saw that it your face!\nExplainee: Yeah, yeah, yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: That's amazing.\nExplainer: Isn't it kind of amazing?\n","100":"Explainer: I'm sure you've heard about extra dimensions a little bit.\nExplainee: I've heard it, yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: I get a little scared, [laughing] because I think how can you prove these theories?\nExplainer: Right.\n","101":"Explainer: Mm-hmm.\nExplainee: Is that an extra dimension? Does that fit into that, or is that something?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: And are each of those dimensions, are they governed by the same laws of physics, or is there like a separate Lagrangian for each universe--\nExplainer: It's a, yeah.\n","102":"Explainer: It's a, yeah.\nExplainee: [Bela] Or how does that work?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Okay.\nExplainer: Why in the world would you think that there are extra dimensions, right? So you've heard of string theory?\n","103":"Explainer: Mm-hmm. So we have quantum mechanics, right? The theory of atoms and so forth and how those work, and then we have gravity, and gravity doesn't seem to fit in. It's the one force of nature that we can't really easily fit into this quantum mechanical framework, so string theory is one of the best ideas.\nExplainee: Right.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: I've heard it, yeah.\nExplainer: [Sean] Do you know where it comes from?\n","104":"Explainer: It's even better. It's the theory of everything. What would you tell a friend of yours if they asked you what dimensions are, what extra dimensions are, what a brane is?\nExplainee: So we have three spatial dimensions. A brane is sort of the next level. So a brane is a higher dimensional object that vibrates through space.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: It was really cool to learn about strings and branes and how looking at gravity on small scales is actually connected to what I do in looking at gravity on these cosmological scales, and it's definitely something I'm gonna think about in my research.\n","105":"Explainer: [Bettina] Have you ever heard of blockchain?\nExplainee: I have. Whenever we have a transaction, and let's say I buy something from you, this information gets logged. And it gets verified by a third person or third party. And then if like all this information verified and it all matches, right, the transaction goes through without any intermediary basically, right? It gets stored, and when you make further transactions, this information is ready, embedded. It's in the ledger.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Absolutely. The way the technology's changing, nothing's gonna be like it used to be. And there's no like firm, and then the buyer and the seller, it basically, we'll have to rewrite a lot of rules in economics as well.\nExplainer: For sure. A lot of the assumptions won't hold true.\n","106":"Explainer: Yeah. One of the problems that Bitcoin has faced is Bitcoins getting stolen or lost. But a lot of that actually comes from people trying to recentralize Bitcoin in different ways making themselves actually a pretty easy target.\nExplainee: Absolutely, so education will be a big part before we actually can use the technology in a wide sense. Right?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: The current state is in the research state, and it's being developed to be applied in many, many areas. It must be used almost everywhere to where we won't even imagine how we lived without it. But I'm not sure where it's going to go. I mean, no one really knows, right.\nExplainer: Well, we have a lot of public blockchains. Like we have Bitcoin. We have the Ethereum network and XT, but a lot of companies and consortiums are getting together to build private blockchains, so ones that are more closed off at first and then may evolve into a public network where people feel comfortable using it. And some are also proof of concept out in the real world, projects in energy and in pharmaceuticals and in retail and lots of different fields are starting experiments. And we'll see in the next few years how all of those interact and what we learn about the best use cases for blockchain and what it means for trade.\n","107":"Explainer: This is another real-world application but this particular implementation is used to make a wheel for a Rover.\nExplainee: Cool, so this is something that can actually get really, really tiny but then get big and fat and roll.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Yeah!\nExplainer: Another origami challenge that comes up with these patterns is if we're going to make an aircraft out of this thing we're going to need hundreds of yards of folded origami. We're not going to do it by hand and this might be the new frontier in origami engineering, which is the design of machines that can fold patterns that have applications.\n","108":"Explainer: New problems arise when we try to make origami out of things other than paper, but also new opportunities. An example here which is a kind of a variant of the Miura-Ori. It's got a three-dimensional structure. If I stretch it one way, it expands the other but because it has these S-bends in the pattern, if you squeeze it, it doesn't go all the way flat. This is a epoxy impregnated aramid fiber and so if I put this fold pattern into it and then compress it and then put a skin on the top and bottom, this becomes incredibly lightweight but incredibly strong.\nExplainee: Yeah!\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: So you're talking about a machine that is actually folding it into this, not just making the creases but actually folding it.\nExplainer: Yeah, so what goes in as sheet and what comes out is this, or something this wide.\n","109":"Explainer: When we were much smaller societies, you and I could trade in our community pretty easily. As the distance in our trade grew, we ended up inventing institutions, right? If you Uber or you use Airbnb or you use Amazon even, these are just digital marketplaces and platforms that help us facilitate an exchange of value. But today, we actually have a technology that allows us to trade one to one but at scale, and it's called blockchain technology. There is some kind of interface for it. You could have an app, or you could use a computer to do it, but instead of there being a company in the middle that's helping you make that transaction, it's a bunch of software code.\nExplainee: Okay.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: I mean, I would assume this technology is taking away business or activity from these middlemen.\nExplainer: In some cases, yeah, it is. And a lot of people in the financial industry, in particular, are looking at it from the banking side of how do we use this technology to trade things like Bitcoin or other tokens that are easier to use instead of today's currency. A lot of people think about blockchain as Bitcoin because it's sort of in the news a lot, and it's this new cryptocurrency. And it's kind of exciting. But we're actually seeing a lot more use cases for blockchain that aren't around the currency side. They're more around, how do you take any asset and be able to trade that using this same technology.\n","110":"Explainer: And so it's being run by all of these different computers that have like a node. So they're all running the same software and guaranteeing your transactions as they happen.\nExplainee: I mean, I would assume this technology is taking away business or activity from these middlemen.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Is there a mechanism for verifying that person A is a legitimate seller or producer of the item?\nExplainer: So today, a lot of people are working on how to create identity structures that leverage blockchains. And one of the tools for doing that is being able to cryptographically sign for a given attribute. So your government could sign that you have a US passport or a university could sign that you are a currently enrolled student. And you could then dole out that information and control it yourself and be able to show people those certifications on an as needed basis.\n","111":"Explainer: In some cases, yeah, it is.

We've done one meta-analysis and it's showed that those with sleep apnea, they have a ratio of 1.26, which means that those who have sleep apnea have 26% elevated risk of developing Alzheimer's compared to those without sleep apnea.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Yeah, so I think what's really fascinating is all these bio-directional relationships that's being identified in animal studies especially, showing that sleep changes actually occur very early on in the disease process, so it could be a prodromal stage of Parkinson's, and also in transgenic model of AD, they're already showing a lot of circadian abnormalities in this mouse.\nExplainer: So within dementia risk in particular, Alzheimer's for instance, there are kind of two clear features that seem to be part of the pathology, right? So there's beta-amyloid which accumulates in the brain, and then there's kind of these tangles, this tauopathies, right? And so it sounds like sleep seems to be related to the tauopathies. What about kind of beta-amyloid?\n","113":"Explainer: So within dementia risk in particular, Alzheimer's for instance, there are kind of two clear features that seem to be part of the pathology, right?

I think there are incredible innovations that are happening in the basic sciences, kind of really starting to understand what are the clear biological processes that underly some of these things as they relate to disease risk, and what is the true function of sleep, kind of the why we sleep phenomenon, right?\n","114":"Explainer: Here's a spider with eight legs, ants with legs and these, just like the crane, are folded from a single uncut square.\nExplainee: What?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Yes.\nExplainer: That's a corner, four corners of the square, four points. How would you make one point out of this sheet of paper?\n","115":"Explainer: You've got it, so you are ready to design origami.\nExplainee: Awesome.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Wow, that's so impressive. I think I learned how to make one of these paper cranes when I was in third grade but I guess I never unfolded it to actually see where it was coming from. And so now that it's all broken up into circles it makes these super complicated insects and animals and everything seem so much simpler, so that's so cool. I'm pretty excited about it.\nExplainer: That's so cool.\n","116":"Explainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Life gave us this toolkit that is already on the nanoscale. So we think that that's a great place to think about making materials on the nano scale and manipulating materials on the nano scale, and wiring them together as well. This abalone shell, you can see the exquisite beautiful colors and structures of it. This is a nano composite material. If you take this and fracture it, and you look at it in a scanning electron microscope, what you'll see is that it's made out of these beautiful tablets. And I studied that as a graduate student. I looked at that and I said, that is completely amazing. You have an organism in the ocean, that takes what's in its environment, which is calcium and carbonate. That's dissolved in the water and templates it into this really exquisite structure. And so you think that's great. Calcium carbonate is great, but what if we wanted to make a solar cell or a another electronic device or a battery, how would you get an organism to do that? And you say, okay, that's a really crazy idea. But is it really that crazy if this abalone, already figured out how to do it, 500 million years ago? So we're saying, okay, abalones build shells. Can viruses build solar cells, can viruses build catalysts? Can they build batteries using the same kind of idea?\nExplainer: It's really fascinating work, especially now we're all familiar with the viruses and how they act. And I'm not aware of any viruses that build nanostructures. So how did you come to that? And then how do you actually program a virus to do your bidding?\n","117":"Explainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Right.\nExplainer: Telescopes, solar arrays, they need to be packed into a rocket, go up, but then expand in a very controlled, deterministic way when they get up into space.\n","118":"Explainer: Telescopes, solar arrays, they need to be packed into a rocket, go up, but then expand in a very controlled, deterministic way when they get up into space.\nExplainee: Okay.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: [Grad Student] Okay.\nExplainer: So this is what's called a single degree of freedom mechanism. You have one degree of freedom, I can choose this fold, and then if these are perfectly rigid every other fold angle is fully determined. One of the key behaviors here is that with the smaller angles up here, the two folds that are the same parity and the folds that are of opposite parity move at about the same rate but with this, as we're getting closer to 90 degrees, we find they move at very different rates and then at the end of the motion, the opposite happens. This one is almost folded but this one goes through a much larger motion so the relative speeds differ.\n","119":"Explainer: There's an engineering trade-off to get them both to work. And there's another place that shows up in deployable structures in a very cool structure. This is a folded tube, it sort of pops out like this but it has this neat property that if you twist it quickly, it changes color. There's a Mars Rover application where they need a sleeve that protects a drill and as the drill goes down, the sleeve is going to collapse and they're using a pattern very much like this.\nExplainee: Interesting.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: If you want to send something to space it probably makes sense to do it compactly, so if you have something that you can fold up and then unfold, just one of the folds, that's going to be probably the easiest way to get something up there and expand it to what it needs to be.\n","120":"Explainer: Yeah, or in Minecraft. When you look at a TV on the wall there showing like a picture of a mountain or something, how can you tell that its not just a window and there's something else behind it. Because it always doesn't look quite right if you have a static picture of a person on a screen and you move around like this, its not really changing. And its interesting, those are things we have to figure out We need to figure out when you look at something in reality how can you tell whether its real or not.

It's not really one dimensional, right?\nExplainee: So everything has to be one or two dimensional before it's three dimensional.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: I think I would be maybe there, since I'm facing it.\nExplainer: But here's what I want you to think about. If I say I'm at this point on the line, I could translate that into saying I'm at the three centimeter point, if I were here I'd be at the four centimeter point, the five centimeter point, right?\n","127":"Explainer: I think you should be in this chair and you should be explaining this to me.

[both laugh]\nExplainee: Oh, I didn't realize it was that deep, almost. Is there a situation which you'd want to use a deep learning algorithm over a reinforcement learning algorithm?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: What would be the outcome if you were to choose the, quote-unquote, wrong approach?\nExplainer: You build a system that could actually be useless. So years ago, I had a client that was a big telecom company and they had a data scientist who built a deep learning system to predict customer churn. It actually was very accurate, but it wasn't useful because nobody knew why the prediction was what it was. So they could say, you know, Sunny, you're likely to quit next month.

But we're still not gonna get to the Schwinger limit, isn't that right?\n","135":"Explainer: That's right, if you can do that, go for it.\nExplainee: And then we will shine that laser onto that electron beam, and the electron's rest frame, we beat the Schwinger limit.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: That's why I wanna cheat.\nExplainer: That's the Nobel Prize winning idea though if we can come up with it.\n","136":"Explainer: So we can either cheat by doing laser accelerating and going into that rest frame.\nExplainee: Yes.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Absolutely.\nExplainer: Or we need, going around and giving my talks now, I show how we're plateauing. I showed how there was a plateau, CPA raises it up, but we're sort of starting to plateau again and we need another Nobel Prize winning idea. And so do you think it's on the horizon? Do you see anything out there that really says, oh yeah that's a good way to go? 'Cos we're gonna have to get out to the x-rays right? We can't stay in the visual.\n","137":"Explainer: And that's, like you said, we're stuck a little bit, we're not up to that kind of acceleration, so that would be a Nobel Prize winning possible idea.\nExplainee: Absolutely.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: So actually there's a potential ways of doing it with optical or near optical radiation. And there's been a lot of work done in the defense department and so on, how do I combine laser beams together?\nExplainer: Okay.\n","138":"Explainer: Okay.\nExplainee: And make them act as one coherent source. So one of the things that we'll be doing with our two petawatts, we're going to see if we can actually combine them into a 50. If you can do that, you can begin to imagine doing this with many lasers. Many petawatt lasers of the scale we're talking about. So one could possibly see an exawatt from that. People have been able to combine 10s of lasers together for a coherent source so you have to be able to phase lock them, you have to be able to make their phases be exactly connected and related and be able, as they propagate through all the different optical components, whatever it may be--\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: So that's right so you have to have the aperture size, you have to have them phase locked across the entire aperture. Which will be a great challenge and people have done it, again, with small lasers. The lasers we'll be trying to do is about a 40cm aperture. So we'll begin to start looking at this. And actually wavelength control and then be able to adaptive optics other ways which you can control the uniformity of the phase is something that's been developed in lots of ways now. For defense applications, for science applications. So we will do our best to make use of all these technologies. Lasers I think have progressed so much. Just like the semi conductor did, 'cos there's such a market for it, there were so many different applications for that.\nExplainer: Okay so there's a lot of us working around the world on these high intensity lasers and so, what do you think the real fun is? What do you see the real excitement being?\n","139":"Explainer: Have you heard of the breach of Target where they were breached many years ago and their point of sale systems were hacked?\nExplainee: Yes, I heard about that.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: I've heard about similar attacks in hospitals using hospital equipment, but I'm surprised that something as simple as a meat scale would have been used in such an attack. We discussed it in class as how hackers look at some of the weakest links in these large networks and use those to tap into networks.\nExplainer: Yeah, that's another interesting concept. It's really just different layers that we have for protection, because often when you're talking about something like a corporate network, or even your home network, you typically have sort of one level of defense, right? If someone can break that or it can get in through some other system that is connected or exposes some other protocol, like Bluetooth, right? You can connect to a Bluetooth device without being on the wireless network, without being on the LAN. That potentially gives you another place that you can pivot on and then access other devices, because if something has both Bluetooth and also Wi-Fi, well, if you can get in through Bluetooth, then you can then access the Wi-Fi and get to other devices on the network. Are you familiar with buffer overflows?\n","140":"Explainer: So where people are swiping credit cards, those credit card numbers were stolen. They hired a company to come in and perform a penetration test to see, can the good guys essentially break in again to prevent this sort of thing in the future? And when this team came in, they found they actually were able to get pretty much to the same point of sale system, and the way they did that was by exploiting an internet-connected deli meat scale. Once the company was able to essentially get into the deli scale, because the deli scale was on the internal network, then they were able to really escalate privilege and find a vulnerability within another system. Essentially, that just got them into the network. and once you're in the network, it's often really easy to then escalate from there.\nExplainee: I've heard about similar attacks in hospitals using hospital equipment, but I'm surprised that something as simple as a meat scale would have been used in such an attack. We discussed it in class as how hackers look at some of the weakest links in these large networks and use those to tap into networks.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: No, I am not familiar with that.\nExplainer: If we were to write a program that asked for your name and you typed in your name, but before you could type in your name, in a low leveling, which is like C or C++, you'd have to allocate some memory. So you might allocate a buffer of a hundred bytes because whose name is going to be longer than a hundred bytes or a hundred character? But what happens if you were to not really check that they limited to a hundred bytes? Do you know what happens if they essentially start typing over that hundred bytes?\n","141":"Explainer: Well one of the fun things people do with lasers, the cat will try to grab that dot. I'm sure what you have at home is a flashlight. I brought a cute little one. So the question is, do you see any difference between what a flashlight does and what a laser does?\nExplainee: Flashlight is a bigger shine and the laser is just a dot.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: [Harmoni] The laser.\nExplainer: The laser. So which one do you think's more powerful?\n","142":"Explainer: One of the things that lasers are great for is that because it's a directed beam, we can actually put that light where we want the light to go and sometimes you maybe just want to see something around the corner and you can't see it. But with a laser, you can actually and this is a smoky one so you can actually watch it go. You see it actually bending the corner?\nExplainee: Yes.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Yeah.\nExplainer: So this obviously is much bigger than our hair. Right?\n","143":"Explainer: So this is just a demonstration. If you have a laser like this, it actually bends and comes out, I'm gonna point it to you and you'll see it coming out the other end. It hits these walls, it has to go around and come out the other side. You wanna play? So is this the first time you've seen a laser or have you gotten to play with lasers somewhere else?\nExplainee: I don't have a cat or--\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Yes.\nExplainer: Have you ever seen that maybe there's a little bit of a red light when you do that?\n","144":"Explainer: That's a laser. We cut steel with them now. We actually do surgery with lasers. You know when some people have either scars or birth marks that they don't want to see? We can actually remove those with lasers now. Never seen a laser light show? When they light up the sky with lasers, it's almost like fireworks.\nExplainee: Well I saw a shooting star before.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Yes they're very cool. I like the one where you did the green one.\nExplainer: The green one. And the next time you go to a grocery store, take a peek at the red.\n","145":"Explainer: That's pretty challenging if you want to use wireless, right? If you wanna use a wireless router.\nExplainee: Yeah, I mean, there's obviously essentials, but yeah, no matter what, you can't really avoid any of this.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Oh yeah, for sure. When people find vulnerabilities, I think it's their duty to release those to the public.\nExplainer: Especially now that we're seeing more and more companies who are trying to make it illegal for you to inspect the vehicle that you've purchased, right? Something that you actually own.\n","146":"Explainer: We have a lot of companies that sort of help us make sure that our trades happen, but if we could guarantee the same trade using technology as sort of a technological trust, then we wouldn't really need all those middlemen in between.\nExplainee: So how does it work?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: So like, how do you make sure that it's secure?\nExplainer: So it use cryptography, and that helps it basically encode all of the transactions. So you can't really see exactly what happened, but you can know it happened because it's like a marker.\n","147":"Explainer: [Bettina] Exactly.\nExplainee: That's cool.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: That's cool.\nExplainer: Yeah.\n","148":"Explainer: Well I brought a little bit of a prop to explain how chirped pulse amplification works. Our short pulses are made of different colors. So I've got a colored slinky here. We probably could've called it stretched pulse amplification but that's kind of boring so we used the word chirped. The word chirped comes around because birds chirp. When the birds are singing, the notes are actually changing audio frequency with time and that's a chirp. The point is is that when all the light is squeezed together like this, it's a short pulse. And that's when it's a hammer because all of the light is now concentrated and you can imagine if this was coming along and also using a lens to focus it small, then all of that light at the focal spot, concentrate. And so that was the laser hammer. So we can't have that in the laser. So the question is what could we do? The fact that it's different colors and different colors because of dispersion, travel different speeds inside material. So we used a long fiber, 1.4 kilometers of fiber but, in fiber, the red colors really haven't got that much in common with the glass atoms and so they spend very little time interacting and they travel fast. The red is going to start traveling faster than the green, faster than the blue and, as you travel down the fiber, next thing you know, you have a long pulse and it's chirped from red at the beginning to blue at the back. And so the frequencies go hoo! Like this okay? So this is a chirped pulse and now it's a long pulse. And so, first this is what we did, we chirped it, we stretched it, then we can safely amplify it because it's not all concentrated and, after we amplify it, then we use something called a compressor and we put all of the colors back together and it was back being a short pulse but a high energy pulse. And then we really had what I like to call a laser hammer. When this laser pulse goes inside, it smacks those electrons right off the atom.\nExplainee: So the laser hammer that you were describing with other types of lasers and the one in the chirped is it still the same premise?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: What's the pendant?\nExplainer: The necklace is something that was designed for my Nobel prize. It's sold at the Nobel museum and it is a chirped pulse. So we've been talking a lot about lasers and applications, what have you learned about chirped pulses?\n","149":"Explainer: Right.\nExplainee: Then I finally understood the idea where the overtone series came from that if a bunch of singers were to nail a chord or have it perfectly tuned, the overtones, you would hear a tone that necessarily wasn't being produced by one the singers.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Yeah.\nExplainer: I think that people forget that you can work with the notes you already have by just rearranging them, just the simple idea of inversion, inversion of the simple triad, of F major. \u266aI once was lost and now I'm found \u266a \u266a Was blind \u266a \u266a But now I see \u266a Now how home do I want to go here, you know? Is there another verse to come?\n","150":"Explainer: Yeah. The amazing thing about harmony is that it exists in nature. So, take the harmonic series of the note F, for example. Okay. You have the ups on the fifth and the fourth and then the, (hums) That seemed a little bit sharp, but that's fine. And then tones get increasingly small. Beneath that note, you have the undertone series, which essentially is like a reflection of something. In the same way that when a tree grows in nature, you have the branches which grow upwards and the roots which go downwards. So it's quite a nice thing to thing about, this being the key center, the floor, the ground, and then these two different directions of ways in which it can express itself, and the differences in the sensations with that. Lots of the time I think when it comes to reharmonization or harmonization, people think that the solution to the problems come when we add more notes.\nExplainee: Yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Right.\nExplainer: Because I can delay the gratification of going home. First of all, just by using inversions, even before we add the notes to the chord. One thing that I was very joyful to discover is that every single melody note works with every single base note.\n","151":"Explainer: I think that people forget that you can work with the notes you already have by just rearranging them, just the simple idea of inversion, inversion of the simple triad, of F major. \u266aI once was lost and now I'm found \u266a \u266a Was blind \u266a \u266a But now I see \u266a Now how home do I want to go here, you know?

And then, G seven with a flat 13\nExplainee: (laughs)\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: But what about negative harmony, the dark side?\nExplainer: So essentially, the way I'd apply negative harmony would be this idea of polarity, you know, between the overtone series and the undertone series, or you know, the one side and the other side. The perfect and the play goal. The feeling of a minor perfect-- (keyboard music) Resolving, it's so moving, you know? And it's a good alternative to something like, (keyboard music)\n","153":"Explainer: That's it! (laughs) A flat soft, A flat major seven. A flat major seven sharp five, with a sharp 11. Essentially, what that demonstrates is that every note and every base note are compatible. So once we realize this its like, that's great! Now what should we do? What, how, what should we, what should we, how, what am I supposed to do? What to do, right. And sometimes the paralyzing thing when it comes to arranging, there are too many options, too many things are possible. So that's when it becomes super, super important to be aware of what you wanna try and say emotionally.\nExplainee: But what about negative harmony, the dark side?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: It's funny, you know, you doing that makes something in a major key sound like kind of a wistful sad song.\nExplainer: Right.\n","154":"Explainer: But if you arrive in F major from A major, then it's like the sun's gone in.\nExplainee: Interesting.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: All right.\n","155":"Explainer: Connectome.\nExplainee: To be honest, I have no idea.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Whoa.\nExplainer: In one brain, in your brain.

Two scientists were dissecting an eye, a cow's eye. And I was like that is the coolest thing I've ever seen. And something about that that carried me forward. Something happened so long ago, it left some long lasting trace through neural circuits and it continues to shape the decisions we make about what to study and what to do.\n","162":"Explainer: My work has actually kind of pushed against that distinction between memories that kind of are consciously accessible versus unconscious.\nExplainee: When you say that you don't necessarily look at implicit and explicit memory as anything different, if you were to take a step back, what would you define as implicit and explicit memory?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Are the connectivities that you're seeing using the FMRI in your studies, are they different when you look at the implicit and explicit memories? Are you seeing more activity in the striatum in comparison to the hippocampus or the prefrontal cortex?\nExplainer: Yeah, you know things are kind of breaking down in unexpected ways I'd say. I think there's been a lot of really great work out of multiple labs showing hippocampal activity related to behaviors that don't look anything like episodic memories, but which might depend on episodic memories right? So for example also when you're making a decision about how to choose between two good options that suddenly you might see activity in the hippocampus related to the choice itself, others have found that you find activity in the hippocampus not only when people are forming memories, but also when they're imagining events that are gonna happen in the future. So it kind of forced us to rethink the way we define what the hippocampus might be doing in a way that can account for creating memories, thinking about the future, making decisions and other kinds of behaviors that involve what we would refer to you in the field as relational processing. And that raises all kinds of new questions about what memory really is. Reminiscing about our early influences that made us want to be scientists is that, you know, of course we know, we know better than to think that those are necessarily accurate memories. You know this reminds me of sort of the classic example from literature when people talk about memory of course is Marcel Proust's Madeleine in Remembrance of Things Past. Where in the book it's this taste for the, for the protagonist this taste of the crumbs of the Madeleine cookie and the tea that bring him back to his childhood. You know, seven volumes then emerge of memories of, of that childhood. Digging further into earlier drafts of Proust's novel that initially it didn't describe a Madeleine at all.\n","163":"Explainer: What's your favorite subject?\nExplainee: I'd say math.

And there's a sense in which it's very similar to the arithmetic that you learned about already. But it's also totally different. It has some very weird properties. Welcome to Hilbert's Hotel. Unlike an ordinary hotel, has accountably infinitely many rooms. Suppose a new guest shows up, you might think that the new guest could take the room that's all the way down at the end of the hall, all the way at infinity, except there isn't a room like that. The rooms each have a number, and even though there's infinitely many rooms, each room is only a finite distance away. So here's how we're gonna make room for the new guest. I'm gonna ask the guest in room one to move into room two, and then we're gonna ask the guest in room two to move into room three, and we'll continue this all the way along. It looks to me like there's space for the new guest. Where is it? \nExplainee: It'll be in room number one.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Would it be two plus infinity equals infinity?\nExplainer: Absolutely. So now I'm gonna make this story a little more complex. That there's another Hilbert's Hotel down the street and they're having plumbing issues and we need to find room for them.\n","169":"Explainer: Infinity, great. Hilbert's Hotel is a story that mathematicians have been telling themselves for almost 100 years because it's a really visceral way to think about some of the counterintuitive properties of the arithmetic of infinity.\nExplainee: How does infinity come across in mathematics for you?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","170":"Explainer: Yeah. That's what it's called.\nExplainee: Yeah. yeah, I haven't heard of it before.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Yeah, I did work with robots, but they weren't doing like artificial intelligence type of stuff. We were just sending like instructions and the robot would do, like, perform like a simple task. I wasn't so used to the aspect of, like, teaching computer how to do stuff. So I'm always on that other end of like giving instructions, more focused on the data analysis and machine learning aspect of it.\nExplainer: And how would you just describe machine learning, like in one sentence?\n","171":"Explainer: That's a great question. I think we should be able to accelerate the data collection process by having robots collect more data autonomously on their own. And by doing that, we might be able to overcome some of the challenges of Moravec's paradox.\nExplainee: What are some common algorithms that are used in these types of techniques as the robot is learning?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","172":"Explainer: Do you have any sense of how you would give a really precise mathematical definition to, you know, what is a fractal?\nExplainee: It would probably have to be some kind of recursive definition, like imaginary numbers. I know the Mandelbrot set we'll use those.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: No, I have not actually.\nExplainer: Yeah, great. So, so the real physical paper has some amount of thickness, but when we model this mathematically, we might ignore the thickness and say, yeah, this is really just kind of a two dimensional sheet of paper. And then you have your apple, how many dimensions is the apple?\n","173":"Explainer: Totally, now, as a little experiment, take your piece of paper and just crumple it into a ball. So what is it? Is the paper three dimensional or is it two dimensional?\nExplainee: Because it has the pipes and the width. And there's a depth to it as well.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: It changed and dimensions depending on how it is shaped.\nExplainer: And if I cut that box in half again, how many boxes do I need to cover the line.\n","174":"Explainer: But if you take a more interesting shape, some kind of fractal shape, like let's say the coastline of great Britain and you start doing this box, counting experiment, something really interesting happens as you make these boxes smaller, the number of boxes you need to cover the coastline grows faster than it would for just a straight line.\nExplainee: Four.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Yeah, I've, I've heard about that. Where if you, if you change the amount of measurement for a coastline, you can actually change like how much of the coast that, that there is like if you measure in mile lengths, you're gonna get a much different estimate than if you measure in one inch increments.\nExplainer: So procedural computer graphics, which kind of came out of thinking about fractals is one answer to this question about how do you add more detail without for instance, consuming tons of memory or requiring artists to paint ultra detail the textures. So if, if you can instead describe at least some aspect of what you're looking at in a procedural or recursive way, then you can add as much detail as you need when you get close to objects.\n","175":"Explainer: Yeah like perlin noise is a great example, right? Perlin noise was one of the early ways of synthesizing additional texture at any level of detail that you needed to make things look natural and realistic.\nExplainee: Oh, you mean like perlin noise?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: I have a, a random question. Do you know how the research into fractals began?\n","176":"Explainer: And then program the robot to move over here and open the- \nExplainee: And drop it.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Yes.\nExplainer: We can see what happens. So it's gonna, we programed the robot to move to the same exact position as before.\n","177":"Explainer: When we gave it instructions, did we tell it to look at where the cup was? Or did we tell it to just move over here?\nExplainee: We told it to just move over here.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Okay.\nExplainer: Does that seem like a hard task or an easy task?\n","178":"Explainer: So actually, in the blockchain space is one of the spaces where we are seeing zero-knowledge proofs being implemented. And I think it's just the beginning. Let's talk about zero-knowledge proofs. At its core, a zero-knowledge proof is an interaction between two people. Then I should be able to convince you that some statement is true, but you won't have any idea why it's true.\nExplainee: Will I, like, understand that it's true because like, you know, the operations performed in the proof are like, of a certain, like, you know, they have like, certain attributes that would make them true?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Sounds good.\nExplainer: And the way we're gonna approach this is through something called NP-completeness. What an NP-complete problem is, it's a problem that's really hard to solve. But if you can solve it, you can solve any problem that's in the class NP. And that includes a vast number of problems. And what we're gonna do is we're gonna use an NP-complete problem to actually prove an incredible variety of statements through a zero-knowledge proof. And the specific Np-complete problem that we're gonna be looking at is called map three-coloring. Okay, so here we have a map. Okay. And these are a bunch of countries. And we've arranged them so that no countries that have the same color share a border. That's what makes a map like this validly colored. And now you might think, well, why should we care? It turns out that whether or not a map can be three-colored in this way is an example of an NP-complete problem. And it turns out that, you know, maybe what you really wanna do, is you wanna give a zero-knowledge proof that you have at least 0.3 Bitcoins, right? That would be cool.\n","179":"Explainer: Right? So you have a little bit of confidence, right, that I have managed to color this correctly. but not that much confidence. 'Cause I've only shown you two of the countries.\nExplainee: Yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: I'll take this one and this one.\nExplainer: Nice. And that's smart of you to check with the same one of the ones you already had. Right?\n","180":"Explainer: You would use encryption. Right. But it's really, this is the protocol.\nExplainee: So what are the broader implications of like, zero-knowledge proofs. Are they supposed to be like, more practical for like, implementation, and or, are they supposed to like, structurally prove something?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Where do you think we could build like, more trust using like, zero-knowledge proofs?\nExplainer: Right.\n","181":"Explainer: Right.\nExplainee: And it's implementations?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","182":"Explainer: So on your trip what was the funnest day ever?\nExplainee: There was this pool, I love pools. And then there's a slide you go down and there's pool noodles in there too. And then there's a little tiny sandbox.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: I don't really remember.\nExplainer: Do you remember from that day what color towel you used when you got out of the pool?\n","183":"Explainer: Do you remember from that day what color towel you used when you got out of the pool?\nExplainee: I think the one I used was a dark blue or a light blue or, or like sort of a teal.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: I think as you get older you start forgetting things more because you have to make space for new things, which is why you forget stuff.\nExplainer: Yeah, that's a great insight. Basically we can't remember everything. So when you tell us this memory of that vacation and your brain is able to kind of play almost this movie of a memory, a moment, a day that you had in your life a while ago, where do those memories come from?\n","184":"Explainer: And so you can't actually measure the length.\nExplainee: Yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Would a planet or an asteroid be a fractal?\nExplainer: Yeah, so if you look at kind of the wrinkly surface of an asteroid, each one of those little wrinkles adds a little bit to the surface area. And so it's really hard to say, what is the area of an asteroid? Let's take a look at a little example of where fractals actually show up in nature. What we're gonna try to do is we're gonna try to say what the length of the coastline of great Britain is. So we're gonna start out with the blue ones, which are spaced further apart. We're gonna ask you to connect the blue pins with a piece of string so we can get a measurement of the coastline. So we have our first measurement of the length of the coastline, and we're gonna do it over again. But this time we're gonna use the white pins, which are spaced closer together. So we measured the coastline again. And what do you think happens?\n","185":"Explainer: I think I agree with you, but I think to really validate our scientific experiment, we should probably compare the length of the string. A lot of extra slack in that pig of string. So what we noticed with great Britain is we were never able to measure it's length. It just kept getting longer and longer. This is called the coastline paradox where there's not really one definite number you can assign to the length of the coastline, but it depends on how you measure it. Like if we kept going to really get this to be accurate, we might have to like actually go down the beach and start measuring these tiny little details along the coastline. But really there's so much detail. We would probably never get a definite answer for how long the coastline is. Fractals also give us a really nice language. We're talking about how smooth or rough some kind of shape is. And actually a lot of people, engineers and scientists use this idea of fractals and this language of fractals to compare different shapes, not in terms of their size, but in terms of their roughness. So based on everything we talked about today, how would you describe a fractal to somebody in your own words?\nExplainee: It's a shape, that you can't describe as a shape.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","186":"Explainer: What's your name?\nExplainee: Namina.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Seeing, hearing, tasting and smelling.\nExplainer: Mm-hmm.\n","187":"Explainer: Mm-hmm.\nExplainee: Yeah, and touch.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: No, I don't think so. No? Okay.\nExplainer: Can you bounce it for me?\n","188":"Explainer: But with the magnifying glass, you'd only be able to see what's right near the surface, right? Just.\nExplainee: Yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Yeah, yeah, it would be cool if we like used something like an x-ray, we build an x-ray\nExplainer: Yeah.\n","189":"Explainer: That's exactly the type of thing that we're doing. We are sensing, is we're trying to measure what's inside, and do it without destroying the ball.\nExplainee: Yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","190":"Explainer: Yeah, I started out doing magnetic resonance, studying things like bone and biomedical magnetic resonance. Ended up playing with spins for a long time and the physics of spins just fascinated me.\nExplainee: So what do you think is a big difference between imaging large biological objects versus sensing very small quantum objects, I guess?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: How is the resolution higher?\nExplainer: So it's because the nitrogen-vacancy center is a single defect. So you can actually see a single electron. In normal magnetic resonance, you don't have the sensitivity.\n","191":"Explainer: So it's because the nitrogen-vacancy center is a single defect. So you can actually see a single electron. In normal magnetic resonance, you don't have the sensitivity.\nExplainee: In order to be sensitive to like a single electron, do you have to be really close to it?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Okay, I see.\nExplainer: Yeah. And that's why you're able to do it at room temperature as well.\n","192":"Explainer: [Sekhar] Yeah.\nExplainee: And those are very sensitive to fluctuations. Yeah. I guess any fluctuations can kick your quantum system either out of the state that it's in to another state.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Oh, yeah.\nExplainer: And that was a source of noise, like, it's completely random, but it is still there. And then the other form is very much what is intrinsically within your experiment itself because some of the materials that you have have defects that are coupling into your sensor, into your quantum system and are also producing noise.\n","193":"Explainer: Yeah.\nExplainee: And that I think is gonna make real breakthroughs in the next 10 years, is the fact that we're just having this much larger group of scientists.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","194":"Explainer: so steve tell me about your research and the work you've been doing in quantum computing\nExplainee: I'm a theoretical physicist. I started out in condensed matter theory, the theory that studies superconductors and magnets and I had to learn a new field of quantum optics and apply those ideas. One of the nice things about being a theorist Is you get to keep learning new things.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: My main focus right now is quantum error correction and trying to understand this concept of fault tolerance which everybody thinks they know it when they see it but nobody in the quantum case can precisely define it.\nExplainer: common myth how many qubits do you have that's the only thing that matters like just add more qubits what's the big deal pattern them on your chip\n","195":"Explainer: exactly so i think something that frustrates a lot of people about quantum computing is the concept of decoherence right you can only keep your information quantum for so long right and that limits how many operations you can do in a row before you lose your information\nExplainee: The great power of a quantum computer is also it's Achilles's heel. That it's very very sensitive to perturbations and noise and environmental effects. You're just multiplying your problems if all your doing is adding qubits.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: That's the challenge I would say. As much progress as we've made it's a frustration to still be facing it.\nExplainer: another common myth in the next five years quantum computing will solve climate change cancer [Laughter]\n","196":"Explainer: What happens in Minecraft if you get really, really close to a shape?\nExplainee: Well, it just looks like a block.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Recursion is a function that uses itself or calls itself in it's definition. And basically with that, you can figure out minute details such as searching for a value in a binary tree. It's kind of like iterating through itself, but it's often more sophisticated in that it's easier to write.\nExplainer: They're easy for a computer to execute, right? It just has to run this recursive procedure over and over and over again. We can kind of get as much detail as we want or need. When I think about fractals and kind of what they've done for computer graphics. The example I think is subdivision surfaces. Did you, did you encounter subdivision surfaces in your graphics class at all?\n","197":"Explainer: Yeah it looks really blocky. And it's the same thing not only with shapes and games, but also colors and textures. And this is an especially a big problem in virtual reality because you have no control over where people are gonna go. What they're gonna look at, how close they're gonna get to various objects. So fractals on the other hand are these things that have infinitely, you know, nice details you get closer and closer and closer. And so this is something that can help us solve this problem in computer graphics of generating more detail. One of the reasons why fractals are really nice for computer graphics is because the algorithms that we use to draw images also have this kind of recursive flavor. What's recursion?\nExplainee: Recursion is a function that uses itself or calls itself in it's definition. And basically with that, you can figure out minute details such as searching for a value in a binary tree. It's kind of like iterating through itself, but it's often more sophisticated in that it's easier to write.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: The name doesn't really ring a bell.\nExplainer: So subdivision surface is a way of describing a smooth shape on a computer rather than some complicated fractal shape. So meshes and computer graphics are usually made of these flat polygons with kind of sharp edges. And so the question is how can I get something nice and round and smooth out of these sharp looking polygons? What I can do is I can start cutting one at a time, the corners of this paper off, it still looks very angular. I still have these really sharp points.\n","198":"Explainer: So subdivision surface is a way of describing a smooth shape on a computer rather than some complicated fractal shape.

In fact, subdivision services were invented basically at Pixar. There's this guy, Ed Capel, and he was harshly responsible for one of the most famous kinds of subdivision surfaces called Capel Clark subdivision surfaces. And in fact recently won the touring award for these subdivision services.\n","199":"Explainer: Well, because people who really need to use these subdivision services for everything, people who worked hard over the years to make this super, super fast.

Actually, it was called ARPA at the time. They wanted to build this notion of a packet-switching network. Not a circuit switch network like a phone network where you get a dedicated path and a dedicated set of bandwidth and links from source to destination.\nExplainee: So what would packet switching enable? I'm sure there's something big here, for sure.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Sounds like the reason for like a request response type of structure.\nExplainer: So you can sort of see how the network architecture that wasn't designed to be 100% reliable inside the core of the network, and had that complexity built into the edges of the network. And to me, the really cool thing is you put this infrastructure in place, and then all these super creative people think about amazing things to build on top of it.

And so remember, this was a Department of Defense, was they wanted to have forms of of communication that were very robust, that were survivable.

So if parts of the network failed, you could route around failures.\nExplainee: Sounds like the reason for like a request response type of structure.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Abstraction, I think it's the reason why everything.\nExplainer: Ah ha! Spoken like a real computer scientist, right? You're a computer scientist. I'm a computer scientist. We talk about APIs, application programming interfaces. The API for the internet is something called a socket. And a socket simply says, I can communicate if I know your internet address, you know, 128.119.40.186, that number is the IP address of my server, the University of Massachusetts. If you know that, you can write a program anywhere in the world and send a message, and it'll pop out at my end.\n","202":"Explainer: So you can sort of see how the network architecture that wasn't designed to be 100% reliable inside the core of the network, and had that complexity built into the edges of the network.

[Jim laughs] I've heard that there are like seven keys to the internet, something like that.\nExplainer: Okay, well I don't know about the number seven, but there's something in the internet that's sort of similar to that. It's called the Domain Name System. The DNS's role is to translate names like gaia.cs.umass.edu, or ibm.com, or facebook.com to an IP address so that your application can actually send a message to that name, to that named service.\n","203":"Explainer: Where do they get dropped, do you think?\nExplainee: Somewhere in their travel process.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: I see.\nExplainer: I'm curious, has our conversation sort of changed your view or sort of taught you new things about the internet?\n","204":"Explainer: Cool. What do you think of when you hear the words quantum sensing?\nExplainee: I think that using some sort of quantum computing to sense some quantum level molecules or particles, like interactions and stuff, maybe.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Okay.\nExplainer: We believe quantum mechanics tells us what the true laws of physics are, and so a quantum sensor, in that sense, would reach the limits of what's attainable.\n","205":"Explainer: So you can implant nitrogen into a diamond and then you bombard it with electrons to create the vacancies and then you heat it up and anneal it, and then you get these nitrogen-vacancy centers in your system. So you mentioned quantum computing earlier. So have you heard of the idea of superposition?\nExplainee: Mm-hmm, yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Okay, so it's like using like, the quantum computer would be kind of like the base level and then like you take it out into the world and see how like it differs?\nExplainer: So rather than trying to build a lot of complex algorithms and gates with it, what you do is, you take these quantum bits and you take them out into the world and say, what do you see? What are you sensitive to? So you can use an idea called entanglement to make an even more sensitive quantum sensor, but it's even more fragile. So there's always this trade-off between being super fragile and being super sensitive at the same time.\n","206":"Explainer: So that's in some ways the key to both quantum sensing, as well as quantum computing. It's the idea that you can take a system and put it in a superposition of two states. Normally we think of classically a bit can be a zero or a one. So switch is either on or off. Whereas in a quantum system, it can be in what's called a superposition. So it can be partially on and partially off. But one of the challenges with quantum systems is that these superpositions are really hard to maintain because we don't see superpositions in the world around us. In quantum computing, you try really hard to isolate everything so that you can maintain this quantum property and the fact that it's actually going to lose its quantum properties as it interacts with the world also makes it a great sensor because now you're actually, you're using that fact that it's interacting with the world to say, wait, it's sensing something.\nExplainee: Okay, so it's like using like, the quantum computer would be kind of like the base level and then like you take it out into the world and see how like it differs?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: How does entanglement work into it?\nExplainer: So entanglement is the idea that two particles are correlated. They're essentially in the same quantum state, so that you can't disturb one particle without disturbing the second particle. And so, if I have a large number of quantum sensors that are entangled, then they're all going to interact much more strongly than if I just had one of them interact at a time.\n","207":"Explainer: In some ways, it is and you know, atomic clocks are remarkable devices and being able to measure time that precisely has really important consequences. In fact, our old GPS system is based on the accuracy of atomic clocks. They're a set of satellites, each of which has an atomic clock on board and they send out a timestamp and so, once it gets a signal from three different satellites, it can triangulate and figure out exactly where you are. Now, if you could make those clocks even more precise, you could actually accurately position where you are even more accurately.\nExplainee: Okay, that's really cool.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","208":"Explainer: So you're a student in high school, is that right?\nExplainee: Yes, I'm a sophomore.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: How does like all of the networks in my house connect to all the city networks?\nExplainer: Wow. Great question. Often, it's a little blue wire called an ethernet cable. So that cable is able to bring bits of information up into your apartment at say, a billion bits per second. That's pretty fast, right? Literally a wire that goes between a box in your apartment, sometimes called a router or a modem in your apartment that comes from an internet service provider come into this first network and then that network connects to another network connects to another network connects to another network.\n","209":"Explainer: Well, we're gonna be talking about computers here today, and we're gonna be talking about the internet. I always like to think of the internet by analogy to say road systems for example, where you have roads in your neighborhood. You have state roads, you have the Interstate Highway System. And so the internet is a lot like that. It's an interconnection of local roads, local networks like the network in your house for example.\nExplainee: How does like all of the networks in my house connect to all the city networks?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: You could FaceTime somebody who's like in Australia.

It's not just one big, super highway. It's a lot of smaller super highways that are all interconnected. And those interchanges are what are called routers. That's where the links come together. You're talking about talking to a friend in Australia.

Server is really just a big computer with a lot of memory, a lot of discs that store all the Netflix movies, and also so that you don't have to cross over too many internet links to get from where the server is to the TV or the device in your home.\nExplainee: So when I'm watching Vampire Diaries in my house, how does it know exactly what to do without getting scrambled up?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","213":"Explainer: Calculus involves the study of functions. Functions are one of the most fundamental concepts in mathematics, but they aren't always so clearly defined. What would you say a function is?\nExplainee: I would say a function is a procedure that takes an input and does some operation and returns an output.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: How can you compare something that is endless?\nExplainer: Today we're gonna think about infinity as a cardinality, which is a technical term for a number that could be a size of a set. And we're gonna use this idea of one-to-one correspondence to try and investigate the question of whether all infinite sets have the same size. So what I've drawn here are some pictures of some of the infinite sets that appear in mathematics. So the natural numbers are the prototypical example of an infinite set. So the natural numbers are clearly a subset of the integers. Both of these are infinite sets. Are they the same size infinity or different size infinities?\n","214":"Explainer: I'm gonna now try and convince you that they are in fact the same size infinity. And this is using this idea of a one-to-one correspondence which was applied in this context by Georg Cantor. What he says is if we can match up the elements of the integers with the elements of the natural numbers so that there's nothing left over, so that there's a bijective function between them, then that's a proof that there's exactly as many natural numbers as there are integers. Start by matching zero with zero and one with one. But then we wanna include the negatives in the list. So which natural number would we match with negative one?\nExplainee: Maybe two.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: All of the positive integers would be odd numbers and all of the negative integers would be even numbers?\nExplainer: Great. So now I have a much harder question. So we have the same challenge, again, evidently there are way, way, way more rational numbers than there are integers. Does that mean this is a larger infinite set than the integers? What do you think?\n","215":"Explainer: Maybe two. Why not? Because now we're starting to make progress on matching all the negatives. We can match the natural number three with the integer two, the natural number four with the integer minus two. And do you see a pattern?\nExplainee: All of the positive integers would be odd numbers and all of the negative integers would be even numbers?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: By intuition I would say yes, but that was the same case with the integers. I would imagine there might be some bijective function for mapping natural numbers to rational numbers.\nExplainer: So I'm going to use this picture to count the rational numbers by actually counting the elements of this larger set because it'll be clearer geometrically. What I've drawn in this picture is the integer lattice. So Z cross Z refers to the set of all of these dots. So I'll start by counting the number at the origin, and you can see I'm just labeling the dots around the origin, moving in a counterclockwise fashion and getting progressively further away. And this process could continue, but maybe by now you see the pattern, though it'd be a little bit difficult to describe as a function.\n","216":"Explainer: Yeah, that's exactly right. And now for each pair of integers, I'm gonna represent it by a corresponding natural number. That's what's going on with this counting. And when I compose those operations, what I've done is I've encoded rational numbers as natural numbers in a way that reveals that they can be no larger, there are no more rational numbers than natural numbers.\nExplainee: So this slope is represented by three, two, and three, two is in here as 25.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: That's wild.\nExplainer: Now there's one final collection of numbers that we haven't yet discussed, which are the real numbers, all of the points on the number line. Do you think that's the same size infinity?\n","217":"Explainer: So we've started to explore some of the counterintuitive properties of infinity. On the one hand there are infinite sets that feel very different like the natural numbers, the integers, the rational numbers that nevertheless have the same size or the same infinite cardinality. While there are other infinities that are larger. So there's more than one size of infinity, not all infinities are created equal.\nExplainee: I was wondering what the kind of practical implications are, what you can do with this sort of knowledge.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","218":"Explainer: is it some sort of conjecture circuit that is a really good guess there's parts of that that are definitely about conducting this is the inside of a quantum computer\nExplainee: Oh wow.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Oh wow. So when you say colder, you mean like physically colder?\nExplainer: yeah like physically colder so room temperature is 300 kelvin as you get down all the way to the bottom of the fridge it's at 10 milli kelvin\n","219":"Explainer: so that's pretty good so you mentioned superposition but you can also use other quantum properties like entanglement have you heard of entanglement\nExplainee: I have not.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Oh okay.\nExplainer: okay so how do noise-canceling headphones work \n","220":"Explainer: so you can have constructive interference and you can have destructive interference we have constructive interference you have amplitudes wave amplitudes that add until the signal gets larger and if you have destructive interference the amplitudes cancel by using a property like interference we can control quantum states and amplify the kinds of signals that are towards the right answer and then cancel the types of signals that are leading to the wrong answer so given that you know that we're trying to use superposition entanglement and interference for computation how do you think we build these computers\nExplainee: They read like ambient wavelengths and then produce like the opposite one to cancel out.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: I have no idea.\nExplainer: it's a perfect question i mean it's very early for quantum computing but we're building assembly languages we're building layers of abstraction that are going to get you to a point as a programmer where you can interchangeably be programming something the way that you already do and then make calls to a quantum computer so that you can bring it in when it makes sense we're not envisioning quantum computers completely replacing classical computers anytime soon we think that quantum computing is going to be used to accelerate the kinds of things that are really hard for for classical machines\n","221":"Explainer: so step one is you need to be able to have an object or physical device we call it a qubit or quantum bit that can actually handle those things can actually be put into superpositions of states you know two cubit states that you can physically entangle with each other that's not really trivial right and things in our classical world you can't really entangle things in our classical world so easily we need to use devices where they can they can support a quantum state and we can manipulate that quantum state atoms ions and in our case superconducting qubits we make qubits out of superconducting materials\nExplainee: I have no idea.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: But as like a programmer, how would quantum computing affect a different way of writing a program?\nExplainer: simulating nature is something that's really hard because if you take something like you know modeling atomic bonding and electronic orbital overlap instead of now writing out a giant summation over many terms you try and actually mimic the system you're trying to simulate directly on a quantum computer which we can do for chemistry and uh we're looking at ways of doing that for other types of things there's a lot of exciting research right now on machine learning trying to use quantum systems to accelerate machine learning problems\n","222":"Explainer: it's a perfect question i mean it's very early for quantum computing but we're building assembly languages we're building layers of abstraction that are going to get you to a point as a programmer where you can interchangeably be programming something the way that you already do and then make calls to a quantum computer so that you can bring it in when it makes sense we're not envisioning quantum computers completely replacing classical computers anytime soon we think that quantum computing is going to be used to accelerate the kinds of things that are really hard for for classical machines\nExplainee: But as like a programmer, how would quantum computing affect a different way of writing a program?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: So what exactly are some of those problems?\nExplainer: couldn't have said it better myself\n","223":"Explainer: Here, let me show you something. I can ask how heavy it is.\nExplainee: It's not weight, but it's how much of it is in it.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Yeah.\nExplainer: If a star is heavy enough to explode into supernova what's left begins to collapse under its own weight. And if that's heavy enough, the core will not be able to stop collapsing, 'cause it no longer has the thermonuclear fuel, it's run outta fuel. And if it's run outta fuel, it's no longer shining and pushing outward. And without that it itself begins to go dark and there's nothing fighting the collapse anymore. And that's when you form a black hole.\n","224":"Explainer: If a star is heavy enough to explode into supernova what's left begins to collapse under its own weight.

Any light that veers too close will fall in, will not be able to make it back out again. If a light is shining from the sun near a black hole, the black hole's not touching it. Why does the light get pulled in? Why does that happen?\n","225":"Explainer: Well, that's a really good question. So interestingly, the sun itself isn't heavy enough. So it has to be heavy enough that when it begins to collapse, it just overcomes all attempts to fight it. If you made something really dense, you would have to travel faster than the speed of light to actually escape. That's 300,000 kilometers per second.\nExplainee: So if like the sun all collapsed on itself, it would form a black hole?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: So it goes so fast that there's it's all dark?\nExplainer: It is taking other stuff, but the funny question was like, if I wanted to move your chair, you'd think it was really strange if I didn't have to come near you and actually grab the chair and move it. One of the things Einstein thought about is he imagined that what the black hole is doing is it's changing the shape of space around it. What do you think of that idea?\n","226":"Explainer: So it goes so fast that it goes completely dark. Any light that veers too close will fall in, will not be able to make it back out again.

And then Einstein goes a step further and thinks, well, what black holes must be doing is curving the space so strongly that even light gets caught. Sometimes you can get light caught into a whole orbit, literally the light going round and round in an orbit.\n","227":"Explainer: Does infinity come up in your mathematics that you're studying?\nExplainee: One place infinity comes up is in algebraic geometry. Normally we think okay, well if you have two lines like this, you'd keep drawing them, they intersect right here. But in projective space, two parallel lines will also intersect at the point at infinity. Infinity is like this perfect concept for what we can add to a space that allows lines to have this more uniform property. What's your research in?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Yeah, it's basically this idea that you can put a choice function on any set.\nExplainer: And a choice function does what exactly?\n","228":"Explainer: That you don't want the complexity of managing them to go up linearly with that. You'd like it to still stay pretty flat as you start adding.\nExplainee: Right, exactly. I mean, the good thing about IoT devices is that they tend to transmit very, very small amounts of data.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: No, I mean I would imagine upper bound, KB per second, lower bound, you could see bytes per second just on average. But I mean, say that you have a temperature sensor running off of your Arduino that's reporting the temperature in your house every minute. That's going to be far less than kilobytes per second on average.\nExplainer: My sense is you're spot on, that they'll produce over time, a lot of data. And that a lot of IoT is about computing on that data. That computation happened mostly at the edge, or somehow a combination between the edge and something happening in a far away data center.\n","229":"Explainer: We're used to ethernet cables that can handle many hundreds of gigabits per second over a wired device.

Something I'm interested in with my research is collaborating with people who manage these distributed sensor devices, and then taking advantage of those datasets and comparing them to, say you were interested in doing a research project on how daily rush hour traffic impacts the acoustic landscape of New York City. Figuring out, look, this street next to this school is causing visible ratings above what we mandate. And so there needs to be an intervention here.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Definitely. I mean, we're already seeing long range networks like LoRa that can, first of all, provide access over a much larger coverage area, but then also look the same because they're set up to the same specification, regardless of where the individual gateway is.\n","231":"Explainer: Yeah.

So I'm measuring star formation histories in the Small and Large Magellanic Clouds.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: So, I think the prevailing wisdom for a while was no, but my answer honestly is I'm not sure.\nExplainer: Yeah, I think it's a really good question. The only mechanism that we know for sure can form black holes is to collapse of very massive stars. So it's sensible to think, well maybe some very massive stars in a young universe collapsed under their own weight and then they merged and after some time they got big enough, but the black holes from stars can be tens of times the mass of the sun, maybe hundreds of times to the mass of the sun if they merge. To get to millions and billions, and if you just do the simple arithmetic of how many years that would take, there aren't enough years in the 14 billion years of the universe's lifetime. So they must have come from somewhere else.\n","235":"Explainer: Yeah, and probably nobody is. Have you heard a lot in your studies about these super massive black holes that we think lurk in the centers of very nearly every galaxy?\nExplainee: So, I think the prevailing wisdom for a while was no, but my answer honestly is I'm not sure.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: So I don't study AGN a lot, but I do have a long term interest in black holes, it's one of the reasons I entered the field. I always was curious about how a black hole of that size was able to form. Was it the result of mergers between smaller black holes, ultimately creating gravitational well deep enough to contract a protogenic disc for a whole galaxy? Or, man, what happened?\nExplainer: Yeah, I think that's right. I think people are really perplexed about how you make something so big in such a short period of time. It's kind of funny, the bigger you make a black hole, it seems maybe counterintuitive, but the less dense the material has to be out of which you make it. So you can, out of something the density almost of air, you can make a supermassive black hole. You can't make a star out of that, but weirdly, if you skip the star phase altogether, it's conceivable that they directly collapse. And so there's suddenly a new way to make black holes that nature has figured out.\n","236":"Explainer: [Janna] Yeah.\nExplainee: We spend all of our time, when we learn about black holes in school, predominantly through star collapse.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: I didn't even realize that there was an alternate route to creating a black hole.\nExplainer: Can you tell us about Andromeda?\n","237":"Explainer: But when we do merge with Andromeda, presumably our black holes will merge and Andromeda indeed has a very big black hole as well at its center. And then we'll have this just gigantic-\nExplainee: And Andromeda is one of the few galaxies that is traveling towards us and do for a merger event at some point. So given a sufficiently low velocity, we would just have two big galaxies that, for the most part, pass through each other, pass by each other. But given a sufficiently high velocity, we will have some crazy black hole interactions and some crazy star interactions.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Supermassive black hole.\nExplainer: We work a lot right now on thinking of black holes as batteries. So a black hole that can take, like a giant magnet, astronomical magnet in the form of another collapsed star, like a neutron star, and flip it around so fast, near the speed of light, that it actually creates an electronic circuit out of this moving magnet. And so that the power that can come out of these electronic circuits created by these batteries can be tremendous.\n","238":"Explainer: It's a great question. I once did a calculation of using a black hole made out of the moon and the strongest magnet we could find on Earth to see if I could make an electronic battery. And honestly, you only get about enough energy to power New York City. But we have to find one in our neighborhood first.\nExplainee: You know, I know that at a certain point for our civilization to become sufficiently advanced, to travel the cosmos beyond, you know, the moon or Mars, we may have to be able to harness the power of our sun. Would it be similarly possible to harness the power of a black hole like you were mentioning, to travel?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Yeah, wouldn't be my favorite thing.\nExplainee: Oh, I think our discussion kind of exposed a piece of black holes that I don't think of often, which is that they're not just life takers, they're life givers. And they inform a lot about, not just how a galaxy is destroyed or made, but how it's shaped and how it eventually, you know, builds life like ours. So maybe I have to give black holes a little bit more props.\n","239":"Explainer: i have colleagues here that tell me it can take up to weeks to train certain neural networks right\nExplainee: Certainly, depending on the complexity of your model then computational speed is one thing.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Sure, yeah.\nExplainer: if you think about even just classical information like bits right at the end of the day when you store a bit in your hard drive there's a magnetic domain and you have a magnetic polarization right\n","240":"Explainer: and actually machine learning is one research direction where we're really hoping that we're going to find um key parts of the machine learning computation that can be sped up using quantum computing\nExplainee: Sure, yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: So in a classical computer, you know, you have all sorts of logical gates that perform operations and they change an input to some sort of output but I guess it's not immediately obvious how you do that with quantum computers.\nExplainer: you can change the magnetization to be pointing up or pointing down right quantum systems we're still manipulating a device and changing the quantum state of that of that device you can imagine if it's a spin that you could have spin up and spin down but you can also if you isolate it enough you can have a superposition of up and down\n","241":"Explainer: you can change the magnetization to be pointing up or pointing down right quantum systems we're still manipulating a device and changing the quantum state of that of that device you can imagine if it's a spin that you could have spin up and spin down but you can also if you isolate it enough you can have a superposition of up and down\nExplainee: Sure.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Sure.\nExplainer: yeah that's a really good question this actually is a model of the inside of one of our quantum computers\n","242":"Explainer: yeah that's a really good question this actually is a model of the inside of one of our quantum computers\nExplainee: So how do we actually encode it to start with?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Okay.\nExplainer: yes exactly also through microwave signals\n","243":"Explainer: the key is to come up with algorithms where the result is deterministic\nExplainee: Okay.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Interesting, so what do those algorithms look like?\nExplainer: yeah they also unfortunately require fault tolerance right now the algorithms that we know of today to do those things um on a quantum computer require you to have millions of error-corrected qubits today we're at like 50. it's actually amazing that we're at 50. there's things that we know or we have strong reason to believe um are going to be faster to do on a quantum computer and then there's things that we'll discover just by virtue of having one\n","244":"Explainer: there's sort of two main classes of quantum algorithms there's algorithms which were developed for decades right things like shore's algorithm which is for factoring grover's algorithm for unstructured search and these algorithms were designed assuming that you had a perfect fault tolerant quantum computer which is many decades away so we're currently in a phase where we're exploring what can we do with these near-term quantum computers and the answer is going to be well we need different kinds of algorithms to really even explore that question\nExplainee: Interesting, so what do those algorithms look like?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Yeah certainly having a search algorithm is very useful. Factoring, those are definitely useful things that I would imagine could be done a lot faster on a quantum computer.\nExplainer: i'm glad you're interested i think the place where lots of people can get involved right now is by going and trying it out and thinking about what they could do with it there's a lot of opportunity to find these near-term applications that are only going to be found by trying things out\n","245":"Explainer: What are some of the challenges that you've run into when trying to work with robots and do these tasks?\nExplainee: So, I was really interested in the problem of scooping peas on a plate.

And increasingly, certificate authorities that help bootstrap the secure, encrypted and communication between end hosts. So there are a few of these sort of centrally, kind of agreed upon kinds of infrastructure, but for the most part, each network runs itself.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Not really because each country really can have it's own laws and its own norms. And so they can decide, like the Great Firewall of China can decide, they don't wanna let certain content be accessed by the citizens inside that country. So if a country decides they don't wanna answer a request for a particular domain name, they say, Hey, I don't want to let someone know the IP address of this website. They can decide not to let those answers be delivered inside their country. And so encryption plays a role in helping people keep their privacy or prevent surveillance, but it's not perfect. It's often possible, still, to know a fair amount about what people are doing, even if you can't look inside the envelope at the letter that's written.\nExplainer: I mean, even you could just tell that two people are communicating even though the traffic itself is encrypted.

It's both the high bandwidth, it's the low delay so that you can have these applications that interact with the physical world and need answers in real-time. It's about having the compute really close so that you can integrate computation and communication. It's about having more coverage.\nExplainer: Coming back again to the softwarization. SDN and softwarization is a maybe a little bit behind the covers, that you wouldn't normally see it as a user going from 3G to 4G to 5G. You just see an increase in speed. But yet, the way the network is now being managed again, I think is bringing the cellular networking world sort of into the internet world in terms of the softwarization-\n","254":"Explainer: You know, we've had cellular networks now for 20, 30 years.

It's both the high bandwidth, it's the low delay so that you can have these applications that interact with the physical world and need answers in real-time. It's about having the compute really close so that you can integrate computation and communication. It's about having more coverage.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Completely agree. I think the bringing in of compute and storage is important too. I think when you think just about networking, it really is often just one part of the IT, the information technology ecosystem. Is there's often compute and storage as well. And so, I think now there's an opportunity to have all of those parts of the infrastructure work together towards an even higher level goal. And so I think it's a really exciting time to be in the field 'cause now, the plumbing is getting close to the application in a way that it wasn't before.\n","255":"Explainer: What is your impression of what a black hole is?\nExplainee: I'm a senior at NYU. I'm studying physics and environmental studies.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: So it's a star that has collapsed. It has so much concentrated mass and gravity that there's a point outside of the black hole called the event horizon. So once you get past the event horizon, nothing, not even light can escape from that.\nExplainer: It turns out that there are only three quantities that define a black hole, its electric charge, its mass, and its spin. So the most general black hole can also spin and it can also be electrically charged. Whether or not they are has to do with how they formed. If a star collapses, it will likely be spinning when it collapses and the remnant black hole that formsbwill likely be spinning. A black hole of a certain mass, charge, and spin is indistinguishable from any other black hole with those same properties. So in some sense, they're like fundamental particles, which makes them absolutely exceptional for any other astrophysical object. Have you heard the stories about what happens inside a black hole?\n","256":"Explainer: So that's a great definition and I wanna pick that apart a little bit. So what you described is just right. Stars, when they run out of thermonuclear fuel are gonna collapse under their own weight. It'll explode in a supernova, it'll leave a core, and if the core itself is heavy enough, it will keep collapsing. It does, as you say, reach this point where not even light can escape. But the amazing thing is it leaves that point, you called it rightly the event horizon, it leaves it behind kind of like an archeological record because the start itself can no more sit at the event horizon than it can race outward at the speed of light. So the core of the star keeps collapsing and where it goes nobody knows. So in a weird way, the black hole isn't anymore a crush of matter. It left it behind in its wake, but the stuff of the star is gone.\nExplainee: So it's a star that has collapsed. It has so much concentrated mass and gravity that there's a point outside of the black hole called the event horizon. So once you get past the event horizon, nothing, not even light can escape from that.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: I've heard of Schwarzschild black holes, which is a black hole that is static, a Kerr black hole or a Kerr-Newman black hole, which is a black hole that rotates, but what makes a black hole static versus rotating? And what's more common?\nExplainer: So from the outside, if you're an astronaut, you're watching your friend, another astronaut going into the black hole, it's as though your times become rotated relative to each other. So the profound thing is as an astronaut on the outside, looking at this round event horizon, you think of the center of black hole as a point in space, but to the person who's fallen in, it's not a point in space at all, it's a point in time. The singularity, or the end of it all, the crush in the center of a black hole is in their future. So they can no more avoid the singularity than you can avoid the next instant of time coming. So the death in the singularity is inevitable. Although we don't really think the singularity necessarily exists.\n","257":"Explainer: It turns out that there are only three quantities that define a black hole, its electric charge, its mass, and its spin. So the most general black hole can also spin and it can also be electrically charged. Whether or not they are has to do with how they formed.

And what's more common?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: I remember that once you pass the event horizon space becomes time and time becomes space, in like, a coordinate sense.\nExplainer: So the singularity is definitely predicted in Einstein's general theory of relativity and that's purely a theory of spacetime. And in the theory of spacetime, there is no question that a singularity would form when the star collapses catastrophically inside the black hole. Now, even when people talked about singularities back in the '60s, they thought, you know, quantum mechanics is part of the story of the whole of physics. It's not just gravity. And if we understand quantum gravity we'll realize that singularity probably doesn't ever actually form.\n","258":"Explainer: I would say to some extent we don't know for sure. What we have found is that the mathematics is so unbelievably powerful that we're able to disprove wrong ideas just in pen and paper. Just very recently, within the past couple of years, the first ever human-procured image of a black hole showed us what we expected to see of the event horizon. So Jayda, after our conversation today, what would you say a black hole is?\nExplainee: So since we obviously have never been to a black hole, how do we know for sure, like, what happens after you cross the event horizon or what happens inside a black hole? Is it just like, inferred from the math?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Something that I had never thought of before is a black hole as kind of a type of quantum fundamental particle. I've also learned how event horizon of a black hole kind of hides a singularity.\nExplainee: Awesome!\n","259":"Explainer: Talk us through Hawking's initial revolution that led to a lot of these conversations about the information around black holes.\nExplainee: Hawking's big insight was that he had to apply both the rules of quantum mechanics and the rules of gravity to really understand how black holes behaved. But Hawking took a point of view where he brought quantum mechanics into the game. He really that if you took that into account, that it's actually not quite true that black holes are black, that actually things can escape from black holes.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: A way to think about Hawking radiation is to imagine that pairs of particles and antiparticles appear out of the quantum vacuum and the particle can escape the black hole, but the antiparticle falls in. But the particle and antiparticle are a pair and if the antiparticle really falls into the black hole and is destroyed at the singularity, that poor particle outside the black hole has lost his partner. It also violates the rules of quantum mechanics. If you have two particles that are entangled, that has to be preserved.\nExplainer: Now, to be clear, nobody disputes that black holes will quantum radiate, that Hawking radiation is a solid prediction. The black holes should in fact evaporate, that's not disputed, right?\n","260":"Explainer: There's this domain of black holes in astrophysics where we see stars collapse, and we know that they exist and there's whole observational astronomy around them. And then there's this domain that we're talking about, where, as you said, black holes are so special because they're kind of guiding us in the right direction to understand the very nature of reality. And that makes them really unusually special. And one of the things I wanted to draw out is that we talk about the fundamental forces of nature. So there's the matter forces, and then the outlier is gravity. We've quantized all the matter forces in a way that we're rather comfortable with. Gravity keeps resisting quantization of gravity itself. And now we're thinking in a way that you're describing that, well, maybe it's only the quantum forces altogether.\nExplainee: The pursuit of quantum gravity has taken us to places we never expected to be. I think what's exciting about physics, about theoretical physics, that you start following a thread, you start developing a chain of logic, and you never know where it's gonna end up.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: It's a real challenge, but astronomical observations have gotten so fantastically precise. And there is some hope that if you looked at things like two black holes merging, each black hole comes in with its own event horizon, but then when the black holes merge, there's a very complicated process where these two event horizons merge and oscillate and vibrate, and then settle down into a single event horizon for the final black hole. There is some hope that if we can make sufficiently detailed observations of this process, if we could really see the way the event horizon is behaving as it settles down to this final state, that maybe that could reveal some of these quantum effects that we've been talking about.\nExplainer: It is amazing in the numerical simulations of two black holes merging, you really see the event horizons bobble around. And we were talking earlier about how really black holes are flawless, they don't tolerate those kinds of imperfections. And so you can so quickly watch the system wring away that misshapen merger. And it comes out in the gravitational waves, which is literally the ripples in the shape of spacetime until it settles down, and then it's utterly flawless again. It really happens fast. It's quite amazing.\n","261":"Explainer: Do you think there's ever a hope that the kind of information that you think about, the quantum gravity aspects of the universe that you think about, whether it will pan out or not, will ever be viably observed in these astronomical pursuits of the event horizon?\nExplainee: It's a real challenge, but astronomical observations have gotten so fantastically precise.

To my mind your work has really revolutionized the field of cognitive neuroscience more broadly.\nExplainee: I've been really interested in how past understandings of the brain have really focused on, on pinpointing exactly what each piece of the brain does. But I think that there's also a broader conversation happening in the brain, which is between one region and another. So it's actually the pattern of connections between these regions that would allow for the flow of information. But I think the tools that have become widely available now from the physics community and mathematics and computer science are under the umbrella of, of network science. So that is a science of networks, a science of understanding how bits of a system are interconnected with one another. Not just comparing two groups of people or two kinds of two species, but we can ask even within a single person, how does the pattern of connectivity in my brain change as we talk with one another? How does the information flow change? I think a lot about traffic on roadway networks as a good example of this. Which is, you know, we can understand where the roads are and perhaps the roads are relatively fixed. They change over long timescales and it's similar to the brain. We really only create large scale connections over long timescales. But we can alter the traffic on the roadways really easily. And that's similar to what we do in the brain is that we change the way that information is flowing to allow us to respond to our environment.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: The field is definitely opening up in the kinds of questions that can be asked now with these approaches. And I think what you're pointing out is that conceptually it's where we wanted to go anyway. So if there's so much orchestration that happens and a symphony is not a single piece, it's not a single pattern of, of harmony between instruments and, and similar to the brain, symphony of your brain is not a single pattern. It's a very dynamically changing pattern.\nExplainer: In the field we often talk of have having a mental model that we use to make predictions about what's about to happen and really use that to mean kind of a general understanding of what's going on. What does that look like in terms that come from your world of like the configuration of, of a circuit?\n","269":"Explainer: It's a great analogy. You know I remember when I first learned of your work, for me as somebody who studies learning and memory, which are processes that are all about rapid updating that to me was really mind blowing that we can now start asking questions about dynamics of circuits on a timescale that's much closer to the timescale of human thought than anything we had before.\nExplainee: The field is definitely opening up in the kinds of questions that can be asked now with these approaches. And I think what you're pointing out is that conceptually it's where we wanted to go anyway. So if there's so much orchestration that happens and a symphony is not a single piece, it's not a single pattern of, of harmony between instruments and, and similar to the brain, symphony of your brain is not a single pattern. It's a very dynamically changing pattern.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: I think this is the most exciting area of memory research right now I think, which is how people build and remember, you know, and keep with them models of the world over long periods of time. When I think about a mental model, I think about ideas, potential outcomes, potential events, potential actions, and how they all depend on one another. So when we predict what will happen next it would be, I am currently sitting at this piece of the network and I know that there are, there are these possible outcomes. And so I have to get ready for those, you know, four possible outcomes. But that brings this interesting question to the fore, I think which is how does a network system in our mind and our brain create a network model of the world outside? It's almost like there's a reflection in the structure of what's inside in the hardware and what we're building in a very abstract way. And I think that relates to some interesting work that's coming out about the hippocampus too.\nExplainer: We now think of the hippocampus so much in terms of memory but really some of the earliest work in neuroscience on the hippocampus talked about the role of the hippocampus in spatial navigation. And it really exposed I think one of the deepest questions in memory research, or at least from the neuroscience perspective is like, well what is the connection? What is the connection between spatial processing and memory? And why is it that neurons in the hippocampus when an animal is navigating a maze, why is it that there's spatial specialization there? I really do think that this notion of a mental model, a generative model is where those, where memory and space meet.\n","270":"Explainer: Memories as models or models first and memory as part of what helps build the model starts generating new predictions. Exactly the kind you just brought up or other ways of thinking about things because an efficient model needs to let go of information, right? I just heard a colleague of mine joking about the fact that the principles of neuroscience textbook keeps growing and growing. And that if we had enough strength in theoretical neuroscience, if our models of neuroscience were good enough, that book should shrink back. We know that memory retrieval is essentially construction. And so you don't need to store all those separate memories. You need to construct them. But if you have a good model, let go of all those details and just construct them to feel as if it's a memory. But really all you're doing is using the model to fill the details. It's kind of like the matrix, you know.\nExplainee: Right.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: I think it's information certainly that, that is stored in the brain and that can then affect our behavior. I think getting your behavior in there somewhere seems, seems important. But also is it just a record of the past or is it, you know, our perceptions of, of what happened in the past, or how we've changed how we think about that past event or have we deleted that event completely and then gathered this higher level structure or mental model that then allows us to behave differently in the future? So it's more alive, it's more changing. It's more, I think it's bubbling out and gathering, gathering and growing and becoming more flexible, but it's also sort of bubbling in, in the sense of deleting and removing and forgetting. So yes, I think that what we need to add perhaps is that changeability and perhaps the behavioral relevance of that changeability. I don't know, what do you think?\nExplainer: I agree. I think, you know, as you were speaking I was thinking maybe the most important word to replace there is record. Record implies an etching of something as it was. And maybe what we need instead is that it's a model, it's an approximation, it's an abstraction that can help us create the illusion of constructing your record. But that it's the model that's the important thing that drives the whole thing.\n","271":"Explainer: Have you heard about black holes?\nExplainee: Yes, I know it has a lot of mass, but it's very small. I know that there are several theories about the universe due to black holes, like, around the universe and how it's made.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: A little bit?\nExplainer: Okay, you wanna do the demo for me? So the LIGO instrument electronically records the ringing of the shape of space with its very complicated instrument. It stands for Laser Interferometric Gravitational-Waves Observatory and the design was incredibly difficult and they didn't know if they would succeed. I think of the instrument as like the body of the electric guitar. And then they take the readout of the motions of the waves that they're recording, just like that guitar is recording the motions of the waves on the string. Now just play it like a little bit. And you can't hear anything, right? You're not meant to hear an electric guitar when it's not plugged in. What's happening is the guitar strings are ringing, but so quietly that we can't actually hear the sound. And this is like the gravitational waves, which are ringing the drum of spacetime, but so quietly that they're not move the air and we're not hearing them. So now play and I'm gonna turn the volume up a little bit. While I can't actually hear the ringing of the strings themselves, I can hear the data of the shape of the string recorded and played through this amplifier. And that's kind of the idea behind the LIGO instrument.\n","272":"Explainer: Okay, you wanna do the demo for me?

Only this instrument, and that's why it was so hard to build. And by the time it gets here, it's so weak that it's only squeezing and stretching space at like the fraction of a nucleus over very large distances. Has your understanding of black holes changed over the course of our conversation?\n","273":"Explainer: Why do you think it's so hard to build these things into AI systems and robots?\nExplainee: I guess if you think about a quintessentially human task, like playing chess or solving arithmetic problem, things that other creatures just don't do, when you're a human being, you have to learn that in cultural time. And so there's a limited amount of data you have. But if you're talking about seeing the world interacting with the world, using your effectors properly, that's the combination of this massive amount of evolutionary time. When you look at that, it's like the 56 games of chess I played in chess club that doesn't look like a lot of training data. You work so hard to make a robot, do one particular thing or one class of task, and then seems like people must always come up to you and say, 'So, okay, but what about my other task? Okay. You can fold the sock or stack a cup. How about my dishes?' Is that frustrating? Is that a challenge? Is it interesting?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: When we think about babies on their social cognition, we actually start from the idea that they have a notion of what an agent is. An agent is something that's self-propelled, that has its own internal states, like goals and beliefs. And so, it's very natural to imagine that when you see a seemingly, they call it propulsive, action by a robot, you're thinking, 'Hey, this thing has a desire. It has a goal. It's accomplishing it with its. So what if I give it a different goal? Why couldn't it do that?' They call it promiscuous generalization about agents, right? I think that the electrical outlet looks like a face. I think that my computer's mad at me. And so I think it, the challenge actually is to stop people from doing that, and to recognize limitations where there are some. Or we bring to bear our knowledge, sometimes incredibly quickly, to parse an uncertain image. So our experiences go all the way down to our very first impressions of the sensory signal.\nExplainer: I like that description, because it conveys how much complexity there is to these really basic tasks that we're doing. Is there a definition for the simple tasks that we do versus things that are more complex, like playing chess?\n","274":"Explainer: So what are you studying these days?\nExplainee: Well, I'm preparing my dissertation. The general topic is going to be how we perceive different types of social stimuli, like different people's faces and make judgements about them and how the way that we report on what we are experiencing tells us about what's actually going on inside our heads.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Oh of course.\nExplainer: Right, like it reminds me so much of, you know, what we in the field would refer to as statistical learning. On one hand we might have like a one-shot memory, a memory of something that we saw yesterday, like what we did or what we ate or where we were. But a lot of our memories and our knowledge instead are based on many, many, many experiences.\n","275":"Explainer: Right, like it reminds me so much of, you know, what we in the field would refer to as statistical learning.

It's fairly easy to get different participants to experience consistent negative emotions to the same stimuli, but with positive emotions it's so much harder to study. I might not react the same to like this like cute cat video than someone else. And I definitely believe that people's memory that they're bringing up unconsciously when they're experiencing something to make an emotional judgment informs especially our experience with positive emotion possibly more than negative emotion.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: As far as the way that my research plays into it is like the first step in making a judgment about what to do based on an experience we're calling from memory is deciding what your emotional response was.\nExplainer: I think what we're still kind of trying to understand as a field is the more kind of detailed and bigger picture of where does this model live? How does it get updated based on experiences? Why does that sometimes happen and sometimes not? There are actually people who are born without a hippocampus. They have disruptions to episodic memories. They have trouble after this conversation remembering what the conversation was about, but they do have pretty good semantic information. They have a good sense of knowledge about the world. And that's interesting for two reasons. One, it shows this association between the role of the hippocampus and these two forms of memory, episodic memories and semantic memory. The other reason it's interesting is that people often assume that we get to semantic memory through episodic memory, that we encounter one dog and then another dog, and then another dog and then we learned the concept, the semantic notion of a dog. And these people, their profile suggests that you can learn semantic information. You can learn general knowledge about the world, even without ever having the capacity to build those individual memories.\n","276":"Explainer: Some of those examples really remind me also some of the questions about kind of abnormalities in, in memory or trauma or disruptions in memory and how they also play out in terms of not just what people remember but what they do with those memories right?\nExplainee: As far as the way that my research plays into it is like the first step in making a judgment about what to do based on an experience we're calling from memory is deciding what your emotional response was.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: In people with intact brains, you might use a particular process, but if that brain region that subserves that process is damaged, that it's not that you can't do it anymore you just now do it a different way.\nExplainer: You know when I look back at, some of the work for my own lab and in the field in general, I really feel like some of the most exciting discoveries were not an answer to a question that was around before, but they were discoveries that made us realize we weren't asking the right question. I think one example of that even has to do with the connection between memory and decision-making. There was a discovery about how the striatum responds to rewards and to learning that just all of a sudden flipped the way we thought about the role of reward and learning and memory, and may force us to realize there was something fundamentally connected between these processes. And that discovery just raised a whole new set of questions that didn't exist before.\n","277":"Explainer: You know when I look back at, some of the work for my own lab and in the field in general, I really feel like some of the most exciting discoveries were not an answer to a question that was around before, but they were discoveries that made us realize we weren't asking the right question.

And it has to be able to figure out, from that massive set of numbers, what is in the world. There is a number of different ways to have the robot see, but we use a technique called neural networks, that tries to take out in those big numbers and form representations of the objects in the world, and where those objects are.\nExplainee: Can a robot ever go off the program?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Do you think robots will take over the world? Just being honest.\nExplainer: I think that robotics is really, really hard. Having robots do even really basic stuff, like pick up objects, is really, really hard. So if they do take over the world, I think it'll be a very, very, very, very long time from now.\n","280":"Explainer: Or you don't even need computers. Like I remember when I was a kid, I played electric guitar and I had all these guitar pedals with different effects and oh, what happens if you put the output back in the input and just run it through itself, you're gonna start hearing this kind of fractal sound, right? So today we've been telling people, fractals are things that are somehow self-similar, they have detail at all scales. Are there other ways you might introduce fractals to somebody or are there other things you might say, this is what a fractal is?\nExplainee: And I think that's one of the things that's exciting about it.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: I think you could get to the reasons why does a coastline look like a coastline at all different scales? It's because the forces of nature tend to work similarly at all different scales. And it's those forces that are doing very, very simple things over and over and over again that are constantly creating the sense of detail.\nExplainer: Yeah.\n","281":"Explainer: Yeah.\nExplainee: Yeah I actually actually remember the moment when I finally figured out how to make turbulence in computer graphics, I was working for this company, Maggi and Disney was working on a movie. I think it was weird science where they wanted to have a marble vase. And then about three in the morning, I was at a diner nearby and I was pouring the cream into the coffee and I was watching it and I started watching it swirl around. And I realized that what was happening was really simple that you had this line of cream and then it hits the cup and it folds and then the folds get caught up. And then that folds again. And it's a really simple process of folding within folding. And I just went to the computer and did that.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: And things look like marble and looked like flame. And they looked like clouds and they look like you just keep using those simple techniques\nExplainer: You know, behave the way that nature does.\n","282":"Explainer: Absolutely.\nExplainee: Well, it's also, it's not even possible to explore, to store an entire world in your computer.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: You wanna be able to sort of generate it on the fly. I'm looking forward to things getting better. We're not there yet.\nExplainer: So- He made a lot of happy little trees.\n","283":"Explainer: I'll admit. I have absolutely no idea. Do you think it's a finite number or an infinite number?\nExplainee: Finite because I can see them all in here.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: An infinite amount of jars.\nExplainer: Very good. Why do you say that?\n","284":"Explainer: me too\nExplainee: Yeah, always when I'm trying to take a photo.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Wow.\nExplainer: so my team is working on building new kinds of computers all together ones that operate by totally different set of rules so do you know what that is\n","285":"Explainer: have you ever heard of the word quantum \nExplainee: No.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Yeah.\nExplainer: i'm going to start by telling you about something called superposition so i'm going to explain it using this giant penny\n","286":"Explainer: i'm going to start by telling you about something called superposition so i'm going to explain it using this giant penny\nExplainee: Heads.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Oh, I wouldn't know.\nExplainer: okay but what if i spin the penny\n","287":"Explainer: while it's spinning\nExplainee: That's crazy.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Oh my god.\nExplainer: when we use the word entangled in everyday language what do we mean\n","288":"Explainee: Yeah, I mean I'm definitely gonna impress all my friends when I tell them about this, they're gonna be like, quantum what?\nExplainer: your hair is tangled or whatever you can you can untangle it right\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainer: that's so cool right \nExplainer: the way that we are able to actually see these quantum properties is by making our quantum chips really really cold so that's what this is all about actually this is called a dilution refrigerator and it's a refrigerator it doesn't look like a normal refrigerator right but it's something that we use actually there's usually a case around it to cool our quantum chips down cold enough that we can create superpositions and we can entangle qubits and the information isn't lost to the environment \n","289":"Explainer: but in the quantum world when we entangle things they're really now connected it's much much harder to separate them again so using the same analogy we spin our pennies and eventually eventually they both stop right and when they stop it's either heads or tails right so in my case i got tails and you got heads you see how they're totally disconnected from each other right our pennies in the real world now if our pennies were entangled and we both spun them together right when we stopped them if you measured your penny to be ahead i would measure my penny to be ahead and if you measured your penny to be a tails i would measure my opinion to be a tails if we measured it at exactly the same time we would still find that they were both exactly correlated \nExplainer: that's so cool right \nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainer: so one of the things that we're trying to use quantum computers to do is simulating chemical bonding use a quantum system to model a quantum system\n","290":"Explainer: So sensing is really just about measuring stuff.\nExplainee: Okay.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Okay, measurements on like what kinds of things?\nExplainer: Could be on almost anything you want. Have you ever broken a bone?\n","291":"Explainer: Start to see the different cells\nExplainee: Yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Are there different types of quantum sensors for different things?\nExplainer: So one of the quantum sensors that's related to the work that I do is based on these defects that are called nitrogen-vacancy centers\n","292":"Explainer: In a diamond and people actually now make nano diamonds that they can try to put inside the human body to look at the chemistry inside the cells.\nExplainee: So is that used for drug trials and when testing out new treatments?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Are there any other quantum sensors at the moment that are in the developmental stage anymore that we are using?\nExplainer: So there are quantum sensors that are sold for very specific applications, one of them is a magnetometer and those can be really, really sensitive to measure small variations in magnetic fields. They are trying to develop sensors that are gravitational sensors. Right now, we have no way of probing what's under the ground without digging into the

it sounds neither like a major seven chord nor a typical dominant seven chord because of the combination of the sharp five and natural seven. It's a unique chord with its own characteristic sound, which might explain why it haunted you for days.","5":"The concept that made me keep thinking for days was what Chris Anderson talked about in his TED talk.","6":"It's the second one in the playlist.","7":"That's right. A lower latency in VR means that the actions you take in the virtual world correspond more closely to your actions in the real world. This reduces the sensation of motion sickness and improves the overall immersive experience.","8":"but maybe the challenge is to turn a 'crazy' idea into a fun, playable game that appeals to a wide audience.","9":"Actually, I was referring to your assumption about machine learning. Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that provides systems the ability to automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. In other words, it allows machines to learn from data without human involvement.","10":" Absolutely, machines can perform tasks with a higher level of precision, speed, and consistency than humans in certain areas. However, machines lack the ability to understand, empathize, or create in the way humans do. For instance, a machine can perfectly simulate a picture of a landscape, but it cannot paint it with the emotional depth that a human artist can. Similarly, while machines can solve complex mathematical problems quickly, they cannot necessarily understand the underlying concepts as a human might.","11":"Neutron stars and black holes are both extremely dense objects, formed from the remnants of massive stars. However, neutron stars are composed mainly of neutrons, while black holes have such a high density that their mass is compressed to a singularity, a point of infinite density surrounded by an event horizon where the gravity is so strong that nothing can escape.","12":"In some sense, it might be more accurate to describe the black hole as not having an insides in the way we conventionally think about objects having insides. The event horizon is a hard boundary that even light cannot pass beyond. Beyond it, we don't have a good understanding of what happens because the gravitational pull is so strong that we can't accurately predict what happens to matter that crosses it.","13":"But the collision of two neutron stars has actually been shown to be more efficient in creating the heavier elements beyond iron. This is because during the collision, protons and neutrons are smashed together under extreme pressure and temperatures, fusing to form heavier elements.","14":null,"15":"Einstein proposed that the speed of light is constant and independent of the relative motion of the observer and the source of the light. With this assumption, time dilation arises from the fact that as an object moves faster, its length (along the direction of motion) contracts, and as a result, the ticking of its clock is perceived to slow down by a stationary observer. This is known as the time dilation effect.","16":"I think what you're getting at is that as they're moving past you and you're stationary, according to Einstein's theory of relativity, neither of you can be said to be truly stationary. You're both in motion relative to each other and the train is causing the curved spacetime, which is what's making it seem like you're stationary when you're actually not. Time is also relative in this sense, so even if you think it's passing normally for you, it might be passing slower or faster for the person on the train, depending on their speed and distance from you. All in all, it's a fascinating interplay of motion, time, and spacetime that forms the foundation of modern physics.","17":"and just carry on with my life.","18":"It's like wrapping a rope around a cylinder. In the same way, we can wrap extra dimensions in certain regions of space to get a smaller observable universe.","19":"Is there something special about that particular way of compactification?","20":"It was in a higher dimensional space and we are in a lower dimension which makes it look large to us.","21":" And that's when they dubbed these objects as black branes. The difference from a black hole is that the black brane, rather than terminating at a singularity, extends down indefinitely and is characterized by its thickness or number of dimensions. The balance between radius, cosmological constant, and electromagnetic field determines the behavior of this 'brane' in the universe.","22":"minimizes the action among all the possible solutions that can be obtained by choosing different values for the cosmological constant in the transverse dimensions.","23":"Would you suggest they dive into the ideas further by reading your new graphic novel, which touches on this topic?","24":"Would that be of interest to them? It delves deep into the mysteries of quantum mechanics and how they relate to the concept of spacetime.","25":"You're not really able to see it, but you can just barely tell that my hand is moving.","26":"That's correct!

And with its precision, we could manipulate the cell or even the molecules within it by driving extremely specific chemical reactions, or even perform techniques like pump-probe spectroscopy to observe the cell's behavior or ionize it.","29":"But creating realistic interactions with people is a significant challenge, and it doesn't only involve mastering micro-expressions. It also requires a deep understanding of social cues, context, and the complexities of human behavior. Developing a machine-learning model to process and replicate such complexities from YouTube videos and other sources could potentially accelerate the process. However, it's a huge task that likely transcends the scope of what we can achieve in the next ten years.","30":"So, do you understand the concept of dimensions? If so, can you describe how a two-dimensional space would be like if we were to add another dimension to it, at right angles?","31":"And that's what describes four dimensional space.","32":"Imagine dividing the sky into imaginary lines similar to the way we divide the earth into longitude and latitude lines. Those lines, called right ascension and declination, give us the astronomical coordinates of celestial objects.","33":"That's correct! The peels, or dimensions, we are familiar with are three - length, width, and depth (in your everyday objects). The theory suggests there could be additional dimensions beyond what we can perceive, possibly creating a 'multidimensional' universe with more than three dimensions.","34":null,"35":"So whenever we try to predict what will happen, all we can do is form probabilities to help us better understand the situation, but those probabilities are not deterministic, just statistical. So we really don't know for sure what will happen.","36":"I've also heard about the event horizon telescope project, a global network of 8 radio telescopes that were brought together to create an Earth-sized virtual scope, allowing scientists to witness, for the very first time, detailed images of black holes located in the far reaches of the universe.","37":"In the study of black holes, various technologies and tools are used. For instance, LIGO uses laser interferometry to detect gravitational waves, while the Event Horizon Telescope uses Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) and radio waves to image the event horizon of black holes.

In the case of a black hole, the boundary is the event horizon. However, in your analogy, you're packing information 'into' a region which already has a boundary (the volume). In the context of a black hole, it's more accurate to say that the event horizon is the boundary within which you're packing information. The holographic principle suggests that the entirety of the information contained within the black hole can be described by the boundary conditions on the event horizon, rather than the volume of the black hole itself.","72":"Holography suggests that information in a lower number of dimensions is equivalent to a more complex information structure in a higher number of dimensions.

In a zero-gravity experience, a large airplane flies in parabolic paths to create conditions of free fall. When you're in free fall, you're falling forward at the same rate that the ground is rushing up to meet you, so you feel weightless. This demonstrates that the sensation of weight we feel is not due to the Earth exerting a force on us; it's due to us being in contact with the Earth, and the Earth exerting an equal and opposite force. When you're in free fall, that balance is broken, and you feel weightless because there's no net force acting on you.","98":null,"99":"That was the exact emotion I was feeling, wasn't it?","100":"We live in a universe with three spatial dimensions and one time dimension.

For instance, in the case of cryptocurrencies, individuals can send and receive payments without the need for banks or financial institutions. As for verifying the authenticity or identity of a seller, blockchain can support solutions like smart contracts. These contracts can include a list of predefined conditions that need to be met for the transaction to be validated. In this way, the Blockchain network can ensure that the seller is known and trusted within the community.

The closest server is usually chosen to reduce the travel time, but it's not quite the same as everything being in one spot.","212":"It knows what to do without getting scrambled up by connecting to the server that's closest to your house, and then the server sends the movie data to your device a piece at a time, reconstructing the movie for you as it arrives.","213":"For sets to have the same size, there should be a way to pair each element in one set with exactly one element in the other set without any left overs. In terms of these sets, it's not immediately clear if it's possible to find such a pairing, so it's not immediately clear if they have the same size.","214":"But there's a catch. If we can make a one-to-one correspondence between the set of all rational numbers and the set of integers, then we would have proven that there are exactly as many rational numbers as there are integers, and they would still be the same size infinity.","215":null,"216":"Yes, we have encoded the real numbers as well, also of the same size infinity. The process is a bit more complex, involving limits of sequences. But it shows that there are no more real numbers than rational numbers, which in turn have the same size as natural numbers. Therefore, they are all the same size infinity.","217":"For instance, in mathematics, understanding these differences can help solve problems more efficiently. For example, some mathematical statements that seem true for finite sets can fail in infinite sets. This is known as 'Cantor's Diagonal Argument' and it's a testament to the subtle differences between various infinities. In computer science, the concept of different sizes of infinity is crucial for understanding the complexity of algorithms, especially those dealing with infinite sets, like stream processing algorithms.","218":null,"219":"Entanglement is a phenomenon where two or more particles are linked in such a way that the state of one particle will instantaneously affect the state of the other, regardless of the distance between them. It's a key concept in quantum mechanics and it can be quite powerful when it comes to quantum computing, for example.","220":"In practical terms, we are designing and implementing quantum gates, quantum processors, and quantum error correction techniques to construct Quantum Information Processing (QIP) systems. This allows us to manipulate and process quantum information for computing tasks. We are also working on integrating these QIP systems with classical computers to leverage the power of both, as quantum computers might not replace classical computers entirely.","221":"Quantum computing uses qubits, or quantum bits, which can be put into superpositions of states and physically entangled with each other. Qubits can be made from various devices like atoms, ions, or in our case, superconducting materials. This is not easily done with things in our classical world.","222":"What I mean is, you'll need to learn new quantum programming languages and paradigms to harness the power of quantum computing. However, once you get the hang of it, you'll be able to seamlessly integrate quantum computing into your classical programming. Common use-cases for quantum computing include optimization problems, cryptography, and simulating complex systems that are infeasible for classical computers.","223":"So in other words, it's the mass of the star that determines whether or not it can form a black hole.","224":null,"225":"In simpler terms, a black hole forms because of its massive gravity, which warps the fabric of space-time around it so much that not even light can escape. So, if the sun were to collapse into a black hole, it would create a region of spacetime where everything, including light, would be trapped and unable to escape.","226":null,"227":null,"228":"So you're suggesting that as more IoT devices are added, the total amount of data generated will increase, but the amount of data per device will remain relatively small. This data needs to be processed, and much of that processing happens at the edge of the network or is done in a combination of edge and distributed cloud computing.","229":"I think they would, but it depends on the specific application and the requirements for data privacy and security. For instance, if it's a security-sensitive device like a smart lock, the data might be encrypted and kept local. On the other hand, if it's an energy management system, the data might be sent to a cloud server for analysis and optimization.","230":"I suppose they might consider sharing the data if there's a beneficial research collaboration or agreement in place, especially given the potential research value. By the way, have you considered investigating how different urban planning strategies could influence the acoustic landscape? For instance, examining the Sonic City project in Melbourne, which aims to create an audible city map by integrating sound art and urban design.","231":"without revealing any information about the input values you provided, or any state of the program.","232":"To be more precise, a distributed ledger requires a proof mechanism to ensure that every transaction in the system is valid. This proof is what the baby in the analogy represents. As our understanding of these proof mechanisms improves, our system becomes more robust and mature, much like a child growing up.","233":"The future direction for both crypto and zero-knowledge proof in the real world is very promising. As for the mathematical aspect in computing, I believe there's a lot we don't yet understand, which means there are many opportunities for new discoveries and advancements.","234":"So, have theories been proposed to explain the existence of black holes with millions or billions of solar masses like we see in some galaxies?","235":"But the problem with that is, we still don't understand the exact mechanisms by which it happens. It's one of the mysteries of the universe. Do they form inside the centers of protogenic discs as you mentioned, or is there some other process at play?","236":"Well, Andromeda is a galaxy that is similar to the Milky Way. It's located about 2.5 million light years away. It's known for a process called 'supernova', where a massive star explodes and can create a black hole.","237":"And we work a lot right now on thinking about what happens when these two supermassive black holes get close enough to each other to interact. This would mean they could potentially influence each other's magnetic fields, causing these batteries to overcharge or discharge, resulting in a massive release of energy.","238":null,"239":"The training time also depends on the size of the dataset you're working with. The larger the dataset, the more iterations it takes for the network to learn and thus the longer the training duration.","240":" So, in a quantum computer, instead of logical gates that change classical bits (0s and 1s), we use quantum bits (qubits) which can be in multiple states simultaneously due to superposition. This allows for a massive increase in the number of computations that can be performed at once compared to classical computers.","241":"so the superposition of up and down is similar to having a coin that can be both heads and tails at the same time, until you look at it and force it to be one or the other","242":"It's done with a process called quantum state preparation. Specifically, in a superconducting quantum computer, we initialize the qubits to a specific state, usually the ground state, using microwave pulses. To encode specific information, we manipulate the qubits to alter their quantum state, which is represented as a superposition of 0 and 1.","243":"We cannot implement those algorithms with our current technological limitations. This is because we are only able to maintain around 50 error-corrected qubits, while the algorithms that we know of today to do those things require millions of error-corrected qubits.","244":"The algorithms for near-term quantum computers are those that can be implemented on existing noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices. These algorithms need to be specifically designed to work with the limitations of these devices, such as low coherence times, high error rates, and limited qubit numbers. An example of such an algorithm is the Quantum Approximation Optimization Algorithm (QAOA), which is useful for solving combinatorial optimization problems.","245":"However, to overcome these challenges, we have been exploring machine learning algorithms such as Deep Learning Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for better object segmentation and deformable object handling. These techniques have shown promise in dealing with complex and deformable objects, and we hope they'll be integral in advancing the field of robotic manipulation.","246":"A fractal is a never-ending pattern repeated at every scale. Imagine the pattern on the edge of a leaf or a shell, for example. You can see the same pattern recursing at smaller and smaller scales. Mathematicians, however, define fractals as a set that can be split into parts, each of which is a reduced-size copy of the whole (also called a detailed copy), similar to mathematical fractions.","247":"The rule to model the tree is that every branch splits into no more than two and possibly fewer branches.","248":"If a branch itself looks like a tree as per your previous description, we'll count it as a tree and move on to the next branch. So it's a recursive process. If a tree is split into many smaller trees following our rule, those smaller trees can also eventually split into more trees, and so on.","249":"You'd write a program that generates patterns based on recursive mathematical equations.","250":null,"251":"But, it's important to note that while encryption shields the content being exchanged, it may not conceal the fact that a communication is taking place. Metadata, such as the identities of the communicating devices, the frequency and duration of the communication, and the timestamps, can still be observed.","252":"And with that, the latency is reduced significantly, making the user experience more responsive and interactive. In brief, this edge computing is all about bringing the computing power closer to the data source to improve efficiency, reduce costs, and enhance the user experience.","253":"But you, as a user or developer, have the flexibility to control and innovate the network as it's being managed through software, not hardware, just like you would with web applications.","254":"And that's where concepts like Edge Computing and Multi-access Edge Computing (MEC) come into play, enabling real-time processing of data and applications closer to the end-users, thereby reducing latency and improving user experience.","255":"So what do you understand by a black hole?","256":"So the distinction between static and rotating black holes comes down to their rotation, which is determined by their angular momentum. A static black hole, also known as a Schwarzschild black hole, has zero angular momentum and appears stationary, whereas a rotating black hole, according to Kerr's solution, rotates on its axis. In the real world, not all black holes are static, and some may be rotating due to the acquisition of angular momentum during their lifetime. As for which is more common, it's difficult to say because we don't have a clear understanding of the distribution of black hole spins in the universe.","257":" A black hole's rotation is determined by its angular momentum carried from the matter that formed it. When a star collapses, it spins, and it is this spin that determines how a Kerr black hole rotates. A Schwarzschild black hole, on the other hand, is static and does not rotate as it has zero angular momentum.","258":"Yes, that's correct. We don't know exactly what happens after crossing the event horizon or inside a black hole since we can't directly observe or interact with them, but physicists believe that the mathematics involved in the theories such as general relativity and quantum mechanics provide a good description of the phenomena we observe. Additionally, it's important to note that black holes are not particles, but rather regions in space where gravity is so strong that nothing, not even light, can escape. However, the concept of a black hole as a 'quantum fundamental particle' is currently not supported by scientific evidence.","259":"But what is disputed is the implication that black holes will completely evaporate until their temperature reaches the Planck temperature. Once they reach this temperature, the energy required to push a particle over the event horizon becomes equal to the particle\u2019s own energy, which is the quantum mechanical equivalent of the energy contained in an object with a mass of approximately 1.2 x 10^-5 g. At this point, the black hole disappears completely, however, it is theorized that what remains is a remnant of spacetime singularity. The discrepancy between the theoretical predictions about the complete evaporation of a black hole and the observational evidence that supermassive black holes are known to exist has led to ongoing discussions about the nature of black holes and the fundamental laws of physics.","260":"So the thought is that these observable quantum effects might show up in these gravity waves as they settle, giving us a sneak peek into the realm of quantum gravity.","261":"It would require a tremendous amount of computational power and observational precision to accurately capture and analyze such data, but if successful, it could potentially shed light on the elusive quantum properties of black holes and provide insights into the nature of quantum gravity.","262":"between different parties in cloud computing, and create a system where data can be shared and verified without the need to disclose the actual data.","263":"Well, for instance, if you remember that you didn't like the taste of orange juice from your old house, but during your vacation, you found a delicious orange juice, it would change your perception of orange juice, which is an example of how memory can influence us. Similarly, when you were a kid, if you remember that you enjoyed a certain candy, and you're presented with two candies, your decision might be influenced by your memory of that enjoyable experience.","264":"Now let's see, both candies are great, but I think I'll regret it more if I don't get the other one, that's what my past memories with those candies suggest.","265":"Wow, that's an interesting question. I guess the video would be broken down into smaller pieces called packets and they would travel through the internet by hopping from one server to another until they reach their destination.","266":"Actually, there might be multiple servers in a network with the same destination IP address. This is known as load balancing, ensuring that the server does not become overwhelmed with too much traffic. So the video might get routed to any of these servers, rather than one specific server.","267":"There are many different service providers, which offer various services. They have built their own infrastructure on top of the internet to provide these services.","268":"What I meant was, in the context of network science, our mental models would be the specific configurations and structures of connections, or 'networks', within the brain. These networks allow us to make predictions about how information will flow, and subsequently, how we'll respond to our environment.","269":null,"270":"Also, the model can adapt and change over time based on new experiences, making it dynamic and capable of predicting new outcomes accurately. So perhaps we should emphasize its adaptability and its ability to generate new predictions based on its structure and the data it's been trained with.","271":"They discovered gravitational waves for the first time from the collision of two black holes in 2016.","272":"Because gravitational waves are produced by the immense violent collision of massive objects such as black holes, we can infer that it is a black hole merger that is creating this gravitational wave. The wave propagates out from the source, losing energy as it travels and getting weaker over time. When it reaches Earth, it's still too weak to have any noticeable effect on Earth or its inhabitants.","273":null,"274":"And it sounds like your research is looking at how we form those many, many experiences into some sort of schema or mental model that we can then use to make judgements or predictions about new social stimuli. That's essentially what statistical learning is about, right?","275":"I think it's important to note that this implies that our emotional responses and memory might not strictly rely on episodic memories. Instead, it seems that there could be parallel processing happening where experiences contribute to both episodic and semantic memory, but semantic memory can also be shaped outside of episodic memory, potentially through direct experiences or environmental stimuli.","276":null,"277":"Well, we're trying to explore the nature of these connections in more detail and figuring out if and how they might be influencing other brain regions involved in memory and decision-making. We're designing experiments to manipulate these connections and observe changes in behavior and neural activity to better understand their role in these processes.","278":"But things that we find easy to do physically are actually quite complex for a robot or computer, since they have to account for multiple variables and make precise movements.","279":"A neural network is an interconnected group of artificial neurons that uses a mathematical model to compute and predict values based on the given input. Robots use neural networks to learn from the data they process, and it enables them to make decisions based on that learning. However, they still can't go off the program or make independent decisions as of now. They only function based on the programming they've been given and the data they're trained on.","280":"So you can say, fractals are repeatable patterns that exhibit self-similarity at different scales, and they seem to be everywhere in nature due to the simple, self-replicating processes that lead to their formation.","281":null,"282":"A better way, to achieve this, is to have algorithms in place, that can generate the world on the fly as needed rather than storing it all in the computer.","283":"From your statement that you can 'see them all in here', it implies that the jars are contained within a finite space. However, you suggested creating more jars to put the remaining unseen jars into, implying an infinite number of jars when those jars are filled. This apparent contradiction suggests that the number of jars may be infinite.","284":null,"285":"This is a physical system that is very familiar to you. Let's consider this penny as our physical system.","286":"and it starts spinning on a perfectly horizontal plane. Now, according to superposition, this spinning penny is in all possible orientations at the same time - spinning head-first, spinning tails-first, and every orientation in between, but you don't see this because it averages out when the penny stops spinning and settles on one orientation.","287":null,"288":"It's a process called quantum annealing. Quantum annealing allows us to solve complex problems that are practically impossible for classical computers to solve.","289":"it's really fascinating, because in the classical world simulating complex chemical reactions is incredibly computationally expensive. However, a quantum computer's ability to entangle particles and operate on them all at once could potentially make these simulations much more efficient.","290":"That's an example. In that case, the measuring device (like an X-ray machine) is measuring the broken bone to confirm the diagnosis.","291":"in the diamond lattice, such nitrogen-vacancy centers can function as a type of quantum sensor, especially useful in measuring magnetic fields and temperature.","292":" Yes, indeed.

In VR, a lower latency helps ensure that the actions you take in the virtual world correspond more closely with your real-world actions, which reduces motion sickness and contributes to a more immersive, engaging experience. It's important to minimize latency because even a small time delay can disrupt the immersion and negatively affect the overall experience.","8":null,"9":null,"10":"To respond to your questions, let me say that machines can excel at specific tasks, like calculations, and accomplish them with greater speed and precision than humans. However, when it comes to understanding, empathy, or creativity \u2013 aspects which are integral to human intelligence \u2013 machines are woefully inadequate. For example, while machines can recreate an image of a landscape, they can't imbue it with the emotional depth and nuances that a human artist can. Similarly, although machines can solve complex mathematical problems rapidly, they can't truly grasp the underlying concepts in the same way a human might.","11":"Neutron stars and black holes are both incredibly dense objects, formed from the remnants of massive stars. While neutron stars are primarily made of neutrons, black holes reach such a high density that their mass becomes compressed into a singularity - an infinitely dense point surrounded by an event horizon where the gravity is so intense that nothing can escape.

It's quite fascinating how these events contribute to the formation of our universe's chemical richness.","14":"In simpler terms, let's use the example of space, something we're familiar with, say two dimensions X and Y. What's unique about it is that no matter which coordinate system we use, the distance between two points remains unchanged. For example, you can imagine a path between two points, where I am, a traveler, would have an odometer measuring the distance I travel. The path that takes longer time or distance, no matter how I move, is always greater. This concept extends to spacetime, as it not only has three dimensions like space but also time. This makes it a four-dimensional realm that is crucial for understanding physics, especially physics that deals with objects moving through time and space.","15":"In simpler terms, as an object moves faster, its length (along the direction of motion) appears shorter from the perspective of a stationary observer. This is due to a concept called time dilation, which Einstein proposed. When an object moves at high speeds, its clock appears to run slower compared to a stationary clock, because the spacetime in which those clocks exist has a unique metric that bends time as objects move through it.","16":"Indeed, you've conveyed the concept quite well. In simple terms, as the train moves, it creates a curved spacetime around it, causing both you and the moving passenger to be in relative motion. This relative motion is a key aspect of Einstein's theory of relativity. It also affects the passage of time - time may appear to pass differently for you based on your relative speed and distance. There's indeed a fascinating dance between motion, time, and spacetime that underpins our modern understanding of physics.","17":"Well, now that our discussion is wrapped up, I'll get back to my usual life groove. But you know, a little harmony never hurts! How about I head off humming 'Amazing Grace'?","18":"Imagine winding a rope around a cylinder. In the same analogy, physics allows us to twist extra dimensions in specific areas of space, generating a smaller observable universe similar to our own. This concept is further explored in my co-authored paper with Matt Johnson and Lisa Randall, where we discuss a novel approach to compactify extra dimensions dynamically.","19":"So, do certain forms of compactification seem particularly favored in the observable universe? Are there unique properties that make our world what it is?","20":"In a multi-dimensional world, these extra dimensions exist naturally. However, they only manifest themselves in sizes we perceive as large due to our reduced dimensionality.","21":"You've hit the nail on the head! Black Branes, indeed, differ from Black Holes in how they extend beyond their singularities and terminate indefinitely on a thick brane instead. This extended structure is a result of having extra dimensions, which physicists humorously attribute to the analogy of a membrane. These extended dimensions are symbolized by the letter 'P' in the context of a P-brane. In simpler terms, a Black Brane can be visualized as having various higher dimensions, with the balance between its radius, cosmological constant, and electromagnetic field determining its behavior in the universe. Additionally, it's worth noting that these branes tend to start as non-singular, and in the core, you'll find an anti-de Sitter spacetime.","22":null,"23":null,"24":null,"25":"That's not entirely clear to me right now. But if you imagine, you can almost tell my hand is moving. It's similar to focusing on one hand, while the other foot becomes less distinct. This is because our eyes can perceive different levels of detail in various areas. In the future, we hope to create technology that renders high levels of detail only where you're looking. This would reduce the computational load since we wouldn't need to render as much detail as we do now. But it's a challenging problem. We're currently working on this by using cameras to track eye movements and determine what you're looking at. Our goal is to create a virtual reality that feels as real as the world around us, but it will take some time before we can truly deceive the senses.","26":"Awesome job! You're spot on! Three fingers, not bad at all!","27":"So, that's quite fascinating! I can imagine the difference between continuous wave laser and chirped pulse amplification. In the CW laser, the energy is delivered at a continuous rate as you mentioned. But in the chirped pulse amplifier, the energy is delivered in very short, high-power pulses. This ability to compress and deliver a large amount of energy in a short time is one of the main advantages of chirped pulse amplification. By the way, have you considered using optical tweezers for any advanced experiments with high-intensity laser pulses? It might be an interesting connection to explore.","28":"That's right. With such precision, we could potentially stimulate targeted chemical reactions in a single cell or any other structure even as little as a molecule. This could allow us to study cell behavior in detail or manipulate it selectively using various techniques like spectroscopy or ionization.","29":"Indeed, once we overcome these technical hurdles, a whole realm of artistic possibilities opens up. As you said, we're still grappling with the human and social aspects of simulating people's interactions. To achieve this, artificial intelligence and machine learning will be crucial, processing vast amounts of data from various sources to better understand and replicate human behavior. It's a monumental task, one that might take decades and isn't limited to deciphering micro-expressions, but rather encompasses social cues, context, and the intricacies of human interaction.","30":null,"31":null,"32":"Indeed. If you visualize the sky as slices of an orange, you're on the right track. The imaginary lines we use - named right ascension and declination - are much like the meridians and parallels on earth. These coordinates help us pinpoint celestial objects in the sky.","33":"Yes, you've got it right! In our world, we generally experience three dimensions: length, width, and depth. However, certain theories propose the existence of additional dimensions beyond these. The number of these dimensions isn't definitively known yet, but some theories suggest it could be as many as six. In the universe they describe, objects could exist not only along multiple dimensions that we can perceive, but also in dimensions too small for us to detect, which would make this universe truly multidimensional.","34":null,"35":"And that's the tricky part \u2013 we often predict what might happen in the world of physics, but our predictions aren't set in stone. Instead, we work with probabilities to help us grasp the situation, but remember, these probabilities aren't a guarantee. They're statistical, so we can't be certain about our predictions.","36":"I've also heard about the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) project, which is a global network of more than 80 radio telescopes collaborating to create an effective Earth-sized virtual telescope. With EHT, we were able to capture images of black holes located in the far reaches of our universe, breaking new ground in the realm of black hole research.","37":null,"38":null,"39":"In space, astronauts don't grow taller as such.

When they're smaller than 15 nanometers, their band gap changes depending on their size, giving us the flexibility to finely tune the colors they emit.","47":"Quantum dots could find their way into lighting applications, such as display technology, because of their ability to emit pure light of a single color.

It'd be quite intriguing to scrutinize whether cosmic rays could cause a bit flip in memory, potentially taking control of a computer system. This would, in essence, be another unexplored territory for fault injection research!","55":"Yes, that's right. Fault injection in this scenario involves manipulating the flash memory by flipping bits. This can lead to unauthorized access or system malfunctions by triggering errors during the authentication process. It's a fascinating technique to explore the vulnerabilities of the device's security mechanisms.","56":"Wow, that's fascinating!

In order to simulate such intricate mental functions, a model would need to capture and model the emergent properties of the brain, such as neuroplasticity and the chaos theory. This is a fascinating area of ongoing research\u2014perhaps one day, we'll be able to build a machine that matches the complexity of the human mind.","64":null,"65":"Indeed, it seems challenging to explain the origin of these massive black holes, particularly the ones with million solar masses or more. One possibility is that they originated through the coalescence of smaller black holes, but we're still unsure about the initial formation process. Another theory posits that these black holes might have formed from the remnants of incredibly massive stars, but this theory is debated among astronomers due to observed discrepancies. Another intriguing aspect is why we don't find black holes at the centers of supernova remnants, despite expectations. One explanation could be that they don't exhibit the same easily observable characteristics as neutron stars, making them harder to detect. Yet, another theory suggests the black holes swallowed up all the nearby matter so quickly that they didn't trigger a supernova, making them more elusive to our detectors.","66":"Interesting!

In a quantum theory of gravity, the event horizon can't be definitively established due to the superposition of states. This implies that we might have a state representing a black hole and another state without a black hole, or a black hole with a slightly varying event horizon. Classical relativity isn't violated when the wave function peaks around a well-defined state.","71":"But you're right. The holographic principle suggests that the maximum amount of information one can pack into any region in the universe, including a black hole, is constrained by the boundary of that region. In the case of a black hole, the boundary is indeed the event horizon. Yet, in your analogy, you're packing information 'into' a region which already has a boundary (the volume). A more precise description would be that we're essentially filling the space within the event horizon, the boundary itself, with information. The holographic principle posits that the entirety of the information contained within a black hole can be described by the boundary conditions on the event horizon, rather than the volume of the black hole itself.","72":"Holography implies that the complex information structure of our three-dimensional world can be equivalent to information in fewer dimensions, suggesting that our universe could potentially be represented as a hologram in a two-dimensional surface.","73":"Here it is, just be gentle with it.

For example, have you ever wondered about those miniature components that make up the chip in your phone? They're the result of nanotechnology!","79":"Intricate designs like these are created using a process called photolithography. A silicon wafer is coated with a photosensitive material and a mask is placed on top. Ultraviolet light is then shone through the mask, and the parts of the wafer that are exposed to light harden, while the parts that are covered by the mask remain soft and can be washed away. This light-and-chemistry dance is repeated multiple times to create the intricate networks of transistors that power your devices today.","80":null,"81":"It depends on the system's security measures. Generally, it can take anywhere from a few minutes to several hours, or even days for complex systems.","82":null,"83":"Sure, when you're on a train and another one nearby moves, it creates a moment of confusion about who's moving because we're typically used to assuming a stationary platform. In reality, both trains are moving relative to each other, yet there's no absolute reference frame to determine who's stationary and who's moving. This situation illustrates the concept of relative motion, where objects in motion can appear stationary or moving when compared with other objects in motion.","84":"It also gives your brain a chance to rest, process information, and consolidate memories, much like how chargers rejuvenate an electric car's battery.","85":null,"86":"Have you ever imagined how great it would be to sleep underwater like a hippo?

So, if I understand correctly, gravity isn't just a force acting between objects, but it's more like a warping of space-time itself. Since we're standing on Earth, we're moving through this curved space-time, giving us the perception of weight. And when we remove the influence of the Earth, like in a falling elevator, we're experiencing free-fall, moving along this curved path in space-time. Is that about right?","97":null,"98":"I see!

This can be achieved using digital signatures from reliable institutions, such as governments or certified authorities. For instance, if person A wants to sell an item, they could present a digital signature from a trusted source, verifying their identity as a legitimate seller. This creates a more secure and trustworthy environment for transactions on the blockchain.","111":"Indeed, the blockchain's decentralized and secure nature allows for a transparent tracking of asset ownership and transfers. This means that in the context of goods and services, a blockchain network could validate transactions, ensuring each participant in the network verifies the legitimacy of the seller or producer. This increases trust and accountability in the transaction process.","112":"Yes, that's an interesting observation. As we delve further into the relationship between sleep and Alzheimer's, there seems to be a stronger correlation with tauopathies. In terms of beta-amyloid, studies have shown that sleep disturbances can be a significant contributing factor to its accumulation in the brain, potentially accelerating the progression of Alzheimer's.","113":"The missing part of the dialogue might be the explainer explaining that both beta-amyloid and tauopathies, the two clear features of Alzheimer's pathology, seem to be associated with sleep changes in transgenic mouse models of AD. These models, which include those expressing human mutant amyloid precursor protein (APP) and mutant tau, demonstrate sleep changes in both pathologies. This suggests that both beta-amyloid and tauopathies may play a role in the sleep changes observed in Alzheimer's disease.","114":"That's a corner, where the halves of the square meet.

While it is fascinating to think about reprogramming viruses, as of my current knowledge, there are no instances of viruses naturally building nanostructures such as solar cells, catalysts, or batteries. To achieve this, we would need to modify the genetic code of a virus to carry and integrate specific genetic code for the desired nano structure, similar to the way a vaccine encourages immune system response.

One of the main aspects to consider is that with smaller angles, the folds of the same parity and those of opposite parity move at approximately the same rate. However, as we get closer to 90 degrees, we observe they move at very different rates. At the end of the motion, the opposite happens \u2013 the fold that was mostly folded before undergoes a larger motion while the other is almost fully deployed.

This technique is particularly useful in situations where you want to prove that you possess certain information without disclosing the information itself, such as in secure authentication systems.","166":"A zero-knowledge proof is a method that allows one party to prove to another that they know a secret, without revealing the secret itself. This means that even if a hacker gains access to the computer, they won't learn anything because the computer doesn't store or learn the secret.","167":"In essence, a zero-knowledge proof allows you to demonstrate that you are Chelsea without disclosing any sensitive information, such as your password.

In mathematics, we often model an apple as a three-dimensional object, considering its length, width, and height. However, when discussing fractals, we might focus on the intricate patterns and self-similarity within the apple's structure, which can be represented using complex mathematical equations.","173":"Well, if we consider the paper as a whole, it has two dimensions: length and width. However, if we think about it as a 3D object, it also has depth. But when we cut it in half, we're essentially creating two 2D parts, so we would need two boxes to cover the line.","174":"That's correct! By using recursion, we can create smaller and smaller boxes as we zoom in, calculating the coastline within each box based on a simple rule or algorithm. This way, we can add as much detail as needed without wasting resources on regions that don't need it when viewed at a larger scale. This concept is the basis for procedural computer graphics, which allows us to add detail efficiently without requiring artists to paint ultra-detailed textures.","175":"Indeed, Perlin noise is a fascinating topic. It was one of the pioneering methods to generate additional texture at any desired level of detail, making digital creations look more natural and realistic. Now, let's delve into the origins of fractal research. Have you heard about Benoit Mandelbrot and his groundbreaking work in the field?","176":"Let's relocate the drop-off point to the new position. Let's see how the robot adjusts to the change.","177":"It wasn't asked to locate the cup, only to move over here. So, it doesn't need to consider the cup's position. Is that a simple or complex task in your opinion?","178":"As the verifier, you don't need to understand the operations performed in the proof. Instead, you verify that the proof is valid, without knowing the actual details or why it's true. In our example, the zero-knowledge proof will demonstrate that the map can be three-colored, without providing the three-coloring itself.","179":"Great! I'd appreciate it if you could confirm the colors for India and Australia. It's always good to double-check our work, don't you think?","180":"Zero-knowledge proofs can be utilized in various scenarios to foster trust, such as secure authentication, privacy-preserving verification of credentials, or confidential transactions. They are designed to be practical for implementation and offer enhanced privacy and security compared to traditional methods.","181":"There are various types of neural networks, including multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs), convolutional neural networks (CNNs), recurrent neural networks (RNNs), and others.

Typically, we need to be within a few nanometers to achieve the high resolution necessary for detecting a single electron at room temperature. This is one of the unique advantages of using nitrogen-vacancy centers for magnetic resonance imaging.","192":"That's correct. To minimize the impact of environmental fluctuations and material defects, we aim to optimize and cool down quantum systems, making their states more stable. This helps reduce the effect of random noise, which can be caused by fluctuations, as well as intrinsic noise from material defects that couple into the quantum system.","193":"I believe that the surge in the number of scientists and the diversification of research sectors will not only foster innovation but also lead to groundbreaking discoveries in the next ten years. This dynamic combination could potentially revolutionize various fields and reshape our understanding of the world.","194":"In reality, it's not just about adding more qubits. The real challenge lies in managing and safeguarding the quantum information processed by these qubits, as quantum errors are inevitable and can be a major obstacle. Quantum error correction and achieving fault tolerance are essential elements in the quest for a functional quantum computer.","195":"Indeed, the challenge lies in maintaining the quantum state, as it's quite delicate and susceptible to environmental factors. This is a significant hurdle that we're still working to overcome.","196":"In Minecraft, when you get really close to a shape, it doesn't change much because everything is made up of blocks. However, if you're interested in recursion, it's a powerful technique used in programming to solve complex problems by breaking them down into smaller, simpler parts. For instance, it's used in computer graphics to create intricate patterns and shapes, like fractals. Have you ever studied fractals or subdivision surfaces in your graphics class?","197":"Subdivision surface is a technique used in computer graphics to make shapes appear smoother by adding more polygons to the sharp corners. This process is similar to the recursive nature of fractals, where details become more intricate as you zoom in. In subdivision surface, this is achieved by recursively defining new vertices and edges within the existing mesh structure, allowing the shape to transition smoothly between the polygons.","198":"I'm explaining how to make a smooth shape out of sharp polygons using subdivision surfaces. This technique was developed by Pixar, specifically by a man named Ed Catmull, who invented the Catmull-Clark subdivision surfaces. These subdivision services have been refined over the years to make them incredibly fast, and in fact, they recently won the Touring Award.","199":"Currently, the main challenges in applying fractals to computer science lie in their computational complexity and the need for fine-tuning multiple parameters to achieve realistic and aesthetically pleasing results. However, as computational power improves and algorithms become more efficient, the use of fractals in rendering and other areas of computer science is expected to become increasingly important, particularly in the development of immersive virtual environments like the metaverse.","200":"Packet switching allows multiple computers to share the same network by breaking data into small packets and sending each packet independently across the network.

Abstraction is indeed the key here. By abstracting the complexity of the network, we can focus on building creative applications on top of it. The Domain Name System (DNS) is one of the abstraction layers that makes this possible. It translates names like gaia.cs.umass.edu, or ibm.com, or facebook.com to an IP address so that your application can actually send a message to that name, to that named service.","203":"They are dropped at various points along their journey, such as data centers or servers, and then transmitted to their destinations.","204":"For instance, a quantum sensor could leverage quantum phenomena to measure magnetic fields or minute position changes more accurately than traditional sensors, potentially revealing new insights about the world at the quantum level.","205":"And nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamonds can serve as quantum bits due to their unique ability to exist in two distinct quantum states concurrently, a phenomenon known as superposition. This property is vital for quantum computing as it enables multiple calculations to be executed simultaneously, thereby enhancing computational efficiency. By harnessing the power of superposition, we can create quantum sensors that are exceptionally sensitive to their environment, albeit fragile.","206":"That's correct! Essentially, you can think of a quantum computer as a base, and then using it as a sensor involves taking it out into the world to see how it behaves differently. Entanglement plays a crucial role here. If you have a large number of quantum sensors that are entangled, they'll interact much more strongly than if you just had one interact at a time.","207":"That also means that with more precise clocks, GPS readings would be even more accurate, which is crucial in emergency situations like natural disasters or air travel, where even a small error can have significant consequences.","208":"The ethernet cable in your house connects to your modem or router, which is part of a network.

This journey might involve multiple undersea cables and satellite links, depending on the path taken.","210":"The internet service provider uses a network of servers located around the world to route your call to the recipient. These servers are connected by undersea cables, which allow the signal to travel quickly and efficiently across long distances.","211":null,"212":"It does this by connecting to the server that's closest to your location, and then the server sends the show data to your device in small chunks, reassembling the show for you as it arrives.","213":"In terms of these sets, it's not immediately clear if it's possible to find such a pairing, so it's not immediately clear if they have the same number of elements. This is where the concept of cardinality comes in, which allows us to compare the sizes of infinite sets. We'll use the idea of one-to-one correspondence to investigate if all infinite sets have the same size.","214":"Here's the tricky part: if we can establish a one-to-one correspondence between the set of all rational numbers and the set of integers, we'd have shown that there are just as many rational numbers as there are integers, and they'd still be the same size of infinity. This might sound surprising, given that there are way more rational numbers than integers, but it's all about finding the right match.","215":"Let's continue counting the rational numbers by labeling the dots in this integer lattice, starting from the origin and moving counterclockwise. This process can continue indefinitely, but I'll leave it to you to discover the fascinating pattern that emerges.","216":"Yes, we've encoded the real numbers as well, using a process called the Cantor set, which shows that the real numbers, rational numbers, and natural numbers all have the same size infinity. This is a fascinating concept known as the continuum hypothesis, which suggests that there's no subset of the real numbers with a size strictly between that of the integers and the real numbers.","217":null,"218":"Yes, exactly.

We are also working on integrating these quantum computers with classical computers to take advantage of both systems. Quantum computers may not replace classical computers entirely, but they are expected to accelerate tasks that are difficult for classical machines.","221":"Quantum computing uses quantum bits, or qubits, which can be put into superpositions of states and physically entangled with each other. These qubits can be made from various devices like atoms, ions, or in our case, superconducting materials. This is not easily done with things in our classical world. As a programmer, this means that instead of writing out a giant summation over many terms to simulate complex systems, we can try to mimic the system directly on a quantum computer. This can be particularly useful for chemistry and machine learning problems.","222":"As a programmer, you'll need to learn new quantum programming languages and paradigms to utilize quantum computing. Some common use-cases for quantum computing include optimization problems, cryptography, and simulating complex systems that are infeasible for classical computers.","223":"So, to clarify, a star's mass determines whether it can form a black hole. If a star is massive enough to explode in a supernova, what remains can collapse under its own gravity. If this remnant is heavy enough, its core will continue to collapse due to the lack of thermonuclear fuel, causing the formation of a black hole.","224":"The light gets pulled in due to the intense gravitational force of the black hole. As the light approaches the event horizon, it's pulled towards the black hole and cannot escape its gravitational pull, causing it to be absorbed.","225":"In essence, a black hole forms due to its immense gravitational pull, which distorts the fabric of space-time so severely that not even light can escape. So, if the sun were to collapse into a black hole, it would create a region of spacetime where everything, including light, would be trapped and unable to escape, making it appear dark from our perspective.","226":"That's right! Black holes are so powerful that they bend space and time around them, even light can't escape their grasp. Sometimes, light can even get trapped in a loop, orbiting the black hole.","227":"A choice function selects a unique element from any non-empty set.","228":"So you're suggesting that as more IoT devices are added, the total amount of data generated will increase, but the amount of data per device will remain relatively small. This data needs to be processed, and much of that processing happens at the edge of the network or in a combination of edge and cloud computing.","229":"I see your point. However, the data rates can vary greatly depending on the specific device and its purpose. For example, a simple temperature sensor might only send a few bytes of data every minute. On the other hand, a smart lock or a security camera might send larger amounts of data, potentially even in the kilobytes per second range, especially if they're sending encrypted data or high-resolution video. It's also worth noting that some devices may store data locally for privacy and security reasons, while others may send data to the cloud for analysis and optimization.","230":"Indeed, they might be willing to share the data if there's a mutually beneficial research collaboration or agreement in place, given its significant research value.

It's one of the mysteries of the universe. Do they form inside the centers of protogenic discs, or is there some other process at play? For instance, is it the result of mergers between smaller black holes, ultimately creating a gravitational well deep enough to contract a protogenic disc for a whole galaxy?","236":"Well, Andromeda is a spiral galaxy similar to the Milky Way, located approximately 2.5 million light years away. It's known for a process called 'supernova', where a massive star explodes and can potentially create a black hole. This is an alternate route to black hole formation, as we often focus on star collapse in school.","237":"And as these two supermassive black holes get closer, they could potentially interact and influence each other's magnetic fields, leading to a buildup or release of energy on a scale we can hardly imagine.","238":"That's a fascinating perspective! Black holes are indeed complex celestial objects. They not only have the potential to destroy, but also to shape and form galaxies, and possibly even contribute to the creation of life. It's a testament to their intricate nature and the mysteries they hold.","239":"Indeed, the training time can vary significantly based on the intricacy of your model and the size of your dataset. The larger the dataset, the more time it takes for the network to learn, due to the increased number of iterations required.","240":"In a quantum computer, we don't use classical bits (0s and 1s) like in a classical computer. Instead, we use quantum bits (qubits) that can exist in multiple states at once due to a property called superposition. This allows for a significant increase in the number of computations that can be performed simultaneously compared to classical computers. We manipulate the quantum state of a device, such as changing the magnetization to be pointing up or down. In some cases, we can even have a superposition of both up and down states.","241":"Yeah, that's a great question! It's like having a coin that can be both heads and tails at the same time, until we measure it and it collapses into one state. This is essentially how our quantum computers work.","242":"To encode information, we use a process called quantum state preparation. In a superconducting quantum computer, we initialize the qubits to a specific state, usually the ground state, using microwave pulses. We then manipulate the qubits using microwave signals to represent the desired information as a superposition of 0 and 1.","243":"Currently, the algorithms we know of to achieve deterministic results on a quantum computer require millions of error-corrected qubits, which is beyond our current technological capabilities. We're only able to maintain around 50 error-corrected qubits at the moment. It's fascinating that we've managed to reach this point, and there are indeed tasks that we believe will be faster to perform on a quantum computer. However, we'll also discover new possibilities just by having a quantum computer.","244":"The algorithms for near-term quantum computers are designed to work with the limitations of existing noisy devices.

This process can be recursive, meaning that if a tree splits into smaller trees, those smaller trees can also split further. It's akin to a tree growing more branches, and it can be quite complex.","249":"You'd be writing code to create patterns based on recursive mathematical equations, which are the essence of fractals.","250":"That's a valid point, Jen. It's frustrating when we can't customize our network equipment to better suit our needs.

Gravitational waves are ripples in the fabric of spacetime that propagate as waves, and they were first directly observed by the LIGO instrument.","272":"Because gravitational waves are produced by the immense violent collision of massive objects such as black holes, we can infer that it is a black hole merger that is creating this gravitational wave. The wave propagates out from the source, losing energy as it travels and getting weaker over time. When it reaches Earth, it's still too weak to have any noticeable effect on Earth or its inhabitants.
