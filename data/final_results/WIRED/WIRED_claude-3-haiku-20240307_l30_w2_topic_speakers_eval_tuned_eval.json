nice emotional device when it come to harmony is just thinking about how to arrive somewhere. You know, it can be so sparse, it can be so rich, and it can be really emotional. So this idea of the overtone and the undertone in the harmonic series, how much do you know about this?","1":"Yeah. The amazing thing about harmony is that it exists in nature. So, take the harmonic series of the note F, for example. Okay. You have the ups on the fifth and the fourth and then the, (hums) That seemed a little bit sharp, but that's fine. And then tones get increasingly small. Beneath that note, you have the undertone series, which essentially is like a reflection of something. In the same way that when a tree grows in nature, you have the branches which grow upwards and the roots which go downwards. So it's quite a nice thing to thing about, this being the key center, the floor, the ground, and then these two different directions of ways in which it can express itself, and the differences in the sensations with that. Lots of the time I think when it comes to reharmonization or harmonization, people think that the solution to the problems come when we add more notes.","2":"I think that people forget that you can work with the notes you already have by just rearranging them, just the simple idea of inversion, inversion of the simple triad, of F major. \u266aI once was lost and now I'm found \u266a \u266a Was blind \u266a \u266a But now I see \u266a Now how home do I want to go here, you know? Is there another verse to come?","3":"Because I can delay the gratification of going home. First of all, just by using inversions, even before we add the notes to the chord. One thing that I was very joyful to discover is that every single melody note works with every single base note.","4":"F major, F minor, D flat major seven G flat diminished, G flat minor major seven, G minor seven, G soft, G seven, G seven sharp 11. And then, G seven with a flat 13","5":"That's it! (laughs) A flat soft, A flat major seven. A flat major seven sharp five, with a sharp 11. Essentially, what that demonstrates is that every note and every base note are compatible. So once we realize this its like, that's great! Now what should we do? What, how, what should we, what should we, how, what am I supposed to do? What to do, right. And sometimes the paralyzing thing when it comes to arranging, there are too many options, too many things are possible. So that's when it becomes super, super important to be aware of what you wanna try and say emotionally.","6":"Exactly, yeah. No, for sure. And, you know, F major can be something you arrive in from, if you arrive in F major from D flat, then it's like the sun's come up.","7":"So, there's a lot about context, I think. Once you have a language, it's about using it and applying it in those emotional ways. I think that's what makes the difference.","8":"Generally in five levels, level five is the ultimate master, the person that's played the game 20, 30 years, has the highest pedigree. Actually, that's you in this case, and we're still on level four because computers have been better than humans at chess for like 30 years. How has it changed the way you approach the game?","9":"So I've never thought of chess that way. This is very interesting to me. So of those three, what would you say is the one that you have more mastery over than the other?","10":"I think G6 is Leningrad. I've tried to find a name. I don't actually know the name of this one. I guess there's also like the Stonewall, right? You can play.","11":"I play like a lot of openings poorly. That's my approach to chess. I just play things that I think will be fun. Then the game starts going, and I'm like, Why did I play this? I should learn real openings. Okay, I guess I'll... Yeah, this is nice and boring.","12":"Yes. Well, actually, it's not a good thing. I would've preferred that it might, you know, it might hang, but oh, we only have like 90 seconds. We have to make conversation and also play some semi-decent moves.","13":"You are the eight-time United States women's chess champion. You also have the highest title in all of chess grandmaster. I'm an eternal runner up. Like what is the championship mentality, and how have you succeeded at it so many times?","14":"in some way. But there are differences, right? If I asked you to move through space, you could do it freely, right? Can you get up? And let's see how easy it is to move through space. Can you move over to that location? And can you come back? Anything getting in your way? Easy to do?","15":"If I were to ask you to sit perfectly still in space, can you do that? I mean, hold perfectly still. That's good. But if I ask you to hold still in time, to not go to the next second or the next second, can you do that?","16":"He does have crazy hair, and I think I'm maybe heading in that direction actually.He showed us an approach to travel to the future. You want me to tell you how you do it?","17":"You build a spaceship. You go out into space really quickly. You turn around and you come back to planet Earth, and he showed us that when you're on that ship, your clock will tick off time more slowly. You will age more slowly. So that journey may only take you, say, a year, six months out and six months back, but you know what? When you step out of the ship, it'll be 100 years into the future or 1,000 years, a million years into the future. Would you do that if you could?","18":"No, you'd be alive, that's the amazing thing. I'd be dead. Everybody else would be dead who stayed on earth, but your body would only age one year, and yet it would be 1,000 years into the future. The question though is, could you get back? And I don't know the answer to that, nobody does. We don't know if you can travel back, but we certainly know that you can travel forward.","19":"I don't think so. That same guy with the crazy hair, Albert Einstein, showed that there's actually a limit to how fast things can go. And you know what the limit is? The limit is the speed of light, because light travels 671 million miles per hour, that is fast enough to go around the entire earth seven times in one second. So if we could build a spaceship that would go as fast as light, we'd be able to do what Einstein noted. There's something else that's really curious about time. Things tend to go in one direction, and we call it the arrow of time. It sort of points from the past into what we call the future. If you're to ask me why is there an arrow to time, ask me.","20":"Maybe, that's absolutely right. I think it's unlikely we'll learn how to travel to the past, but it's not been ruled out. That's kind of exciting that it's still at least an open possibility.","21":"So and a musician, how much of it do you think is in your hands versus in your brains? Meaning like, you do have connections in your muscles from the nerves that are from your spinal cord, what if some of the learning is there?","22":"Yeah, again, we don't know exactly where X, Y, Z, zero is, we're assuming that it's something, you know, the X-rays that are coming out are very close to the event horizon of the black hole, but this is still, you know, your realm of X-rays, to really figure out those kinds of things. But once the X-rays, once the photons hit the corona, and are re-scattered, and up, energized, and then they start illuminating the accretion disk, it heats it up, and so just by the light travel time, when the optical, if it gets, you know, brighter and fainter, and then the infrared gets brighter and fainter, two weeks later, then the dust is two light weeks away from that. So it's a one dimensional one, so we're averaging, so we don't get the two dimensional, or even three dimensional one. And then we've done it now, of course, we have better telescopes, there was a project where you could do it with the Hubble Space Telescope and the ultraviolet, you used the Swift Observatory, which had optical and ultraviolet, and then from ground base, we did optical, and then from space we did it with Spitzer and the infrared. So you could actually see this bright flash go off in a nearby AGN called NGC5548, and then you see it propagate as it warms up the disk, as all that light is falling onto it, and then eventually you hit the, the, further away, where the dust is, and the dust tends to radiate in an infrared. So we got basically a structure, and you just, you see this flashbulb go off, and then it illuminates, effectively, the structure.","23":"So you do see it, basically the dust sublimation radius, and you see it at, and it tells you, depending on what kind of dust it is, and it's actually one of the problems for me studying, whenever we try and do X-ray studies of low luminosity active galactic nuclei in your, by galaxies, because there're all these X-ray binaries that are also emitting X-rays, which make our lives difficult. But they're also in black holes, when it's this really interesting sort of both, it's great, but ugh, it's also a source of noise for those of us who are trying to do X-ray observations of nearby galaxies.","24":"It's a weird thing to be sitting in your own galaxy, but not be able to separate all these, four million solar mass black hole creating, next to, how massive, it's like two to three solar masses for the X-ray binaries?","25":"Which was one idea, but again, it's, I'll leave this to your theoreticians, I think there are problems with that, as well. I call it job security. That's right. (both laugh) We have a lot of things about black holes, both in terms of their formation, or even how they exist as they are, and how they're interacting with their environment that we're still not understanding.","26":"Now, in some sense that's kind of trivial to you and me, because of course you have space, which is three dimensional, you have time which is one dimensional, so spacetime is four dimensional. But it didn't turn out, it didn't occur to anyone that that was a sensible way to talk until really relativity. This is the crucial thing, right? Is that what Einstein realized is that sure there's both time and space, but how we divide spacetime into time and space can be different for different people, and really there's a real sense in which four dimensional spacetime is kind of a generalization of three dimensional space. And I think to really explain this we're gonna need a blackboard.","27":"Let's bring one in. All right. The thing about relativity is that they really want you to think of spacetime as one four dimensional thing, right? It's kind of like space. It's not just three dimensions of space and one dimension of time.","28":"Why? This is a very good question. So, let's just start with space, right? We know a little bit about space. So here's my simple minded way of drawing space two dimensions, because that's how many I can draw on the blackboard. Let's say X and Y. And what is special about space, there's many things, but one is that if I have a curve or a path between two points, there's a distance that you can calculate, right? And the distance between those two points doesn't depend on your coordinates. It doesn't depend on whether you're in radial coordinates or Cartesian coordinates, or whatever. I'm allowed to imagine a curve that does something like this between those two points, and if I were a person walking on that curve, I would have an odometer with me maybe, and I would know, you would know, even without having done that, this path is always gonna be longer than that path. There's a formula, Pythagoras' Theorem that tells you what the shortest distance path is. That's the point. The physical-ness of what is real is the distance along a certain curve. So spacetime is like that. That's why it is useful to think about spacetime.","29":"So let me draw spacetime. Here's how we usually draw it. I'll just say X, but all of space is condensed in this one direction, and this is time, okay? So if you're a little person and you started some event, so you start, you're located somewhere in space, somewhere in the three coordinates of space, and whether you like it or not, you're moving through spacetime just by getting older.","30":"When people ask me can you travel through time? I say yes, yesterday I traveled 24 hours into the future and here I am, a day later. So that's just this. Okay, you're moving through time, like it or not. So what Einstein says is look, I can travel through spacetime in different ways, like I could hop in a rocket ship and fly out and then fly back, and then I could meet you there. So this is a different trajectory through spacetime, right?","31":"And it's almost exactly like the space story. The space story says there's a distance, distance is different along different curves. Einstein says there's something that measures the length of these curves, and we call it the proper time. It is literally the time that you would read on your wristwatch.","32":"Well kind of. What Einstein wants to get across is there's no such thing as fundamental, like there's the universe's time, this big letter T that might tell you how old the universe is, but then every individual has a clock with them, and they measure their own time depending on how they're moving through the universe.","33":"There is what we call a metric on spacetime, and when we talk about Euclidean space versus a curved space, versus a sphere or something, that's a different metric. And spacetime has its own metric which says the following thing, that the path between two events in spacetime that is a straight line, will always be the longest time.","34":"So when Einstein had this idea, oh gravity could be related to the curvature of spacetime, he did some equations, so he got it, that's a long story, we'll put that aside. What he figured out was that rather than gravity living on top of spacetime, it's a manifestation of the curvature of spacetime so when you have like the earth, the sun, the moon, they cause a gravitational field, they're actually warping the spacetime around them. They're giving it a different geometry.","35":"Yeah, exactly. If you had a sheet that was originally flat, and you set a marble on it, it would go in a straight line, but then if you put something on it so it warps it, that marble is now gonna be deflected.","36":"Yeah, that's right. And it goes exactly back to what we drew on the board where how those two people in the train and on the ground would divide spacetime up differently to space and time.","37":"A baby ant? Very good. So I have over here a meter stick, let me show it to you. And so that's a meter and if I divide it by 1000, I get a millimeter. So milli just means 1000. There's all these little lines on the ruler. And each of those little lines is one millimeter. So a baby ant is probably a couple of millimeters. So even the thing, that's the smallest thing you can think of, it's a million times bigger than a nanometer. Tiny, tiny, tiny.","38":"If I took this stick and I was to draw 1 billion lines, the distance between those two lines would be one nanometer. So that's really all it is. It's just a measure of size. But it's really, really, really tiny, smaller than anything that we can see with our eyes. The reason why, in nanotechnology, scientists, we care about things that are that small, is because there are objects called atoms. Have you ever heard of atoms before?","39":"That was a perfect explanation. But what if I told you that scientists invented a special type of microscope that not only lets you see atoms, but also lets you move them around and build things with them. Would you think that would be pretty cool?","40":"So it's called a scanning tunneling microscope. And not only can you see the atoms, but you can move them around. Atoms are kind of sticky. You can actually build things using this instrument with actual individual atoms. So if I gave you that machine, would you want to make something? Would you want to look at something very carefully?","41":"I study it because objects that are that small have really interesting properties. They behave completely different than objects that are big. And because of that, we can build really cool things with them. Like really fast computers, for example, or new types of batteries or new types of solar cells. And a lot of nanotechnology is kind of like playing with Legos. You take these small objects and you put them together to build something new. Something interesting that no one's built before. It's like Legos for scientists.","42":"We're gonna have to create entire new concepts of how they do trade and how they work with us, too. What kind of barriers or road blocks would you imagine are gonna happen in the blockchain space?","43":"Yeah. One of the problems that Bitcoin has faced is Bitcoins getting stolen or lost. But a lot of that actually comes from people trying to recentralize Bitcoin in different ways making themselves actually a pretty easy target.","44":"Yeah. To actually transition into the mainstream and make it useful for average people to use, we're going to need to make sure we have a lot more education, a lot more standards and probably work with a lot of enterprises to create sort of a user experience around this being a technology that is safe and usable and understandable. What is the current state of blockchain in your understanding? What's gonna have to happen next?","45":"These are the building blocks of many, many origami deployable shapes, it's called a degree-4 vertex. It's the number of lines. So in this case, we use solid lines for mountain, we use dash lines for valley. We're going to fold it and use these two to illustrate some important properties of origami mechanisms. It's important in the study of mechanisms to take into account the rigidity. So what we're going to do to help simulate rigidity is to take these rectangles and we're going to fold them over and over so that they just become stiff and rigid.","46":"So this is what's called a single degree of freedom mechanism. You have one degree of freedom, I can choose this fold, and then if these are perfectly rigid every other fold angle is fully determined. One of the key behaviors here is that with the smaller angles up here, the two folds that are the same parity and the folds that are of opposite parity move at about the same rate but with this, as we're getting closer to 90 degrees, we find they move at very different rates and then at the end of the motion, the opposite happens. This one is almost folded but this one goes through a much larger motion so the relative speeds differ.","47":"So when we start sticking together vertices like this, if they're individually single degree of freedom then we can make very large mechanisms that open and close but with just one degree of freedom. So, these are examples of a pattern called the Miura-Ori. When you stretch them out they're pretty big.","48":"Yeah, so typically the mechanism will run from corner to corner, to diagonally to opposite corners because then you can stretch it out that way. Notice some differences between the one you have and the one I have in how this one sort of opens out almost evenly but this one opens out more one way and then the other.","49":"And it's exactly the difference between the motions of these two vertices. So these angles are closer to right angles and the closer you get to a right angle the more asymmetry there is between the two directions of motion. And then the other difference is how efficiently they pack, so these started at about the same size but when they're flat notice that yours is much more compact. So if I were you making a solar array, I'd say, oh, I want that one. But if I say, well, I want them to open at the same rate, then I want this one.","50":"There's an engineering trade-off to get them both to work. And there's another place that shows up in deployable structures in a very cool structure. This is a folded tube, it sort of pops out like this but it has this neat property that if you twist it quickly, it changes color. There's a Mars Rover application where they need a sleeve that protects a drill and as the drill goes down, the sleeve is going to collapse and they're using a pattern very much like this.","51":"There are many open mathematical questions and so room for mathematicians, like yourself, to have a big impact on the world of origami and mechanisms. And even though those studies are mathematically interesting, they're going to also have real-world applications in space, solar arrays, drills, telescopes, and more. Any questions or thoughts about this?","52":"You try, we all gotta try. You've probably heard about sleep as this kind of, you know, it's a biological process that happens in your brain. It's really important for your body, but it's a lot more complex than that. Sleep is made up of different parts. You know, when you think about sleep, what do you think about?","53":"So our sleep is made up of different types, okay? The first one is called non-rapid eye movement sleep, or non-REM, okay? Or NREM. And then the other one, which might not be a surprise, is called REM. Rapid eye movement sleep. And those are the two main types of sleep that happen. The way that we measure that as a sleep scientist is that we'll actually bring people into the lab where they can do this at home, where we put electrodes on their scalp while they're sleeping, and that allows us to measure the brain activity that's going on during the night.","54":"When we measure all of that, we're able to see how much time someone's asleep, and how many times they wake up and stuff during the night. You know, we're also really interested in kind of, the amount of non-REM sleep someone gets and the amount of REM sleep that someone gets, because each part of those types of sleep do different things for the body. And so it's important to get both of those. And so within non-REM sleep, there are three stages ranging from N-1 to N-2 to N-3. So not particularly clever in our naming, but that's how we know what stages they are. And what they do is it moves from lightest to deepest sleep, okay? N-1, it's more kind of light, wakefulness sleep, kind of in and out of sleeping. Then you go into N-2, which is where we spend 45 to 55 percent of our sleep. And it's more this kind of light sleep, but then we get into kind of the really restorative sleep, and that's N-3. And in N-3, when we look at someone's EEG wave, we see these big slow waves, and it's called slow wave sleep. And so we spend about 20% of our sleep in slow wave sleep, though it can vary on a day to day.","55":"You know, some of that is totally accurate, that like when your brain's more engaged by being on your phone or doing things that you really enjoy or things that stress you out or any of those types of things, it's harder to get to sleep and to kind of fall into that deeper levels of sleep. Most of the REM sleep, this dreaming sleep, happens in the second half of the night.","56":"Okay? So we wake up a lot during the night, and we just don't remember it. And you'll go back down into deep sleep, and then up again into REM, you know, in kinda these cycles.","57":"Okay. Usually we want to keep naps, like 20 to 30 minutes. When people drop into deep sleep, and then they're woken up out of a nap, most people report that they feel way worse than they did before they took the nap, and that's because you've been in deep sleep, and it's this term called sleep inertia. So what are the stages of sleep?","58":"The way our sun generates energy is by fusion reactions. It fuses hydrogen, the lightest element we know about, into helium, and that gets fused into heavier and heavier elements. So here on earth we're going to take some special kinds of hydrogen, a special flavor of it if you will, which we call an isotope. And we're going to combine them to create new particles. And we can only get that combination of particles to happen if they are in a plasma. What's your favorite exhibit at the science museum?","59":"Absolutely, we take the gas, and we add heat, and we get a plasma. And a plasma is a state of matter where you have an ionized gas. If we break down that gas, and we add enough energy to ionize it, where you can take the electrons and the ions and the atom and separate them, and now there's this soup of charged particles that are moving around, that's the plasma. And it is what creates the beautiful light in lightning. So you've already seen a plasma in fact. So I'm gonna show you this fun demonstration. You've probably seen one of these before, right?","60":"Yeah. So the way this is happening is this glass ball here is a container for our plasma. And we've taken most of the air out of the container, so there's not a lot of particles inside the glass ball, and very, very low temperature plasma. So it's continuously ionizing and then recombining, and becoming neutral again. And we see those energy transitions as the visible light. So if we're gonna put this plasma to use and do something helpful with it, like maybe make some clean electricity, we would have to control it. And another word for controlling it is confining it. So let me turn this off and set it back down. You're probably wondering what is this thing on this table? It's a model of a tokamak, and that's the name of a device that I work on with the goal of creating clean energy. Have you played with magnets in school?","61":"This is all very important to sort of understand how we would create a container that would let us hold a plasma in place and control it. Have you ever played around with an electromagnet in class? It's a coil of wire, much like this big red coil of wire right here. And when we push an electrical current through this wire, it creates a magnetic field that goes around the wire perpendicular. So if you want to know the direction of the magnetic field that's being created by pushing the current through the wire, put your thumb in the direction of the current and then curl your fingers like this. Yeah, and that's the right hand rule. So if we push the current this way we're creating a magnetic field in this perpendicular direction. So if I drive a current in this red wire like this, which direction will the magnetic field go?","62":"Exactly, yeah, the long way, perpendicular. Now this is a bit of a trickier one. The blue wire is gonna act like a transformer action. And so by changing the current in the blue coil, we are going to be able to run a current in this direction around the tokamak. And now think back to how the wires worked. If I have a current going like this, where's the magnetic field?","63":"Exactly, back this way, the short way around the tokamak. We can now put together the pieces and understand the three magnetic fields that we need to confine a plasma in our tokamak. So our plasma will be inside this vessel in the shape of a donut.","64":"So we are trying to bring a star to earth. We are not going to be using hydrogen the way our star in our solar system, our sun, uses hydrogen to make helium and generates fusion energy that way. Instead on earth we're gonna be using isotopes of hydrogen, deuterium and tritium. What do you know about charged particles? If I want to try and push two positively charged particles together, two protons together, what do you think is gonna happen?","65":"So that's very, very hot temperature. But the other thing we need is a lot of particles. That's the density. We are able to combine a deuteron and a triton in a fusion reaction at lower temperatures, at lower energies than other fuel. And this has to do with some very nice properties of the deuteron and the triton that when we get them close enough to one another to fuse, there's actually a resonance which is predicted by quantum mechanics, and that really helps have a little bump up in the cross section for the deuterium-tritium fusion reaction.","66":"Yes, exactly, exactly. That little bump up is good for us. Because it means that we have a higher probability of getting the deuterium and the tritium to fuse than otherwise at those manageable temperatures. And when we say manageable, for fusion scientists, yeah, 50 million, a hundred million, 150 million Celsius.","67":"We've come so far in the study of magnetically confined plasmas, which is what I work on, that we sort of tamed all the other types of major instabilities that would cause loss of the plasma. So you might be asking yourself what is the energy that's coming out of the fusion reaction? So we've got the deuteron and we've got the triton, and so they combine in a fusion reaction, and that produces a neutron and a helium nucleus. But the neutron doesn't have any charge.","68":"Exactly. So it comes right out. And it's the kinetic energy of the neutron. And we want it to interact with our overall energy system. And as it interacts with that material, it heats the material up. It transfers its kinetic energy to this material. Take that thermal energy and run a turbine, run a generator, and convert it into electricity. So once you get to that stage, it starts to look a lot like any other thermal power plant. Whether it's fission or natural gas. So a fusion plant could basically be the plasma core coming in, setting it in place, and driving your thermal system to make electricity. We often call it an alpha particle. And that is a charged particle, right. So it's actually going to stay in the plasma. It's an energetic particle compared to the fuel. So it actually is going to give its kinetic energy back to the fuel via Coulomb collisions. So now they're good, now we like them.","69":"It turns out, for people that are between the ages of 18 and 65, the agreed upon amount of sleep that people should get is between seven and nine hours, and it's really at least seven hours per night, to maintain optimal health as an adult. So at least seven hours. When we look at across all of the data that is available on like sleep and health, and sleep and psychiatric illness and those types of things, the largest risk is when people get five hours or less. What do you think is responsible for driving how much sleep you need, and things like that?","70":"The first thing I want to show you is origami in the real world. This is the origami lamp. It comes shipped flat but it folds, clip holds it together. The lamp has LEDs on the inside so when we power it up we get light, we have a lampshade and we get the base.","71":"New problems arise when we try to make origami out of things other than paper, but also new opportunities. An example here which is a kind of a variant of the Miura-Ori. It's got a three-dimensional structure. If I stretch it one way, it expands the other but because it has these S-bends in the pattern, if you squeeze it, it doesn't go all the way flat. This is a epoxy impregnated aramid fiber and so if I put this fold pattern into it and then compress it and then put a skin on the top and bottom, this becomes incredibly lightweight but incredibly strong.","72":"Another origami challenge that comes up with these patterns is if we're going to make an aircraft out of this thing we're going to need hundreds of yards of folded origami. We're not going to do it by hand and this might be the new frontier in origami engineering, which is the design of machines that can fold patterns that have applications.","73":"It's something we've talked about a little bit that with all the richness of behavior of origami from a flat sheet, it seems like there ought to be an equally rich world of things that don't start flat but are still made from flat sheets of paper.","74":"It will develop. It will take five years. It will take 10 years. That kind of time is necessary. One of the areas that brought me to supply chain research is the fact that we're not just gonna see blockchain emerge. We're gonna see artificial intelligence continue to evolve. We're gonna see connective devices and this sort of growing internet of things and machinery that can do a lot more and have a wallet and transact on their own. And so I actually think a lot of where blockchain and other technologies are headed is this interesting synergy that will help us elevate the kinds of institutions we've used in the past and cobbled together to create that identifiable, verifiable trust.","75":"In that it's hard to compare it to some perfect future. Just like you compare autonomous vehicles to this very high standard because machines are doing it. It should be perfect. There should be zero car deaths.","76":"When you say, well, there's hundreds of thousands, millions of car deaths on the road due to human error today. I think we're in a similar place. We're going to see problems with this technology, and we are going to need to develop multiple kinds of standards that also have some flexibility. But it's going to also be a version, a system, that allows us to fix some of the things that are broken today.","77":"All right, you're in the wrong place. [laughs] We're not gonna be talking about biology or computer science. So we wanna talk about the idea of dimensions. Do you know what dimension is? How we would define dimensions?","78":"Right, you know the difference between like one dimension two dimensions, three dimensions, et cetera. So let's do a little experiment here. So there's one dimension. I'll give that to you. Now, here's your task. I'm going to give you another dimension, and I'm gonna ask hold those two things at right angles to each other. It's easy to do. Yeah, so there's no trick here.","79":"I'm not trying to fool you here. Okay. Now this is going to be slightly trickier. I'm going to give you this. I want you to hold all three of them at right angles to all the others at the same time.","80":"There you go. So what that's doing is when you had just two that was describing a two dimensional plane, right? Like the two things pick out a plane, the three things pick out all three dimensional space. I'm gonna give you one more, and I'm gonna ask you to hold that fourth one so that it's at a right angle to all the other three at the same time.","81":"All right, now I am tricking you. It can't be done. Yeah. Right? You can't do it. So we just experimentally proved that space is three dimensional. That's sort of what it means to be three dimensional, that there are three different directions you can move in and there's not four or five or six directions you can move in.","82":"Well, we could also say how far we are away from the center, just the distance. And then the angle that our little line makes with let's say the X axis.","83":"So that's a different way of giving you two numbers and locating yourself, and we call those polar coordinates. It's a different coordinate system. What we want to do as physicists is look for extra dimensions. Can you imagine, can you think of any way that there could be extra dimensions?","84":"Time. Yes, Einstein said that we can think of time as a fourth dimension, and that's a very fascinating thing that we could talk about all by itself. But what about space? What about the solar system? Like, if you wanted to tell me where a certain star was in the sky, do you know how we do that?","85":"So you can define something as, well you know, how high above a certain location on earth it is, but the earth is rotating and revolving around the sun so we have to define separate celestial coordinates.","86":"We don't know. You know, the optimistic view is that there are six, but the thing is, some of them might be really, really, really, really, really small, like way too small for us to ever see.","87":"You know, honestly out there, if you go out onto campus and talk to the physicists, half of them will say probably extra dimensions exist, and half of them say no, that's just nonsense.","88":"That was, it was like, oh, wow, this might be it, and then, but very early on, it was, as I just started my, it was basically my second year of graduate school, it was like, uh, this is not that simple.","89":"You know, everybody's been just coming at it from different wavelengths at the optical infrared, and, but definitely the X-rays has been one of those things where it's like, oh, finally.","90":"It does seem to be that it may not even, in parts, it may not be even connected to this tiny, little torus at all because part of the work that I did, and others have done, is that type twos preferentially live in different kinds of galaxies than type ones, which should not in any way have to do with something such a small scale. They tend to be in smaller bulged, SB and SC type spiral galaxies. So there's something also having to do with environment that gets you to be a type two, and you can still maybe, timing wise, but there's something else that's going on on a larger scale because the type of the AGN should not really correspond to the host galaxy, but it seems to. And that was one of the things that we were finding out, and that was one of the early little ideas that the, individually, just as the torus model, the unified model, can't explain everything that we were observing at the time. But it is one of those things that it's, they're super luminous, they're all over the place, and we don't have a really good picture of it, which makes it exciting to study.","91":"This is where it gets really crazy. Could we simulate that map inside a computer and would that computer then be thinking like that original brain from which we made the map?","92":"Huh. It would be like if you simulated a hurricane. Imagine we could keep track of every variable of a hurricane. Ever. Wind speed, every water molecule, et cetera, et cetera. Temperature. And we put that inside a super-fast computer and we simulated it, right? I don't think anyone would think that the inside of the computer would get wet. Even though we had simulated the hurricane perfectly, that wetness is consciousness, it's what we are. Is it ethical to imagine mapping a male brain versus a female brain to look for differences between those, to explain alleged behavioral differences between them?","93":"With something like Maia, do you think it's possible to develop some sort of accurate measure? Let's say I'm a 1,200, I have an opening course. I just wanna practice my opening. Can I do it some way against Maia or-","94":"Onto to E5 on the third move is the most challenging move against the Caro-Kann. It restricts the knight and the main line. So the move is bringing out the bishop, Bringing out the bishop. so you don't get locked. I play that move, but the move that I also added to my toolbox and is the only move I teach now is this move to try to undermine the center. It's not commonly played at the highest level. If you study master games, this is probably one in every six games or something compared to, right? So now we go down a totally different path. We're taking a totally different train to our destination, but just this undermining of the position, you know, splitting up these pawns and then slowly capturing them both, that does wonders at intermediate and early advanced level. This move, despite it being move three, according to databases, already gives black like a 53% chance of winning, which is crazy because normally white is about 52%, right? White just doesn't know what to do about this move.","95":"A lot of people will see you as somebody who's drank in harmony their whole life. They've seen so much harmony, heard so much harmony. How do you make the choices, there's so much that's possible when you know stuff. How do you have the courage to make a choice?","96":"Yeah, yeah, yeah. I find it fascinating in music to think about, you know, say I arrive in a place, if I'm going, say I'm going to D flat major. And there's something you once taught me. You taught me this song Don't Follow the Crowd.","97":"'Cause, you know, I just wouldn't think to use that chord in that situation. And there it was! And, you know, if you read the rule book, it's, that not in it.","98":"Something like that. And that's not 'cause like emotionally, it's almost like I'm here, I'm arriving here. But, if the base note is the same, it's like this inevitability about it, it's like I was there all along.","99":"Yeah, yeah. It's like one thing is moving in one direction and one thing has arrived, so it's this tension and it's glorious. I love thinking about these things emotionally, just because that's a feeling, I know that feeling in my life.","100":"And so, we could play a bit of that if you want to. And we could talk about some stuff. I've been doing it in F. (keyboards playing Amazing Grace) (laughing) Thanks Herbie, that was a trip.","101":"Yeah, it's crazy. They're really a lot of bad or malicious hackers out there who are doing just that. They're going into people's accounts and they're stealing money, but there's also another side of computer hacking where there are people who are trying to learn how those bad hackers are actually breaking in to the bank accounts.","102":"Yeah, exactly. They're looking for ways that they can create protection. It's kind of like the lock on your front door. That lock is to essentially prevent bad people from coming in or people accidentally coming in when they shouldn't. A hacker is essentially looking at a way, how can I get into this lock? But then there are the good ones who are trying to unlock it so that they can tell the company that made the lock, hey, we can actually protect people by making the lock a little harder.","103":"In many cases, they'll send them a new lock. So it's an upgraded, better version. Sometimes that's new features, but sometimes that's bug fixes and ways to protect you as well.","104":"That's a very good point. You should definitely make sure that you're obeying the law. They might work with the lock company and say, I'm trying to improve your product. And they're trying to find these holes or problems, and then share that with the company. Even though the good hacker is doing exactly the same thing as the bad hacker, it's the same exact skillset, and you're using the same exact techniques and information to try to break that lock, but your goal as a good hacker is really to help everyone like you and me to make sure that our stuff is protected. So hopefully they don't get in trouble because they're the good guys.","105":"I started going on the computer and playing video games, but I had some ideas of my own, and that's where I started to learn how to hack. I wanted to play with my friends on this video game and just change the way that things look.","106":"That's entirely possible. They may have done it for a reason, but you may have come up with a really good idea that, do you think there are other people who might like the idea that you came up with?","107":"When you have creative ideas like that, hacking can actually allow you to change the way a system works, and that means you can change a game and how the game is played, and then you can share that with your friends and other people who like that game. Once I started learning how to do it, I found that, things that were harder for me, I could make easier.","108":"You know an interesting topic is: what are the limits to what we can do with virtual reality? Where I'm pretty pleased with what we have today. What we can show people and say virtual reality, its cool. People get an amazing response from it. But we're still clearly a very, very long ways from reality.","109":"Good to see you Mike, nice to have you here with me. So we go way back. 1991, the year I got married, I moved across the country, left my husband in New Jersey, to work with you in Livermore.","110":"And I've been talking sort of, started with sort of what is a laser through linear optics, non linear optics, high intensity laser physics, and saying that you know, we're trying to get to that Schwinger limit of 10 to the 29 watts per square centimeter. We're about somewhere just shy of 10 to the 23 I think at this point. But even if we get to 100 petawatts and focus that down to a wavelength, we're not at 10 to the 29. So you're hoping to build the biggest laser.","111":"Or we need, going around and giving my talks now, I show how we're plateauing. I showed how there was a plateau, CPA raises it up, but we're sort of starting to plateau again and we need another Nobel Prize winning idea. And so do you think it's on the horizon? Do you see anything out there that really says, oh yeah that's a good way to go? 'Cos we're gonna have to get out to the x-rays right? We can't stay in the visual.","112":"Okay so there's a lot of us working around the world on these high intensity lasers and so, what do you think the real fun is? What do you see the real excitement being?","113":"So it is amazing, the parallels. And optics is used everywhere. We're gonna possibly take over from CERN, we'll just do high energy physics with lasers, we're looking at gravity waves with lasers, we wanna do black holes with lasers, we wanna machine with lasers, we wanna do medicine with lasers. It's everywhere. And now, with the Nobel prize, people are hearing more about it so they know lasers are everywhere.","114":"Nowadays there's a lot of concerns around some applications of machine learning like deep fakes where it can kind of learn how I talk and learn how you talk and even how we look, and generate videos of us. We're doing this for real, but you could imagine a computer synthesizing this conversation eventually.","115":"So we've been talking about gravity from Newton and celestial bodies, the Earth, the Moon, pulling on each other in the conventional sense of gravity being an attractive force, to the Earth creating curves in space-time, then we moved on to just diffused seas of energy and space-time as the real universe and gravitation is really just talking about space-time in general, and here we are, and you're really hardcore in theoretical physics. Where would you take the exposition of gravity from that point?","116":"So when we think about quantum mechanics, we think about particles and their quantum charges in the Feynman way, the way that Feynman taught us. They come in and they exchange a force carrier and then they come out again, so that's how we think of an electron and light scattering, for instance, or something like that. And the language that Einstein gave us is so different. It's completely geometric, it's all this space-time. And it's also unnecessary.","117":"So when we're talking about the multiverse or the Big Bang, we are really talking about gravity ultimately, and we're talking about how a theory of gravitation which we know think of as a theory of space-time has a quantum explanation, has a quantum paradigm imposed on it that will help us understand these things, and we don't have that yet. One of the things that I think is so amazing is that the terrains in which we're going to understand quantum gravity are very few. It's the Big Bang, because that's where we know that quantum and gravity both were called into action. And there's black holes. One of the most interesting discoveries is of course Hawking's discovery, kick-started a kind of crisis, right? In thinking about why quantum mechanics and gravity were so knocking heads. It was one of the most beautiful examples.","118":"So this is a huge crisis 'cause either quantum mechanics is wrong, and as you described it, it's the most accurately-tested paradigm in the history of physics, how could it be wrong, right? Or the event horizon is letting information out and violating one of the most sacred principles of relativity.","119":"Yes, so one of the things I like to think of with holography is that I can pack a certain amount of information in a black hole. I mean, you can literally think of it as throwing things into it. So let's say I have information in some volume and I'm under the illusion that I can just keep packing information in that volume, as much as the volume will contain. Eventually I'll make a black hole and I'll find out that the maximum amount of information I can pack into anything in the entire universe is what I can pack on the area. And since area is projecting the illusion, maybe, of volume, maybe the whole world is just a hologram. It's not a principle that only applies to black holes. It's saying that, if this theory of quantum gravity is correct, then this while three-dimensionality is an utter illusion and really the universe is two-dimensional. That's crazy.","120":"Do you think it's possible that gravity is really ultimately just quantum mechanics and doesn't exist at all in the fundamental ways that we've been talking about so far, like the Newtonian way and the space-time way, that those are just these kind of macroscopic illusions? Sometimes I talk about it in terms of temperature. Temperature is not a thing. There is no single thing called temperature. It's a macroscopic illusion that comes from the collective behavior, really quantum behavior of random motions of atoms. And is it possible that the whole of gravity is some kind of emergent illusion from what's really quantum phenomenon underlying it?","121":"I mean, temperature is still great to talk about. It doesn't mean we shouldn't talk about temperature. I mean, we should absolutely adjust our thermostats and talk about temperature. But if we look at it closer and closer and closer, we realize there's not a thing in the world that has as a quantum value temperature, isolated. And so maybe there is no such thing as gravity isolated from quantum mechanics.","122":"So on code.org, one of the things you've been doing is actually building a game or that they have a game and then you can actually rewire some of the inputs and outputs of that. Is that right?","123":"Okay. With computer hacking, it's actually the same thing. Really, you have some sort of system and you have a bunch of inputs and you have some sort of output, and actually you, as the designer, you're essentially designing games and software. You're saying, well, I will only allow a user to really control these inputs. Can you think of any inputs the computer might have?","124":"Yep, there's also things like your mouse and there's even things like the microphone itself is actually an input device. It's taking something from you, which is the sound and it's then transmitting that, ad it's actually sending it to me. Are there any other things that you can talk to a computer? You can give it information.","125":"That's absolutely another input that exists on your computer. That's how I try to think of things is there's just a bunch of inputs. Often, if you're trying to break something or hack something, you're really saying, okay, how can I control these inputs in a way that wasn't necessarily expected?","126":"Typically, it's going to be something like the keyboard, right? I'm just going to be typing keystrokes to be talking to some piece of software or hardware, but other times it can be other things like even the temperature of a computer can actually affect how the computer operates, and it might be advantageous to me to cool down the computer and actually slow down the movement of electrons in something like memory, so that if a computer shuts off, it stores something that wasn't memory like a password and stores it for a long enough time that I might be able to actually extract it through some other methods.","127":"It just depends what you're trying to do. In some cases, it could literally be seconds because you already know how the system works, and other times, it could be years. So what have you learned about hacking?","128":"So have you spent any time thinking about this weird quality of the laws of physics, that there's no mathematical distinction in the laws between forward in time and backward in time? Is that something you're familiar with?","129":"Yeah, not only did we find that time changes with speed in special relativity, but we also found that time changes with gravity. Einstein showed that the rate at which a clock ticks slows down based upon the stronger gravitational field, or gravitational potential actually, that it is experiencing. I think you mentioned the Interstellar before.","130":"Do you remember the scene in Interstellar? They're going to a planet that's near a black hole. They go down to the planet, and they spend just a couple hours there, but when they go back to the ship, it's 23 years later on the ship because time is elapsing slowly near the strong gravitational field, comparatively quickly far away. And that's not science fiction, that's actually how time behaves.","131":"Okay. I just think of physics as the study of everything. What stuff is, what stuff does. So today we're gonna talk about space, and in particular the idea of dimensions. Have you heard about dimensions?","132":"But here's what I want you to think about. If I say I'm at this point on the line, I could translate that into saying I'm at the three centimeter point, if I were here I'd be at the four centimeter point, the five centimeter point, right?","133":"We need one number to tell you where we are. That's one dimension. That's what it means to be one dimensional. I only need to tell you one number to figure out where we are.","134":"So those are the dimensions. That's how we think about dimensions. Remember, we just needed one number to find ourselves on the line, we need two numbers to find ourselves on the plane.","135":"This is why physicists think about things we don't know about. We're wondering whether there could be extra dimensions you've never seen. Yeah. That are tinier than atoms. So, okay. So what have you learned? What do you know about dimensions now? How do you think about dimensions in a slightly different way than you did before?","136":"I think so. I think you're right. All right Hank, we want you to keep up studying, learn a lot of math and physics and help us discover new dimensions some day. Does that sound like a fun idea?","137":"I think to really get deep into nanomaterials and nanoscale devices, you really have to understand to some level, quantum mechanics. What it teaches us as we make these devices smaller and smaller, their properties begin to now depend on the size and the orientation of these devices. There are materials, and you're taking a 2D materials class, you know about this, that are intrinsically thin. As they're grown, as they're fabricated, they're already at the nanoscale and they possess these quantum confinement properties that as a nanotechnologist, you try to exploit. And so the first ones I wanted to talk to you about are quantum dots, have you heard of quantum dots before?","138":"So these are typically semiconductors. They can be cadmium selenide cadmium sulfide, zinc selenide and they're small clusters of atoms. They can be from 2 to 10 nanometers. What's interesting about these materials?","139":"That's correct. Yeah. Because of quantum confinement, once you get below this 15 nanometer range, the band gap of the material depends completely on the size of the material. So in bulk materials, if you want to change the band gap, you have to change the material, right? But in these quantum dots specifically, just by changing the size, you can change their band gap. And because their band gap is changing, their optical properties are different. And you can precisely tune the wavelength of light that they emit just by changing their size.","140":"The optical applications are in development. The science has really been worked out. The health stuff, because of all of the things you have to consider when you're putting something in someone's body is definitely further out there. For example, some of them are made from cadmium. Cadmium's toxic. You would never put that in someone's body. But there are other materials like gold and silver and titanium dioxide, which are less toxic and people are exploring using those. So have you learned about graphene?","141":"Carbon nanotube, right. So if you roll up graphene, depending on how you roll it and the angle, you roll it with, it has different properties. So if I roll it one way, it'll act like a metal. If I roll it a different way, it'll act like a semiconductor. The one that gets everyone most excited is that the electrons and holes move very fast through graphene. And so there's a lot of interest in using these for certain types of high-speed electronics. The other interesting application is because it's one atom thin, it's very sensitive to changes in the environment. And so there's a lot of interest in using them as diagnostics. It's on us researchers to find ways to A, control that process and then B, to actually build some sort of interesting technology from them.","142":"It's just pretty lights. [laughing] But now that you suggested it, these were inspired by the array of quantum dots that we showed earlier. So that's the story I'm going to stick with. [laughing] I like it.","143":"You know, you're right. When you read about some of these technologies, it does feel like science fiction. But the part of nanotechnology I wanted to talk to you about is stuff that you probably use every day, most of your day, all of the time. Can you guess what aspect of nanotechnology I'm gonna talk to you about?","144":"So this is a silicon wafer, and they're embedded in basically almost every object that you use, from a laptop, to a phone, to cars, television sets, appliances. We ended up cutting these into little squares and those repeating patterns, each of those is a processor. And those chips are what goes into all of these objects. What I want to talk to you about is how we got from where we started, and how we're able to actually fit 18 billion of these little devices in a little one inch by one inch area. They're called transistors. It's a switch. Very simply, think of it as a light switch that turns on and turns off using an electric field by applying a voltage.","145":"I went through my kid's Lego bins to build a very simple model of a transistor. And these are wired together in circuits so that you can do computation. You can do logic with them. Where nanotechnology comes into play, the way you double the number of transistors on a chip. Can you guess what you would have to do to this transistor?","146":"You have to make it smaller. Exactly. But here's the problem. So about 10 to 15 years ago, the devices got so small that if you shrunk them this gate, that actually turns it on and off loses its ability to control the channel. And so what they did, was they took devices like this into these things, we call them, FinFETs, kind of like a fin on a fish. So they're very thin transistors. The width of these fins is only six nanometers. Okay? So 6 nanometers is 25 to 30 atoms across. And they repeat this over the entire wafer just about perfectly. It's just a huge feat in engineering. But these types of devices are exactly the kind of devices that your phones and computers either have, or will have in the near future. And it's a way that nanotechnology is directly impacting you right now.","147":"Even if it is a human-made concept that the universe evolved, developed, changed through time, ultimately giving rise to galaxy, stars, planets, and on this particular planet, life. That conception of time gives a feel that it's like universal, that it's out there, it's the same for everybody. It's independent of our actions or activities. Do you know that Albert Einstein shattered that view of time? He found that if you and I, say, have identical wrist watches, I'm sitting still and I'm watching you move, I will find that your clock is taking off time more slowly than my clock. But you know what's really remarkable? You can figure out this quality of time if you know one fact, that the speed of light is constant. Have you ever heard that phrase?","148":"Yeah, if you're clever, you can use that with high school algebra, maybe even a little high school trigonometry to make it even easier, to derive that clocks take off time at different rate. Do you want me to show you how that goes?","149":"All right, so to figure out the effect of motion on time, I'm gonna use a really simple clock, it's called a light clock. It's two mirrors that are facing each other.","150":"It's much longer, right? This one's going tick-tock, tick. This is gonna go tick, tock. In fact, we can figure out the ratio. Let's consider time on the stationary clock compared to time on this moving clock. Well, that ratio is gonna be the ratio of the lengths. Then this would be given by D over L. More time on the stationary because it's longer distance on the moving clock. Well, this length over here, that's the same as this L over here, right? So we want D over L. Now, you may have recall that in trigonometry, there's a name for L over D. Sine of theta, opposite is L, hypotenuse is D, right? And so this ratio is just 1 over sine of theta. So if we can figure out 1 over sine theta, we'll have our beautiful formula for the ratio of time and the stationary clock to time on the moving clock, we just need one other fact. The speed of light along this diagonal is equal to what we call C. C equals speed of light. But in order for this ball of light to hit that point on the mirror, the component of the speed of light in the horizontal direction better be keeping perfect pace with the speed of the clock itself. So let's assume that this clock is moving in this direction with the speed equal to V. So C times cosine theta must be equal to the speed of the clock in motion. And from this, we learn that cosine theta is equal to V over C. There's another beautiful identity you may recall from your study of trigonometry, that sine-squared theta plus cosine-squared theta is equal to 1. This is really just a Pythagorean theorem in disguise. And from that, we can now solve for a sine-squared theta equals 1 minus V over C squared. And therefore sine theta is the square root of this. And now, we're basically done because we already had over here that this ratio is 1 over sine theta, which now is 1 over the square root of 1 minus V over C squared. So you see, as V gets very close to C, this gets very close to 1. 1 minus something very close to 1 is very close to 0. 1 over something close to 0 is huge, which means the ratio of time on the stationary to time on the moving, that can be a huge number as the speed of the moving clock approaches the speed of light. Now I did this for a light clock, but it's true for any clock, and this is what Einstein discovered in 1905 with his special theory of relativity.","151":"So where people are swiping credit cards, those credit card numbers were stolen. They hired a company to come in and perform a penetration test to see, can the good guys essentially break in again to prevent this sort of thing in the future? And when this team came in, they found they actually were able to get pretty much to the same point of sale system, and the way they did that was by exploiting an internet-connected deli meat scale. Once the company was able to essentially get into the deli scale, because the deli scale was on the internal network, then they were able to really escalate privilege and find a vulnerability within another system. Essentially, that just got them into the network. and once you're in the network, it's often really easy to then escalate from there.","152":"But what's really cool about that is, when you're going into memory, you're starting to cross over that boundary of that hundred byte allocation, and now you're starting to write over additional memory. That other memory is really important stuff. So you have your name, the hundred bytes there, and then right next to your name is the return address, and that's the address that the code is gonna execute and it's going to return to after that function is done, and it's going to jump to that address, but after you type your hundred bytes, the next few bites that you type, you're actually going to overwrite that return address. So that return address could essentially be another address in memory. So what you end up doing is you type a name and it's not really a name, it's really just code. And that code, you keep typing until you get to the return address, and you start typing an address, which is really the beginning of your name and your computer or your processor is actually going to read that address and it will jump back to the beginning and then execute that payload. So that was sort of the very first thing that I think was super exciting to me when I started learning about really reverse engineering.","153":"You brought up China and Iran, and something that's interesting about those areas is really censorship, right? They have essentially censored internet. In the US, we have a really interesting internal struggle here where we actually have government agencies like the state department that are funding software to evade censorship, like Tor and other mechanisms. While then we also have an internal struggle where we have other organizations like the NSA who are specifically looking to break that exact same system that the US government is also funding.","154":"Black holes are so amazing that when the neutron star stops and there's something actually there. There's material there. If it's so heavy it becomes a black hole, so it keeps falling, once the event horizon of the black hole forms, which is the shadow, the curve that's so strong that not even light can escape, the material keeps falling. And like you said, maybe space-time breaks down right at the center there, but whatever happens, the star's gone, that black hole is empty. So in a weird way black holes are a place and not a thing.","155":"[Janna] Yes, they ring space-time also like a drum, and you can record the sound of that ringing after a billion years, when it's traveled through the universe. But then the next thing that happens is those neutron stars collide, and because of this incredibly high energy state of matter, which you study, it becomes this firework of different explosions. It's really quite spectacular.","156":"So when the gravitational waves were recorded and they realized, oh this sounds like, you can reconstruct the shape and size of the mallets of the drum from the sound, these sounds like neutron stars colliding, not black holes. And so, like you said, there was a trigger for satellites and experiments all over the world to point roughly in the direction that the sound was coming from. So, from your point of view, they're like two super-conducting giant magnets colliding, an experiment you could never do on Earth. That's just the most tremendous scales and peculiarities of matter.","157":"So my son is five years old. And he asked me what kind of science I do. And I said fusion. And I said I put a star in a jar. Does that make sense?","158":"That's a good answer. Because it sounds a little ridiculous, right? How can we put a star in a jar? Well, we're not actually gonna put the sun, which is a star, inside a jar, but instead we're gonna take the same kind of material that the sun is made out of, and we're going to hold it for a really long time in some kind of container. So fusion is about bringing things together. That's what fusing means. When those fusion reactions occur, a new particle is created, and energy is also released. Do you know what an atom is?","159":"All right, so an atom is what everything in our world is made of. And at the very center of the atom is what we call a nucleus. And inside that nucleus is a proton. We want to take those protons and push them together to make them combine and release energy, fusion energy, that we can use to make electricity. And there's a lot of different energies and forces that we have to think about. Have you heard of gravity?","160":"There you go, yeah! And so if we want to take those protons and push them together to make them combine and release energy, fusion energy, that we can use to make electricity, then we have to actually overcome that strong electrostatic force that just want to make those balls bounce off of each other. There's another force which you might be familiar with, which is like a magnetic force.","161":"You know, scientists are still studying exactly how magnetism works, right? It'll still be there for you to tackle when you become a scientist. Have you ever seen one of these games?","162":"With the iron filing. So if you take this and you take the magnetic end, maybe you can show us what's gonna happen with it. While you move around those iron filings with the magnet, you're totally in control of that material. You're pushing, you're pulling it, you're moving it around. And so you're using this magnetic force to also do something useful for you. Have you learned about the states of matter?","163":"Yes, we absolutely do. We hold it inside the container with the magnetic fields. So you didn't have to actually touch the iron filings in the toy to move them around. You could pass the magnetic field through the plastic and control them with it. So it's the same thing. We don't have to touch this very, very hot plasma to control it and hold it in place because we use magnetic fields. You are so smart. I'm so glad that science is your favorite subject.","164":"[laughs] That's exactly right. It kinda is like recharging your battery, right? And sleep is so critical for so many parts of our body and our mind, right? It plays a really important way that we learn, and it helps us kind of recover from the day before. It affects our immune system and our metabolism, all of these things that we need to kinda be healthy.","165":"And so what's really cool about this is that giraffes need to sleep like everybody else, and so the way that it does is it kind of slumps over and it gets down on its legs and it kind of becomes this ball, but what's crazy about the whole thing is they only sleep for like 30 minutes a day. 30 minutes! Because it can't waste any more time, because it can't be vulnerable for any longer. It can get eaten by lions and that kind of thing. It has kind of evolved in a way that it can still survive and still get all the restoration it needs under such a short period of time.","166":"So we think it works the same way, but maybe just like more efficiently. And so we're still really learning about how this works. Sleep science itself is kind of a new field.","167":"Really tired. Do you think you were a little crankier than usual? Yeah. That's actually really interesting, because what happens is humans and everything needs to sleep eventually, and so you can't stay up indefinitely, right? What do you think happens if you don't sleep?","168":"Right, right! So how do they do it? In the area that they live in, they need to stay cool, right? And so they spend a lot of time in the water, and so then as a consequence, they need to sleep in the water, but how do they do it? So it's really fascinating. What they do is while they're sleeping, they actually float back up to the surface and breathe without waking up. They're able to go about their whole sleep cycles but still able to breathe, because their body has adapted in a way that they can still get the oxygen that they need. It's a really amazing thing. What do you think?","169":"A dolphin! Yes. So dolphins, kind of like hippos, have to sleep in the water, okay? But because they're mammals, right, they need to breathe. Dolphins breathe air. They have to go up to the surface and breathe, right? And for an animal like that, it needs to figure out a way that it can sleep but also still survive, right? You know how dolphins sleep?","170":"One half of their brain at a time. So half of their brain goes to sleep, and the other half stays awake, so that they can continue to breathe and swim, and they do it in this four hours a time, so like their right part of their brain sleeps, they're able to go up to the surface and breathe. Then their left part of their brain sleeps for four hours, and it goes back and forth, back and forth, so they can kind of maintain alertness, still breathe, and survive. Is that amazing or what?","171":"And is this a good thing, do you think? Or an inevitable thing that we, the programmers, we, the computer scientists, the data scientists who are inventing these things, can't actually explain how they work? Because I feel like friends of mine in industry, even when it's something simple and relatively familiar like auto complete, they can't actually tell me why that name is appearing at the top of the list. Whereas years ago when these algorithms were more deterministic and more procedural, you could even point to the line that made that name bubble up to the top.","172":"Okay. So this is about high intensity lasers. Not only how do you make them, but what was really stopping them being made in both cases is non linear optics. We wanna do something that requires a huge photon density application, and so that's how come we came up with chirped pulse amplification, so that we could stretch the pulse, safely amplify it, then compress it at the end, and then we're ready to do whatever we want at the end. So what do you think the main difference is between the continuous wave laser that you have that runs at 10 watts and a chirped pulse amplifier?","173":"So chirped pulse amplification took us sort of from, we were at 10 to the 12, but when I was working the 10 to the 12 sort of sat on a football sized field. It was a kilojoule laser with a nanosecond pulse. And we brought it down to something we call tabletop terawatt. So it was the same terawatt but now it was one joule and one picosecond, so it could fit on a basic optical bench like you would have in your lab. We were able to take that up to, I think the record is right around somewhere between 10 to the 22 and 10 to the 23 watts per square centimeter. So then in going forward, one of the holy grails is can we reach 10 to the 29 watts per square centimeter? So we still have six orders. So we've gone from 10 to the 12 to 10 to the 23. So we've done 11 orders, so you think six isn't so much harder. I have to tell you, over time, it's rolling over. We need another Nobel Prize winning idea. But if we get out there, that's where, if you focus the intensity, the energy in that volume is enough to break the vacuum.","174":"I don't know if people are working on that because I'm not so much in the medical field, but I should look into that and see if that's a possibility. So after hearing about high intensity lasers, can you think about next time you go back to the lab and you're wondering how to do something in the lab with lasers, can you see how short pulses might help you?","175":"Do you think there are going to be general principles that guide those decisions? Because right now, it's generally up to the machine learning engineer to decide what tools they want to apply.","176":"If you train a model off of language off the internet, it sometimes says uncomfortable things or inappropriate things and sometimes really biased things. Have you ever run into this yourself? And then how do you think about that problem of potentially even measuring the bias in a model that we've trained?","177":"The end goal of reality, of course in computer graphics people chase photo-realistic form for a long time. And basically, we've achieved it. Photo-realism, if you're willing to throw enough discreet path traced rays at things, you can generate photo-realistic views. And we understand the light really well. Of course it still takes a half hour per frame like it always has, or more, to render the different things. So its an understood problem and given infinite computing power we could be doing that in virtual reality. However, a point that I've made to people in recent years is that, we are running out of More's Law. Maybe we'll see some wonderful breakthrough in quantum structures or whatever--","178":"But if we just wind up following the path that we're on, we're gonna get double and quadruple, but we're not gonna get 50 times more powerful than we are right now. We will run into atomic limits on our fabrication. So given that, I'm trying to tell people that, start buying back into optimization, start buying back into thinking a bit more creatively. Because you can't just wait, its not going to get to that point where it really is fixed to those highest degrees just by waiting for computing to be advanced. If we want this to be something used by a billion people then we need it to be lighter, cheaper, more comfortable.","179":"You know there's tons of opportunities for the synthetic case where you want to be able to have your synthetic fantasy world where everybody is a creature that's created by the computer and simulated reasonably. But of course we've got, you know we still don't do people well simulated. That's a hard problem, we've been beating our heads against it for a long time. I do think we're making progress and I wouldn't bet on that being solved in 10 years, but maybe 20 years. Because it is going to take a lot of AI. Its going to take a lot of machine-learning, where its not going to be a matter of us dissecting all the micro-expressions that people do. Its gonna be lets take every youtube video ever made and run it through some enormous learner that's going to figure out how to make people realistic.","180":"So, when you say it's an inverse-square law, that means that the closer you are, the more strongly you feel the gravitational pull. And that makes sense. There's very few things that are stronger when you're further apart.","181":"So you can also think of a gravitational field, something that permeates all of space. Even though the earth is three stories below us, it's not as though it's pulling at us from a distance. We're actually interacting with the field at this point and there's a real interaction right here at this point. And that's nice, because people were worried that if things acted at a distance, that the way that old-fashioned inverse-square force law describes it, that it was as spooky as mind-bending a spoon, that it was like telekinesis. If you don't touch something, how do you affect it? And so the first step was to start to think of gravity as a field that permeates all of a space. And it's weaker very far from the Earth and it's closer very close to the Earth. So one way to think of this field as a field that's really describing a curved space-time that is everywhere. Forget the difficulty of the math, just the intuition comes from two kind of simple observations. One was what Einstein described as the happiest thought of his life. So, right now, you might feel heavy in your chair, and we might feel heavy on the floor and our feet, or standing in an elevator cab. And Einstein said, what does the chair have to do with it, or the floor, or the elevator? Those aren't gravitational objects. So he wanted to eliminate them, and one way to do the thought experiment is to imagine standing in an elevator that you can see out of, a black box. And imagine the cable is cut and you and the elevator begin to fall.","182":"You can make somebody look like they're in the International Space Station by flying up in a plane and then just free-falling, the plane just drops out of the air. And while it's falling, they will float weightlessly, and there's been a lot of experiments about it, but you don't want it to end unhappily, so the plane has to scoop back up, and then you see them become pinned to the floor of the plane, because then the plane is interrupting their fall. So that's the first thought, and then the next is, what is the shape that's chased? So if you were floating in empty space, really empty space, and you had an apple, and you threw the apple, what shape do you think it would chase, the path?","183":"Yeah, it would chase a curve, it would chase an arc. And the faster you throw it, the kind of longer the arc. So the second step to think about curved space-time is to say that when things fall freely around a body like the Earth, they trace curved paths, as though space-time itself, space itself was curved.","184":"You went, Oh. [Janna and Lisa laugh] So, that's the intuition, that's how Einstein gets from thinking that space-time is curved from the idea that, well, there's this field that permeates all of space, and what is really describing is the curves that things fall along. And from there, it's a very long path to finding the mathematics and the right description, that's really hard. But that intuition is so elegant and so beautiful and just comes from these two simple thought experiments.","185":"So you described learning in a class about light the theory of special relativity where Einstein is really adhering to the constancy of the speed of light and questioning the absolute nature of space and time. And it seems like that has nothing to do with gravity, but he later begins to think about the incompatibility of gravity with his theory of relativity. So suppose the Sun were to disappear tomorrow. Some evil genius comes and just figures out a way to evaporate the Sun. In Newton's understanding of gravity, we would instantaneously know about it all the way over here at the Earth. And that's incompatible with the concept that nothing can travel faster than the speed of light. No information, not even information about the Sun, could possibly travel faster than the speed of light. So we shouldn't know about what happened to the Sun for a full eight minutes, which is the time it would take light to travel to us. And so he begins to question why gravity is so incompatible with relativity, but he already knows he's thinking about space and time in relativity. So then he gets to his general theory of relativity where he realizes if I eliminate everything but just the gravitational field of let's say the Earth and I look at how things fall and I see that they follow curves, well, then he realizes that space and time don't just contract or dilate, that they can really warp, that they can bend and that they can curve. And then he finds a way to make gravity compatible with relativity by saying if the Sun were to disappear tomorrow, the curves that the Sun imprinted in space-time would actually begin to ripple, and those are the gravitational waves, and they would change and they would flatten out, 'cause the Sun was no longer there. And that would take the light-travel time to get to us to tell us that the Sun was gone, and then we would stop orbiting and just travel along a straight line.","186":"And I dare say, even though you might not have put this word on it, odds are you executed as a human, multiple algorithms today even before you came here today. Like what were a few things that you did?","187":"Okay, so all of those, frankly, if we really dove more deeply, could be broken down into step-by-step instructions. And presumably your mom, your dad, someone in the past sort of programmed you as a human to know what to do. And then after that, as a smart human, you can sort of take it from there and you don't need their help anymore. But that's kind of what we're doing when we program computers. Something maybe even more familiar nowadays, like odds are you have a cell phone. Your contacts or your address book. But let me ask you why that is. Like why does Apple or Google or anyone else bother alphabetizing your contacts?","188":"That, in of itself, is kind of a problem or it's an inefficient solution to the problem. So, it turns out that back in my day, before there were cell phones, everyone's numbers from my schools were literally printed in a book, and everyone in my town and my city, my state was printed in an actual phone book. Even if you've never seen this technology before, how would you propose verbally to find John in this phone book?","189":"Yeah. So, let me propose that we start that way. I could just start at the beginning and step by step I could just look at each page, looking for John, looking for John. Now even if you've never seen this here technology before, it turns out this is exactly what your phone could be doing in software, like someone from Google or Apple or the like, they could write software that uses a technique in programming known as a loop, and a loop, as the word implies, is just sort of do something again and again. What if instead of starting from the beginning and going one page at a time, what if I, or what if your phone goes like two pages or two names at a time? Would this be correct do you think?","190":"Yeah, so sort of accidentally and frankly with like 50\/50 probability, John could get sandwiched in between two pages. But does that mean I have to throw that algorithm out altogether?","191":"Okay, that's nice. So, you could kind of like go twice as fast but then kind of pump the brakes as you near your exit on the highway, or in this case near the J section of the book.","192":"And maybe alternatively, if I get to like A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, if I get to the K section, then I could just double back like one page just to make sure John didn't get sandwiched between those pages. So, the nice thing about that second algorithm is that I'm flying through the phone book like two pages at a time. So, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12. It's not perfect, it's not necessarily correct but it is if I just take one extra step. So, I think it's fixable, but what your phone is probably doing and frankly what I and like my parents and grandparents used to do back in the day was we'd probably go roughly to the middle of the phone book here, and just intuitively, if this is an alphabetized phone book in English, what section am I probably going to find myself in roughly?","193":"Yeah. So, John is going to be to the left or the right and what we can do here, though your phone does something smarter, is tear the problem in half, throw half of the problem away, being left with just 500 pages now. But what might I next do? I could sort of naively just start at the beginning again, but we've learned to do better. I can go roughly to the middle here.","194":"Yeah, exactly. So, now maybe I'm in the E section, which is a little to the left. So, John is clearly going to be to the right, so I can again tear the problem poorly in half, throw this half of the problem away, and I claim now that if we started with a thousand pages, now we've gone to 500, 250, now we're really moving quickly.","195":"And so, eventually I'm hopefully dramatically left with just one single page at which point John is either on that page or not on that page, and I can call him. Roughly how many steps might this third algorithm take if I started with a thousand pages then went to 500, 250, 125, how many times can you divide 1,000 in half? Maybe?","196":"That's roughly roughly 10. Because in the first algorithm, looking again for someone like Zoe in the worst case might have to go all the way through a thousand pages. But the second algorithm you said was 500, maybe 501, essentially the same thing. So, twice as fast. But this third and final algorithm is sort of fundamentally faster because you're sort of dividing and conquering it in half, in half, in half, not just taking one or two bites out of it out of a time. So, this of course is not how we used to use phone books back in the day since otherwise they'd be single use only. But it is how your phone is actually searching for Zoe, for John, for anyone else, but it's doing it in software.","197":"Excellent. I got an engineering physics degree. There you go, something in common. We're here today talking about lasers. So have you have had much exposure to lasers yet at school?","198":"Okay. As opposed to the experimental side and seeing things? Okay so I'm much more, I like to see the things happening. So then the question is, what's so special about making a light that's intense enough to actually possibly blow things up? Certainly we can blow atoms up with the laser hammer and when the laser light comes in and just smacks the electrons right off the atom. And so the question really is how do you make that? Back in the 70s and into the 80s, I know that was a long time ago for you, we had big energy lasers and we had short pulse lasers, we couldn't have big energy, short pulse lasers and actually it was my supervisor and I that figured the way around that and we got something called chirped pulse amplification. Have you heard of chirped pulse amplification by any chance?","199":"So these are things we would call features. And we go through a process where we do feature engineering, where somebody looks at the example and says, Okay, these are the things that I think might allow us to statistically tell the difference from something in one category versus another. So for example, perhaps you don't speak Russian, you start getting a lot of email in Russian.","200":"Yeah. This is actually a good example of a very real world kind of machine learning problem where the solution to this was to build an interpretable system on top of the accurate predictions not to throw it away, but to do a bunch more work to figure out the why.","201":"You can just barely tell. And you can see that even, like if you hold out your hand and you focus on your hand, then your foot would be blurry because there's that difference there. And you can change between that, like you can then focus on your foot and your hand gets blurry. Because your eyes can see different amounts of detail in different places. So we're hoping in the future, that hardware can be like that. Where we can make a display that puts lots of detail right where you're looking. And every time you look someplace else, it moves the detail over to there. So we don't need to render a hundred times as much as we've got right now. Figuring out where you're looking is a pretty hard problem. What we try to go about this, is by taking a camera and looking at people's eyes and then try to figure out is the eye looking over here or up here. We're working hard on stuff like this right now so we hopefully can have a virtual reality that's as detailed and realistic feeling as the reality that we've actually got around us. But its going to be a long time before we get to where we can really fool people.","202":"So you've evolved, and I suppose, trained these viruses to build the materials that you want them to build by exposing them to the raw materials and then evolving their function. We're talking about the electronics from nanomaterials. That critical issue that we're facing is how do you go from those single experiments with a single material, understanding its properties, how do you scale that to the billions of devices that you need in a technology? It is a chemistry driven approach. We're not going to grow them exactly where we want them, but to take that one step, and to tie into what you're doing, tt sounds like there could be an area of collaboration where instead of using conventional chemistry, that we can train some of these biological elements to do that work work for us.","203":"One of the things I love about about nanoscience is it tends to break up the silos between those traditional scientific disciplines. My training was in chemistry, but I had to very quickly merged chemistry and physics. And now I see an area where chemistry, physics, and biology are coming together to produce new materials and new technology, and to advance the field forward. And so being in this field, you kind of have to cross pollinate between these different disciplines and kind of advance the field together.","204":"The reason we're not just flying off the earth is because earth has gravity, so if we throw something up, it comes back down, so that's why when we're walking on the earth, we don't fly off the earth because the earth has gravity, and it keeps us down.","205":"The main thing about black hole to remember is that it's just, like I said, how the earth holds you down, the black hole pulls you in, as well. Now, try and take the ball from me, black hole--","206":"Yes, we're gonna talk about science and we're gonna talk about a very specific kinda science, about people who study brains. Do you know what a brain is? What is it?","207":"Okay, well there's more cells in your brain, like way more cells, than all the stars we can see. (Daniel gasps) (Bobby laughs) And so what the connectome is, is we'd like to know where every cell in your brain is and how it talks to every other cell in your brain.","208":"So often, when we try to give the basic idea of what time is, I'm fond of saying, Look, space is the language that allows us to say where events take place, and time is the language that allows us to specify when they take place. Where would you jump off from there and trying to give a deeper understanding of the basics of time?","209":"To note our recent paper, where we were thinking about Einstein's ideas of special relativity, but in a setting where the global shape of the space time, we imagine there might be a curled up dimension of space, a circular dimension and thought about how special relativity works in that setting, we came to a result in this very basic setting. You can send signals into the past, not in a way that will violate causality. Did that surprise you, that by going from the usual topology that doesn't have a closed part of space, but making that one change, you could have this radical impact?","210":"And the beauty of it is, it is not like there is some high-powered mathematical methodology, straightforward algebra that a high school kid would know is all that you need to extract these unusual results.","211":"And so the old idea that of course we always hear about, that if we ever make contact with extraterrestrial life, if they're far away, we can't really have a conversation because we'll say hello, and then like 10,000 years or 100,000 years later, they'll answer us 'cause they'll take that long for the signals. But at least in this setup, which we don't know is true about our universe, but if it were, then you could have a real-time conversation over arbitrarily large distances, which is--","212":"One of the things that relativity also sheds a light on is what exists, that if someone's moving relative to me, what they consider now might be in my past, what they consider now might be in my future, which would suggest that all of time exists much as we're willing to accept that all of space exists. Is that cold water?","213":"So the side channel analysis is really looking not at a vulnerability within a system, but really unintended consequences of what the system is built on. A very simple example of a side channel is putting your ear to the ground to hear if there are horses coming towards you, and the same thing applies to technology. So you can have something like a CPU, it's executing instructions, certain instructions that use a little bit more power, and power is reserved in these capacitors, which are like tiny batteries next to your CPU. And as they're pulling power, there's something in physics called the electrostrictive effect where the capacitor will move in a very, very tiny amount. And then although we can't hear it, the microphone on a mobile device can actually listen to that. If you then listen to that and you say, oh, I see a pattern here, and you can go all the way down and then extract and reveal the full password, the full key, even though it could be argued that the algorithm itself, there's no problem with it.","214":"Yeah, I suppose the physical adjacency of the underlying transistors and capacitors that are holding that storage. That's crazy. I think the first time I heard of an interesting attack like that was learning about the cold boot attack. Being able to, you know, someone enters their password on their computer and that decrypts their hard drive and then they walk away. Being able to extract that password is really difficult. If I can pull that memory chip out and extract that memory, put it in my own device, except the problem is memory is volatile, so it'll erase as soon as I pull it out. You can take something like canned air, turn it upside down, cool that computer, make it real nice and cool. Then you have a minute or two to pull out the memory, put into your own device, extract the memory, and then you're good. It's such a simple method to really extract something kind of critical. Like Rowhammer, it's such a low level of vulnerability and you could argue that it's not necessarily a vulnerability in the architecture itself, but rather exploitation of physics at that point.","215":"The risk right now, just during this quarantine, is actually massive now that we think about it, because you might have these legacy systems. You know, they were built 20, 30 years ago, and it's too costly to upgrade, but now you can't actually have a lot of people in a single location, so potentially, they actually do have to now add some sort of remote capabilities to these systems that were never meant to be on the internet. Have you ever had any ethical concerns with the stuff you're interested in or the work you do?","216":"Especially now that we're seeing more and more companies who are trying to make it illegal for you to inspect the vehicle that you've purchased, right? Something that you actually own.","217":"What if it were illegal? Would you then do it? Fortunately it's not today, right? It hasn't been, you know, despite their attempts, none of that has been passed, but if you had a vehicle and you wanted to inspect it, but all of a sudden, it passed, I mean.","218":"But the laws don't always equate to hurting anyone. I ethically think similar to you in that, you know, what is moral to me is as long as I'm not intentionally hurting others, right?","219":"Maybe a mutual acquaintance of ours, Jasper gave a example of fault injection, and I like to use that as, when I'm trying to explain fault injection, he shows a pinball machine and the pinball machine, obviously the two inputs are the two plungers when you're playing a pinball machine, but fault injection, you can tilt the entire pinball machine, right? You're just introducing some external variable that's outside of the traditional inputs that you're used to and you've now controlled the environment in a advantageous way to the user or the player. Can you give an example of some type of fault injection that you're doing or working on?","220":"We're also scratching the surface of, like, what is possible? It's not necessarily just the system itself and not necessarily that algorithm itself. Like you said, you don't necessarily need to attack the math in some cases. You can just attack that check. And I think something that's been pretty cool is looking at higher energy particles. It's going to be maybe hard to entirely confirm, but I think it'd be really, really cool to actually see. Like, I want to see one of these faults because I haven't seen it myself. And also, how do you know that you've seen it? I've started playing with, like, setting up a cloud chamber. A cloud chamber lets you actually view high energy particles going through sort of like in a small jar with some evaporated alcohol. And I thought it'd be really cool if we put some memory chip in there, like a basic memory chip and we just fill it with some data, but then you put a camera on that area and you just watch. Assuming that there is a high energy particle that actually hits that memory, that should potentially flip the energy state of that bit. The outside microcontrollers should be able to read that and actually say, Oh wait, the data, even though I'm not changing data, I'm only reading data, and we should be able to visibly or optically see it. What I'm wondering is could that be a next area of research? Because I don't think anyone's actually looking at intentionally injecting high energy particles to take over a computer, when really, you know, that's another technique for fault injection, technically speaking.","221":"I've never seen... Maybe call it a verifiable visualization of it, right? We know it's true, you know, you can get skin cancer by going outside and having too many high energy particles hit you, but we've never seen it. And we know it can happen to a computer chip, but I've never seen both.","222":"It's a good one. The melody on its own just goes. (hums Amazing Grace) That melody on its own is kind of lonely, right? And no one really knows how it feels. (plays and hums Amazing Grace) So which one did you prefer?","223":"Yeah, ah, that's great. I can decide how I want this melody to feel and the more notes there are, the more exciting it is. That's what musical harmony is. Does that make sense?","224":"One of the weird things and wonderful things about wormholes is that they are tunnels, if you will, shortcuts from one point in space to another point in space. But once you have a shortcut from here to there, the beautiful thing is, if you move the openings, time will elapse differently at the different openings. So there's a possibility of wormholes as time machines. Go one direction, you're going into the future, go the other direction, you'd be going into the past. But that, of course, raises philosophical and logical--","225":"Yeah, so you go into the past, and maybe you can prevent your parents from meeting, but you're preventing them from meeting in the parallel reality, which means that you will never be born in that reality, but the origin of your birth is still completely understood, it was in the universe from which you originated. Another one that's more subtle is, the laws of physics may prevent you from interceding.","226":"Yeah, so that one, there's actually some people like Joe Polchinski who did some wonderful studies of billiard ball tables, where you imagine a billiard ball goes into a wormhole, comes out and hits the very ball that was going into the hole. And in that way, if it could knock it off course, we seem to be in some logical paradox.","227":"But the finding was, the ball can come out and just sort of graze the other one, but it can't affect it enough to prevent the sequence of events from happening. And the way I like to think about it frankly is if there's one universe, not parallel universes like in the other solution, moments in time just are. They don't change, the whole point of time is the variable along which change can happen. So if you have the atoms of time, the individual events, there's no conception of them changing. So whatever collection of influences were in play that allowed your parents to meet, they will always be in play because you were always part of that moment.","228":"And imagine I turn on two laser beams, sending a beam of light going to my right and to my left. And these beams will go around the entirety of space, and they'll both come back, and at some point, they will hit me. Imagine they hit me at the same moment from my perspective. Now imagine someone's moving relative to my frame of reference, say, to my left, they do the same experiment. They fire the beam of light left and right. Notice that the beam that they fire to their left will have to travel farther to reach them because they're moving away from it. Whereas the beam that they fired to their right will not have to travel as far because in some sense, they're moving toward it. The two beams of light will not hit that moving observer at the same moment.","229":"No, everybody else is moving relative to me, and it's real motion. So everybody else will be like the moving twin. They will be younger and I will be older. And when you think about past and future on a cosmological scale, there was a long period when there were no human beings in the universe. The fact of the matter is there will be these two long stretches with our presence being sort of a flicker in between, does that thought inform anything about how you live in your brief flicker within that brief flicker?","230":"It can be debilitating to imagine an eternal future of sort of nothing, where none of what we do sort of persist. On the other hand, if you flip your perspective around and say, How remarkable is it that we have this brief moment that allows us to think and feel and love and explore and illuminate, wow, how wonderful is that?","231":"For me, I would describe chess as a lot of what you said, and also, it's a mix of really quick plans like tactics and then things that can take four, five, six, seven moves like a plan, like a strategy. So let's practice. In this position, I had the white pieces. You're playing on my side. My opponent was playing with the black pieces. So we switched a little bit. So if I said, Hey, you get three moves in a row, can you come up with a plan?","232":"I'm very happy that's the first plan that you came up with, right? You can bring your queen out this way or the rook. You can start with both, and then you come here and then you checkmate. But I did say white gets three moves in a row, right?","233":"But that's how we have to think about plans, right? We have to think about, Okay, well if I get a couple of moves in a row, what would I like to accomplish? What does my opponent want to do? So I'm not just gonna sit here and get checkmated hopefully. Right? So what do you think I want to do in this position?","234":"Oh, you're saying like if I take this pawn, maybe in the future I'll try to open up this diagonal. See, that's very good vision. There's some pieces in the way, but yes. In chess, you have to always keep an eye on what can possibly open. Do you know how you can tell whether a position is closed or open?","235":"The easiest way by far to figure out if a position is closed is how many pawns do we each have? Right now, it's eight. So think of it like a fence, right? So if you and your neighbor have a full fence, you can't really see each other, but if there's only four pawns, that means somebody probably knocked down half of the fence, right? So if we start picking up all these pawns, then the position is more open. So this would be a closed position. This type of strategy would be called an attacking strategy 'cause you found a way to get your queen and rook down this line against my king. Before we even talk about what tactic is here, who does it look like is winning this game?","236":"Yes, you're 100% right 'cause in chess, the two most important things we have to think about are who has more material, but then, like you said, who has the weaker king? And I would say my king has gone way too far, right? So there's a tactic here for what?","237":"So that's like immediately you get a reward, but I'll give you a hint. The best way to start looking for a tactic, always look for a check first. Do you have a way to attack my king?","238":"And then you would take the rook. Now the funny thing is you are now totally winning, right? But as we know in chess, maybe one day white will make a mistake in the future. So there's no point for black to surrender here, but this is definitely a really good start.","239":"Because the materials are so small, they're at the nanoscale, their properties are dominated by quantum mechanics, which means that even slight changes in their size, in their orientation give profound changes in their properties. And while that's very scientifically interesting, and it allows you to tune their properties by making subtle changes, from a technology point of view, it's a bit of a headache in the sense that in technology want to optimize for a property and then repeat that over and over again. So what are some of the challenges that you face in the lab related to working with these materials and then trying to incorporate them into the batteries?","240":"That's actually, I think a very common problem. We can build a device in the lab it could be a transistor, can be a battery. And then you ask the question, okay, so what's the next step? How do we take it from that lab demonstration into a technology? The kind of work that I'm very interested in is developing tools to make the exact type of materials that you want. The tools that we've used in the past for conventional fabrication just don't work with these materials because they're all grown from the bottom up. They're intrinsically small, and you have to find ways to either use chemistry or some other means to get them to assemble into the structures that you want to actually either grow specifically what you want or after you grow them, to pull out the ones that you want. You need to be able to build that same thing over and over again, with the exact same properties. No one institution, no one research lab, no one national lab is gonna solve all of these problems on their own because they are difficult problems. And there is a real important payoff at the end. And it's gonna take all of us, making our contributions to push this field forward.","241":"Its basically a delay and it happens in all parts of the system: monitors can be a big one. Like consumer televisions can often have 15 milliseconds or more of latency just in the TV part. And then you've got the processing and the computer and all of these add up to the total latency.","242":"30 years ago, you had desktop PCs which were, you spent whatever on that, but there was always this idea well you could spend a million dollars and buy a super-computer and its gonna be a lot faster. And that's not really true today. For scalar processing, when you just do one thing after another, a high-end, overclocked, cool gaming PC is about the fastest thing in the world. It is within a very small delta, yeah for some things you'll get some IBM power system that might be a little bit faster, but not a whole lot. So if I'm looking at this and saying we need to be five times faster. What do you do? You can't just say make each thing faster. As a developer you're making a trade-off, I can put my effort into making this more efficient or making it more fun. And more fun usually wins out for very good reasons. So there's some good judgment and trickery that goes into the design of things. But you can always just design a game that will just not work well. (laughing) I mean in the old days, games had to be so precisely designed. Nowadays you've got a ton more freedom. You really can--","243":"But VR makes, you have to give up a little bit of that freedom, you have to not do so many crazy things, so you can wind up having it be as responsive and high quality as it needs to be.","244":"When you give up most of what you want? Well, sometimes that definitely happens for sure. What if I told you that this is the kind of technology that I work on that means you could trade with any kid all over the world?","245":"That's probably a good idea, maybe somebody else likes it more than you do. So normally, when people trade, they have to go to the store, or they have to know the person so they can get what they asked for. With blockchain, you can make that exact same trade, but you don't need the store, and you don't even necessarily need to know the other person.","246":"That's right. When we teach machines to learn from data, to build a model from that data or a representation of that, and then to make a prediction. One of the places we often find machine learning in the real world is in things like recommendation systems. So do you have an artist that you really like?","247":"So I'm gonna look up Melanie Martinez. And it says here, If you like Melanie Martinez, one of the other songs you might like is by Au\/Ra. Do you know who that is?","248":"And that's actually a really interesting thing to think about because that creepy vibe is something that you can perceive and I can perceive, but it's actually really hard to describe to a machine. What do you think might go into that?","249":"Sometimes, the ads you see are really uncanny. And I think that's because they're based on so much data. They know where you live. They know where your device is. It's also important to realize that people in aggregate are actually pretty predictable. Like when we talk to each other, we like to talk about the novel things, like here, we're having this conversation. We don't do this every day. But we probably still eat breakfast. We're gonna eat lunch. We're gonna eat dinner. You probably are going to the same home you go to most of the time. And so, they're able to take that data that we already give them and make predictions based on that as to what ads they should show us.","250":"So yeah it's a light bulb and there's a couple of mirrors. Now the light bulb has to be a little bit special. It has to be a type of material that can store the energy in an excited state right? It has to stay up there really energetic and sit there for a while so that when the light comes along, it takes that energy and becomes stronger light and then the mirror sends it back and it does it again and again and again and between these two mirrors, it makes the light come out in a nice beam. In a laser, it comes out as a single color. They all come out with their waves at the same time. Every wave peaks at the same time which then makes it a giant wave and it's this giant wave that has a tremendous amount of power. So it can do something like cutting steel. But when you cut steel, or if you were cutting this floor, it's gray, it actually will absorb the light. That's why the light, you don't see it because the light isn't bouncing back or through it. So I like to use demos to explain how my laser works. So I've brought basically a hammer and a nail. I'm sure you've probably hammered a nail before into a piece of wood but the question is, if you asked yourself why it is we hit the big end and it's the tiny end that we put on the piece of wood. We could never pick up a hammer and hit the sharp end and hope this would go in to the piece of wood.","251":"That's right. All the force that we apply here, goes all the way through but then it can only basically come out when it contacts the wood in that one tiny spot. And so sometimes it's the force that you push something with but sometimes it is that force per unit area. But sometimes it's not even the force per unit area 'cos, you know, push down as hard as you can on that and see if we can get it pushed in. See it doesn't really work does it?","252":"Well it depends. So if you're cutting steel, you need to have the nail. You need to have it concentrated all of the light, not going in all directions but you need it into as small a point as possible. And for that we use a lens. For a lens, the light's coming down as a column, you put in a lens, it all focuses it down in the same way as the nail and then it starts cutting that steel. Okay so that force per unit area--","253":"Exactly. You know sometimes you want to have all of your energy not just in a small area but in the small volume and so one of the other dimensions is time or length. But with light, time and length are the same thing because light always travels at the speed of light.","254":"But if you send a one second long light pulse out into the skies there, the beginning of the pulse is actually two thirds of the way to the moon. It's 300,000 kilometers long. So now, if you talk about light being concentrated, that doesn't seem very concentrated. The type of lasers I play with in my lab will be no thicker than this piece of paper. So we take that energy that might be in three hundred thousand kilometers and we squeeze it all the way down into just this piece of paper and actually the beams are more the size of this piece of paper and so, in my lab, pieces of paper like this would be flying through the sky but we can't see them. 'Cos they don't come in our eyes, they fly by us and they're infra red.","255":"Exactly. And so now, if we have light like that that we wanna machine with. I bring this funnel and so, if we had a lens here and the light was coming down--","256":"Into a spot. So here would be my light coming from my laser and it would just be coming down, down, down, down, down. Hit a lens and it would have to focus down. But now, all the light started out with this big of a spread so concentrated this much. Eventually it would be here, more concentrated. But by the end, right at the focal spot, that's when I get all of my light, all of the energy has been squeezed down into fitting inside this piece of paper and that's why I say that I built a laser hammer. Because when this hits a piece of glass, it just smacks hose electrons right off the atoms and there's nothing else for them to do, they have to fly away. So can you tell me what you learned and maybe about the focusing of the light?","257":"Okay, so we'll do some, but I want to tell you a little bit about origami. Most origami follows two, I'll call them customs, almost like rules. It's usually from a square and the other is it's usually folded with no cuts. So these guys are folded from an uncut square.","258":"Okay. We're going to start with a model that every Japanese person learns in kindergarten, it's called a crane, traditional origami design, it's over 400 years old. So, people have been doing what we're about to do for 400 years.","259":"Let's fold it in half from corner to corner, unfold it and then we'll fold it in half the other direction, also corner to corner but we're going to lift it up and we're going to hold the fold with both hands. We're going to bring these corners together, making a little pocket and then, this is the trickiest part of this whole design, so you're going to put your finger underneath the top layer and we're going to try to make that layer fold right along the edge. Now you see how the sides kind of want to come in as you're doing that?","260":"It's called a petal fold, it's a part of a lot of origami designs and it's key to the crane. Now we're ready for the magic. We're going to hold it in between thumb and forefinger, reach inside, grab the skinny point that's between the two layers, which are the wings, and I'm going to slide it out so it pokes out at an angle. We'll take the two wings, we spread them out to the side and you have made your first origami crane.","261":"Now, this is a traditional Japanese design but there are origami designs that have been around so long we're not entirely sure where they originated. We're going to learn how to fold a cootie catcher.","262":"So we'll start with the white side up and we're going to fold it in half from corner to corner, in one fold and now we're going to fold all four corners to the crossing point in the center. We'll fold it in half like a book. On the folded side we'll take one of the folded corners and I'm going to fold it up through all layers. There's a pocket in the middle. We're going to spread the pocket and bring all four corners together. Where you have original corners of the square, we're gonna just pop those out. This is one of the most satisfying moments, I think-","263":"Yeah, but there's something else we can do with this model. If we set it down and push on the middle then pop it inside out so that three flaps come up and one stays down and then it's called talking crow because here's a little crow's beak and mouth.","264":"There's thousands of other origami designs but these are some of the first people learn and this was, in fact, one of the first origami designs I learned some 50 years ago.","265":"What is I think very true about what you're hinting at is that bubble sort really focuses on local, small problems rather than taking a step back trying to fix the whole thing, let's just fix the obvious problems in front of us. So, for instance, when we're trying to get from smallest to largest, and the first two things we see are eight followed by one, this looks like a problem 'cause it's out of order. So, what would be the simplest fix, the least amount of work we can do to at least fix one problem?","266":"All right, we'll switch this. And now to your point, we don't need to bother with the ones that already bubbled their way up. Now we are a hundred percent sure it's sorted.","267":"And certainly the search engines of the world, Google and Bing and so forth, they probably don't keep webpages in sorted order 'cause that would be a crazy long list when you're just trying to search the data. But there's probably some algorithm underlying what they do and they probably similarly, just like we, do a bit of work upfront to get things organized even if it's not strictly sorted in the same way so that people like you and me and others can find that same information. So, how about social media? Can you envision where the algorithms are in that world?","268":"Well, that's true, we do use slingshot technology once things are out in the solar system. So, for instance, we use Jupiter and other planets so that when some of the spacecraft gets close, it'll slingshot around and it'll cause it to speed up. But mostly, around the Earth, gravity pulls things down, so when we want to send a rocket into space, when we wanna go to the Moon, when we wanna send supplies to the International Space Station, the trick is to get something moving fast enough that it escapes the gravitational pull of the Earth. Have you heard the expression what goes up must come down? It's actually not true. If you throw it fast enough, you can actually get something that doesn't come back down again, and that's basically how rocket launches work. You have to get the rocket for the Earth to go more than 11 kilometers a second. Think of how fast it is. Just one breath and it's gone 11 kilometers. If you get it to go that fast, it's not gonna come back down again. So you know the International Space Station which is orbiting the Earth? That's going around the Earth at 17,000 miles an hour. It has no engines anymore, the engines are turned off. So it's just there falling forever. So once it's out there, it's not coming back down as long as it's cruising like that.","269":"In a weird way, that is gravity pulling it. So have you ever had a yo-yo where you swing it around like this? The string is pulling it in at all times, but you've also given it this angular momentum. And as long as you give it the angular momentum, pulling it in actually keeps it in orbit. And so the Earth is pulling it in at all times, so that's why it doesn't just travel off in a straight line. It keeps coming back around. So it's funny, people think that the International Space Station is so far away that they're not feeling gravity, and that's not the case at all. They're absolutely feeling gravity. They're just cruising so fast that, even though they're being pulled in, they never get pulled to the surface.","270":"Yeah, you feel pinned to that. It's exactly like that. There's something called the equivalence principle where people realized, especially Einstein, that if you were in outer space in a rocket ship and it was dark and painted and it was accelerating at exactly the right rate, you actually wouldn't know if you were sitting on the floor of a building around the Earth or if you were on a rocket ship that was accelerating.","271":"That's because in some sense, you're really not. Imagine you're in this train and it's going near the speed of light relative to the platform, but it's so smooth, then you should be in a situation in which there's no meaning to your absolute motion, there's no absolute motion. So that if you throw a ball up, you might think from the outside of the platform, be confused that when gravity pulls that back down, it's gonna hit you or something, but it'll land in your palm as surely as if you were in your living room.","272":"So imagine you were an astronaut and you were floating in empty space. You can't see anything. There's no stars, there's no Earth. You can ask yourself, am I moving? There's really no way for you to tell. So you would probably conclude, well, I'm not moving. So then your friend Marina comes cruising past you, and maybe she's going thousands of kilometers a second, and you say, Marina, you're cruising at thousands of kilometers a second, you're going so fast. But she had just done the same experiment. She was just floating in space thinking, Am I moving? There's no way to know which one of you is moving and there's no meaning to the absolute motion. The only thing that's true is that you're in relative motion, that's true. You both agree you're in relative motion, and that's clear. But neither of you can say it's actually you who's moving and I'm stationary.","273":"So, let's say you and Marina are floating in space and you can't tell who's moving. Let's say you both see a flash of light. A flash of light comes from somewhere, you don't know where. So you measure the speed of light to be 300,000 kilometers per second. But here comes Marina and she's racing at the light pulse, as far as you can tell. Two cars driving towards each other seem like they're going faster towards each other than somebody who's standing still relative to one of the cars, right?","274":"So you would say, oh Marina is gonna measure a different speed of light. But she comes back and she says, No. 300,000 kilometers per second. Because from her perspective, she's standing still, and the laws of physics have better be the same for her. The speed of light is a fact of nature that's as true as the strength of gravity. And the two of you are in this quandary because if one of you is the preferred person who correctly measures the speed of light, that ruins everything about the idea of the relativity of motion. Which one of you should it be? So Einstein decides they must both measure the same speed of life. How could that possibly, possibly be the case? And he thinks, well, if speed is how far you travel, your spatial distance, in a certain amount of time, then there must be something wrong with space and time. And he goes from the constancy of the speed of light and a respect for this idea of relativity to the idea that space and time must not be the same for you and for Marina. And that's how he gets the idea of the relativity of space and time. [laughs] You have the best expression on your face. [laughs] It's pretty wild, but that is a starting point, actually, of the whole theory of relativity. That starting point leads to this complete revolution in physics where we suddenly have a Big Bang and black holes and space-time. Just from that one simple starting point. So, is your impression of gravity different than when we started the conversation?","275":"You know, a lot of people, a lot of string theorists, they care a lot about all the different ways in which we could hide the extra dimensions. As someone who cares about cosmology, I wanna start asking why are the extra dimensions small at all? How did that happen? Is this something you think about yourself?","276":"The thing I want to talk about is this paper I wrote with Matt Johnson and Lisa Randall where we realize there's another way to compactify extra dimensions spontaneously, dynamically. If you imagine starting with this big piece of paper you couldn't wrap up everything, but within some region of space you could make a tube.","277":"Right? And down there in the tube it looks like your long thing that is compactified in one direction and infinitely extending in the other direction, so there's one less macroscopic dimension of space.","278":"Yeah. So we certainly assume that they're all large as a starting point, and it's worse than that. So in our paper we imagine you start in de Sitter space. You start in a universe with no matter, no anything like that, just empty space but with an energy that is positive and all the dimensions are large.","279":"Yeah, I've been trying to explain this to lower levels, and they always look at me like, are you pulling my leg here a little bit? Or is this the real thing that they use? Yes, it is the real thing they use. We study these branes in de Sitter space, and so what we found is that there are black brane solutions which instead of having a singularity inside are non-singular, and stable, and compactified. Is this a familiar thing? I know things like this have been discussed, right?","280":"Right. Imagine that rather than going down to a point, it just asymptotes to some fixed radius that continues infinitely far down there. But then you can ask, okay what about the rest of the universe? You have some sphere, some two dimensions compactified, and the balance between the cosmological constant and the electromagnetic field keeps it at a fixed distance.","281":"But then the other dimensions, the transverse dimensions, don't need to be anti-de Sitter. They can have either positive, zero, or negative cosmological constant. So you can basically get any sort of cosmological solution times a compactified sphere.","282":"I guess. I mean, maybe you'd think otherwise. Again or maybe you could change my mind, I think that as long as it can happen it will happen some of the time, right?","283":"Someone probably wrote it for him. So it's possible that if you do have this starting point of an empty de Sitter space with positive cosmological constants and fields lying around you inevitably get a multiverse. It just happens, you know, it's just part of quantum nucleation to different things, and then maybe you need to explain why we live in this universe rather than some other one via the anthropic principle or something like that. So how does our kind of, you know, low-tech old fashioned way of making new universes intersect with the kinds of things you'd think about.","284":"And if we put aside for the second the concerns of our colleagues in other parts of physics, and it's just amongst us chickens, what do you think about the future of cosmology and string theory, and the dynamics of these extra dimensions?","285":"And I just wrote a book called Something Deeply Hidden about many worlds, quantum mechanics, and how spacetime can emerge from it. Plenty of reading material for the audience out there.","286":"So we've been, we've had, now, effectively two different ways of getting more direct measurements, one is the LIGO, which is the Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory, which is where, getting the ripples in space time, coming off of the merging of black holes. The other one that you're mentioning is actually called the Event Horizon Telescope, where they're using radio waves to actually image the event horizon, that region where light cannot escape from the black hole at the center of our galaxy, which I know they're working on it right now. It's an amazing thing, but that'll be the most direct imaging of a black hole. LIGO is a direct detection of the consequence of the merging of black holes. The critical part has been, like, for the super massive black hole at the center of our galaxy, we've seen the stars orbiting it, and we've measured the mass, so that way, so if you look at a spinning black hole, it actually fundamentally alters the emission that's coming off the stuff that's falling into it. These are discovered as what are called X-ray binaries, that is, you know, there's an X-ray member of the binary that is emitting in the X-rays, and it's really not very bright in the optical (mumbles) at all, so there's always, people are looking at these X-ray binaries.","287":"Awesome, good. (laughs) It's a map of all the connections between every neuron in your brain. It literally, in a human brain, something like a map of the one quadrillion connections that a hundred billion neurons make with each other.","288":"We have to use electron microscopes and then what we have been developing a way to slice the brain into really thin slices, use an electron microscope to take a picture of each slice, and then use computers to put it all back. Imagine that we could get a map of every connection, right? And we knew how neurons fire. Do you think we could put that in a computer, that map, and then therefore, that computer should be able to think just like the brain that we extracted it from?","289":"So chess is separated into three games, obviously. You have your opening, which is the early stage of the game. Then we have the middle game, right? The most confusing, mysterious side of the game, and the end game where there's no pieces remaining on the board. You gotta have to know how to convert positions, defend positions, understand how to play the game with only five pieces remaining or something like that. So for you, what do you struggle with the most?","290":"In all middle games where we have this mix of tactics, which are immediate gain or immediate loss, depending on if we're getting hit with a tactic or playing one, and strategic chess. I just want you to tell me, who do you think has a better position here and by how much?","291":"Everything you just said is 100% accurate. So that's one of those baseline pieces of information that we need for the middle game. I have the two bishops. How can I activate one of my bishops? You have a little plan you could actually implement right now that would make one of your bishops extremely strong. You think you can find it?","292":"This is how we unlock the intermediate level, which is this move. That move looks like it's disconnecting from the whole board, right? It's a move totally on the edge, but nobody is gonna stop your bishop from going to that diagonal, and then you're threatening a tactic. You're threatening a skewer. You would hit my queen and my rook. Stronger piece in front, weaker peace in back, and then you would be guaranteed to win some material. Just like little pattern recognition in the middle game. So for the future, you're gonna have a game where your opponent makes the same trade early, right? They trade their dark-squared bishop, and you can activate it like that, but in this game, you focused on the center, which was totally fine also.","293":"One thing to always monitor in every chess middle game is does my opponent have a pawn break? Can my opponent strike somewhere with a pawn that would open up the board? If you have a low risk position, your position's just nice and comfortably better, you don't want chaos.","294":"Yes. Yes. And this move is actually very annoying for white because not only am I now targeting things in your center, what else have I changed just by moving this pawn?","295":"Yes. Another thing for middle game. So we just keep adding to that bucket of knowledge. Pawn breaks for the opponent, and then, every time something moves, like a pawn, we have to look around. What else is now opening up? And we wanna get to a situation where you knew this move was gonna happen, and the next I'm gonna come here, and then now what can I do? I can bring both my rooks, and now I have no problems, right? Now I have both knights, queen, rooks. So we need to get to a point where we see that coming, and we're not just focusing on our own plans, but that's not always easy. So with a pawn here, that disrupts my plan, right? Because now this move fails to-","296":"Yes. As you're trying to improve your middle game, one question you always have to ask yourself is, Is that trade good for me? Is it good for my opponent? It's not checkers. You don't have to take me, and I don't have to take you. So we can do something called keeping the tension. We're just having a staring contest here among the pawns. So I'm gonna ask you, do you think it's better for black to capture this pawn or keep the tension? Just slide the rook over and threaten to push the pawn here, which would be a tactic and a fork.","297":"Yes, but before we advance, we need to prepare it, right? Because you push it now, these two would win that trade. So yeah, rookie 8 is a very good move. You used kind of like a heuristic, right? Well, black has two knights. So black prefers the position closed because decide what the bishops wants to be able to see the whole board. Yes, exactly, but your opponent disagreed with you and took this pawn because that's just what intermediate players do. They see they can take something. Pawn for pawn. What the heck? Like, sure, and you did this. Now what does this move change in the white position?","298":"Yes, exactly. So now in the snap of your fingers, you can get your bishop out and the rook, two things that a move ago were just totally blocked in by a pawn, exactly. So in the middle game, trades are either good or bad for you and for your opponent.","299":"So a nice place to start is with the idea of a triad. A triad is a three-part harmony, basically. (keyboard harmonic tone) So that's a triad. So this triad's called C major.","300":"So in Amazing Grace, you start with F. You know, if I go (melodic humming) \u266a How sweet the sound \u266a (scat singing) (laughs) Where am I right now? I don't know where I am. (scat singing) And my job is to get back home, but to make this chord make sense.","301":"That's pretty good. So gravity wants to attract us to the Earth, and the Earth to us. But the Earth is so much bigger that even though we're actually pulling the Earth a little bit to us, you don't notice it so much. You know, the Moon pulls on the Earth a little bit.","302":"[Janna] Exactly, the Moon is such a big body compared to anything else very nearby that it has the larger effect, pulling the water of the Earth. But more than the Moon, think about the Sun pulling on the Earth. We orbit the whole Sun, just the way the Earth pulls on the Moon and causes the Moon to orbit us. All of those things are acting on you and me right now.","303":"That's such a good question. No, we actually couldn't. In the Moon, gravity is weaker, you can almost float between footsteps if you look at the astronauts on the Moon. On the Earth, it's harder, 'cause it's bigger. If you go to a bigger, heavier planet, it gets harder and harder. But there are stars that have died that are so dense that there's no way we could lift our arms, no way we could step or walk. The gravity is just way too strong. Do you know how tall you are?","304":"Maybe four three. People think that while you're sleeping, your body has a chance to stretch out and gravity isn't crunching you together, but when you're standing or walking or sitting, the gravity contracts your spine ever so slightly, so that in the morning you might be a little bit taller than in the evening. See if it works for you. [Woman] Wow.","305":"They say that astronauts in space, definitely their spine elongates. There were two twin astronauts, one who stayed here on Earth and the other who went to the International Space Station. He was there for a long time, and when he came back, he was actually taller than his twin brother.","306":"Yeah, and that was because gravity wasn't compressing him all the time and he was floating freely in the International Space Station and his spine just kind of elongated. After a while here on Earth though he'll readjust, he'll go back to the same size. Have you ever heard of how gravity was discovered?","307":"Isaac Newton would ponder, how does the Earth cause things to fall? There's a famous story that Isaac Newton was sitting under a tree and the apple fell from the tree and hit him on the head and he had an epiphany and understood this law, this mathematical law for how that works. I don't actually think that's a true story, though.","308":"But it's a good story. So Isaac Newton realized that even if you're heavier, you will fall at the same rate as something much lighter, that that's the same. Once you hit the ground, if you're heavier, you'll hit the ground with much greater force, but you will hit the ground at the same time.","309":"They look the same, but this is much heavier, right? Okay, so try it, just try holding your arms up front, a little higher maybe, give them a chance to drop, and then drop them. [balls thud] [Janna laughs] Did they fall at the same time? Did they hit at the same time? So, Isaac Newton, he was also the one who realized that that's the same force that keeps the Moon in orbit around the Earth and the Earth in orbit around the Sun, and that's a huge leap. Here he is, looking at just things around him, and then looks at the stars and has this really big realization, that that's actually the same force. So, what have you learned today talking about gravity?","310":"I think that it actually has a lot of mystery around it, because the fuel for fusion is a plasma, and we don't experience plasmas on earth in our everyday life.","311":"They exist in space, at the event horizon of a black hole, in the solar wind, in our sun, or very rapid events, like lightning is also sort of a very weakly ionized plasma. Even among plasmas there are so many different kinds of plasmas. There are low temperature, higher density plasmas. There are of course the astrophysical plasmas, and space plasmas, and then there are fusion plasmas. They are predominantly fully ionized plasmas. They are also plasmas where we have a certain ability to basically kick up micro-instabilities.","312":"Plus magnetic fields. When we start thinking about turbulence in the plasma, we can no longer even think about the plasma as a single fluid. Instead we have to consider electron fluid and ion fluid separately. We have to use a full blown kinetic equation to explain how this state of matter is behaving. Because we have collisions. So we have to add collisions back in to understand and track how all the particles are moving, and how these collective motions, this turbulence can get kicked up. So that's pretty intractable, right?","313":"So one really big advance in plasma theory over the last I'd say three or four decades has been the development of a gyrokinetic theory that we use to model the micro-turbulence in the plasma and get that under control. And the reason it's so important to get the turbulence under control and understand it is because turbulence is the primary heat loss mechanism. the primary way that heat is transported from hot to cold across confining field lines in a magnetic confinement system. Being able to study it, measure it and predict how it's going to behave is really one of the big hurdles to overcome.","314":"And we talked about how challenging it would be to follow every particle in space and know its position, and know its velocity at all times. So what gyrokinetics actually does as a theory is it takes advantage of the fact that when we drop a charged particle into a strong external magnetic field, the Lorentz force bends that particle's trajectory into a helix. And so now if we know that wherever the field line is going that particle is following it in this helical, in this corkscrew trajectory, we can say aha, I no longer have to worry about following that particle's velocity around in a circle, 'cause at every point in time I know it's going in a circle.","315":"And it has a particular radius of that helix called the gyro radius, because it's just gyrating. So what we know from studying the plasma and making direct measurements of the turbulence and also what comes from the simulations is the scale size of the turbulence is about 5 to 10 gyro radii.","316":"So that's good, because that's why you're here, and so we're talking about sleep today, and really about kind of what is the brain machinery through which we go through consciousness to unconsciousness and that transition.","317":"Okay. The best way to think about this transition is really called, it's a flip flop switch, okay? So this term comes from engineering, and the idea is that in sleep, you basically have kind of this all of nothing experience. Certainly people kind of drift off to sleep, but then all of a sudden you're unconscious, right? So it seems like it's this flip flop between the arousal system and the sleep promoting system, and it's certainly regulated, and we'll get a little bit into that, but they're certainly kind of made up of two reciprocally inhibitory processes. Okay, so we have the ascending reticular activating system. It originates in the brain stem, and there's a dorsal and a ventral arm to this, and so the dorsal arm has neurons, cholinergic neurons, that go up to the thalamus and then it projections into the fore brain, and then there's the ventral arm, and this is comprised of a whole bunch of different types of neurons, so there are monominergic, so there's kind of dopaminergic neurons that come from the periaqueductal gray, serotonergic ones from the dorsal raphae nuclei, histaminergic neurons that come from the tuberomammillary nucleus of the hippothalamus, and then noradrenergic neurons from the locus coeruleus, and so all of those are kind of working in tandem to kind of drive wake within the brain. So if we just think about drugs that are available inducing wakefulness, we can certainly, kind of the dopaminergic ones jump out, right? So we have amphetamines that kind of drive those signaling, and then modafinil, which is a wake promoting drug for people that have kind of excessive day-time sleepiness that maintains alertness throughout the day.","318":"Well one of the fun things people do with lasers, the cat will try to grab that dot. I'm sure what you have at home is a flashlight. I brought a cute little one. So the question is, do you see any difference between what a flashlight does and what a laser does?","319":"That's true, that laser's just a dot. And so the other thing to notice though is that, like if I shine it in your eyes and I'm sorry if I do! But it seems awfully bright doesn't it? And yet when, you know, you shine this down and you put the laser, which one do you see easier?","320":"One of the things that lasers are great for is that because it's a directed beam, we can actually put that light where we want the light to go and sometimes you maybe just want to see something around the corner and you can't see it. But with a laser, you can actually and this is a smoky one so you can actually watch it go. You see it actually bending the corner?","321":"And that's because the light will go through this glass and, when it hits that corner, it has to bend. And we actually send laser beams down glass fibers, the size of your hair.","322":"So this is just a demonstration. If you have a laser like this, it actually bends and comes out, I'm gonna point it to you and you'll see it coming out the other end. It hits these walls, it has to go around and come out the other side. You wanna play? So is this the first time you've seen a laser or have you gotten to play with lasers somewhere else?","323":"That's a laser. We cut steel with them now. We actually do surgery with lasers. You know when some people have either scars or birth marks that they don't want to see? We can actually remove those with lasers now. Never seen a laser light show? When they light up the sky with lasers, it's almost like fireworks.","324":"A lot of origami is animals, birds and things. There's also a branch of origami that is, it's more abstract or geometric, called tessellations. Tessellations, like most origami, are folded from a single sheet of paper but they make patterns, whether it's woven patterns like that, or woven patterns like this. If you hold them up to the light you can see patterns.","325":"The thing that makes them cool is they're sort of like tilings, it looks like you could put this together by cutting little pieces of paper and sliding them together, but they're still one sheet.","326":"There's no cuts in these just folding. We can build these up from smaller building blocks of folds, learn how to fold little pieces and put them together in the same way that a tiling like this looks like it's built up of little pieces. Can you make a fold that starts at the dot that doesn't run all the way across the paper?","327":"Mm-hmm. Each of these folds is peaked like a mountain and we call these mountain folds but if I made it the other way, then it's shaped this way and we call it a valley fold. In all of origami there's just mountains and valleys.","328":"So they're all reversible and it turns out that in every origami shape that folds flat, it's going to be either three mountains and a valley or, if we're looking at the backside, three valleys and a mountain, they always differ by two.","329":"That's a rule of all flat origami no matter how many folds come together at a point and I'm going to show you a building block of tessellations, it's called a twist because that center square, as I unfold it, it twists, it rotates.","330":"If I had another twist in the same sheet of paper I could make these folds connect with that, and these folds connect with that. And if I had another one up here, I could make all three. And if I had a square array and all the folds lined up I could make bigger and bigger arrays, like these, because these are just very large twists. In this case it's an octagon rather than a square, but they're arranged in rows and columns. And let's just try going along. All right, there is our tessellation with squares and hexagons. So you have now designed and folded your first origami tessellation and perhaps you can see how just using this idea of building up tiles and small building blocks you could make tessellations as big and complex as you want.","331":"So machine learning is a way that we teach computers to learn things about the world by looking at patterns and looking at examples of things. So can I show you an example of how a machine might learn something?","332":"That's true. Do you think, if we look at these pictures, do you think maybe we could say, Well, they both have pointy ears, but the dogs have a different kind of body and the cats like to stand up a little different.? Do you think that makes sense?","333":"This one's a jackal. And it's actually a kind of dog. But you made a good guess. That's what machines do too. They make guesses. Is this a cat or a dog?","334":"And so, you did something pretty amazing there. Because we asked the question, Is it a cat or a dog? And you said, I disagree with your question. It's a human. So machine learning is when we teach machines to make guesses about what things are based on looking at a lot of different examples. And I build products that use machine learning to learn about the world and make guesses about things in the world. When we try to teach machines to recognize things like cats and dogs, it takes a lot of examples. We have to show them tens of thousands or even millions of examples before they can get even close to as good at it as you are. Do you have tests in school?","335":"So machines work the same way. If you show them a lot of examples and give them practice, they'll learn how to guess. And then when you give them the test, they should be able to do that. So we looked at eight pictures and you were able to answer really quickly. But what would you do if I gave you 10 million examples? Would you be able to do that so quickly?","336":"So one of the differences between people and machines is that people might be a little better at this, but can't look at 10 million different things. So now that we've been talking about machine learning, is this something you want to learn how to do?","337":"So what if I told you that blockchain technology is basically a tool where you can do the exact same thing, but it goes to you and I directly? You wouldn't need an eBay or a brand in between.","338":"We have a lot of companies that sort of help us make sure that our trades happen, but if we could guarantee the same trade using technology as sort of a technological trust, then we wouldn't really need all those middlemen in between.","339":"It's basically a network of computers that all have the same history of transactions. And so instead of sort of there being one company with one database that holds all the information, the same sort of list is held by all these different people. Like, you could have it on your computer. And then it gets validated by everyone, and basically, that turns into the next part of the list. So it's sort of constantly updating itself.","340":"So it use cryptography, and that helps it basically encode all of the transactions. So you can't really see exactly what happened, but you can know it happened because it's like a marker.","341":"So it's kinda this like really big ledger or accounting system for all sorts of things that get traded, but instead of being owned by one company, it's owned by everybody.","342":"That's actually a really good description. The idea is that if you've got a system here that can make you see whatever we want you to see, then we can make you believe that you're anywhere else, like on top of a mountain, or in a dungeon or under the ocean.","343":"Yeah, or in Minecraft. When you look at a TV on the wall there showing like a picture of a mountain or something, how can you tell that its not just a window and there's something else behind it. Because it always doesn't look quite right if you have a static picture of a person on a screen and you move around like this, its not really changing. And its interesting, those are things we have to figure out We need to figure out when you look at something in reality how can you tell whether its real or not. Have you been to a 3-D movie where you put on the little glasses?","344":"When we were much smaller societies, you and I could trade in our community pretty easily. As the distance in our trade grew, we ended up inventing institutions, right? If you Uber or you use Airbnb or you use Amazon even, these are just digital marketplaces and platforms that help us facilitate an exchange of value. But today, we actually have a technology that allows us to trade one to one but at scale, and it's called blockchain technology. There is some kind of interface for it. You could have an app, or you could use a computer to do it, but instead of there being a company in the middle that's helping you make that transaction, it's a bunch of software code.","345":"In some cases, yeah, it is. And a lot of people in the financial industry, in particular, are looking at it from the banking side of how do we use this technology to trade things like Bitcoin or other tokens that are easier to use instead of today's currency. A lot of people think about blockchain as Bitcoin because it's sort of in the news a lot, and it's this new cryptocurrency. And it's kind of exciting. But we're actually seeing a lot more use cases for blockchain that aren't around the currency side. They're more around, how do you take any asset and be able to trade that using this same technology.","346":"To figure out how to do that we need to learn a little bit about what makes a point. So, let's come back to the crane. You can probably tell that the corners of the square ended up as points, right?","347":"Yeah, exactly. Actually you've discovered something pretty neat because you made your point not from a corner so you've already discovered one of the key insights. Any flap, any point, leg of the ant, takes up a circular region of paper. Here's our boundary. To make your point from an edge you use that much paper and the shape, it's almost a circle. If we take the crane we'll see if the circles are visible in the crane pattern. Here's the crane pattern, and here's a boundary of the wing, and here's the other wing.","348":"The crane has four circles but, actually, there's a little bit of a surprise because what about this? There's a fifth circle, which is like that, but does the crane have a fifth flap in it? Let's refold it and put the wings up. Well, yes, there is, there's another point and that point is the fifth circle of our crane.","349":"And to do that we use a new technique called circle packing in which all of the long features of the design are represented by circles. So, each leg becomes a circle, each wing becomes a circle and things that can be big and thick, like the head or the abdomen, can be points in the middle. Now we have the basic idea of how to design the pattern, we just count the number of legs we want. We want a spider, if it's got let's say eight legs, it's also got an abdomen, that's another point, and it's got a head, so maybe that's 10 points. If we find an arrangement of 10 circles we should be able to fold that into the spider. So in this book, Origami Insects II, it's one of my books and has some patterns, and this is one of them for a flying ladybug and, in fact, it is exactly this flying ladybug. We've got the crease pattern here in the circles and you might now be able to see which circles end up as which parts, knowing that the largest features like the wings are going to be the largest circles, smaller points will be smaller circles. So any thoughts which might be?","350":"Origami artists all around the world now use ideas like this to design, not just insects, but animals, and birds, and all sorts of things that are, I think, unbelievably complex and realistic but most importantly, beautiful.","351":"So, inside of every computer is some kind of brain and the technical term for that is CPU, or central processing unit. And those are the pieces of hardware that know how to respond to those instructions. Like moving up or down, or left or right, knows how to do math like addition and subtraction. And then there's at least one other type of hardware inside of a computer called memory or RAM, if you've heard of this?","352":"Yeah, exactly. And computers have even different types of memory. They have what's called RAM, random access memory, which is where your games, where your programs are stored while they're being used. But then it also has a hard drive, or a solid state drive, which is where your data, your high scores, your documents, once you start writing essays and stories in the future.","353":"Why don't we do it this way? Why don't we pretend like I'm a computer or maybe I'm a robot, so I only understand your instructions and so I want you to feed me, no pun intended, an algorithm. So, step-by-step instructions for solving this problem. But remember, algorithms, you have to be precise, you have to give...","354":"[laughing] Clean all this mess up, right. We made an algorithm, step by step instructions for solving some problem. And if you think about now, how we made peanut butter and jelly sandwiches, sometimes we were imprecise and you didn't give me quite enough information to do the algorithm correctly, and that's why I took out so much bread. Precision, being very, very correct with your instructions is so important in the real world because for instance, when you're using the worldwide web and you're searching for something on Google or Bing...","355":"Pretty much everything we do in life is an algorithm, even if we don't use that fancy word to describe it. Because you and I are sort of following instructions either that we came up with ourselves or maybe our parents told us how to do these things. And so, those are just algorithms. But when you start using algorithms in computers, that's when you start writing code.","356":"Really glad that you could join us. So we've been talking about sleep today, various levels of complexity. But now with you, I really want to talk about what do we know about sleep and the aging brain. Can you tell me a little bit about some of the work that you've been doing in that area?","357":"So it's interesting, so I also saw that there was also a recent meta-analysis around sleep disturbances and dementia risk, and in that study, they looked about 250,000 people in this meta-analysis, and they followed them around for 10 years, and you know, when they pulled all the samples together, they found there was a 1.2 fold increased risk for developing all caused dementia, so it sounds like both sleep apnea and then maybe sleep disturbances more generally are associated with increased risk for dementia. When I think about that, I think about how sleep lives in the brain, these neurodegenerative diseases live in the brain, and so what do we know about the causality of this? Could it be that individuals who have early onset of say, Alzheimer's, have then poor sleep kind of as a consequence of that?","358":"So within dementia risk in particular, Alzheimer's for instance, there are kind of two clear features that seem to be part of the pathology, right? So there's beta-amyloid which accumulates in the brain, and then there's kind of these tangles, this tauopathies, right? And so it sounds like sleep seems to be related to the tauopathies. What about kind of beta-amyloid?","359":"Okay, so there is this bio-directional piece, but I think perhaps the most exciting thing that happened in the sleep field, at least in my view, has been understanding the role of sleep and its clearance of beta-amyloid in the brain. This idea that sleep is kind of the dishwasher of the brain, it seems like, that you know A betta accumulates as we kind of use energy, and you know it's kind of a waste product, and the idea that if you don't clear it out, that it's going to build up and accumulate.","360":"Where we're going with a lot of the experiments right now is trying to produce some maybe outside-the-box datasets that we haven't seen before, and then of course ultimately compare them to the simulations and do a bit of this validation maybe where we're not just looking under the lamppost, where we're going a little bit outside the comfort zone. That means going from measurements really sort of more in the middle of the plasma, at about mid-radius, pushing all the way out to the edge, where the turbulence starts to become very different in its nature, it becomes a lot more electromagnetic, it becomes sometimes larger in scale, just physical scale size. And some of the things we're starting to find was that turbulence features and turbulence characteristics in the edge of some of these high performance plasmas don't always behave the way we think they do. So as we think about pushing our measurements and our study of the turbulence from the core to the edge, how does that influence what you're working on now?","361":"I agree, yeah, I think having multiple stakeholders who are all driven by different missions and different purposes working synergistically is exciting. When I'm asked like, okay, what's the timeline for fusion and why is now any different than five years ago or 10 years ago, why is now that we want for fusion? My answer is it's finally, for the first time, all the pieces of the puzzle are here. We've advanced really the basic physics understanding so far that we have got the predictive capabilities, but we also have alignment with policy and science drivers that we didn't really have before. That's I think what can get us there. Maybe a demonstration of net electricity in a decade. Is that the thing folks are pushing for?","362":"Essentially what harmony is, is like a language, right? And so as with any language, the more words you're capable of speaking in a language, the more you can say. All right, so in harmony, this might be how many notes you can think to add to a chord to make it feel a different way. Have you ever heard of the circle of fifths?","363":"Okay, that's great. On one side, we have a lot of the notes which make us feel brighter, you know, like these kinds of, (keyboard music) these really bright sounds. And the other side is a lot more to do with the darkness of a key center. So we're home in F, but imagine we're taking a quick visit to B-flat, but then the sun comes out.","364":"You got it. Ooh! Yeah? Yeah, yeah. So this is really, this is like a gleaming glade or something, you know? Let's play this tune, Amazing Grace. Let's play it in its simplest form.","365":"Just to see how things feel. Yeah. All right, lets do it. (both playing Amazing Grace) So it's F major seven, but its over A. Which is F seven over A. (both playing) B flat major seven with an A and a G in it. F major seven with an E and a D and a G, yeah. (laughter) D minor seven with a G in it. C softs, or minor, nice. B flat major. G seven, F sharp major seven. Home, yeah! I like that. So what harmony does is just gives us even more tools to tell those stories. Cool, yeah. Nice, man.","366":"When you find a target and you have a way to create threats, attacks against that target, against that goal, but you do it without sacrificing your resources, right? So you can imagine two boxers, right? One is being pushed into a corner. He could still win, he could totally still win, but for now, one side is definitely the aggressor.","367":"The tough thing about chess is you can have a good position, but you actually have to move pieces. You know, like a piece of art, you just say, Oh, it's done.","368":"Black has an initiative. But can black capitalize on this initiative? I don't know. The problem with having a position like this is you feel a lot of pressure to do something.","369":"Yeah, that's the chess player's sign of focus, just- Yeah, when you roll up the sleeves. I guess I have to defend my pawn. I mean, don't really want to, but fine.","370":"That's good, that's a great place to start. There are cells in your brain. Those brain cells are connected by wires to each other. Electricity travels down those wires and communicates from one part of the brain to the other part of the brain, and each of those brain cells makes, you know, a thousand connections, it's something like a hundred trillion connections.","371":"I would say that that map also has your feelings in it because, here's why, your feelings, most neuroscientists think, come from your brain anyway, and amazingly, whether when you feel happy or sad or angry or scared, that's just brain cells communicating with each other.","372":"You got, pretty much, you got a very good idea about it. Basically you have a star, at the core its generating energy, which is countering the pressure of all that mass trying, being pulled in by gravity. Once it can't generate that energy anymore, the core collapses, once the core is collapsing, it keeps collapsing, and collapsing, and collapsing, and that's the critical thing that makes a black hole. You have enough mass in the volume, such that the escaped velocity becomes the speed of light, once light can't escape, hence the black part. (laughs) But that's the thing, is that just because there's an intense amount of gravity very close to a black hole, things don't start behaving differently. And my favorite analogy is a vacuum, everybody thinks, like, if you point a vacuum cleaner at something, it's just gonna suck everything in--","373":"Right, you will feel the gravitational pull, and it'll redirect you in some way, and if you're far enough way, it's just like you're very far away from the sun, or something else. If you're close enough, it will divert your path more, if you're close enough still, then you will get what are called tidal forces, where the difference between, for example, if you're standing next to a black hole, the difference in gravity between your feet and your head actually becomes significant. Next time you see a science fiction movie, if somebody says, Oh, my god, we've been caught in the gravitation field of a black hole, and we're gonna fall in, it's like, no, no, just, if you're far enough away, just thrust a little bit this way, and then you'll slingshot around the black hole.","374":"Well I'm thinking about the idea that there might be more than three dimensions of space. What is your impression of theoretical physicists who think about things like extra dimensions of space that they haven't ever seen?","375":"It does. In fact, one way that different universes might be created and be different from each other is that different universes could have effectively different numbers of dimensions. Like we have three dimensions around us, but there's people out there, aliens, who could live in five dimensional universes.","376":"We think that it would be, no all of this is incredibly speculative, and we don't know for sure. But the idea is that there is some deep down underlying laws that are universal and the same, but they show up differently, so they appear different. So the specific particles and forces and masses would be completely different in different parts of the multiverse.","377":"Mm-hmm. So we have quantum mechanics, right? The theory of atoms and so forth and how those work, and then we have gravity, and gravity doesn't seem to fit in. It's the one force of nature that we can't really easily fit into this quantum mechanical framework, so string theory is one of the best ideas.","378":"That's the good news. The bad news is that it only seems to work if spacetime is ten dimensional. [chuckles] So you would say well then it's wrong. It can't be right. Spacetime is not ten-dimensional. Spacetime is four dimensional. We've observed that. But instead, we say if spacetime looks four dimensional to us, but string theory, which might be the best theory we have of quantum gravity says it must be ten dimensional, maybe we can hide those extra six dimensions somehow. So here's how we could get lucky. We could imagine that there are extra dimensions of space that are curled up somehow that are so small that we can't see them. This is actually an old idea. It goes back to Kaluza and Klein right after general relativity was invented in 1915. But there's a more recent idea that says there could actually be relatively large extra dimensions. There could be extra dimensions that are actually that big, like a millimeter across that you would not have noticed. But here's the new, exciting idea. So let's imagine, okay. This is a piece of paper. But let's imagine this is our entire world. So, in other words, our real world is three dimensional, but let's imagine that we're just idealizing it down to two dimensions, so we all live here. You and I live here. But let's imagine that we're embedded in this bigger space. So there are extra dimensions that are actually big, okay? And let's imagine that. When I say we live on this three dimensional world what I mean is imagine that the particles that you and I are made of, right, the quarks, the leptons, the electrons and everything, all the forces we know about, electromagnetism, the weak nuclear force, the strong nuclear force, imagine they can't leave this surface. This is what we call a brane. B-R-A-N-E. Have you heard this word before?","379":"From membranes, you know. We have lines, one dimension. We have two dimensional surfaces. So if you have a line that is a vibrating physical thing, you call it a string, right?","380":"If you have a two dimensional surface that vibrates and is a physical thing, we call that a membrane. Membrane theory goes back, it never was as popular as string theory, but it's been around for a while. But if you had extra dimensions of space, then you can three dimensional vibrating things, and four dimensional vibrating things.","381":"Well basically the strings are the particles that we see. It's exactly the same thing as we said for the straw, if you look at it far away it looks one dimensional. A little loop of string, so a little one dimensional circle that is vibrating. If you look at it from very, very far away, it just looks like a particle. So in string theory, an electron is a little string. A photon is a little string.","382":"Yes, string theory's even better. So the phrase Grand Unified Theory was coined in the 1970s for theories that joined electricity and magnetism. So a good string theory is gravity plus the Grand Unified Theory.","383":"It's even better. It's the theory of everything. What would you tell a friend of yours if they asked you what dimensions are, what extra dimensions are, what a brane is?","384":"Absolutely. I don't think we still have a completely satisfactory answer to that question. What was so, such a beautiful insight, as I'm sure you know, is that the idea of zero-knowledge","385":"If you can already predict the answer, then you must not be gaining any knowledge by that interaction. This insight of being able to predict the future accurately, and that being an evidence of a lack of new knowledge,","386":"Right. Sometimes. I mean, for example, in medical research, how amazing would it be, right, to be able to have a drug, and be able to prove that my drug works in this model.","387":"in a zero-knowledge way, without any interaction, right. I can just take the program, convert it to a zero-knowledge program, or an obfuscated program, and then just send it to you.","388":"We're definitely at this moment now, where zero-knowledge is gonna be used more and more. There are so many conferences and meetings that occur in the zero-knowledge space, where you and I are not invited. Because it's for the people who are developing. You know, the people who are programming, not us mathematicians.","389":"So that's a great definition and I wanna pick that apart a little bit. So what you described is just right. Stars, when they run out of thermonuclear fuel are gonna collapse under their own weight. It'll explode in a supernova, it'll leave a core, and if the core itself is heavy enough, it will keep collapsing. It does, as you say, reach this point where not even light can escape. But the amazing thing is it leaves that point, you called it rightly the event horizon, it leaves it behind kind of like an archeological record because the start itself can no more sit at the event horizon than it can race outward at the speed of light. So the core of the star keeps collapsing and where it goes nobody knows. So in a weird way, the black hole isn't anymore a crush of matter. It left it behind in its wake, but the stuff of the star is gone.","390":"It turns out that there are only three quantities that define a black hole, its electric charge, its mass, and its spin. So the most general black hole can also spin and it can also be electrically charged. Whether or not they are has to do with how they formed. If a star collapses, it will likely be spinning when it collapses and the remnant black hole that formsbwill likely be spinning. A black hole of a certain mass, charge, and spin is indistinguishable from any other black hole with those same properties. So in some sense, they're like fundamental particles, which makes them absolutely exceptional for any other astrophysical object. Have you heard the stories about what happens inside a black hole?","391":"Right? Yeah. So that's already a really good idea of what a fractal is. It has some really, really interesting detail at all, scales that makes it hard to talk about standard quantities like lengths and areas and volumes.","392":"I think I agree with you, but I think to really validate our scientific experiment, we should probably compare the length of the string. A lot of extra slack in that pig of string. So what we noticed with great Britain is we were never able to measure it's length. It just kept getting longer and longer. This is called the coastline paradox where there's not really one definite number you can assign to the length of the coastline, but it depends on how you measure it. Like if we kept going to really get this to be accurate, we might have to like actually go down the beach and start measuring these tiny little details along the coastline. But really there's so much detail. We would probably never get a definite answer for how long the coastline is. Fractals also give us a really nice language. We're talking about how smooth or rough some kind of shape is. And actually a lot of people, engineers and scientists use this idea of fractals and this language of fractals to compare different shapes, not in terms of their size, but in terms of their roughness. So based on everything we talked about today, how would you describe a fractal to somebody in your own words?","393":"yeah this whole infrastructure is all about creating levels that get progressively colder as you go from top to bottom down to the quantum chip which is how we actually control the state of the cupids","394":"okay so it's this idea that you have two objects and when you entangle them together they become connected and then they're sort of permanently connected to each other and they behave in ways that are sort of a system now so superposition is one quantum property that we use entanglement is another quantum property and a third is interference how much you know about interference","395":"so you can have constructive interference and you can have destructive interference we have constructive interference you have amplitudes wave amplitudes that add until the signal gets larger and if you have destructive interference the amplitudes cancel by using a property like interference we can control quantum states and amplify the kinds of signals that are towards the right answer and then cancel the types of signals that are leading to the wrong answer so given that you know that we're trying to use superposition entanglement and interference for computation how do you think we build these computers","396":"so step one is you need to be able to have an object or physical device we call it a qubit or quantum bit that can actually handle those things can actually be put into superpositions of states you know two cubit states that you can physically entangle with each other that's not really trivial right and things in our classical world you can't really entangle things in our classical world so easily we need to use devices where they can they can support a quantum state and we can manipulate that quantum state atoms ions and in our case superconducting qubits we make qubits out of superconducting materials","397":"It's pretty amazing, right? Because it happened like a year or two ago. Our memory is basically a record in our brain of something that happened in the past, but that record it created isn't perfect. So that day, do you remember was the pool at your hotel?","398":"When you were telling me about the sandbox, it felt like you didn't have to make that guess, that you could just see the sandbox in your eyes. I asked you about the towel. It doesn't come to mind immediately, but you can stop and think about it and kind of make a good guess because there are things you know about the world. And for those of us who study memory that's a really strong hint as to how memory works. And so for you your memory kept all the fun stuff and all the stuff that was important to you, but the details like did you have to have a ticket to get in or how you got there, all these other less interesting, less exciting aspects, your brain kind of decided letting go of all that information.","399":"Yeah, that's a great insight. Basically we can't remember everything. So when you tell us this memory of that vacation and your brain is able to kind of play almost this movie of a memory, a moment, a day that you had in your life a while ago, where do those memories come from?","400":"The hippocampus is a part of your brain that if you kind of took it out and looked at it, it looks a lot like a seahorse and it plays a really important role in creating those kinds of memories that help you two years after your vacation share with me what happened that day, all these details of that day. There's another part of the brain. It's actually also important for memory and it's called the amygdala and it is important for keeping all the kind of emotional processing going for memory. So memory for things that are really scary, it's gonna talk to the hippocampus now and get that memory to be really strong. Why do you think it might be important to remember scary things?","401":"You got it. And so we don't just remember everything and we don't remember random things. We remember the things that matter to us the most. So Abigail based on our conversation today, can you tell me what is a memory?","402":"That's a great way to think about it. Infinity is something that never ends, where finite, the opposite of infinity, refers to a process or a quantity that we could actually count all the way through, at least in theory if given enough time. So if you had to guess, how many Skittles are in this jar?","403":"217. And if we wanted to figure out the exact number, how would we find out? We could put them all out and divide them into pieces of five and then we could use that. Yeah, absolutely. In fact, I did that before you got here, and it's 649 Skittles. Here's a much harder question. How many pieces of glitter do you think are in that jar?","404":"Yeah, you can see them all. And in fact, if we were really, really, really patient, we could do the same thing as with the Skittles. But here's another question. You said that there's a finite amount of glitter in that jar, and I agree. So how many jars would we need to hold an infinite amount of glitter?","405":"Yeah, absolutely not. Because this room holds only a finite amount of space. And in fact, infinitely many jars would not even fit in something called the observable universe, which is the portion of the universe that astronomers can see. Really how does that make you feel?","406":"You have very good intuition. So there are ways that mathematicians can build infinite collections of things. And if you repeat those processes, it's in fact possible to build even bigger and bigger sizes of infinity. So what have you learned today about infinity?","407":"so did you know that there's certain kinds of problems that computers sort of run out of space almost like you're trying to solve the problem and just like how you run out of space on your iphone when you're trying to take a picture if you're trying to solve the problem you just run out of space and even if you have the world's biggest supercomputer did you know that can still happen","408":"okay so quantum mechanics is a branch of science just like any other branch of science it's a branch of physics it's the study of things that are either really really small really really well isolated and really really cold and this particular branch of science is something we're using to totally reimagine how computing works so we're building totally new kinds of computers based on the laws of quantum mechanics that's what a quantum computer is","409":"i don't know what it's worth but uh i can put it face up right in that heads i can put it face down right so at any given time point in time if i ask you is my penny heads or tails probably you could answer it right","410":"it's sort of it's sort of a combination of heads and tails right would you say so superposition is this idea that my penny is not just either heads or tails it's in this state which is a combination of heads and tails this quantum property is something that we can have in real real physical objects in the world so that's super position and the second thing that we'll talk about is called entanglement so now i'm going to give you a penny","411":"but in the quantum world when we entangle things they're really now connected it's much much harder to separate them again so using the same analogy we spin our pennies and eventually eventually they both stop right and when they stop it's either heads or tails right so in my case i got tails and you got heads you see how they're totally disconnected from each other right our pennies in the real world now if our pennies were entangled and we both spun them together right when we stopped them if you measured your penny to be ahead i would measure my penny to be ahead and if you measured your penny to be a tails i would measure my opinion to be a tails if we measured it at exactly the same time we would still find that they were both exactly correlated","412":"the way that we are able to actually see these quantum properties is by making our quantum chips really really cold so that's what this is all about actually this is called a dilution refrigerator and it's a refrigerator it doesn't look like a normal refrigerator right but it's something that we use actually there's usually a case around it to cool our quantum chips down cold enough that we can create superpositions and we can entangle qubits and the information isn't lost to the environment","413":"So black holes, you describe them as huge. The interesting thing about black holes is they're hugely heavy, but they're actually physically really small. What really matters is the density. Do you know what density is?","414":"I can also ask how big it is, which is a question about its volume. If I make it smaller, then what's happening is it's becoming more dense. So imagine I crushed this really, really small. It would weigh the same, it would have the same mass, but it would be much more dense.","415":"If a star is heavy enough to explode into supernova what's left begins to collapse under its own weight. And if that's heavy enough, the core will not be able to stop collapsing, 'cause it no longer has the thermonuclear fuel, it's run outta fuel. And if it's run outta fuel, it's no longer shining and pushing outward. And without that it itself begins to go dark and there's nothing fighting the collapse anymore. And that's when you form a black hole.","416":"Well, that's a really good question. So interestingly, the sun itself isn't heavy enough. So it has to be heavy enough that when it begins to collapse, it just overcomes all attempts to fight it. If you made something really dense, you would have to travel faster than the speed of light to actually escape. That's 300,000 kilometers per second.","417":"So it goes so fast that it goes completely dark. Any light that veers too close will fall in, will not be able to make it back out again. If a light is shining from the sun near a black hole, the black hole's not touching it. Why does the light get pulled in? Why does that happen?","418":"It is taking other stuff, but the funny question was like, if I wanted to move your chair, you'd think it was really strange if I didn't have to come near you and actually grab the chair and move it. One of the things Einstein thought about is he imagined that what the black hole is doing is it's changing the shape of space around it. What do you think of that idea?","419":"Isn't it crazy? And then Einstein goes a step further and thinks, well, what black holes must be doing is curving the space so strongly that even light gets caught. Sometimes you can get light caught into a whole orbit, literally the light going round and round in an orbit.","420":"Is there any particular memory for you that you feel has been either kind of influential in your, in deciding which areas to pursue or that you feel is sort of emblematic of what it is to have a memory?","421":"I've got one too. I was nine and we were at the science expo in San Francisco. Two scientists were dissecting an eye, a cow's eye. And I was like that is the coolest thing I've ever seen. And something about that that carried me forward. Something happened so long ago, it left some long lasting trace through neural circuits and it continues to shape the decisions we make about what to study and what to do.","422":"So we're interested in the idea that memory is kind of a pervasive force that shapes all our behaviors. And we're trying to understand how different kinds of memory are organized in different structures of the brain. And then to understand how those different structures work together to orchestrate complex cognitive behaviors like decision-making or reasoning and thinking.","423":"this really specific combination of zeros and ones everything that your computer does showing you pink panther videos on youtube calculating things searching the internet it does all of that with a really specific combination of zeros and ones which is crazy right that would be like saying your computer only understands these quarters for each quarter you need to tell it that you're going to use heads tails and you assign it heads or tails so i can switch between heads and tails and i can switch the zeros and ones in my computer so that it represents what i wanted to represent like an a and with quantum computers we have new rules we get to use too we can actually spin one of our quarters so it doesn't have to choose just one or the other","424":"yeah they can especially if doing your homework involves calculating something or finding information but what if your homework was to discover something totally new a lot of those discovery questions are much harder to solve using the computers we have today so the reason we're building these kinds of computers is because we think that maybe one day they're going to do a lot of really important things like help us understand nature better maybe help us create new medicines to help people","425":"And at some level, there's different set of rules that seem to come into play 'cause you can have particles at very microscopic scales seem to do really strange things. But one of the quests of quantum sensing is to harvest some of these unique properties at the micro scale. We are really interested in quantum sensors because we think they can give us the ultimate limit of sensitivity. So they're really, really sensitive to small changes, but they're also gonna be really reliable. Every time I make that measurement, I'll always get the same results.","426":"And what the MRI scanner is doing is, it's measuring the signal from all the water molecules that are present and specifically the hydrogen atom. In our bodies, we have these hydrogen atoms that are essentially spinning around magnetic fields all the time and we just don't know them. So in some sense, you've already used a quantum sensor.","427":"And then the different chemicals in the cells. If you look at the MRI images, you can see that they give you the broad features of what the tissue looks like. But if you wanna zoom in a little bit more and see what's actually happening inside a tissue or inside a cell and you need a different type of sensor that's gonna be more sensitive and for something like that, you're gonna need a quantum sensor.","428":"We can do it on tissues right now or on the surface, but we can't actually do it inside the body. So right now, we're struggling to figure out which scenarios can we use this to get better information and when can we not do it.","429":"So there are quantum sensors that are sold for very specific applications, one of them is a magnetometer and those can be really, really sensitive to measure small variations in magnetic fields. They are trying to develop sensors that are gravitational sensors. Right now, we have no way of probing what's under the ground without digging into the ground.","430":"It's still pretty easy, right? It turns out that stacking these two cups, it's actually really hard for robots to do that. So, let's think about how we might have a robot stack these two cups. You could program the robot to move its hand right here and then program the robot to close its hand around the cup.","431":"Exactly, right? That seemed pretty simple for the robot to do. Say we even just move the cup over here. Do you think the robot would still be able to stack the cups?","432":"Exactly. So, Moravec's paradox is something that means that these really simple things, like stacking cups, is really, really hard for robots, even though it's really easy for us. While robots are actually really good at really complicated and really difficult things. Think about the task of multiplying two really big numbers together.","433":"Yeah, I started out doing magnetic resonance, studying things like bone and biomedical magnetic resonance. Ended up playing with spins for a long time and the physics of spins just fascinated me.","434":"In a way, it's part of the same continuum. What you're doing is changing the technological platform and you're actually able to probe it more sensitively. The resolution you're able to get is much higher, so you can see smaller signals in a much smaller volume.","435":"You have to be close to it. You can detect it optically because if we tried to detect the magnetic moment of the electron, we wouldn't be able to do that because there, the energy is too low compared to thermal energies. But what the diamond system gives you is a natural up conversion in energy. So you can couple into an optical photon, which is then much easier to detect a single optical photon than it is to detect a micro wave.","436":"One of the key challenges, I think for all, any quantum technology is really understanding what limits your coherence times. And then the next question that comes up often is how do we make this better? So if I take a single qubit or a single spin, there's a certain limit up to its sensitivity. But if I can take entangled spins, in principle, I could make the system much more sensitive, but it usually comes at a cost 'cause when I entangle something, it's much more sensitive to de-coherence as well.","437":"I think as you said, you know, anything that interferes with my signal is noise, but it can come from different sources. In some ways, the operation of the quantum system itself, as it's sensitive to different physical phenomena, the ones that I don't like, I call noise. The ones I do like, I call signal and that's an artificial definition that I'm making when I choose to build a sensor. One of the challenges we have is, we're trying to figure out if I wanna control it, where is it coming from? I remember we had experiments running in our lab one day and we were running these experiments about 100 megahertz. All of a sudden, we saw these big spikes coming in and we realized we're picking up the local FM stations.","438":"And that was a source of noise, like, it's completely random, but it is still there. And then the other form is very much what is intrinsically within your experiment itself because some of the materials that you have have defects that are coupling into your sensor, into your quantum system and are also producing noise.","439":"Right, it could give you information if you read it out, about what's happening or you have to find smart ways to suppress it so that you can focus on what you really do care about.","440":"Okay, back into the 1960s, there was a research agency in the United States called DARPA, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency. Actually, it was called ARPA at the time. They wanted to build this notion of a packet-switching network. Not a circuit switch network like a phone network where you get a dedicated path and a dedicated set of bandwidth and links from source to destination.","441":"There's a lot big, right? And so remember, this was a Department of Defense, was they wanted to have forms of of communication that were very robust, that were survivable. Packets could all find their own ways, be routed differently through the network. So if parts of the network failed, you could route around failures.","442":"So you can sort of see how the network architecture that wasn't designed to be 100% reliable inside the core of the network, and had that complexity built into the edges of the network. And to me, the really cool thing is you put this infrastructure in place, and then all these super creative people think about amazing things to build on top of it. And you see this proliferation of amazing applications.","443":"Ah ha! Spoken like a real computer scientist, right? You're a computer scientist. I'm a computer scientist. We talk about APIs, application programming interfaces. The API for the internet is something called a socket. And a socket simply says, I can communicate if I know your internet address, you know, 128.119.40.186, that number is the IP address of my server, the University of Massachusetts. If you know that, you can write a program anywhere in the world and send a message, and it'll pop out at my end.","444":"Okay, well I don't know about the number seven, but there's something in the internet that's sort of similar to that. It's called the Domain Name System. The DNS's role is to translate names like gaia.cs.umass.edu, or ibm.com, or facebook.com to an IP address so that your application can actually send a message to that name, to that named service.","445":"That's 98% true. And if you own a network, like you're att.com, or your verizon.com, you can do, within that network, you can do what you want, right? So in that sense, the internet is very decentralized, that the control of the network is up to whoever owns the network. The 2% where you said there's nobody in control, there's a little bit of centralized control. There's an organization called the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers. Its responsibility is to handle, as the name ICANN suggests, names and numbers. It's that little bit of centralization, central authority that you need.","446":"Exactly, right. And maybe they're dropped in your apartment, but much more likely, they're dropped because of congestion somewhere between the Hulu or the Netflix or the Disney server, if you're watching a video, and your home. So even though you've got 200 megabits per second on that last hop, you don't have 200 megabits per second from the server into your apartment.","447":"The Mandelbrot set or the Julia set, you know, the idea is always, oh, I'm gonna apply some polynomial over and over again. Z squared plus C or something like that. When I think about fractals, I try to get away from these very specific examples and ask, what is it fundamentally that makes a fractal, a fractal. And one thing that I think you can be precise about, even if you can't really say exactly what a fractal is, is you can talk about this idea of fractal dimension. Have you ever heard of that?","448":"Totally, now, as a little experiment, take your piece of paper and just crumple it into a ball. So what is it? Is the paper three dimensional or is it two dimensional?","449":"So it's not quite as solid as the apple, but it's also not quite as two dimensional as the original sheet of paper. And so for this reason, people associate this crumpled ball with a fractal dimension, maybe something like 2.5 dimensions instead of two or three, there are a lot of different definitions, precise definitions of fractal dimension. But I think the one that's easiest to understand is this thing called box counting dimension. You have, let's say an image and you want to decide what's the fractal dimension of this image. So what you're gonna do is you're gonna count the number of boxes, or you can imagine big pixels of this image that cover the boundary of this shape. And you're gonna see how does that counting compare with how the counts work for just an ordinary shape? So, so if I have a straight line and I start out with one big box that covers the whole line, and now I shrink my boxes by a factor of two, I just make boxes half as big. How many boxes will I need to cover that line?","450":"But if you take a more interesting shape, some kind of fractal shape, like let's say the coastline of great Britain and you start doing this box, counting experiment, something really interesting happens as you make these boxes smaller, the number of boxes you need to cover the coastline grows faster than it would for just a straight line.","451":"And so what this box counting is getting at is saying, well, I still can never decide what the length of the coastline is, but what I can do is I can see how quick does the number of boxes grow relative to how it would grow just for an ordinary one dimensional curve, like a line or a circle.","452":"So procedural computer graphics, which kind of came out of thinking about fractals is one answer to this question about how do you add more detail without for instance, consuming tons of memory or requiring artists to paint ultra detail the textures. So if, if you can instead describe at least some aspect of what you're looking at in a procedural or recursive way, then you can add as much detail as you need when you get close to objects.","453":"Yeah like perlin noise is a great example, right? Perlin noise was one of the early ways of synthesizing additional texture at any level of detail that you needed to make things look natural and realistic.","454":"Yeah like perlin noise is a great example, right? Perlin noise was one of the early ways of synthesizing additional texture at any level of detail that you needed to make things look natural and realistic. I have a, a random question. Do you know how the research into fractals began? You can look pretty far back in history to see kind of glimmers of this idea of fractals in science in the 19th century, people were trying to look for examples of things in mathematics that were very unnatural. So there was, for instance, this guy named Georg Cantor, who was showing that you can have these sets with really strange properties, or you can have functions with really strange properties. This thing called the devil staircase and so on. And it wasn't until about a century later where someone named Mendel Brock said, Oh, actually this strange mathematics that was meant to show how unnatural things can happen is actually a perfect description of things that really do happen in nature. And from there, people really ran with it and said, Oh, okay, well, if these fractal descriptions are good for nature, we can also use that for creating really realistic and believable pictures in computer graphics.","455":"I'll grant you that Hilbert's Hotel does not exist. For me, infinite objects absolutely exist. And I can't read the thoughts in your head, but I have a high degree of confidence that we have a lot of the same ideas about infinity.","456":"I mean I think that's another common misconception about mathematics is that it's so far removed from the humanities, for instance. I mean it's hard to ignore some of these philosophical questions, particularly when we're talking about certain things like infinity. And I think one of the most difficult things to really be precise about and to explain to students is the continuum hypothesis. What do you say to students about the continuum hypothesis?","457":"What I love about what you were describing is like you didn't use the word memory, were how you were talking about kind of perceptions and social judgments but I think probably we'd both agree that memory is a big part of that.","458":"Right, like it reminds me so much of, you know, what we in the field would refer to as statistical learning. On one hand we might have like a one-shot memory, a memory of something that we saw yesterday, like what we did or what we ate or where we were. But a lot of our memories and our knowledge instead are based on many, many, many experiences.","459":"Some of those examples really remind me also some of the questions about kind of abnormalities in, in memory or trauma or disruptions in memory and how they also play out in terms of not just what people remember but what they do with those memories right?","460":"I think what we're still kind of trying to understand as a field is the more kind of detailed and bigger picture of where does this model live? How does it get updated based on experiences? Why does that sometimes happen and sometimes not? There are actually people who are born without a hippocampus. They have disruptions to episodic memories. They have trouble after this conversation remembering what the conversation was about, but they do have pretty good semantic information. They have a good sense of knowledge about the world. And that's interesting for two reasons. One, it shows this association between the role of the hippocampus and these two forms of memory, episodic memories and semantic memory. The other reason it's interesting is that people often assume that we get to semantic memory through episodic memory, that we encounter one dog and then another dog, and then another dog and then we learned the concept, the semantic notion of a dog. And these people, their profile suggests that you can learn semantic information. You can learn general knowledge about the world, even without ever having the capacity to build those individual memories.","461":"You know when I look back at, some of the work for my own lab and in the field in general, I really feel like some of the most exciting discoveries were not an answer to a question that was around before, but they were discoveries that made us realize we weren't asking the right question. I think one example of that even has to do with the connection between memory and decision-making. There was a discovery about how the striatum responds to rewards and to learning that just all of a sudden flipped the way we thought about the role of reward and learning and memory, and may force us to realize there was something fundamentally connected between these processes. And that discovery just raised a whole new set of questions that didn't exist before.","462":"Yeah it looks really blocky. And it's the same thing not only with shapes and games, but also colors and textures. And this is an especially a big problem in virtual reality because you have no control over where people are gonna go. What they're gonna look at, how close they're gonna get to various objects. So fractals on the other hand are these things that have infinitely, you know, nice details you get closer and closer and closer. And so this is something that can help us solve this problem in computer graphics of generating more detail. One of the reasons why fractals are really nice for computer graphics is because the algorithms that we use to draw images also have this kind of recursive flavor. What's recursion?","463":"They're easy for a computer to execute, right? It just has to run this recursive procedure over and over and over again. We can kind of get as much detail as we want or need. When I think about fractals and kind of what they've done for computer graphics. The example I think is subdivision surfaces. Did you, did you encounter subdivision surfaces in your graphics class at all?","464":"So subdivision surface is a way of describing a smooth shape on a computer rather than some complicated fractal shape. So meshes and computer graphics are usually made of these flat polygons with kind of sharp edges. And so the question is how can I get something nice and round and smooth out of these sharp looking polygons? What I can do is I can start cutting one at a time, the corners of this paper off, it still looks very angular. I still have these really sharp points.","465":"Because I want to draw a smooth curve on the screen, but all my computer can do is draw straight lines. And that's actually too true of GPUs. It's kind of interesting. GPUs are basically really fast machines that can only draw one thing and that's a flat triangle. And so if we keep doing this with our paper, you kind of get pretty quickly the idea of what's gonna happen. So when you go to see a Pixar movie, for instance, every surface has been subdivided down. So you have tiny little triangles called micro polygons that are even smaller than the size of a pixel.","466":"Well, because people who really need to use these subdivision services for everything, people who worked hard over the years to make this super, super fast. In fact, subdivision services were invented basically at Pixar. There's this guy, Ed Capel, and he was harshly responsible for one of the most famous kinds of subdivision surfaces called Capel Clark subdivision surfaces. And in fact recently won the touring award for these subdivision services.","467":"Well, we're gonna be talking about computers here today, and we're gonna be talking about the internet. I always like to think of the internet by analogy to say road systems for example, where you have roads in your neighborhood. You have state roads, you have the Interstate Highway System. And so the internet is a lot like that. It's an interconnection of local roads, local networks like the network in your house for example.","468":"We could talk about that by analogy to a road system. It's not just one big, super highway. It's a lot of smaller super highways that are all interconnected. And those interchanges are what are called routers. That's where the links come together. You're talking about talking to a friend in Australia. So oh, it's coming in from the East Coast of the United States to this router, and it's going out say, that routers in San Francisco, it's going out on an underseas cable over to Australia rather than in this direction up to Japan.","469":"The underseas cables are so cool! They're these big cables that are laid down by switches. They cross both the Atlantic, the Pacific, the Indian Ocean. So the undersea cables are how the networks in Europe, United States, Asia are all connected together.","470":"That's really what we call the first hop. It's like from your phone, from your tablet, from the computer that you're on, there's no cables coming in. You go over a wireless connection. Wi-Fi is the protocol that allows your computer to talk to that first hop router over a wireless communication link.","471":"Ah, you said they're all in one spot. In fact, they're in lots of spots in Netflix. And so most applications would like to connect you with a server that's close to you. Server is really just a big computer with a lot of memory, a lot of discs that store all the Netflix movies, and also so that you don't have to cross over too many internet links to get from where the server is to the TV or the device in your home.","472":"One thing I find really fascinating about robotics is that the things that are so simple for us, like feeding yourself broccoli, so second nature to us, are really hard for robotics. When you try to take a robot and train it to do a task and simulation, and the simulation isn't perfectly accurate, it's really hard to actually model the physics of how tofu crumbles.","473":"I think I have a somewhat similar perspective to you in that, if we provide more structure and support, and sort of forms of prior knowledge or experience in the algorithm, that should make it more efficient. And so if we can acquire those kinds of priors about the world and about interaction from previous data, maybe offline data, then I think we should be able to make learning of new tasks more efficient.","474":"So over the past four levels, we've been talking about Moravec's paradox. I'm curious to get your perspective. There are still a lot of open questions for how to leverage previous experience and learn cumulatively over time.","475":"That notion of hierarchy is really interesting, because it is these higher level things, like playing chess, for example, that are easier for AI systems. And the reason why they're easier is that we're providing the abstraction for the system already, then when we give the game of chess to an AI system, we abstract away all the challenges of like picking up pieces and moving them, and we say, 'Okay, there's this board of however many boxes on it.' And you just need to figure out within that very narrow, small world, what to do. But handling and learning what those abstractions should be and handling everything from low level sensory inputs to that higher level processing is really, really hard.","476":"Yeah. It is exactly using quantum phenomena to sense and measure things and the idea is that, if I can harness quantum phenomena and I can push the limits that are possible, I can get something that's ultimately more precise and potentially more accurate over time too.","477":"So I study spins. And so, spins are one of the platforms that people have suggested is a useful platform for building quantum technologies and I study spins on the solid state. And one of the platforms I work on is nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond.","478":"So in some sense, the phenomena we're studying essentially is nuclear magnetic resonance or electron spin resonance which is a very similar phenomena, but uses the spin of the electron rather than the spin of the nuclei.","479":"So that's in some ways the key to both quantum sensing, as well as quantum computing. It's the idea that you can take a system and put it in a superposition of two states. Normally we think of classically a bit can be a zero or a one. So switch is either on or off. Whereas in a quantum system, it can be in what's called a superposition. So it can be partially on and partially off. But one of the challenges with quantum systems is that these superpositions are really hard to maintain because we don't see superpositions in the world around us. In quantum computing, you try really hard to isolate everything so that you can maintain this quantum property and the fact that it's actually going to lose its quantum properties as it interacts with the world also makes it a great sensor because now you're actually, you're using that fact that it's interacting with the world to say, wait, it's sensing something.","480":"So rather than trying to build a lot of complex algorithms and gates with it, what you do is, you take these quantum bits and you take them out into the world and say, what do you see? What are you sensitive to? So you can use an idea called entanglement to make an even more sensitive quantum sensor, but it's even more fragile. So there's always this trade-off between being super fragile and being super sensitive at the same time.","481":"So entanglement is the idea that two particles are correlated. They're essentially in the same quantum state, so that you can't disturb one particle without disturbing the second particle. And so, if I have a large number of quantum sensors that are entangled, then they're all going to interact much more strongly than if I just had one of them interact at a time.","482":"In some ways, it is and you know, atomic clocks are remarkable devices and being able to measure time that precisely has really important consequences. In fact, our old GPS system is based on the accuracy of atomic clocks. They're a set of satellites, each of which has an atomic clock on board and they send out a timestamp and so, once it gets a signal from three different satellites, it can triangulate and figure out exactly where you are. Now, if you could make those clocks even more precise, you could actually accurately position where you are even more accurately.","483":"So some ways, you know, when atomic clocks were designed and built, we didn't necessarily think of GPS, but technology often works that way is that, there are new discoveries and then someone else comes along and says, hey, this is a great tool for some other application.","484":"Our topic today is quantum sensing. So quantum is about the study of stuff that's really, really, really small and sensing is about measuring. So the word sensing comes from kind of like our senses. So do you know what your five senses are?","485":"Touch, exactly. So it's kind of really important for us to be able to have these senses, so we know what's happening in the world around us, right? In doing quantum sensing is we're trying to measure things that can be hard to see. Let me show you. Can you see inside it with your eyes?","486":"You wouldn't be able to see into the middle. If you had the right tools, you could start to think about ways to look inside the ball without cutting it open. That would then, you'd still have your ball. We could still play with it.","487":"For example, we want to go inside, let's say the human body and see what's happening. Sometimes we can look under the surface of the Earth and see what's underneath it. We can make really, really precise clocks that will tell us, that can measure time really, really accurately. And we can make very, very fine measurements that'll tell us about the rules of science and how the world works around us. But we need to build better tools that allow us to do that.","488":"Like how can that possibly be? What I wanna do is prove to you that I know this combination without revealing the combination to you. And what you could do is you could write a little note, a secret that I definitely wouldn't know. Fold it up, stick it in here. And then, if I know the combination, I should be able to open it and tell you what you wrote. All right. There we go. All right. So,My dog is named Doug. Did you figure out what the combination was?","489":"So you're asking like, why shouldn't I just share my secrets with somebody? People don't trust each other. And if I was able to prove that I've done something correctly to someone without having to reveal my secrets, then that person would trust me more.","490":"What would you guys do? You'd probably first get together and like, figure out some secret code, right? And then like, write messages to each other in that code. But what if you've never met the person before? What if you wanna exchange secret messages with me and we've never met each other before? How could we possibly do that?","491":"But it's not. You wouldn't use like, a physical lock, or a physical box. We would instead use mathematics to do these kinds of things. You could take a message and encrypt it using mathematics. And then, I could prove to you that I know the key, I could open it up, and send it back to you. That way I would be proving to you that I know the mathematical key to the mathematical lockbox. So based on what we've discussed today, in your own words, what is a zero-knowledge proof.","492":"Yeah, and probably nobody is. Have you heard a lot in your studies about these super massive black holes that we think lurk in the centers of very nearly every galaxy?","493":"Yeah, I think it's a really good question. The only mechanism that we know for sure can form black holes is to collapse of very massive stars. So it's sensible to think, well maybe some very massive stars in a young universe collapsed under their own weight and then they merged and after some time they got big enough, but the black holes from stars can be tens of times the mass of the sun, maybe hundreds of times to the mass of the sun if they merge. To get to millions and billions, and if you just do the simple arithmetic of how many years that would take, there aren't enough years in the 14 billion years of the universe's lifetime. So they must have come from somewhere else.","494":"There might be many alternate routes. It might be in the very early universe that bubbles in unusual phase transitions from very high energy universe to a low energy universe can make black holes. Like, we haven't really thought of the range of possibilities.And so there could also be primordial black holes that are still around that also skipped the star stage altogether that were formed really in the very earliest phases. And I think the interesting thing is, with your looking at like the Large Magellanic Cloud, is to wonder if we're gonna merge.","495":"But when we do merge with Andromeda, presumably our black holes will merge and Andromeda indeed has a very big black hole as well at its center. And then we'll have this just gigantic-","496":"Yeah, and it's very possible that as you said, the collision won't be so severe that it'll be very disruptive. So our entire solar system could stay intact and here we would go with the sun and all the other planets in orbit around a new black hole.","497":"We work a lot right now on thinking of black holes as batteries. So a black hole that can take, like a giant magnet, astronomical magnet in the form of another collapsed star, like a neutron star, and flip it around so fast, near the speed of light, that it actually creates an electronic circuit out of this moving magnet. And so that the power that can come out of these electronic circuits created by these batteries can be tremendous.","498":"Right, and it allows you to prove that you've been behaving honestly, without revealing any of the secrets involved that you use to actually behave honestly. So we of course know that zero-knowledge proofs for NP-complete languages plays such a huge role in cryptography. I'm curious. What was your first experience with Np-completeness like?","499":"Exactly. Right. Because random is unpredictable and that's what we want. Right. We want that unpredictability around us to be utilized, to actually hide the information that we wanna hide. How have you used your knowledge in the projects that you've worked on? What are the challenges that you find?","500":"And also in the blockchain space, for example, if you wanna speed up the generation of proofs, if that could be done in a distributed way, then that would be great. One of the hopes that I have is that the power of multi-party computation is about bringing people together who are mutually distrustful.","501":"It's a great analogy. You know I remember when I first learned of your work, for me as somebody who studies learning and memory, which are processes that are all about rapid updating that to me was really mind blowing that we can now start asking questions about dynamics of circuits on a timescale that's much closer to the timescale of human thought than anything we had before.","502":"So actually, in the blockchain space is one of the spaces where we are seeing zero-knowledge proofs being implemented. And I think it's just the beginning. Let's talk about zero-knowledge proofs. At its core, a zero-knowledge proof is an interaction between two people. Then I should be able to convince you that some statement is true, but you won't have any idea why it's true.","503":"What you're basically asking is, wait, what? Right? Right. So this is what makes zero-knowledge proof so fascinating, and so counter-intuitive. And I think the best way I can explain it to you is by means of an example. But before we do that, I have to decide what I'm gonna prove to you in a, with a zero-knowledge proof.","504":"And the way we're gonna approach this is through something called NP-completeness. What an NP-complete problem is, it's a problem that's really hard to solve. But if you can solve it, you can solve any problem that's in the class NP. And that includes a vast number of problems. And what we're gonna do is we're gonna use an NP-complete problem to actually prove an incredible variety of statements through a zero-knowledge proof. And the specific Np-complete problem that we're gonna be looking at is called map three-coloring. Okay, so here we have a map. Okay. And these are a bunch of countries. And we've arranged them so that no countries that have the same color share a border. That's what makes a map like this validly colored. And now you might think, well, why should we care? It turns out that whether or not a map can be three-colored in this way is an example of an NP-complete problem. And it turns out that, you know, maybe what you really wanna do, is you wanna give a zero-knowledge proof that you have at least 0.3 Bitcoins, right? That would be cool.","505":"Right? So you have a little bit of confidence, right, that I have managed to color this correctly. but not that much confidence. 'Cause I've only shown you two of the countries.","506":"Right? So now, of course, one way to get more confidence is to open up more of them for you, but that would be revealing information to you. I don't wanna do that. So instead, I'm gonna ask you to please turn around. And now, let's change up these colors. Can you pick two countries at random and we'll reveal two of the colors again.","507":"But as you'll see, now it's not green, it's blue. And this one on the other hand, is green. Okay. The colors I showed you last time, don't work with these new colors, right? This wouldn't have worked before.","508":"Exactly. Right. But it works for this coloring that I'm showing you right now. So what we've done is we've made it impossible for you to put the pieces together. And if you do this, let's say, a thousand times. And if I correctly showed you different colors, each thousand times, you'd be really convinced. And that's it. That's the entire zero-knowledge proof.","509":"It's not about making something more efficient. It's about doing things that we just didn't know how to do before. I can actually prove to you without revealing to you any of my secrets that I use to behave honestly. Right? I could prove to you that I signed some encrypted document correctly. Right? Without revealing to you what that secret document was. That ability to change the game. Like, really just change what we can do is what zero-knowledge brings to the table.","510":"One great example is like in elections. If you could prove that an election was correctly conducted. That every vote was counted, and it all added up to one person winning with a particular total, in zero-knowledge, then you don't have to give up the actual votes of any person. And yet everyone could see that, hey, yeah, it was done correctly.","511":"So one of my main research areas is something called category theory, it's been described as the mathematics of mathematics. It's a language that can be used to prove very general theorems. And an interesting aspect of being a researcher in category theory that doesn't come up as much in other areas is that we have to really pay attention to the axioms of set theory in our work. When you're proving theorems, have you ever used the axiom of choice?","512":"So the way I think about it is if you have an infinite or an arbitrary family of sets and you know for sure that none of these sets are empty, then a choice function would allow you to select an element from each set sort of all at once. When you've used the axiom of choice in proofs, do you know which incarnation of this you've used?","513":"So there are three well-known famous equivalent forms of the axiom of choice. The well ordering principle is the assumption, the axiom that any set can be well ordered, but there are lots of subsets of real numbers that do not have a minimal element. So that ordering is not a well ordering. So here's the key question. Do you believe the axiom of choice?","514":"You do believe the axiom of choice, though it leads us to some strange conclusions. So if the axiom choice is true, then it's necessarily the case that there exists a well ordering of the reals. And what that means is that we can perform induction over real numbers like we perform induction over the natural numbers. This is trans-finite induction. It would work for any ordinal. So there must be some uncountably infinite ordinal that represents the order type of the real numbers. And this allows us to prove some crazy things. Imagine three-dimensional Euclidean space. So the space that we live in, extending infinitely in all directions. So it is possible to completely cover three-dimensional Euclidean space by disjoint circles, so infinitesimal circles, disjoint circles of radius one. So what that means is you can put a circle somewhere in space and then put a second circle somewhere in space that can't intersect with the first one because these are solid circles and then another circle can somehow cover every single point in space with no gaps in between.","515":"So Cantor's diagonal argument can be abstracted and then generalized to prove that for an arbitrary set A, its power set has a strictly larger cardinality. And since that's true for any set, we can just iterate this process. When set theory was being discovered or invented or created in the late 19th century, one of the natural question to ask is can there be a universe of all sets? This comes up in my research in category theory because even though there is no set of all sets, we would really like for there to be a category of sets. So what category theorists need to do to make their work rigorous is to add additional axioms to set theory. One of my favorites was introduced by an algebraic geometer Alexander Grothendieck. This is something that we sometimes call a Grothendieck universe, or also an inaccessible cardinal. It's an infinite number that is so big that it cannot be accessed by any of the other constructions within set theory. It's so big that we'll never get to it and this allows us to contemplate the collection of all sets whose cardinality is bounded by this size that will never reach.","516":"So what you're describing is the famous Hawking radiation where a black hole cleverly kind of steals energy from the quantum vacuum and radiates and in the process of evaporates. And of course this caused a big kerfuffle because when the black hole evaporates, eventually that event horizons is yanked up. And the question is, where did everything go that had once fallen in?","517":"So a fractal is something that we see every day, but it's a little bit hard to describe. It's it's a shape that if you look at it really far away, or you look at it really up close, it has kind of a similar appearance. And actually that word fractal sounds a little bit like fraction.","518":"And that's kind of what we're gonna try out today. In fact, we're gonna have you build a fractal. A tree is a really good example of a fractal because if you look at the whole tree and then you break off a big branch of the tree.","519":"So your tree is totally beautiful, but it took a long time to make, right. How would you feel if I said, now you have to make a thousand of those trees.","520":"Yeah, it's a ton of work. If you think about Moana's island, it has these tens and hundreds of thousands of trees on it. And that's why we need computers to help us out because computers are really good at taking these really simple rules, like put two branches on every other branch and doing it really, really fast.","521":"Like coding, exactly. That's what actually a lot of the artists for the movies are working with code rather than with a paintbrush. So in your own words, how would you describe a fractal to somebody?","522":"We're used to ethernet cables that can handle many hundreds of gigabits per second over a wired device. What are the typical data rates for IoT devices? I mean, not hundreds of gigabits.","523":"My sense is you're spot on, that they'll produce over time, a lot of data. And that a lot of IoT is about computing on that data. That computation happened mostly at the edge, or somehow a combination between the edge and something happening in a far away data center.","524":"it's something that we've already figured out for classical computing like something that amazes me is all the parallels between what we're going through now for quantum computing and what we went through for classical computing","525":"exactly so i think something that frustrates a lot of people about quantum computing is the concept of decoherence right you can only keep your information quantum for so long right and that limits how many operations you can do in a row before you lose your information","526":"it let's talk about some of the things we think need to happen between now and fully fault tolerant quantum computers to get us to that reality i mean there's so many things that need to happen in my mind one of the things we need to do is build all these different layers of abstraction that make it easier for programmers to come in and just enter at the ground level you know","527":"you know now that everybody around the world can access a quantum computer through the cloud people are doing all kinds of cool things they're building games we've seen the emergence of quantum gains right what do you think people want to do with them","528":"And things that are hard for humans should also be hard for robots and humans to do. But it turns out that it's actually the opposite. I wanna try a little demo.","529":"So I have a penny in my hand and I'd like you to pick it up with your right hand and put it into your left hand. So that was pretty easy, right?","530":"We're gonna make this a little bit harder now. So, can you put these on? And we'll try to do the same thing again with your eyes closed. There you go. Let's try that one more time, and see if you can do any better. So close your eyes.","531":"Yeah. So that you're able, with a bit more practice, you're able to figure it out. When it fell on the ground, how did you know to pick it up off the ground?","532":"So when a robot tries to do something, like pick up an object, not only do you need to program exactly like what the motors should do, the robot also needs to be able to see where the object is. Then this is what's called a perception action loop in robotics. So if the object moves, the robot can then adapt what it's doing and change what it's doing to successfully pick up the object. It's really important for robots to be able to leverage, not just like the past hour of experience, but also ideally many years of experience, in order to do the kinds of things that you did.","533":"That's a great question. So in reinforcement learning, the robot tries the task, and then it gets some sort of reinforcement, some sort of feedback. It's similar to how you might train a dog.","534":"We give robots a camera and the camera produces this array of numbers. Basically, each pixel has three different numbers, one for R, for G and for B. And so the robot sees this really massive set of numbers. And it has to be able to figure out, from that massive set of numbers, what is in the world. There is a number of different ways to have the robot see, but we use a technique called neural networks, that tries to take out in those big numbers and form representations of the objects in the world, and where those objects are.","535":"Or you don't even need computers. Like I remember when I was a kid, I played electric guitar and I had all these guitar pedals with different effects and oh, what happens if you put the output back in the input and just run it through itself, you're gonna start hearing this kind of fractal sound, right? So today we've been telling people, fractals are things that are somehow self-similar, they have detail at all scales. Are there other ways you might introduce fractals to somebody or are there other things you might say, this is what a fractal is?","536":"I think about like the scale and variance of different physical equations, like navier-stokes is, you know, kind of scale and variant, you know, this Reynolds number that tells you how viscous things are, but you can have the same kind of fluid behavior at all different scales. And that's why you get turbulence at all different scales.","537":"I think that's also, what's so beautiful about fractals is that, you know, if you think about sort of the history of geometry as well, Felix Klein was looking at geometry by saying, well, geometry is all about in variance. I have some group of transformations and I look at objects that are sort of in variant with respect to these transformations. So if you just look at translations, okay, what kinds of shapes remain the same under translations? Will you get tiling? You get wallpaper. And if you start asking that same question, what if I allow scaling in my transformations then boom, you have fractal.","538":"Now you work on kind of the future of virtual reality and augmented reality and extended reality. But it's kind of interesting because I think if I think about exploring these infinite fractal landscapes in some way, they still feel a little bit lonely or they feel a little bit poor of the kind of richness that we have in the real world.","539":"People outside of computer graphics and engineering and science and so forth have also thought a lot about and used fractals as a language for talking about nature, for characterizing shapes and behaviors and so forth tissue or friction, or all sorts of really important phenomena. Do you think that computer graphics has kind of dropped the ball in terms of saying, you know, this is not something that's exciting anymore to work on procedural descriptions and we're, we're moving on from that?","540":"So one of the things I guess that touches on is this question about controllability or the ease of, with which everybody can create these worlds. Not just people, not just mathematicians, not just, you know, trained computer scientists. One thing when I think about Ken Musgraves working about this program, Bryce, this one I felt like I could really use, what do you think we still need to do in terms of putting these kinds of tools in, in people's hands, making it easier for people to use procedural machine learning, to build these kind of worlds?","541":"Yeah. And I think this is what what's so beautiful also about Mandelbrot's work is him saying, you know, it's not really about these exotic examples. Like even the Mandelbrot set or Julia sets or whatever. Yeah they're like really interesting mathematical curiosities, but they get at this idea that fractals are kind of inevitable. And Bob Ross probably never, as far as I know, never sat down and you know, thought about recursive descriptions of trees or anything like that. But it's just something that naturally comes to you as an artist.","542":"And on one hand memory is like a record of something that happened in the past that we can carry with us and we can like bring it back to mind. And on the other hand we need to be a little bit suspicious sometimes because we might get it wrong. In what world would that memory of the orange juice maybe be useful?","543":"Sometimes, you know, memory is doing something much simpler but no less important for us, which is it's helping us figure out what's good and what's bad. And if we can remember what's good and what's bad from what we did in the past, that can help us make decisions about what to do next time. So Dylan, you may be surprised to learn this, but we asked your mom what some of your favorite candies are. So you have to make a decision between these two candies and whichever one you pick, you actually get to take with you.","544":"There you go, there is your decision. Okay, you can take those. It took you some time there. You looked like you were really working hard at that problem. And that's interesting because actually we know that from research that when people have to make a decision between two things they like equally, some people like economists think oh those are the easiest decisions because they're both good options. But as psychologists and neuroscientists we know it's the opposite. One of the reasons is because there's no simple answer of like I know that one's better I'm just gonna go with it. And so we think that that's the kind of decision where memory is especially important because you have to kind of come up with more information.","545":"Everything you just said is exactly what we know from research. All the thoughts running through your mind, were really at kind of about a prediction into the future, right? You're like, how, how will this taste if, when it's in my mouth or how will I feel about my decision down the road? You know we think of memory as something in the past, but it's an example of how you use your memories of these two candies to predict what's gonna happen in the future so that you can make a decision in the present. But you did it, you made your way through that torture. And now you've got to keep the candy.","546":"I love math for the same reason. Today, I'm gonna tell you about a thing called zero-knowledge proof. So in a zero-knowledge proof, there are two people. There's a prover and a verifier. And I wanna prove that something is true to you. But the weird thing is, I wanna prove to you that it's true without telling you any reasons why. I remember when I first heard about it, I was like, wait, what? How can that possibly be? Right?","547":"But what if I could prove to you that I know where the puffin is without revealing to you where it is? Let me show you. I took that photo that we showed you. And I put it behind this poster here. Why don't you go take a look through that hole?","548":"So when you look at this board, we don't know where the photo was, right? Was the photo like with the corner here? In which case the puffin would be all the way at this side. Or was the photo with the corner here? In which case the puffin would be on the other side. So this is a really simple example of a zero-knowledge proof. I convinced you that I knew where the puffin was, but you didn't learn anything else.","549":"When I first learned about them, I just thought they were so cool. But it turns out they're also really useful, not just for finding like, puffins. If you just type in your password and the hacker hacks into the computer, they can just get your password. Right?","550":"What if instead, we could somehow use a zero-knowledge proof to log in. You would just be able to prove that, hey, I'm Chelsea, without revealing anything to them. If you could do that, then it would be amazing, right?","551":"Because then even if the hacker hacked into the computer, he wouldn't learn anything. Because even the computer doesn't learn anything. So Chelsea, in your own words, what is a zero-knowledge proof?","552":"It describes something in AI, which is that things that are really intuitive and easy for humans, are actually really difficult to build into AI systems. And on the flip side, picking up an object, really simple for people, but it's actually really difficult to build that into robotic systems. So do you have any experience working with robots or other AI systems?","553":"Yeah, exactly. One thing that my research has been looking into is, if we can have robots learn from data, we'll collect data from the robot sensors. And if the robot has sensors in its arm, to figure out the angle of one of its wrist, for example, then we'll record that angle. And all of the robots experience will go into a data set, that if we wanted a robot to solve a task, like, I don't know, picking up a cup, and then maybe you want to pick up a different cup, if it only had the data of picking up the first cup, do you think it would be able to perform well on the second cup?","554":"So you can think of robotics as having two core components. One is perception, being able to see and feel and so forth, and action, where the robot actually figures out how to move its arm. And both components are really essential, and both components are quite difficult. If you train a perception system independently of how to choose actions, then it might make errors in a way that mess up the system that selects actions And so if you instead try to train these two systems together, to have it learn perception action for the goal of solving these different tasks, then the robot can be more successful. One thing that's really difficult about robotics is, there actually isn't that much data of robots in the world. On the internet, there's all sorts of text data, all sorts of image data that people upload and write. But there isn't a lot of data of doing a simple thing, like tying your shoe, for example, because it's so basic. One challenge is even just getting data sets that allow us to teach robots to do these simple kinds of tasks.","555":"I would tend to agree that I think, in some sense, anything that uses superposition could be a quantum sensor, but then spectroscopy uses superpositions and has been around for 60, 70 years. I think what excites me most now is the idea that can we push the boundaries of how sensitive one can make this technique? How improving sensitivity, specificity, what other limits and we define it better, are there fundamental physical limits?","556":"So do you think you can integrate multiple NV centers or multiple optical sensors? So are there ways in which you can overcome this question of there's a spot size and that limits how many NVs I can pack into a certain region?","557":"Yeah, that's absolutely right. So infinity gets used a lot of different ways in mathematics. There's a way that mathematicians think of infinity as a number, just like the number 13, just like the number 10 million. So the reason that mathematicians consider infinity to be a number is that it is a size of a set. So the first example of an infinite set in mathematics is the set of all counting numbers. So one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, et cetera. That list goes on forever. That is an infinite set. And to be a little bit more precise, it's a countably infinite set. But as a number, infinity is pretty strange.","558":"Adding infinities. Multiplying infinities. And there's a sense in which it's very similar to the arithmetic that you learned about already. But it's also totally different. It has some very weird properties. Welcome to Hilbert's Hotel. Unlike an ordinary hotel, has accountably infinitely many rooms. Suppose a new guest shows up, you might think that the new guest could take the room that's all the way down at the end of the hall, all the way at infinity, except there isn't a room like that. The rooms each have a number, and even though there's infinitely many rooms, each room is only a finite distance away. So here's how we're gonna make room for the new guest. I'm gonna ask the guest in room one to move into room two, and then we're gonna ask the guest in room two to move into room three, and we'll continue this all the way along. It looks to me like there's space for the new guest. Where is it?","559":"Room number one. Exactly. I'm gonna use this symbol for infinity, but what we've just shown is that one, the one new guest plus infinity is equal to the same infinity. What happens if we had a second guest?","560":"Absolutely. So now I'm gonna make this story a little more complex. That there's another Hilbert's Hotel down the street and they're having plumbing issues and we need to find room for them.","561":"They can't live together. That would be a great solution. I don't know. I think these people don't really get along. So I need to somehow create infinitely many new rooms, but I can only ask each person in the hotel to move a finite distance away. So let's take the guest who is originally in room one and move them into room two. So that's creating one new space for us. And I'm gonna take the guest who was originally in room two and move them into room four. Are you starting to see a pattern here?","562":"Yeah, I'm increasing by one more each time. So I'm doubling the room number in fact. So this is some of the strange arithmetic of infinity. So we have two Hilbert Hotels, each of which have infinitely many guests, then this is equal to?","563":"Infinity, great. Hilbert's Hotel is a story that mathematicians have been telling themselves for almost 100 years because it's a really visceral way to think about some of the counterintuitive properties of the arithmetic of infinity.","564":"The internet is, physically, these computers that all talk to each other. Billions of computers, in the case of the internet. The internet allows us to do a lot of really, really interesting, what we call applications. You ever think about how that video gets to you over the internet?","565":"Matilda. All right. We're gonna actually build an internet. I've got a couple of things here that I wanna show you, or a couple of toys, actually. Okay, let's pretend that these round balls are computers. And the internet is something that connects them. And right now, the internet is just one communication link. And Matilda is sent over the internet from this computer to your computer. So the internet is a network for carrying information from one computer to another. Now this network here looks pretty simple, doesn't it? Right? It's just one thing. Should we add some more friends in?","566":"That's right. So that's pretty cool. There are actually lots of different ways to actually go through the internet to get from what we call a source, the place that's sending the information, to the receiver, the place that's actually gathering the information together. And that's something we actually call routing.","567":"Yeah. So that's a really good observation. In most pieces of the internet, that's exactly what would happen. We want to take what's called a shortest path. But still, there are multiple paths. And why do you think that might be valuable?","568":"Exactly. So, Skylar, that was a great discussion about what we just built. And I wanted to talk to you about, or ask you about maybe one other really important part about networks. And it's not so much the thing itself, the physical thing, but more about the rules about communication. That's governed by something that are called protocols. Are you up for one?","569":"Lettuce go on. [Skylar and Jim laughing] A knock, knock joke is an example of a protocol, right? The computer that you are using say, makes a request, you ask for something, you get something in return. In the internet, there are protocols everywhere. So that two computers that have never talked to each other before know the rules for talking to each other. This global internet with billions of people using it are just lots of smaller networks that are all hooked together to each other. But also, what the internet allows are all of these what we call applications, Zoom, video playing services, can all run on top of the same internet.","570":"We're in level five now. So you're the expert-expert. I'm a huge fan of the work that you did in RCP, the Routing Control Platform being a precursor to software-defined networking and the notion that rather than having protocols actually always compute things, that we could compute things in data centers. I'd be interested if you could sort of just reflect back on that time and sort of the beginnings of SDN and where it's come since then.","571":"Right, so some people have called that the flattening of the internet, right? I think it used to be on average, you would go through 10 different networks to get from a source to a destination.","572":"And certainly, we've heard about some countries that impose firewalls that don't let certain kinds of traffic out, or certain kinds of traffic in. So there's no global body that is regulating that?","573":"I mean, even you could just tell that two people are communicating even though the traffic itself is encrypted. So you don't know what they're saying, just even knowing two devices are communicating.","574":"You're one of the most awesome networking researchers that I know. I'm curious, just to pick your brain, what do you think are some of the hot topics in networking research? Where do you think the field is heading?","575":"You know, we've had cellular networks now for 20, 30 years. So when we hear about 5G, what's trumpeted the most is the fact that oh, super high bandwidth, right? But I sense that the exciting things are more than just the network being faster.","576":"So a lot of times stars are born together in two star systems and when they die, if they're heavy enough, they will collapse under their own weight and form a black hole. So here you have a black hole and a big fluffy star. And what will happen is it'll start to tear apart its neighboring star. Literally parts of the star will begin to spill onto the black hole and splatter on the black hole. But let's say both those stars formed black holes. And what these black holes do is they are like mallets on a drum. They create literally waves in the shape of spacetime as they're moving. So imagine mallets on a drum, how the drum ripples. Depending on how the mallets are moving you hear different sounds. So effectively these black holes, as they get very close together in the final stages of their life together, they're orbiting each other at hundreds of times a second. It's this really crazy event, but it's happening in complete darkness. Eventually they bobble together and they merge and then they wring out, the spacetime's going crazy around them, it's this storm in spacetime, and they settle down to a quiet black hole. Then those waves that they created travel through the universe, basically undisturbed. For a long time people thought, well, even if black holes are out there, they're impossible to observe. And then they got very clever. You might wonder how we could possibly hear black holes, that sounds crazy. So I'm gonna show you, but I'm gonna need your help. This demo involves an electric guitar. Do you play at all?","577":"Okay, you wanna do the demo for me? So the LIGO instrument electronically records the ringing of the shape of space with its very complicated instrument. It stands for Laser Interferometric Gravitational-Waves Observatory and the design was incredibly difficult and they didn't know if they would succeed. I think of the instrument as like the body of the electric guitar. And then they take the readout of the motions of the waves that they're recording, just like that guitar is recording the motions of the waves on the string. Now just play it like a little bit. And you can't hear anything, right? You're not meant to hear an electric guitar when it's not plugged in. What's happening is the guitar strings are ringing, but so quietly that we can't actually hear the sound. And this is like the gravitational waves, which are ringing the drum of spacetime, but so quietly that they're not move the air and we're not hearing them. So now play and I'm gonna turn the volume up a little bit. While I can't actually hear the ringing of the strings themselves, I can hear the data of the shape of the string recorded and played through this amplifier. And that's kind of the idea behind the LIGO instrument.","578":"That's the computer science brain thinking right there. So we wanna think of a function as procedure or mapping between sets. So a function defines a one-to-one correspondence if it defines a perfect matching between the elements of its domain set and the elements of its output set. We call such functions bijections or isomorphisms. So the reason I'm so interested in this idea of a bijective function or a one-to-one correspondence that guarantees that every element of one set gets matched with an element of the other set, no matter how many elements there are, these bijections or these one-to-one correspondences as they help mathematicians reason about infinity.","579":"Today we're gonna think about infinity as a cardinality, which is a technical term for a number that could be a size of a set. And we're gonna use this idea of one-to-one correspondence to try and investigate the question of whether all infinite sets have the same size. So what I've drawn here are some pictures of some of the infinite sets that appear in mathematics. So the natural numbers are the prototypical example of an infinite set. So the natural numbers are clearly a subset of the integers. Both of these are infinite sets. Are they the same size infinity or different size infinities?","580":"I'm gonna now try and convince you that they are in fact the same size infinity. And this is using this idea of a one-to-one correspondence which was applied in this context by Georg Cantor. What he says is if we can match up the elements of the integers with the elements of the natural numbers so that there's nothing left over, so that there's a bijective function between them, then that's a proof that there's exactly as many natural numbers as there are integers. Start by matching zero with zero and one with one. But then we wanna include the negatives in the list. So which natural number would we match with negative one?","581":"Maybe two. Why not? Because now we're starting to make progress on matching all the negatives. We can match the natural number three with the integer two, the natural number four with the integer minus two. And do you see a pattern?","582":"Great. So now I have a much harder question. So we have the same challenge, again, evidently there are way, way, way more rational numbers than there are integers. Does that mean this is a larger infinite set than the integers? What do you think?","583":"Yeah, that's exactly right. And now for each pair of integers, I'm gonna represent it by a corresponding natural number. That's what's going on with this counting. And when I compose those operations, what I've done is I've encoded rational numbers as natural numbers in a way that reveals that they can be no larger, there are no more rational numbers than natural numbers.","584":"Exactly. That's exactly right. So we were hoping to compare the size of infinity of the rational numbers with the size of infinity of the natural numbers. What we've done is introduced an intermediate set, these pair of integer points, and this proves that this size of infinity is smaller than this size of infinity. Since we also have an injective function the other way, this size of infinity is smaller than this size of infinity so therefore they must be the same size.","585":"Now there's one final collection of numbers that we haven't yet discussed, which are the real numbers, all of the points on the number line. Do you think that's the same size infinity?","586":"Great. That's exactly right. So what we've proven is that this number is missing, and therefore it is impossible to define a bijection between the natural numbers and the real numbers.","587":"So we've started to explore some of the counterintuitive properties of infinity. On the one hand there are infinite sets that feel very different like the natural numbers, the integers, the rational numbers that nevertheless have the same size or the same infinite cardinality. While there are other infinities that are larger. So there's more than one size of infinity, not all infinities are created equal.","588":"and actually machine learning is one research direction where we're really hoping that we're going to find um key parts of the machine learning computation that can be sped up using quantum computing","589":"if you think about even just classical information like bits right at the end of the day when you store a bit in your hard drive there's a magnetic domain and you have a magnetic polarization right","590":"you can change the magnetization to be pointing up or pointing down right quantum systems we're still manipulating a device and changing the quantum state of that of that device you can imagine if it's a spin that you could have spin up and spin down but you can also if you isolate it enough you can have a superposition of up and down","591":"so what we do when we try to solve problems with a quantum computer is we encode parts of the problem we're trying to solve into a complex quantum state and then we manipulate that state to drive it towards what will eventually represent the solution","592":"so you need a chip with qubits each qubit is a carrier of quantum information and the way we control the state of that qubit is using microwave pulses you send them all the way down these cables and we've calibrated these microwave pulses so that we know exactly this kind of pulse what this frequency and this duration will put the cupid into superposition or we'll flip the state of the qubit from zero to one or if we apply a microwave pulse between two qubits we can entangle them","593":"there's sort of two main classes of quantum algorithms there's algorithms which were developed for decades right things like shore's algorithm which is for factoring grover's algorithm for unstructured search and these algorithms were designed assuming that you had a perfect fault tolerant quantum computer which is many decades away so we're currently in a phase where we're exploring what can we do with these near-term quantum computers and the answer is going to be well we need different kinds of algorithms to really even explore that question","594":"yeah they also unfortunately require fault tolerance right now the algorithms that we know of today to do those things um on a quantum computer require you to have millions of error-corrected qubits today we're at like 50. it's actually amazing that we're at 50. there's things that we know or we have strong reason to believe um are going to be faster to do on a quantum computer and then there's things that we'll discover just by virtue of having one"},"dialogue":{"0":"Explainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Only until I started listening to singing, like barbershop quartet, and, and as I was a violinist as well--\nExplainer: Right.\n","1":"Explainer: Right.\nExplainee: Then I finally understood the idea where the overtone series came from that if a bunch of singers were to nail a chord or have it perfectly tuned, the overtones, you would hear a tone that necessarily wasn't being produced by one the singers.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Yeah.\nExplainer: I think that people forget that you can work with the notes you already have by just rearranging them, just the simple idea of inversion, inversion of the simple triad, of F major. \u266aI once was lost and now I'm found \u266a \u266a Was blind \u266a \u266a But now I see \u266a Now how home do I want to go here, you know? Is there another verse to come?\n","2":"Explainer: Yeah. The amazing thing about harmony is that it exists in nature. So, take the harmonic series of the note F, for example. Okay. You have the ups on the fifth and the fourth and then the, (hums) That seemed a little bit sharp, but that's fine. And then tones get increasingly small. Beneath that note, you have the undertone series, which essentially is like a reflection of something. In the same way that when a tree grows in nature, you have the branches which grow upwards and the roots which go downwards. So it's quite a nice thing to thing about, this being the key center, the floor, the ground, and then these two different directions of ways in which it can express itself, and the differences in the sensations with that. Lots of the time I think when it comes to reharmonization or harmonization, people think that the solution to the problems come when we add more notes.\nExplainee: Yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Right.\nExplainer: Because I can delay the gratification of going home. First of all, just by using inversions, even before we add the notes to the chord. One thing that I was very joyful to discover is that every single melody note works with every single base note.\n","3":"Explainer: I think that people forget that you can work with the notes you already have by just rearranging them, just the simple idea of inversion, inversion of the simple triad, of F major. \u266aI once was lost and now I'm found \u266a \u266a Was blind \u266a \u266a But now I see \u266a Now how home do I want to go here, you know?

(laughs) A flat soft, A flat major seven. A flat major seven sharp five, with a sharp 11. Essentially, what that demonstrates is that every note and every base note are compatible. So once we realize this its like, that's great! Now what should we do? What, how, what should we, what should we, how, what am I supposed to do? What to do, right. And sometimes the paralyzing thing when it comes to arranging, there are too many options, too many things are possible.

Obviously, with material odds, it's gonna be one part of the training, and other part of the training that I find interesting is like, you know, to find positions from, let's say, real life tournaments. And I've been doing that actually from this recent tournament that's going on in Isle of Man, playing out some of those fascinating positions and just seeing what the computer does, and he's like coming up with resources that you would never think of, you know?\nExplainer: Today, we've been talking a lot about how chess is kind of a mix of tactics versus strategy.

So what is chess to you?\nExplainee: Well, the way my coach explained chess to me that really seems intuitive is that chess is a game of time, space, and harmony. You have one turn to get things done, right? Obviously you try to make it as efficient as possible. We have the saying in chess that, you know, you lost by one tempo, by one move. Space. You know, we have a game of 64 squares, right? So control over these 64 squares is what the game is about. You can get control in moving up your pawns. You can get control by winning opponent's material, right? So obviously, that's another big element that we're fighting over, and harmony is basically like you got this army of pieces, right? Your job is to make them work well with each other, coordinate them, and build that beautiful picture of harmony that, you know, all chess players aim for and are so pleased when they can finally achieve.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Harmony trumps everything. Like you could be winning when it's not your turn, and you're like totally behind on material. So it shows you that harmony is the end goal.

Probably.\nExplainee: E5 looks a little dangerous, but I guess we can analyze that later. All right, so what are you threatening? At the moment, not much, yeah? If I take an E5, it gets very boring.

Okay, I have a personal question now.\nExplainee: Yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: In terms of the grand title, that's like, I think, everyone's personal journey, right? It can take some people longer. I actually did it very late in my life. I don't know, Levy, if you know this, but I made grandmaster when I was 29. Most people, if they don't do it by the time they're like 20, they'll probably never do it. In terms of becoming a grandmaster, really, that's the time and the commitment. I think if you're an international master like you are, like everything is within reach. Like you've already played chess long enough in your life. You're close enough to that level that, really, it's gonna be little things like putting in the time, going to the best tournaments, and getting the best competition, and just maybe getting a good coach to help you as well. So it's not too late, Levy.\nExplainer: Okay.\n","14":"Explainer: Nine times. So there's a relationship between motion through space, the earth is going through space, and the passage of time. They're kind of connected\nExplainee: Yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Yep.\nExplainer: If I were to ask you to sit perfectly still in space, can you do that? I mean, hold perfectly still. That's good. But if I ask you to hold still in time, to not go to the next second or the next second, can you do that?\n","15":"Explainer: in some way. But there are differences, right? If I asked you to move through space, you could do it freely, right? Can you get up? And let's see how easy it is to move through space. Can you move over to that location? And can you come back? Anything getting in your way? Easy to do?\nExplainee: Yep.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: No.\nExplainer: So there's definitely this difference between space and time, some fundamental quality that distinguishes how freely we can move through space\n","16":"Explainer: What do you know about him?\nExplainee: He has crazy hair.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Okay.\nExplainer: You build a spaceship. You go out into space really quickly. You turn around and you come back to planet Earth, and he showed us that when you're on that ship, your clock will tick off time more slowly. You will age more slowly. So that journey may only take you, say, a year, six months out and six months back, but you know what? When you step out of the ship, it'll be 100 years into the future or 1,000 years, a million years into the future. Would you do that if you could?\n","17":"Explainer: He does have crazy hair, and I think I'm maybe heading in that direction actually.He showed us an approach to travel to the future.

I'd be dead. Everybody else would be dead who stayed on earth, but your body would only age one year, and yet it would be 1,000 years into the future. The question though is, could you get back?

That same guy with the crazy hair, Albert Einstein, showed that there's actually a limit to how fast things can go. And you know what the limit is? The limit is the speed of light, because light travels 671 million miles per hour, that is fast enough to go around the entire earth seven times in one second. So if we could build a spaceship that would go as fast as light, we'd be able to do what Einstein noted. There's something else that's really curious about time. Things tend to go in one direction, and we call it the arrow of time. It sort of points from the past into what we call the future. If you're to ask me why is there an arrow to time, ask me.\n","19":"Explainer: No, you'd be alive, that's the amazing thing. I'd be dead.

I think that there are too many, you know, so much of it is associative to what you already know.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Are you still doing EM or?\nExplainer: Yeah. We do a lot of X-ray in addition to EM and this is actually, I'm not saying it's the only problem, but it's the only problem that needs to be solved right away, is that the data analysis, right? In fact, I think we calculated that there aren't enough humans ever to map a mouse brain where you collect every connection and et cetera so the problem is to get algorithms to trace, to recognize things in brains the way humans would recognize things in brains, or map things, trace things in brains. It's gonna cost a lot of money to imagine setting the gold standard for the wiring diagram even once and those are the kinds of ethical concerns that I'm worried about.\n","22":"Explainer: So fortunately there's, I'm also doing it from space with the Spitzer Space Telescope, so particularly in the infrared, and my main interest has been to try and study the environment around the super massive black holes, not as close as where the X-rays are coming from, but clearly there's something from the X-ray corona that illuminates the rest of the accretion disk, and the dust that's further out. And so fundamentally, that's one of the key things that I'm trying to use, is trying to see how long, once you've got this sort of pulse that's generated close to the black hole, it propagates out, and so you can use optical wavelengths to see that the accretion disk lights up in the optical a little bit as it gets heated up from the X-ray, and then later on, the infrared dust, the dust absorbs it, and emits it in the infrared. And so that, I love that, the ability to exchange time for resolution, because these structures are so far away that we're never gonna get a telescope big enough where that has the resolution to see the accretion disk, or the dust distribution around--\nExplainee: So do you get dimensions of the disk out of that?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: So you can map out the dust, where do you see it?\nExplainer: So you do see it, basically the dust sublimation radius, and you see it at, and it tells you, depending on what kind of dust it is, and it's actually one of the problems for me studying, whenever we try and do X-ray studies of low luminosity active galactic nuclei in your, by galaxies, because there're all these X-ray binaries that are also emitting X-rays, which make our lives difficult. But they're also in black holes, when it's this really interesting sort of both, it's great, but ugh, it's also a source of noise for those of us who are trying to do X-ray observations of nearby galaxies.\n","23":"Explainer: Yeah, again, we don't know exactly where X, Y, Z, zero is, we're assuming that it's something, you know, the X-rays that are coming out are very close to the event horizon of the black hole, but this is still, you know, your realm of X-rays, to really figure out those kinds of things. But once the X-rays, once the photons hit the corona, and are re-scattered, and up, energized, and then they start illuminating the accretion disk, it heats it up, and so just by the light travel time, when the optical, if it gets, you know, brighter and fainter, and then the infrared gets brighter and fainter, two weeks later, then the dust is two light weeks away from that. So it's a one dimensional one, so we're averaging, so we don't get the two dimensional, or even three dimensional one. And then we've done it now, of course, we have better telescopes, there was a project where you could do it with the Hubble Space Telescope and the ultraviolet, you used the Swift Observatory, which had optical and ultraviolet, and then from ground base, we did optical, and then from space we did it with Spitzer and the infrared. So you could actually see this bright flash go off in a nearby AGN called NGC5548, and then you see it propagate as it warms up the disk, as all that light is falling onto it, and then eventually you hit the, the, further away, where the dust is, and the dust tends to radiate in an infrared. So we got basically a structure, and you just, you see this flashbulb go off, and then it illuminates, effectively, the structure.\nExplainee: So you can map out the dust, where do you see it?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: We have the same problem, we can't see the actual black hole underneath all these very bright X-ray binaries.\nExplainer: It's a weird thing to be sitting in your own galaxy, but not be able to separate all these, four million solar mass black hole creating, next to, how massive, it's like two to three solar masses for the X-ray binaries?\n","24":"Explainer: So you do see it, basically the dust sublimation radius, and you see it at, and it tells you, depending on what kind of dust it is, and it's actually one of the problems for me studying, whenever we try and do X-ray studies of low luminosity active galactic nuclei in your, by galaxies, because there're all these X-ray binaries that are also emitting X-rays, which make our lives difficult.

So that's where we have LIGO, and LIGO has now directly, I mean, this was all theory before, that we knew that this was gonna happen, and never seen it before, so LIGO is now the first time that we have been able to completely verify this theory, that you can have black holes and neutron stars merging together. And so what happens in the case of two neutron stars, when they merge together, now suddenly they become heavier, they become heavy enough to turn into a black hole. And so the first of these events happened in August, and what happened here is you had these two neutron stars that spun around each other, and then they merged, and then for a very short time, we are talking about 100 milliseconds, or tens of 100 milliseconds, it actually remained a neutron star, probably, it was a hyper massive neutron star because it was spinning so fast, it didn't collapse under its own weight. But then, you know, the angular momentum gets dissipated away from the object, and then, at that point, it can't maintain its own weight, and then it collapses, and turn into a black hole. All this theory that we knew about is now finally being, being validated.\nExplainer: Which is great, although it still doesn't help us in the AGN community, because we don't know how the millions to billions solar mass black holes came to be. But it's, at least we're building up, or hopefully that at some point, and by understanding these lower mass, how these lower mass black holes came to be, then we can see where there are a large scale number of mergers can potentially give us this, or you really need something, other, another corridor to fundamentally get us something that's a million solar masses, you know, on the minimum side, but definitely, you know, we've gotten those which are billion. So we know we can merge the million solar mass black holes to get the bigger ones, but how do you get to those in the beginning, particularly so early in the universe, when you get quasars at really high red shifts, so they're really early on.\n","25":"Explainer: And this goes to the idea that you don't have a core balance, that a supernova with a black hole as its final result, actually never has any kind of expulsion, that it all just goes. (imitates sucking)\nExplainee: Yeah, that might be, yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","26":"Explainer: [Sean] Being four dimensional, right?\nExplainee: Mm-hmm.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Okay.\nExplainer: Let's bring one in. All right. The thing about relativity is that they really want you to think of spacetime as one four dimensional thing, right? It's kind of like space. It's not just three dimensions of space and one dimension of time.\n","27":"Explainer: Now, in some sense that's kind of trivial to you and me, because of course you have space, which is three dimensional, you have time which is one dimensional, so spacetime is four dimensional. But it didn't turn out, it didn't occur to anyone that that was a sensible way to talk until really relativity. This is the crucial thing, right? Is that what Einstein realized is that sure there's both time and space, but how we divide spacetime into time and space can be different for different people, and really there's a real sense in which four dimensional spacetime is kind of a generalization of three dimensional space. And I think to really explain this we're gonna need a blackboard.\nExplainee: Okay.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Why though?\nExplainer: Why? This is a very good question. So, let's just start with space, right? We know a little bit about space. So here's my simple minded way of drawing space two dimensions, because that's how many I can draw on the blackboard. Let's say X and Y. And what is special about space, there's many things, but one is that if I have a curve or a path between two points, there's a distance that you can calculate, right? And the distance between those two points doesn't depend on your coordinates. It doesn't depend on whether you're in radial coordinates or Cartesian coordinates, or whatever. I'm allowed to imagine a curve that does something like this between those two points, and if I were a person walking on that curve, I would have an odometer with me maybe, and I would know, you would know, even without having done that, this path is always gonna be longer than that path. There's a formula, Pythagoras' Theorem that tells you what the shortest distance path is. That's the point. The physical-ness of what is real is the distance along a certain curve. So spacetime is like that. That's why it is useful to think about spacetime.\n","28":"Explainer: Let's bring one in. All right.

Here's how we usually draw it. I'll just say X, but all of space is condensed in this one direction, and this is time, okay? So if you're a little person and you started some event, so you start, you're located somewhere in space, somewhere in the three coordinates of space, and whether you like it or not, you're moving through spacetime just by getting older.\n","29":"Explainer: Why?

I say yes, yesterday I traveled 24 hours into the future and here I am, a day later. So that's just this. Okay, you're moving through time, like it or not. So what Einstein says is look, I can travel through spacetime in different ways, like I could hop in a rocket ship and fly out and then fly back, and then I could meet you there. So this is a different trajectory through spacetime, right?\n","30":"Explainer: So let me draw spacetime. Here's how we usually draw it.

The space story says there's a distance, distance is different along different curves. Einstein says there's something that measures the length of these curves, and we call it the proper time. It is literally the time that you would read on your wristwatch.\n","31":"Explainer: When people ask me can you travel through time?

Or our base time?\nExplainer: Well kind of. What Einstein wants to get across is there's no such thing as fundamental, like there's the universe's time, this big letter T that might tell you how old the universe is, but then every individual has a clock with them, and they measure their own time depending on how they're moving through the universe.\n","32":"Explainer: And it's almost exactly like the space story.

If you had a sheet that was originally flat, and you set a marble on it, it would go in a straight line, but then if you put something on it so it warps it, that marble is now gonna be deflected.\n","35":"Explainer: So when Einstein had this idea, oh gravity could be related to the curvature of spacetime, he did some equations, so he got it, that's a long story, we'll put that aside. What he figured out was that rather than gravity living on top of spacetime, it's a manifestation of the curvature of spacetime so when you have like the earth, the sun, the moon, they cause a gravitational field, they're actually warping the spacetime around them. They're giving it a different geometry.\nExplainee: Would it be if I had like a spring or not a spring, but like a sheet, and I dropped a book in the sheet, curves down?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: I see.\nExplainer: Einstein says that gravity is just like that.\n","36":"Explainer: But there are no straight lines, because spacetime itself is curved. So do you think if you had to explain relativity what would you say?\nExplainee: I think I'd go with kind of the train paradox. Let's say I'm stationary, and someone's moving past me on the train, they think they're stationary on the train. Like they think that they're not accelerating, but if they start walking through the train cars, then they are accelerating in their frame, but then from my outside frame where I'm completely removed, I see they are accelerating. So I guess that relativity is all about perspective, I guess in a way.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: That was pretty good.\nExplainer: [Sean] Yeah. I learned a lot. [Sean] It's a lot of fun stuff to talk about.\n","37":"Explainer: Nano is kind of a funny word, right? It's a word that's used before another word, and it means one billion.

So that's really all it is. It's just a measure of size. But it's really, really, really tiny, smaller than anything that we can see with our eyes.

And so that's a meter and if I divide it by 1000, I get a millimeter. So milli just means 1000. There's all these little lines on the ruler. And each of those little lines is one millimeter. So a baby ant is probably a couple of millimeters. So even the thing, that's the smallest thing you can think of, it's a million times bigger than a nanometer.

We have the Ethereum network and XT, but a lot of companies and consortiums are getting together to build private blockchains, so ones that are more closed off at first and then may evolve into a public network where people feel comfortable using it. And some are also proof of concept out in the real world, projects in energy and in pharmaceuticals and in retail and lots of different fields are starting experiments.

You have one degree of freedom, I can choose this fold, and then if these are perfectly rigid every other fold angle is fully determined. One of the key behaviors here is that with the smaller angles up here, the two folds that are the same parity and the folds that are of opposite parity move at about the same rate but with this, as we're getting closer to 90 degrees, we find they move at very different rates and then at the end of the motion, the opposite happens. This one is almost folded but this one goes through a much larger motion so the relative speeds differ.\n","46":"Explainer: These are the building blocks of many, many origami deployable shapes, it's called a degree-4 vertex. It's the number of lines. So in this case, we use solid lines for mountain, we use dash lines for valley. We're going to fold it and use these two to illustrate some important properties of origami mechanisms. It's important in the study of mechanisms to take into account the rigidity. So what we're going to do to help simulate rigidity is to take these rectangles and we're going to fold them over and over so that they just become stiff and rigid.\nExplainee: [Grad Student] Okay.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Right.\nExplainer: So when we start sticking together vertices like this, if they're individually single degree of freedom then we can make very large mechanisms that open and close but with just one degree of freedom. So, these are examples of a pattern called the Miura-Ori. When you stretch them out they're pretty big.\n","47":"Explainer: So this is what's called a single degree of freedom mechanism. You have one degree of freedom, I can choose this fold, and then if these are perfectly rigid every other fold angle is fully determined. One of the key behaviors here is that with the smaller angles up here, the two folds that are the same parity and the folds that are of opposite parity move at about the same rate but with this, as we're getting closer to 90 degrees, we find they move at very different rates and then at the end of the motion, the opposite happens. This one is almost folded but this one goes through a much larger motion so the relative speeds differ.\nExplainee: Right.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Okay.\nExplainer: And they fold flat and a pattern almost exactly like this was used for a solar array for a Japanese mission that flew in 1995.\n","48":"Explainer: And they fold flat and a pattern almost exactly like this was used for a solar array for a Japanese mission that flew in 1995.\nExplainee: So then you like fly it up compactly and then once you get up there, there's like some sort of like motorized mechanism, but you only need it on one fold.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Yeah. What sort of angle would you want so that they open up the same rate?\nExplainer: Infinitesimally small.\n","49":"Explainer: So, sadly, the only way to get them at exactly the same rate is when these are microscopic slivers and then that's not useful.\nExplainee: For sure, right, right.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: So, it's kind of a trade-off?\nExplainer: There's an engineering trade-off to get them both to work. And there's another place that shows up in deployable structures in a very cool structure. This is a folded tube, it sort of pops out like this but it has this neat property that if you twist it quickly, it changes color. There's a Mars Rover application where they need a sleeve that protects a drill and as the drill goes down, the sleeve is going to collapse and they're using a pattern very much like this.\n","50":"Explainer: And it's exactly the difference between the motions of these two vertices. So these angles are closer to right angles and the closer you get to a right angle the more asymmetry there is between the two directions of motion. And then the other difference is how efficiently they pack, so these started at about the same size but when they're flat notice that yours is much more compact. So if I were you making a solar array, I'd say, oh, I want that one. But if I say, well, I want them to open at the same rate, then I want this one.\nExplainee: So, it's kind of a trade-off?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Interesting.\nExplainer: There are many open mathematical questions and so room for mathematicians, like yourself, to have a big impact on the world of origami and mechanisms. And even though those studies are mathematically interesting, they're going to also have real-world applications in space, solar arrays, drills, telescopes, and more. Any questions or thoughts about this?\n","51":"Explainer: There's an engineering trade-off to get them both to work.

Do you sleep?\nExplainee: I do, I try. [laughs]\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Resting, relaxing, really shutting down your brain, taking some time off of a busy schedule and work day.\nExplainer: But being off is not just being off. There's lots of things that are happening. We're gonna kind of talk about those different pieces of sleep.\n","53":"Explainer: But being off is not just being off. There's lots of things that are happening. We're gonna kind of talk about those different pieces of sleep.\nExplainee: Okay.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Okay. Are you like able to tell how much sleep someone's getting or what their sleep schedule is by REM?\nExplainer: When we measure all of that, we're able to see how much time someone's asleep, and how many times they wake up and stuff during the night. You know, we're also really interested in kind of, the amount of non-REM sleep someone gets and the amount of REM sleep that someone gets, because each part of those types of sleep do different things for the body. And so it's important to get both of those. And so within non-REM sleep, there are three stages ranging from N-1 to N-2 to N-3. So not particularly clever in our naming, but that's how we know what stages they are. And what they do is it moves from lightest to deepest sleep, okay? N-1, it's more kind of light, wakefulness sleep, kind of in and out of sleeping. Then you go into N-2, which is where we spend 45 to 55 percent of our sleep. And it's more this kind of light sleep, but then we get into kind of the really restorative sleep, and that's N-3. And in N-3, when we look at someone's EEG wave, we see these big slow waves, and it's called slow wave sleep. And so we spend about 20% of our sleep in slow wave sleep, though it can vary on a day to day.\n","54":"Explainer: So our sleep is made up of different types, okay? The first one is called non-rapid eye movement sleep, or non-REM, okay? Or NREM. And then the other one, which might not be a surprise, is called REM. Rapid eye movement sleep. And those are the two main types of sleep that happen. The way that we measure that as a sleep scientist is that we'll actually bring people into the lab where they can do this at home, where we put electrodes on their scalp while they're sleeping, and that allows us to measure the brain activity that's going on during the night.\nExplainee: Okay. Are you like able to tell how much sleep someone's getting or what their sleep schedule is by REM?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Oh wow.\nExplainer: Okay? When do you think you experience the most REM?\n","55":"Explainer: Okay? When do you think you experience the most REM?\nExplainee: Well I've heard that you don't really go into like a deeper sleep, so I'm guessing like N-3, or really any of the N's at all, really, if you are on technology right before you sleep. And also if there's too much light, or if you're listening to music while you're asleep or anything like that, you're not experiencing deep sleep, right?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Oh.\nExplainer: Okay? So we wake up a lot during the night, and we just don't remember it. And you'll go back down into deep sleep, and then up again into REM, you know, in kinda these cycles.\n","56":"Explainer: You know, some of that is totally accurate, that like when your brain's more engaged by being on your phone or doing things that you really enjoy or things that stress you out or any of those types of things, it's harder to get to sleep and to kind of fall into that deeper levels of sleep. Most of the REM sleep, this dreaming sleep, happens in the second half of the night.\nExplainee: Oh.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Oh wow.\nExplainer: Do you ever take naps?\n","57":"Explainer: One to six hours? That's a long nap.\nExplainee: It is a long nap.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: So N-1 being like light sleep, still a lot of brain activity going on. I can imagine that happens right after you fall asleep. Asleep. And then N-2 being light, moderate activity in your brain, still sleep, but still kind of consciously aware, and N-3 being the deepest form of sleep.\nExplainer: I want to know if you agree, sleep is the coolest thing you've ever heard of.\n","58":"Explainee: What is fusion energy?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: I love the lightning show, I think it's so cool.\nExplainer: You probably have learned in school about three states of matter.\n","59":"Explainer: You probably have learned in school about three states of matter.\nExplainee: Solid, liquid and gas.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: That's so cool.\nExplainer: Yeah. So the way this is happening is this glass ball here is a container for our plasma. And we've taken most of the air out of the container, so there's not a lot of particles inside the glass ball, and very, very low temperature plasma. So it's continuously ionizing and then recombining, and becoming neutral again. And we see those energy transitions as the visible light. So if we're gonna put this plasma to use and do something helpful with it, like maybe make some clean electricity, we would have to control it. And another word for controlling it is confining it. So let me turn this off and set it back down. You're probably wondering what is this thing on this table? It's a model of a tokamak, and that's the name of a device that I work on with the goal of creating clean energy. Have you played with magnets in school?\n","60":"Explainer: Absolutely, we take the gas, and we add heat, and we get a plasma. And a plasma is a state of matter where you have an ionized gas. If we break down that gas, and we add enough energy to ionize it, where you can take the electrons and the ions and the atom and separate them, and now there's this soup of charged particles that are moving around, that's the plasma. And it is what creates the beautiful light in lightning. So you've already seen a plasma in fact. So I'm gonna show you this fun demonstration. You've probably seen one of these before, right?\nExplainee: That's so cool.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: [Nods.]\nExplainer: Okay.\n","61":"Explainer: Okay.\nExplainee: We've learned about how it has to be a positive and negative charge. And we've done those things where you can like put 'em with something in between 'em, and just move one and the other will always follow.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: [Points vertically.]\nExplainer: Yeah, exactly, perpendicular. And if I drive the current in this green wire, which direction will it go?\n","62":"Explainer: Yeah, exactly, perpendicular. And if I drive the current in this green wire, which direction will it go?\nExplainee: [Points counter-clockwise.]\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: That way.\nExplainer: Exactly, back this way, the short way around the tokamak. We can now put together the pieces and understand the three magnetic fields that we need to confine a plasma in our tokamak. So our plasma will be inside this vessel in the shape of a donut.\n","63":"Explainer: Exactly, yeah, the long way, perpendicular. Now this is a bit of a trickier one. The blue wire is gonna act like a transformer action. And so by changing the current in the blue coil, we are going to be able to run a current in this direction around the tokamak. And now think back to how the wires worked. If I have a current going like this, where's the magnetic field?\nExplainee: That way.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: What could the tokamak be used for in like real life?\nExplainer: I'm so glad you asked. So what we want to use the tokamak for in real life is to confine a super hot plasma, and we're talking a hundred million, 150 million degrees. Because the plasma is so very hot, the particles have enough energy to interact with one another and fuse. When those fusion reactions occur, we are releasing energy that's inside the nucleus, and we can harness that energy to make clean electricity.\n","64":"Explainer: Do you have any idea about any of the challenges? Like why has it taken us so long to get to fusion?\nExplainee: Making a star on earth is not easy.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: They repel each other and they don't like being close together, so they push back by that force.\nExplainer: Or we're gonna call the pushback a Coulomb interaction, or a Coulomb collision. So you can sort of imagine if I were to take a deuteron and a triton, and so those are the positively charged ions of deuterium and tritium, and I try and combine them together, those two positively charged particles just sort of bounce off of each other. So we have to give them enormous amounts of energy, and it has to do with getting up to very high temperatures. So we're talking about over 100 million degrees Celsius. And we typically put that into an energy unit that we use a lot in plasma physics called an electron vault. And so we describe being up at 100 million degrees that we're at sort of 15 kiloelectron volts.\n","65":"Explainer: Or we're gonna call the pushback a Coulomb interaction, or a Coulomb collision.

And we typically put that into an energy unit that we use a lot in plasma physics called an electron vault. And so we describe being up at 100 million degrees that we're at sort of 15 kiloelectron volts.\nExplainee: Uh huh.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Compared to just hydrogen.\nExplainer: Yes, exactly, exactly. That little bump up is good for us. Because it means that we have a higher probability of getting the deuterium and the tritium to fuse than otherwise at those manageable temperatures. And when we say manageable, for fusion scientists, yeah, 50 million, a hundred million, 150 million Celsius.\n","66":"Explainer: So that's very, very hot temperature. But the other thing we need is a lot of particles. That's the density. We are able to combine a deuteron and a triton in a fusion reaction at lower temperatures, at lower energies than other fuel. And this has to do with some very nice properties of the deuteron and the triton that when we get them close enough to one another to fuse, there's actually a resonance which is predicted by quantum mechanics, and that really helps have a little bump up in the cross section for the deuterium-tritium fusion reaction.\nExplainee: Compared to just hydrogen.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: So the problem you described is that we get to those high temperatures, we have dense plasma, but the problem is the hotter the plasma is, the more likely it is the heat to get sucked out of it by.\nExplainer: Absolutely, yeah, absolutely.\n","67":"Explainer: Absolutely, yeah, absolutely.\nExplainee: So that the plasma itself is not staying hot enough for the time we need it to stay.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Yeah, it comes out.\nExplainer: Exactly. So it comes right out. And it's the kinetic energy of the neutron. And we want it to interact with our overall energy system. And as it interacts with that material, it heats the material up. It transfers its kinetic energy to this material. Take that thermal energy and run a turbine, run a generator, and convert it into electricity. So once you get to that stage, it starts to look a lot like any other thermal power plant. Whether it's fission or natural gas. So a fusion plant could basically be the plasma core coming in, setting it in place, and driving your thermal system to make electricity. We often call it an alpha particle. And that is a charged particle, right. So it's actually going to stay in the plasma. It's an energetic particle compared to the fuel. So it actually is going to give its kinetic energy back to the fuel via Coulomb collisions. So now they're good, now we like them.\n","68":"Explainer: We've come so far in the study of magnetically confined plasmas, which is what I work on, that we sort of tamed all the other types of major instabilities that would cause loss of the plasma. So you might be asking yourself what is the energy that's coming out of the fusion reaction? So we've got the deuteron and we've got the triton, and so they combine in a fusion reaction, and that produces a neutron and a helium nucleus. But the neutron doesn't have any charge.\nExplainee: Yeah, it comes out.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: So you get this kind of self-sustaining cycle.\nExplainer: Yes, you you said exactly the right word, self-sustaining.\n","69":"Explainer: And so, how much do you think you need?\nExplainee: I mean, I've read that six is ideal for people in my age range.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: I mean, I know sleep is kind of regulated by the thalamus and the suprachiasmatic nucleus sending signals to the pineal gland to which kind of secretes melatonin, which tells us when it's time to go to sleep.\nExplainer: Right. You can do part of this level, and you can do the other part, clearly. Got some expertise under your belt, and that's awesome, because I think that everyone should know more about sleep. And so the way that we think about what drives sleep are two independent but related processes and so they have kind of lame names. Process S and process C, and what you've kind of described is process C, and that's the master clock, right? And it helps regulate kind of the rhythms like all over your body, all your cells, and all those kind of things. It drives the release of melatonin from the pineal gland, and melatonin comes online under darkness, so when the sun goes down, your brain knows okay it's time to start getting ready for sleep, and so you start releasing melatonin, which really kind of sets the table for sleeping.\n","70":"Explainee: I'm Tom Hull, I'm a math professor, a mathematician. I've been doing origami since I was eight years old and studying the mathematics of origami ever since grad school, at least.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Why does origami lend itself to, say, this type of application?\nExplainer: Origami applications have in common, is that at some stage the thing is flat and so whenever you need to either start from a flat state and then take it to a 3D state, or conversely, for deployables like space, you want to have it in a fully folded flat state but then take it to a 3D state, or possibly an unfolded flat state. Whenever a flat state is involved, origami is a really effective way of making the transition between those states.\n","71":"Explainer: This is another real-world application but this particular implementation is used to make a wheel for a Rover.\nExplainee: Cool, so this is something that can actually get really, really tiny but then get big and fat and roll.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Yeah!\nExplainer: Another origami challenge that comes up with these patterns is if we're going to make an aircraft out of this thing we're going to need hundreds of yards of folded origami. We're not going to do it by hand and this might be the new frontier in origami engineering, which is the design of machines that can fold patterns that have applications.\n","72":"Explainer: New problems arise when we try to make origami out of things other than paper, but also new opportunities. An example here which is a kind of a variant of the Miura-Ori. It's got a three-dimensional structure. If I stretch it one way, it expands the other but because it has these S-bends in the pattern, if you squeeze it, it doesn't go all the way flat. This is a epoxy impregnated aramid fiber and so if I put this fold pattern into it and then compress it and then put a skin on the top and bottom, this becomes incredibly lightweight but incredibly strong.\nExplainee: Yeah!\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: So you're talking about a machine that is actually folding it into this, not just making the creases but actually folding it.\nExplainer: Yeah, so what goes in as sheet and what comes out is this, or something this wide.\n","73":"Explainer: Yeah, so what goes in as sheet and what comes out is this, or something this wide.\nExplainee: That's cool, yeah. What do you see as kind of like the next big breakthrough? Is there anything out there on the horizon that you're just like, oh wow, this is really exciting?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: So like a cone?\nExplainer: Bi-stable properties and you can combine them together with copies of themselves to make cellular structures. They're astonishingly stiff and rigid, useful for mechanics.\n","74":"Explainer: And it's because we've had a lot of PR, a lot of proof of concept, but truthfully, this is more like a science, right?\nExplainee: Yes.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Yes, and one of the most interesting ideas to me that came out of the currency side of the blockchain project was the notion around like coloring coins, right, assign properties to a particular coin, and in particular to assign those properties in ways that would allow you to do things like bring in the graph of previous transactions.\nExplainer: [Bettina] Right.\n","75":"Explainer: The system we have today is also broken. (laughs) Right?\nExplainee: Yes.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: (laughs) Yeah.\nExplainer: When you say, well, there's hundreds of thousands, millions of car deaths on the road due to human error today. I think we're in a similar place. We're going to see problems with this technology, and we are going to need to develop multiple kinds of standards that also have some flexibility. But it's going to also be a version, a system, that allows us to fix some of the things that are broken today.\n","76":"Explainer: In that it's hard to compare it to some perfect future. Just like you compare autonomous vehicles to this very high standard because machines are doing it. It should be perfect. There should be zero car deaths.\nExplainee: (laughs) Yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","77":"Explainer: [Sean] What kind of science?\nExplainee: I like biology and computer science.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: I guess, I don't know how to exactly define it, but I know, like the first four.\nExplainer: Right, you know the difference between like one dimension two dimensions, three dimensions, et cetera. So let's do a little experiment here. So there's one dimension. I'll give that to you. Now, here's your task. I'm going to give you another dimension, and I'm gonna ask hold those two things at right angles to each other. It's easy to do. Yeah, so there's no trick here.\n","78":"Explainer: All right, you're in the wrong place. [laughs] We're not gonna be talking about biology or computer science.

How we would define dimensions?\nExplainee: I guess, I don't know how to exactly define it, but I know, like the first four.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: [laughing] Yeah.\nExplainer: I'm not trying to fool you here. Okay. Now this is going to be slightly trickier. I'm going to give you this. I want you to hold all three of them at right angles to all the others at the same time.\n","79":"Explainer: Right, you know the difference between like one dimension two dimensions, three dimensions, et cetera.

So what that's doing is when you had just two that was describing a two dimensional plane, right? Like the two things pick out a plane, the three things pick out all three dimensional space.

It can't be done. Yeah. Right? You can't do it. So we just experimentally proved that space is three dimensional. That's sort of what it means to be three dimensional, that there are three different directions you can move in and there's not four or five or six directions you can move in.\n","81":"Explainer: There you go.

And then the angle that our little line makes with let's say the X axis.\nExplainee: Yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Time?\nExplainer: Time. Yes, Einstein said that we can think of time as a fourth dimension, and that's a very fascinating thing that we could talk about all by itself. But what about space? What about the solar system?

You know, the optimistic view is that there are six, but the thing is, some of them might be really, really, really, really, really small, like way too small for us to ever see.\n","86":"Explainer: So you can define something as, well you know, how high above a certain location on earth it is, but the earth is rotating and revolving around the sun so we have to define separate celestial coordinates.\nExplainee: So, there's like how many dimension would there be?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Yeah.\nExplainer: And some of them might be medium sized that hopefully we can see.\n","87":"Explainer: Absolutely right.

[laughs]\nExplainer: [Sean] We really don't know.\n","88":"Explainer: Which is, by the way, what, when I was just starting out in graduate school, that was the hot new thing, so.\nExplainee: Exactly.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: It isn't.\nExplainer: You know, everybody's been just coming at it from different wavelengths at the optical infrared, and, but definitely the X-rays has been one of those things where it's like, oh, finally.\n","89":"Explainer: That was, it was like, oh, wow, this might be it, and then, but very early on, it was, as I just started my, it was basically my second year of graduate school, it was like, uh, this is not that simple.\nExplainee: It isn't.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: And we've come a long way by seeing a wider range of the spectrum, we can elucidate more about the circumnuclear geometry, and there's just been so much progress made with all these new spectral models that we use to fit AGN spectra, and the different types of classes of AGN, like type one and type two are believed to be just a viewing angle effect of seeing this torus at different angles.\nExplainer: It does seem to be that it may not even, in parts, it may not be even connected to this tiny, little torus at all because part of the work that I did, and others have done, is that type twos preferentially live in different kinds of galaxies than type ones, which should not in any way have to do with something such a small scale. They tend to be in smaller bulged, SB and SC type spiral galaxies. So there's something also having to do with environment that gets you to be a type two, and you can still maybe, timing wise, but there's something else that's going on on a larger scale because the type of the AGN should not really correspond to the host galaxy, but it seems to. And that was one of the things that we were finding out, and that was one of the early little ideas that the, individually, just as the torus model, the unified model, can't explain everything that we were observing at the time. But it is one of those things that it's, they're super luminous, they're all over the place, and we don't have a really good picture of it, which makes it exciting to study.\n","90":"Explainer: You know, everybody's been just coming at it from different wavelengths at the optical infrared, and, but definitely the X-rays has been one of those things where it's like, oh, finally.\nExplainee: And we've come a long way by seeing a wider range of the spectrum, we can elucidate more about the circumnuclear geometry, and there's just been so much progress made with all these new spectral models that we use to fit AGN spectra, and the different types of classes of AGN, like type one and type two are believed to be just a viewing angle effect of seeing this torus at different angles.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Yeah, and I think, you know, pushing towards the future, that, like, this whole multi-messenger era, and like, you know, utilizing all the different wavelength telescopes that we can is really the way to go. We cannot just build up a picture purely from X-rays alone, or purely from infrared, and, you know, I think there should be increased effort to try and have more coordinated observations with the different telescopes, like NuSTAR--\nExplainer: Oh, that makes sense, but it's always so difficult to get that.\n","91":"Explainer: Huh.\nExplainee: Understanding the anatomy of the brain is definitely important but, it doesn't necessarily tell us everything about the function, there's some sort of temporal order from neuron to neuron and region to region that we may not be able to pick up.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: I mean that's not the person, I mean, having a representation of someone's neural network is just that, it's just a representation of the neural network.\nExplainer: Huh.\n","92":"Explainer: Because there's more to you in here than just information passing between neurons.\nExplainee: I'd like to think so.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Every single person is different and so it should be okay to map every single person's brain. I mean I understand that there are, that it's very sensitive, you know?\nExplainer: Wait, what do you think is sensitive?\n","93":"Explainer: I think my audience once pulled 92% or below the level of 1,200, but it's really hard to learn chess because you don't get to experience learning content based on people who are your level. Like how did you really deduce how a 1,200 will play?\nExplainee: We used state-of-the-art neural networks like Alpha-Zero and Leela, but we instead try to predict what move a human would make given a board position. These deep neural nets are kind of like black boxes. So we've come up with interesting ways to probe at them to get an idea of, okay, what is actually is going on that is different about this person or different about that person? We had like a style vector for each person. We can compare those, see where you defer, and try to map those back to human understandable chess concepts because that's the key, right? If I just tell you, Oh, they defer in the third number and the fifth number, you'll be like, What does that even mean, right? But if I can tell you, Oh I think this person worries more about their king's safety or sacrifices their center at the cost of protecting their king, or something like that, some kind of trade-off, then you might be able to understand what's going on there. So that's what we're trying to do now with these style vectors, and the fun thing about having numbers representing people is that you can add them together. You can mix them.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: I think that's actually a good idea, and I agree with you that it's not something you can easily access today like out with the online tools and the chess platforms that are out there. I play the Caro-Kann, and when I learned it, I started getting afraid of, so when you go, I started getting afraid of\nExplainer: Yeah, the advance.\n","94":"Explainer: Yeah, you'd have to move your king.\nExplainee: Get to my king, and so I remember hitting all these variations that just scared me.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Is that like human empirically, though, based on the games that people are playing?\nExplainer: Yeah, like I would say-\n","95":"Explainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: It comes from just your life experience. And that moves you in a certain direction. How it gets expressed, many times, is sudden. Complete surprise. (laughs)\nExplainer: Yeah, yeah, yeah. I find it fascinating in music to think about, you know, say I arrive in a place, if I'm going, say I'm going to D flat major. And there's something you once taught me. You taught me this song Don't Follow the Crowd.\n","96":"Explainer: A lot of people will see you as somebody who's drank in harmony their whole life. They've seen so much harmony, heard so much harmony. How do you make the choices, there's so much that's possible when you know stuff. How do you have the courage to make a choice?\nExplainee: It comes from just your life experience. And that moves you in a certain direction. How it gets expressed, many times, is sudden. Complete surprise. (laughs)\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Oh, yeah.\nExplainer: And there's that chord. It's not a Dennerman chord, but it functions as a dominant chord. But it doesn't matter, because you're still going to the place you're going to.\n","97":"Explainer: That haunted me for days.\nExplainee: (Herbie laughs)\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Yeah, and this is what I learned from the great Chris Anderson.\nExplainer: Chris Anderson, yeah, yeah.\n","98":"Explainer: Right, right, right.\nExplainee: Right.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: And it makes like a pull.\nExplainer: Yeah, yeah. It's like one thing is moving in one direction and one thing has arrived, so it's this tension and it's glorious. I love thinking about these things emotionally, just because that's a feeling, I know that feeling in my life.\n","99":"Explainer: Something like that. And that's not 'cause like emotionally, it's almost like I'm here, I'm arriving here. But, if the base note is the same, it's like this inevitability about it, it's like I was there all along.\nExplainee: And it makes like a pull.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Music is not different from life.\nExplainer: (Jacob) No.\n","100":"Explainer: I've been using this tune Amazing Grace.\nExplainee: Oh, right.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Yeah, thank you.\n","101":"Explainer: Do you know what computer hacking is?\nExplainee: It's bad.

Like, give them their money or something like that?\nExplainer: What they're trying to do is they're trying to even prevent the bad hackers from getting in in the first place.\n","102":"Explainer: What they're trying to do is they're trying to even prevent the bad hackers from getting in in the first place.\nExplainee: So they put like a protection account or something.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: What would they do about the people and the broken lock?\nExplainer: In many cases, they'll send them a new lock. So it's an upgraded, better version. Sometimes that's new features, but sometimes that's bug fixes and ways to protect you as well.\n","103":"Explainer: Yeah, exactly. They're looking for ways that they can create protection. It's kind of like the lock on your front door. That lock is to essentially prevent bad people from coming in or people accidentally coming in when they shouldn't. A hacker is essentially looking at a way, how can I get into this lock? But then there are the good ones who are trying to unlock it so that they can tell the company that made the lock, hey, we can actually protect people by making the lock a little harder.\nExplainee: What would they do about the people and the broken lock?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: But like, they may get arrested because they might get mistaken.\nExplainer: That's a very good point. You should definitely make sure that you're obeying the law. They might work with the lock company and say, I'm trying to improve your product. And they're trying to find these holes or problems, and then share that with the company. Even though the good hacker is doing exactly the same thing as the bad hacker, it's the same exact skillset, and you're using the same exact techniques and information to try to break that lock, but your goal as a good hacker is really to help everyone like you and me to make sure that our stuff is protected. So hopefully they don't get in trouble because they're the good guys.\n","104":"Explainer: In many cases, they'll send them a new lock. So it's an upgraded, better version.

Once I started learning how to do it, I found that, things that were harder for me, I could make easier.\n","107":"Explainer: That's entirely possible.

And Realism was meant to capture the mundane, everyday lives of individuals and not idealize any of their activities in any way. And I think that that's really important for virtual reality. I think its kind of rite-of-passage for any kind of our technology to go through.\nExplainer: Mostly in VR we talk about the display and optics, the visual side of things, but we should at least tick off the other senses. And haptics is an interesting thing about virtual reality really doesn't have that aspect of touching things. You can move your hands around, you can do everything but its a disconnected experience because you know you don't have an actual solidity there. And I am pessimistic about progress in haptics technology. Almost all other areas I'm an optimist and I'm excited about what's coming up, but I don't have any brilliant vision about how we're going to revolutionize haptics and make it feel like we're touching the things in the virtual world.\n","109":"Explainee: Hello Donna, good to see you.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: I remember very much and how hard it was to convince you to travel across the country and work at the lab.\nExplainer: And stay there.\n","110":"Explainer: You could not convince me to stay, no.\nExplainee: But you were there long enough to make a big impression and get some good work done.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Yes.\nExplainer: At Rochester. But we're still not gonna get to the Schwinger limit, isn't that right?\n","111":"Explainer: And that's, like you said, we're stuck a little bit, we're not up to that kind of acceleration, so that would be a Nobel Prize winning possible idea.\nExplainee: Absolutely.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: So actually there's a potential ways of doing it with optical or near optical radiation. And there's been a lot of work done in the defense department and so on, how do I combine laser beams together?\nExplainer: Okay.\n","112":"Explainer: And right across the beam. Don't you think that's gonna be the challenge? 'Cos it's not like our beams are as perfect as we like to think they are.\nExplainee: So that's right so you have to have the aperture size, you have to have them phase locked across the entire aperture. Which will be a great challenge and people have done it, again, with small lasers. The lasers we'll be trying to do is about a 40cm aperture. So we'll begin to start looking at this. And actually wavelength control and then be able to adaptive optics other ways which you can control the uniformity of the phase is something that's been developed in lots of ways now. For defense applications, for science applications. So we will do our best to make use of all these technologies. Lasers I think have progressed so much. Just like the semi conductor did, 'cos there's such a market for it, there were so many different applications for that.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: I remember when laser was first demonstrated 1960, what could we do with this? We already got light. Now we can't live without lasers. My cell phone, that is in my pocket, has billions of transistors. How is that made? With lasers. All of the greatest circuitry is done with lasers. Actually now it's using x-rays, made from laser heated matter. That came out of the laser fusion program.\nExplainer: So it is amazing, the parallels. And optics is used everywhere. We're gonna possibly take over from CERN, we'll just do high energy physics with lasers, we're looking at gravity waves with lasers, we wanna do black holes with lasers, we wanna machine with lasers, we wanna do medicine with lasers. It's everywhere. And now, with the Nobel prize, people are hearing more about it so they know lasers are everywhere.\n","113":"Explainer: Okay so there's a lot of us working around the world on these high intensity lasers and so, what do you think the real fun is? What do you see the real excitement being?\nExplainee: I remember when laser was first demonstrated 1960, what could we do with this? We already got light. Now we can't live without lasers.

Only three women have won the Nobel prize in physics and only one educated in the United States. You.\nExplainer: There you go.\n","114":"Explainer: Sounds like you've dabbled with quite a few algorithms. So, how does one actually research algorithms or invent algorithms?\nExplainee: The most important way is just trying to think about inefficiencies, and also think about connecting threads. The way I think about it is that algorithm for me is not just about the way of doing something, but it's about doing something efficiently. Learning algorithms are practically everywhere now. Google, I would say for example, is learning every day about like, Oh what articles, what links might be better than others? And re-ranking them. There are recommender systems all around us, right? Like content feeds and social media, or you know, like YouTube or Netflix. What we see is in a large part determined by this kind of learning algorithms.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Right.\nExplainer: But how does it even know what I sound like and what I look like, and how to replicate that?\n","115":"Explainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Well, one thing is quantum mechanics. Quantum mechanics is the most successful theory in the history of science, it explains the most different phenomena the most precisely. Yet many people would still say we don't understand even the basics of it.\nExplainer: So when we think about quantum mechanics, we think about particles and their quantum charges in the Feynman way, the way that Feynman taught us. They come in and they exchange a force carrier and then they come out again, so that's how we think of an electron and light scattering, for instance, or something like that. And the language that Einstein gave us is so different. It's completely geometric, it's all this space-time. And it's also unnecessary.\n","116":"Explainer: So we've been talking about gravity from Newton and celestial bodies, the Earth, the Moon, pulling on each other in the conventional sense of gravity being an attractive force, to the Earth creating curves in space-time, then we moved on to just diffused seas of energy and space-time as the real universe and gravitation is really just talking about space-time in general, and here we are, and you're really hardcore in theoretical physics. Where would you take the exposition of gravity from that point?\nExplainee: Well, one thing is quantum mechanics. Quantum mechanics is the most successful theory in the history of science, it explains the most different phenomena the most precisely. Yet many people would still say we don't understand even the basics of it.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Yeah, for me, the beauty of the theory of gravity is the way Einstein formulated it, as a theory of geometry, of curved space and time. I think, like you, that's one of the things that really pulled me into it.\nExplainer: Is there really space-time or are we just using unnecessary language because it's elegant and we like it and it's beautiful?\n","117":"Explainer: So do you think there's some sense in which we shouldn't be thinking about individual universes, individual space-time, so we should be thinking about superpositions of space-times?\nExplainee: Yeah, I think so. I think if you were to go far enough back in the history of the universe, back to when it was very, very dense, very small, and when quantum mechanics was certainly important, then it must have been like that. I mean, if we believe that the dominant standard model of cosmology, something had to produce the density perturbations, the things that seeded all the galaxies and stars and everything else in the world. So there's a galaxy over there, let's say, and not over there, so how did that happen? Why is there a galaxy there and not there? In the standard theory, as you know, that was a quantum event, a random event. And it doesn't mean that if happened there and not there 'cause you flipped a coin, it actually happened in both places. There's gotta be a wave function where in one branch of the wave function there's a galaxy there and not there, and on the other branch it's the opposite.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Sure, yeah, it is a beautiful, beautiful idea. So, first of all, to be totally clear, though, we've never observed Hawking radiation, which is what he predicted, directly. I don't think very many people doubt that it's there, but yeah, Hawking discovered mathematically that when you have a black hole, it's got an event horizon, it's got a surface which is a point of no return. If you fall through that surface, no matter what you have, no matter how powerful the rocket you've got, even if you beam a flashlight back behind you in the direction you fall from, nothing escapes, not even light. It all gets sucked in and spaghettified and destroyed at the singularity, or something, something happens, but it doesn't get out. But in quantum mechanics, you can't really pin down the location of something precisely. If you try to pin down an electron in a tiny circuit in a microchip, sometimes you discover it's not actually there and then your computer crashes.\nExplainer: This is the Heisenberg's uncertainty principle in reality. You can't precisely say where the electron is, and you can't precisely say how quickly it's moving.\n","118":"Explainer: Practical purposes.\nExplainee: Yes.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: One thing about quantum mechanics is that any time you have a state of the world and another state of the world, you can literally add them together and get a third possible state, as crazy as that sounds. And so if you're gonna have a quantum theory of gravity, then we can't really talk about there being a black hole or not a black hole, or an event horizon or not an event horizon, because we could always a state that had an event horizon and a state that doesn't, or has the event horizon in a slightly different position, maybe, and add them together. So the existence or position of an event horizon can't possibly be determined as a fact any more than the position of an electron is determined. So I think that's the loophole.\nExplainer: That's a nice way of looking at it. So that you're not actually violating classical relativity once you're in a regime where the wave function has really peaked around a very well-defined stage.\n","119":"Explainer: That's a nice way of looking at it. So that you're not actually violating classical relativity once you're in a regime where the wave function has really peaked around a very well-defined stage.\nExplainee: That's right, and one of the most exciting developments in the last 10 or 20 years is called holography, and it's called holography because a hologram is a two-dimensional surface that creates a three-dimensional image. It's got sort of 3D information built into it. And this, in a fundamental way, really has that 3D or higher dimensional information built into it. It's exactly the same as this theory of gravity and more dimensions.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: That's true.\nExplainer: [Janna laughs]\n","120":"Explainer: Right, exactly. And the most knowledge you could ever have would only be on a two-dimensional surface.\nExplainee: Right, and as big as the universe, and then you're done. So, you know, not likely that we're ever gonna hit that limit any time soon.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: If we buy the idea of holography, then absolutely, that's for sure, that's what it's telling us. Although which side is the illusion and which side is the reality? They're the same.\nExplainer: I mean, temperature is still great to talk about. It doesn't mean we shouldn't talk about temperature. I mean, we should absolutely adjust our thermostats and talk about temperature. But if we look at it closer and closer and closer, we realize there's not a thing in the world that has as a quantum value temperature, isolated. And so maybe there is no such thing as gravity isolated from quantum mechanics.\n","121":"Explainer: Do you think it's possible that gravity is really ultimately just quantum mechanics and doesn't exist at all in the fundamental ways that we've been talking about so far, like the Newtonian way and the space-time way, that those are just these kind of macroscopic illusions? Sometimes I talk about it in terms of temperature. Temperature is not a thing. There is no single thing called temperature. It's a macroscopic illusion that comes from the collective behavior, really quantum behavior of random motions of atoms. And is it possible that the whole of gravity is some kind of emergent illusion from what's really quantum phenomenon underlying it?\nExplainee: If we buy the idea of holography, then absolutely, that's for sure, that's what it's telling us. Although which side is the illusion and which side is the reality? They're the same.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Right, so I guess with the holographic description we've got two sides, which are actually secretly the same. On one side there's definitely no gravity. On the other side, well, it's a quantum theory of gravity, whatever that means. But the point is you can get it out, it's equivalent to this theory.\nExplainer: So that's just like saying there's the idea of a dual description. It's just saying there's a perfect dictionary between these two descriptions, and so to belabor which one's real is silly. It's like saying, is French or is English real?\n","122":"Explainer: Oh, that's pretty cool. What do you know about computer hacking?\nExplainee: I don't really know much about computer hacking actually.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Yeah.\nExplainer: Okay. With computer hacking, it's actually the same thing. Really, you have some sort of system and you have a bunch of inputs and you have some sort of output, and actually you, as the designer, you're essentially designing games and software. You're saying, well, I will only allow a user to really control these inputs. Can you think of any inputs the computer might have?\n","123":"Explainer: So on code.org, one of the things you've been doing is actually building a game or that they have a game and then you can actually rewire some of the inputs and outputs of that.

But then I say to you, where'd the chicken come from? And you'd say from an egg. But there's actually some real insight we can draw from this, because if we keep going back with the chicken and egg story, we'll go back through the evolutionary lineage of life, we'll go back to early moments of the sun and the galaxy, and ultimately, the universe, each step taking us to greater and greater order. So we believe that the ultimate source of order is the Big Bang itself. Highly ordered beginning called the Bang, and we have been living through the degradation of that order ever since. We still don't really have a solid explanation for why the Big Bang had to be or was, highly ordered. At the moment, it's really a deep assumption.\nExplainee: Back with Einstein, you know, we wondered, does time change with speed? And that's another change with that before, we didn't think possible, but I guess we found out eventually some of the fanciful ideas. I guess it's just tiny sliver of hope that.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Yeah.\nExplainer: Do you remember the scene in Interstellar? They're going to a planet that's near a black hole. They go down to the planet, and they spend just a couple hours there, but when they go back to the ship, it's 23 years later on the ship because time is elapsing slowly near the strong gravitational field, comparatively quickly far away. And that's not science fiction, that's actually how time behaves.\n","130":"Explainer: Yeah, not only did we find that time changes with speed in special relativity, but we also found that time changes with gravity. Einstein showed that the rate at which a clock ticks slows down based upon the stronger gravitational field, or gravitational potential actually, that it is experiencing. I think you mentioned the Interstellar before.\nExplainee: Yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: I've always heard people say, Oh, general relativity, you know, it might not seem applicable. But GPS, due to satellites, we could synchronize those clocks by accounting for relativity.\nExplainer: Well, but that's even a really, really good point. The GPS would become completely inaccurate in a very short period of time if the satellites weren't taken account of, or the software wasn't taking account of the fact that time elapses differently for the clocks on the satellite compared to the clocks down here on earth. So we walk around with general relativity in our pockets even though most of us perhaps don't really know that.\n","131":"Explainer: What's your idea what physics is?\nExplainee: Um, I'm not so sure.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: At the camp I made a 3D printing one.\nExplainer: 3D printing, good.\n","132":"Explainer: And how would you find yourself, like if someone said where are you, could you use some words or ideas to say where you are on that line?\nExplainee: I think I would be maybe there, since I'm facing it.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Yeah.\nExplainer: So every point, every location on our little line--\n","133":"Explainer: Has its own unit, has one number.\nExplainee: Yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Unlike three dimensional, you have to tell a lot 'cause if it's like a sphere, you kind of have to start using points.\nExplainer: There you go. Exactly. We're gonna build a little two dimensional space. You wanna do it? You wanna do the honors here? Why don't you put those two lines together?\n","134":"Explainer: I think you should be in this chair and you should be explaining this to me. You're much better at this than I am.\nExplainee: Yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: I think that would be an X or a Y axis, so--\nExplainer: There you go.\n","135":"Explainer: Well, as far as we know.\nExplainee: Yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: So at least everything has a certain dimension.\nExplainer: Yeah, do you think you'd be excited if physicists said that they found extra dimensions of space?\n","136":"Explainer: Yeah, do you think you'd be excited if physicists said that they found extra dimensions of space?\nExplainee: That would be an amazing discovery. The news would be spreaded around the world rapidly.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Yeah.\n","137":"Explainer: So have you taken a quantum mechanics course?\nExplainee: I have. I took that last year.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Yes.\nExplainer: So these are typically semiconductors. They can be cadmium selenide cadmium sulfide, zinc selenide and they're small clusters of atoms. They can be from 2 to 10 nanometers. What's interesting about these materials?\n","138":"Explainer: I think to really get deep into nanomaterials and nanoscale devices, you really have to understand to some level, quantum mechanics. What it teaches us as we make these devices smaller and smaller, their properties begin to now depend on the size and the orientation of these devices. There are materials, and you're taking a 2D materials class, you know about this, that are intrinsically thin. As they're grown, as they're fabricated, they're already at the nanoscale and they possess these quantum confinement properties that as a nanotechnologist, you try to exploit. And so the first ones I wanted to talk to you about are quantum dots, have you heard of quantum dots before?\nExplainee: Yes.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Well, the other day we were talking about the different dimensions you can have of nanotechnology. So all the way from like 0D to 3D. If I remember correctly, my professor labeled it as 0D?\nExplainer: That's correct. Yeah. Because of quantum confinement, once you get below this 15 nanometer range, the band gap of the material depends completely on the size of the material. So in bulk materials, if you want to change the band gap, you have to change the material, right? But in these quantum dots specifically, just by changing the size, you can change their band gap. And because their band gap is changing, their optical properties are different. And you can precisely tune the wavelength of light that they emit just by changing their size.\n","139":"Explainer: So these are typically semiconductors.

There are companies that are building displays from these materials. And there're even people thinking about if I take these quantum dots, and I change the chemistry on the outside so they stick to specific types of cells or tissue, that I could really do some interesting imaging and therapeutic work to track disease, even maybe to treat disease, if you can very precisely control the chemistry.\n","140":"Explainer: There are people that are exploring using these materials for diode lasers.

So how do you go about building and controlling these nanotubes in terms of their diameter?\nExplainer: You're speaking my language. This is what I spent many years of my life working on. You don't physically roll up graphene. You grow nanotubes by basically taking nanocrystals and you deposit them on a surface. And then you do a CVD process, chemical vapor deposition. So you basically flow in a carbon source, the carbon dissolves in a nanocrystal and then once nanocrystal is saturated, the nanotubes precipitate out of them in tubes. Then you have to develop ways to go into this pile of nanotubes and pull out exactly the ones that you want. So I have to find ways to program them to go exactly in the places that I want. I modify the surface of the nanotube with specific molecules that recognize one type of surface over another. And then I just pattern the surface and the tubes just land exactly where we want them to. And it's still very much in the research stage. The ultimate goal is to build functional high-speed electronics using these new materials.\n","142":"Explainer: Yeah. 100%. That's right. And that's the motivation for looking at these emerging materials. But I would never bet against the innovation and the creativity in this nano electronic space. Tens of thousands of scientists, every time they hit a barrier, at least historically, as a guide, they have found a way to overcome it. It's a real marvel in ingenuity.\nExplainee: I gotta ask. The lights that are behind you, is that related to the quantum dots that you work with at all?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Well, thank you so much. This was all so very interesting.\n","143":"Explainer: What do you think of when you think of nanotechnology?\nExplainee: It kind of seems very science fiction.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: My phone?\nExplainer: Yeah, so modern computer chips rely heavily on nanotechnology. Does this look familiar to you? Can you guess what this might be?\n","144":"Explainer: Yeah, so modern computer chips rely heavily on nanotechnology. Does this look familiar to you? Can you guess what this might be?\nExplainee: I don't know.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: OK.\nExplainer: I went through my kid's Lego bins to build a very simple model of a transistor. And these are wired together in circuits so that you can do computation. You can do logic with them. Where nanotechnology comes into play, the way you double the number of transistors on a chip. Can you guess what you would have to do to this transistor?\n","145":"Explainer: So this is a silicon wafer, and they're embedded in basically almost every object that you use, from a laptop, to a phone, to cars, television sets, appliances. We ended up cutting these into little squares and those repeating patterns, each of those is a processor. And those chips are what goes into all of these objects. What I want to talk to you about is how we got from where we started, and how we're able to actually fit 18 billion of these little devices in a little one inch by one inch area. They're called transistors. It's a switch. Very simply, think of it as a light switch that turns on and turns off using an electric field by applying a voltage.\nExplainee: OK.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: You make it smaller?\nExplainer: You have to make it smaller. Exactly. But here's the problem. So about 10 to 15 years ago, the devices got so small that if you shrunk them this gate, that actually turns it on and off loses its ability to control the channel. And so what they did, was they took devices like this into these things, we call them, FinFETs, kind of like a fin on a fish. So they're very thin transistors. The width of these fins is only six nanometers. Okay? So 6 nanometers is 25 to 30 atoms across. And they repeat this over the entire wafer just about perfectly. It's just a huge feat in engineering. But these types of devices are exactly the kind of devices that your phones and computers either have, or will have in the near future. And it's a way that nanotechnology is directly impacting you right now.\n","146":"Explainer: I went through my kid's Lego bins to build a very simple model of a transistor.

Obviously it's not handmade, so is it factories and stuff?\nExplainer: Exactly. So these are made using a technique called lithography. You basically coat the silicon wafer with a polymer. Then you put a mask on it and then you shine light through it. And the features of the mask, the size of those holes determine the feature size in the chip. It's not just the size of the mask that matters. It's the wavelength of the light that's used. We talked about nanotechnology being science fiction before, but this is real stuff that's being produced, that's being made, that's being used every day by people.\n","147":"Explainer: And how would you talk about that change without invoking this concept of time?\nExplainee: It's difficult to talk about something without adding time into it.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Yeah, my freshman year physics class.\nExplainer: Yeah, if you're clever, you can use that with high school algebra, maybe even a little high school trigonometry to make it even easier, to derive that clocks take off time at different rate. Do you want me to show you how that goes?\n","148":"Explainer: Even if it is a human-made concept that the universe evolved, developed, changed through time, ultimately giving rise to galaxy, stars, planets, and on this particular planet, life. That conception of time gives a feel that it's like universal, that it's out there, it's the same for everybody. It's independent of our actions or activities. Do you know that Albert Einstein shattered that view of time? He found that if you and I, say, have identical wrist watches, I'm sitting still and I'm watching you move, I will find that your clock is taking off time more slowly than my clock. But you know what's really remarkable? You can figure out this quality of time if you know one fact, that the speed of light is constant. Have you ever heard that phrase?\nExplainee: Yeah, my freshman year physics class.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Yes, please.\nExplainer: All right, so to figure out the effect of motion on time, I'm gonna use a really simple clock, it's called a light clock. It's two mirrors that are facing each other.\n","149":"Explainer: Yeah, if you're clever, you can use that with high school algebra, maybe even a little high school trigonometry to make it even easier, to derive that clocks take off time at different rate. Do you want me to show you how that goes?\nExplainee: Yes, please.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: It's much longer.\nExplainer: It's much longer, right? This one's going tick-tock, tick. This is gonna go tick, tock. In fact, we can figure out the ratio. Let's consider time on the stationary clock compared to time on this moving clock. Well, that ratio is gonna be the ratio of the lengths. Then this would be given by D over L. More time on the stationary because it's longer distance on the moving clock. Well, this length over here, that's the same as this L over here, right? So we want D over L. Now, you may have recall that in trigonometry, there's a name for L over D. Sine of theta, opposite is L, hypotenuse is D, right? And so this ratio is just 1 over sine of theta. So if we can figure out 1 over sine theta, we'll have our beautiful formula for the ratio of time and the stationary clock to time on the moving clock, we just need one other fact. The speed of light along this diagonal is equal to what we call C. C equals speed of light. But in order for this ball of light to hit that point on the mirror, the component of the speed of light in the horizontal direction better be keeping perfect pace with the speed of the clock itself. So let's assume that this clock is moving in this direction with the speed equal to V. So C times cosine theta must be equal to the speed of the clock in motion. And from this, we learn that cosine theta is equal to V over C. There's another beautiful identity you may recall from your study of trigonometry, that sine-squared theta plus cosine-squared theta is equal to 1. This is really just a Pythagorean theorem in disguise. And from that, we can now solve for a sine-squared theta equals 1 minus V over C squared. And therefore sine theta is the square root of this. And now, we're basically done because we already had over here that this ratio is 1 over sine theta, which now is 1 over the square root of 1 minus V over C squared. So you see, as V gets very close to C, this gets very close to 1. 1 minus something very close to 1 is very close to 0. 1 over something close to 0 is huge, which means the ratio of time on the stationary to time on the moving, that can be a huge number as the speed of the moving clock approaches the speed of light. Now I did this for a light clock, but it's true for any clock, and this is what Einstein discovered in 1905 with his special theory of relativity.\n","150":"Explainer: All right, so to figure out the effect of motion on time, I'm gonna use a really simple clock, it's called a light clock.

Will we have that kind of intuition about these ideas? I think it's quite possible.\n","151":"Explainer: Have you heard of the breach of Target where they were breached many years ago and their point of sale systems were hacked?\nExplainee: Yes, I heard about that.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: I've heard about similar attacks in hospitals using hospital equipment, but I'm surprised that something as simple as a meat scale would have been used in such an attack. We discussed it in class as how hackers look at some of the weakest links in these large networks and use those to tap into networks.\nExplainer: Yeah, that's another interesting concept. It's really just different layers that we have for protection, because often when you're talking about something like a corporate network, or even your home network, you typically have sort of one level of defense, right? If someone can break that or it can get in through some other system that is connected or exposes some other protocol, like Bluetooth, right? You can connect to a Bluetooth device without being on the wireless network, without being on the LAN. That potentially gives you another place that you can pivot on and then access other devices, because if something has both Bluetooth and also Wi-Fi, well, if you can get in through Bluetooth, then you can then access the Wi-Fi and get to other devices on the network. Are you familiar with buffer overflows?\n","152":"Explainer: Absolutely, you would essentially cause a segmentation fault.\nExplainee: Yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: So how does the buffer overloading relate to what you are doing in terms of network security or designing software for penetration testing?\nExplainer: Ever since buffer overflow started many years ago, there been a lot of protection mechanisms built to make it difficult to exploit. More and more, we're actually using smaller and smaller computers with smaller amounts of compute power. If you take a car, you have hundreds of microcontrollers that are all running there. So they don't really have a sophisticated operating system that can try to prevent attacks like buffer overflows. So how do we keep these low cost computers in here while adding layers of protection to prevent malice and these types of attacks? Sometimes it actually is, how can we write software or how can we build a system that prevents these types of attacks from entering? But oftentimes, it's really looking for how can we find new attacks that we haven't even necessarily thought of?

I enjoy how interdisciplinary computer science is. Like, nowadays there's so much going on in the world of computers and that's what fascinated me.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: There are a lot of ethical questions about whether we should be intervening in other countries, but it's pretty interesting that two different agencies of the government are actually working on contrasting technology. I can actually understand that because if we are creating a technology that we are going to deploy somewhere else, we should know its limitations. We should know how to control it.\nExplainer: It's good for us to understand how these systems can really break down. Although, I think one thing that I see is that some of, let's say, the organizations that are looking to break this are not necessarily going to share once they actually learn that information. They might actually sort of hold that in their back pocket and use it when it's advantageous to them.\n","154":"Explainer: So what's the connection between neutron stars and black holes?\nExplainee: So, as I understand it, a black hole is sort of like a neutron star's big brother. It's more intense, though. If you have so much matter when a star is collapsing that it can't hold itself up, it collapses to a black hole, and those are so dense that space-time breaks down in some way or another.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: So is there a sensible way to talk about what's inside a black hole, or is that, should you think of it as there is no space-time inside?\nExplainer: There isn't a sensible way to talk about it yet, and that probably means that's where Einstein's theory of gravity as a curved space-time is beginning to break down, and we need to take the extra step of going to some kind of quantum theory of gravity. And we don't have that yet. So even though the black hole isn't completely understood, we do know that they form astronomically, that in the universe things like neutron stars form and things like black holes form. The consequences are very much speaking to this curved space-time. So, for instance, if two black holes orbit each other, they're like mallets on a drum, and they actually cause space-time to ring, and it's very much part of gravitation. The ringing of space-time itself, we call gravitational waves. And this was something Einstein thought about right away in 1950-1960, he was thinking about that.\n","155":"Explainer: There isn't a sensible way to talk about it yet, and that probably means that's where Einstein's theory of gravity as a curved space-time is beginning to break down, and we need to take the extra step of going to some kind of quantum theory of gravity.

I've heard statistics like many Earth masses worth of gold were created, forged in the neutron star collision that caused that. We used to think that most elements in the universe were created in supernova, which is when stars explode, because there's so much violent activity at the center that you need that kind of energy to create new elements.\nExplainer: [Janna] The way you do in a bomb. It's basically nuclear fusion.\n","157":"Explainer: What's your name, tell me a little bit about yourself.\nExplainee: I'm Amelia, I'm nine years old.

Because it sounds a little ridiculous, right? How can we put a star in a jar? Well, we're not actually gonna put the sun, which is a star, inside a jar, but instead we're gonna take the same kind of material that the sun is made out of, and we're going to hold it for a really long time in some kind of container.

And at the very center of the atom is what we call a nucleus. And inside that nucleus is a proton. We want to take those protons and push them together to make them combine and release energy, fusion energy, that we can use to make electricity. And there's a lot of different energies and forces that we have to think about. Have you heard of gravity?\n","159":"Explainer: That's a good answer. Because it sounds a little ridiculous, right?

While you move around those iron filings with the magnet, you're totally in control of that material. You're pushing, you're pulling it, you're moving it around.

Because it can't waste any more time, because it can't be vulnerable for any longer. It can get eaten by lions and that kind of thing.

So half of their brain goes to sleep, and the other half stays awake, so that they can continue to breathe and swim, and they do it in this four hours a time, so like their right part of their brain sleeps, they're able to go up to the surface and breathe. Then their left part of their brain sleeps for four hours, and it goes back and forth, back and forth, so they can kind of maintain alertness, still breathe, and survive. Is that amazing or what?\n","170":"Explainer: A dolphin! Yes. So dolphins, kind of like hippos, have to sleep in the water, okay? But because they're mammals, right, they need to breathe.

To a large extent we are still looking for basic theoretical results around why deep neural networks generally work. Why are they able to learn so well? They're huge, billions of parameter models and it's difficult for us to interpret how they're able to do what they do.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Absolutely.\nExplainer: So, is this a good thing, a bad thing, that we're sort of losing control perhaps in some sense of the algorithm?\n","172":"Explainer: Do you know a lot about lasers? Or just about the laser that you use.\nExplainee: Not a lot, just a little bit.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: I feel like the continuous laser delivers power at a continuous rate, whereas you want all that power to be delivered in a really, really short time with your amplification.\nExplainer: And so we get the power with a lot less energy 'cause its power is energy per unit time. So we aren't depositing much energy in comparison. Can I just ask, 'cause you are using the thermal process of it heating up, but have you ever had the opportunity to use laser tweezers?\n","173":"Explainer: You haven't? Okay.\nExplainee: So I was always curious, how much further, like what higher power can we go now?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: We could probably use this to drive chemical reactions at a very, very specific spot. Like if we want to target just a single cell in the body.\nExplainer: Yes. And maybe what, do pump-probe spectroscopy and watch the cell? Or to ionize it?\n","174":"Explainer: Yes. And maybe what, do pump-probe spectroscopy and watch the cell? Or to ionize it?\nExplainee: I mean I was thinking more on the lines of if we want to, let's say destroy one cell, like a tumor cell or something like that. So that the neighboring areas are not affected but just the cell burns.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: I think short pulses might help in my experiment in the sense that if I drive my swimmers with a continuous wave as opposed to a pulsed wave, maybe a continuous wave would heat up the sample too much and a pulse laser would deliver power exactly where I need it so that I could run my experiment longer.\nExplainer: That's true. Thank you very much.\n","175":"Explainer: So what are some of the techniques you're applying to look at that debate data?\nExplainee: Something I'm interested in exploring is how well it works to use deep learning and sort of automatically extracted features from this text versus using some of the more traditional techniques that we have, things like lexicons or some sort of template matching techniques for extracting features from texts. That's a question I'm just interested in, in general. When do we really need deep learning versus when can we use something that's a little bit more interpretable, something that's been around for a while?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: I definitely think there is, but I also, sort of, see it varying a lot based on the use case, something that, kind of, works out of the box and maybe works a little bit more automatically might be better. And in other cases, you do, sort of, kind of, you want a lot of fine grain control.\nExplainer: So is that where some of that frustration around the lack of controllability and interpretability comes from?\n","176":"Explainer: So is that where some of that frustration around the lack of controllability and interpretability comes from?\nExplainee: Yeah, if you're building a model that just predicts the next thing based off of everything it's seen from texts online, then yeah, you're really gonna be replicating whatever that distribution online is.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Yeah, it's a really tricky question. As you said, these models are trained to, sort of, predict the next sequence of words, given a certain sequence of words. So we could start with just, sort of, prompts like the woman was versus the man was, and, kind of, pull out common words that are, sort of, more used with one phrase versus the other. So that's, sort of, a qualitative way of looking at it. It's not ever kind of a guarantee of how the model is gonna behave in one particular instance. And I think that's what's really tricky and that's why I, sort of, think it's really good for creators of systems to just be honest about, This is, sort of, what we have seen. And so then, someone can make their own judgment about, Is this gonna be too high risk for, sort of, my particular use case?\nExplainer: I imagine in the last few years, we've seen a lot of changes and improvements in the capabilities of NLP systems. So is there anything in that that you're particularly excited about exploring further?\n","177":"Explainer: As an engineer of course, I love quantifiable things. I like saying here's my 18 millisecond motion to photon, here's my angular resolution that I'm improving. I'm doing the color-space right. But you can look not too far back where you say we have blu-ray DVDs at this amazing resolution, but more people want to watch Youtube videos at really bad early internet video speeds. Where there are things that if you deliver a value to people then these objective quantities may not be the most important thing. And while we're certainly pushing as hard as we can on lots of these things that make the experience better in potentially every way or maybe just for videos or for different things. I don't think that its necessary. I've commented that I think usually my favorite titles on mobile that are fully synthetic are ones that don't even try, they just go and do light-mapped, black-shaded. And I think its a lovely aesthetic. I think that you don't wind up fighting all of the aliasing. While you get some other titles that, oh we're gonna be high-tech with our specular bump maps with roughness. And you've got aliasing everywhere, and you can't hold frame rate and its all problematic. While some of these that are clearly very synthetic worlds where its nothing but these cartoony flat-shaded things with lighting, but they look and they feel good. And you can buy that you're in that place. And you want to know what's around that monolith over there.\nExplainee: We did a project called Life of Us, which was exactly that mindset. We were let's embrace low-poly aesthetic and just simple vertex shading. And we ended up realizing, you can embody these various creatures and transform yourself. And when you do that with co-presence of another creature, another human, it makes for a totally magical journey. You don't even think for a second, you actually dismiss the whole idea of photo-realism and embrace that reality for what it is. I think it actually helps put you at ease a little bit.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Or bandwidth, or streaming.\nExplainer: But if we just wind up following the path that we're on, we're gonna get double and quadruple, but we're not gonna get 50 times more powerful than we are right now. We will run into atomic limits on our fabrication. So given that, I'm trying to tell people that, start buying back into optimization, start buying back into thinking a bit more creatively. Because you can't just wait, its not going to get to that point where it really is fixed to those highest degrees just by waiting for computing to be advanced. If we want this to be something used by a billion people then we need it to be lighter, cheaper, more comfortable.\n","178":"Explainer: The end goal of reality, of course in computer graphics people chase photo-realistic form for a long time. And basically, we've achieved it. Photo-realism, if you're willing to throw enough discreet path traced rays at things, you can generate photo-realistic views. And we understand the light really well. Of course it still takes a half hour per frame like it always has, or more, to render the different things. So its an understood problem and given infinite computing power we could be doing that in virtual reality. However, a point that I've made to people in recent years is that, we are running out of More's Law. Maybe we'll see some wonderful breakthrough in quantum structures or whatever--\nExplainee: Or bandwidth, or streaming.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: And there's constantly novel UX innovations. Like Google Earth, where the kind of elimination of your periphery as you zoom in and move. And also, giving you the user action to decide where you're going and looking. I'm constantly seeing people coming up with ways to break from the paradigms of actual reality and then introduce mechanisms that work very well.\nExplainer: You know there's tons of opportunities for the synthetic case where you want to be able to have your synthetic fantasy world where everybody is a creature that's created by the computer and simulated reasonably. But of course we've got, you know we still don't do people well simulated. That's a hard problem, we've been beating our heads against it for a long time. I do think we're making progress and I wouldn't bet on that being solved in 10 years, but maybe 20 years. Because it is going to take a lot of AI. Its going to take a lot of machine-learning, where its not going to be a matter of us dissecting all the micro-expressions that people do. Its gonna be lets take every youtube video ever made and run it through some enormous learner that's going to figure out how to make people realistic.\n","179":"Explainer: But if we just wind up following the path that we're on, we're gonna get double and quadruple, but we're not gonna get 50 times more powerful than we are right now.

But I think, to your point very much, we need to solve the actual human and social challenges and turn those into opportunities to figure out how this technology fits into our lives.\nExplainer: I'm still a believer that the magic's out there. We haven't found it yet, so somebody's going to happen upon the formula. I feel like I've felt little pockets of magic.\n","180":"Explainer: So, from your perspective, how would you describe gravity?\nExplainee: I'm taught that it's a force. It's described by inverse law. But I also know that it's a field. And there's a recent discovery with gravitational waves, although I don't know the specific details about that.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Yeah.\nExplainer: So you can also think of a gravitational field, something that permeates all of space. Even though the earth is three stories below us, it's not as though it's pulling at us from a distance. We're actually interacting with the field at this point and there's a real interaction right here at this point. And that's nice, because people were worried that if things acted at a distance, that the way that old-fashioned inverse-square force law describes it, that it was as spooky as mind-bending a spoon, that it was like telekinesis. If you don't touch something, how do you affect it? And so the first step was to start to think of gravity as a field that permeates all of a space. And it's weaker very far from the Earth and it's closer very close to the Earth. So one way to think of this field as a field that's really describing a curved space-time that is everywhere. Forget the difficulty of the math, just the intuition comes from two kind of simple observations. One was what Einstein described as the happiest thought of his life. So, right now, you might feel heavy in your chair, and we might feel heavy on the floor and our feet, or standing in an elevator cab. And Einstein said, what does the chair have to do with it, or the floor, or the elevator? Those aren't gravitational objects. So he wanted to eliminate them, and one way to do the thought experiment is to imagine standing in an elevator that you can see out of, a black box. And imagine the cable is cut and you and the elevator begin to fall.\n","181":"Explainer: So, when you say it's an inverse-square law, that means that the closer you are, the more strongly you feel the gravitational pull. And that makes sense. There's very few things that are stronger when you're further apart.\nExplainee: Yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: So, in free fall?\nExplainer: You're in total free fall. Now, because things fall at the same rate, including the elevator and you, you can actually float in the elevator. If you just floated in the elevator, the two of you would drop, and you might not even know you're falling. You could take an apple and drop it in front of you, and it would float in front of you. You would actually experience weightlessness. It's called the equivalence principle. It was Einstein's happiest thought that what you're really doing when you're experiencing gravity isn't being heavy in your chair, it's falling weightlessly in the gravitational field. And that was the first step, to think of gravity as weightlessness and falling.\n","182":"Explainer: Yeah, exactly.\nExplainee: Yeah, yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Well, if I threw it straight, I would think it would go straight.\nExplainer: Yeah, it would just go straight. But if you did that on the Earth, what would happen?\n","183":"Explainer: Yeah, it would just go straight. But if you did that on the Earth, what would happen?\nExplainee: It would just go down.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Oh.\nExplainer: You had that moment, I saw that it your face!\n","184":"Explainer: You had that moment, I saw that it your face!\nExplainee: Yeah, yeah, yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: That's amazing.\nExplainer: Isn't it kind of amazing?\n","185":"Explainer: Isn't it kind of amazing?\nExplainee: Yeah. [laughs]\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Wow.\nExplainer: Wow. [Janna and Lisa laughs] Well, let's hope it doesn't happen.\n","186":"Explainer: What do you know about algorithms?\nExplainee: Nothing really, at all honestly. I think it's just probably a way to store information in computers.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: I got ready.\nExplainer: Okay. And get ready. What does that mean?\n","187":"Explainer: Okay.\nExplainee: Getting dressed.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: I just assumed it would be easier to navigate.\nExplainer: What if your friend happened to be at the very bottom of this randomly organized list? Why is that a problem? Like he or she's still there.\n","188":"Explainer: What if your friend happened to be at the very bottom of this randomly organized list? Why is that a problem? Like he or she's still there.\nExplainee: I guess it would take a while to get to while you're scrolling.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Or I would just flip through and just look for the J's I guess.\nExplainer: Yeah. So, let me propose that we start that way. I could just start at the beginning and step by step I could just look at each page, looking for John, looking for John. Now even if you've never seen this here technology before, it turns out this is exactly what your phone could be doing in software, like someone from Google or Apple or the like, they could write software that uses a technique in programming known as a loop, and a loop, as the word implies, is just sort of do something again and again. What if instead of starting from the beginning and going one page at a time, what if I, or what if your phone goes like two pages or two names at a time? Would this be correct do you think?\n","189":"Explainer: That, in of itself, is kind of a problem or it's an inefficient solution to the problem. So, it turns out that back in my day, before there were cell phones, everyone's numbers from my schools were literally printed in a book, and everyone in my town and my city, my state was printed in an actual phone book. Even if you've never seen this technology before, how would you propose verbally to find John in this phone book?\nExplainee: Or I would just flip through and just look for the J's I guess.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Well you could skip over John, I think.\nExplainer: In what sense?\n","190":"Explainer: In what sense?\nExplainee: If he's in one of the middle pages that you skipped over.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Maybe you could use that strategy until you get close to the section and then switch to going one by one.\nExplainer: Okay, that's nice. So, you could kind of like go twice as fast but then kind of pump the brakes as you near your exit on the highway, or in this case near the J section of the book.\n","191":"Explainer: Yeah, so sort of accidentally and frankly with like 50\/50 probability, John could get sandwiched in between two pages. But does that mean I have to throw that algorithm out altogether?\nExplainee: Maybe you could use that strategy until you get close to the section and then switch to going one by one.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Exactly.\nExplainer: And maybe alternatively, if I get to like A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, if I get to the K section, then I could just double back like one page just to make sure John didn't get sandwiched between those pages. So, the nice thing about that second algorithm is that I'm flying through the phone book like two pages at a time. So, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12. It's not perfect, it's not necessarily correct but it is if I just take one extra step. So, I think it's fixable, but what your phone is probably doing and frankly what I and like my parents and grandparents used to do back in the day was we'd probably go roughly to the middle of the phone book here, and just intuitively, if this is an alphabetized phone book in English, what section am I probably going to find myself in roughly?\n","192":"Explainer: Okay, that's nice. So, you could kind of like go twice as fast but then kind of pump the brakes as you near your exit on the highway, or in this case near the J section of the book.\nExplainee: Exactly.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: K?\nExplainer: Okay. So, I'm in the K section. Is John going to be to the left or to the right?\n","193":"Explainer: Okay. So, I'm in the K section. Is John going to be to the left or to the right?\nExplainee: To the left.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: And you can do it again.\nExplainer: Yeah, exactly. So, now maybe I'm in the E section, which is a little to the left. So, John is clearly going to be to the right, so I can again tear the problem poorly in half, throw this half of the problem away, and I claim now that if we started with a thousand pages, now we've gone to 500, 250, now we're really moving quickly.\n","194":"Explainer: Yeah. So, John is going to be to the left or the right and what we can do here, though your phone does something smarter, is tear the problem in half, throw half of the problem away, being left with just 500 pages now. But what might I next do? I could sort of naively just start at the beginning again, but we've learned to do better. I can go roughly to the middle here.\nExplainee: And you can do it again.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Yeah.\nExplainer: And so, eventually I'm hopefully dramatically left with just one single page at which point John is either on that page or not on that page, and I can call him. Roughly how many steps might this third algorithm take if I started with a thousand pages then went to 500, 250, 125, how many times can you divide 1,000 in half? Maybe?\n","195":"Explainer: Yeah, exactly. So, now maybe I'm in the E section, which is a little to the left. So, John is clearly going to be to the right, so I can again tear the problem poorly in half, throw this half of the problem away, and I claim now that if we started with a thousand pages, now we've gone to 500, 250, now we're really moving quickly.\nExplainee: Yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: 10.\nExplainer: That's roughly roughly 10. Because in the first algorithm, looking again for someone like Zoe in the worst case might have to go all the way through a thousand pages. But the second algorithm you said was 500, maybe 501, essentially the same thing. So, twice as fast. But this third and final algorithm is sort of fundamentally faster because you're sort of dividing and conquering it in half, in half, in half, not just taking one or two bites out of it out of a time. So, this of course is not how we used to use phone books back in the day since otherwise they'd be single use only. But it is how your phone is actually searching for Zoe, for John, for anyone else, but it's doing it in software.\n","196":"Explainer: And so, eventually I'm hopefully dramatically left with just one single page at which point John is either on that page or not on that page, and I can call him. Roughly how many steps might this third algorithm take if I started with a thousand pages then went to 500, 250, 125, how many times can you divide 1,000 in half? Maybe?\nExplainee: 10.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Oh, that's cool.\nExplainer: So, here we've happened to focus on searching algorithms, looking for John in the phone book. But the technique we just used can indeed be called divide and conquer, where you take a big problem and you divide and conquer it, that is you try to chop it up into smaller, smaller, smaller pieces. A more sophisticated type of algorithm, at least depending on how you implement it, something known as a recursive algorithm. Recursive algorithm is essentially an algorithm that uses itself to solve the exact same problem again and again, but chops it smaller, and smaller, and smaller ultimately.\n","197":"Explainer: [Donna] And what's your major?\nExplainee: I'm an engineering physics major with a minor in math. I'm in the three, two program for biomedical engineering.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Not yet. I'm really hoping that we will. I think it's super interesting just the field in general because I really do enjoy examining all the calculations and being able to do a little bit more of the math side of physics.\nExplainer: Okay. As opposed to the experimental side and seeing things? Okay so I'm much more, I like to see the things happening. So then the question is, what's so special about making a light that's intense enough to actually possibly blow things up? Certainly we can blow atoms up with the laser hammer and when the laser light comes in and just smacks the electrons right off the atom. And so the question really is how do you make that? Back in the 70s and into the 80s, I know that was a long time ago for you, we had big energy lasers and we had short pulse lasers, we couldn't have big energy, short pulse lasers and actually it was my supervisor and I that figured the way around that and we got something called chirped pulse amplification. Have you heard of chirped pulse amplification by any chance?\n","198":"Explainer: Excellent. I got an engineering physics degree. There you go, something in common. We're here today talking about lasers. So have you have had much exposure to lasers yet at school?\nExplainee: Not yet. I'm really hoping that we will. I think it's super interesting just the field in general because I really do enjoy examining all the calculations and being able to do a little bit more of the math side of physics.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Vaguely.\nExplainer: Well I brought a little bit of a prop to explain how chirped pulse amplification works. Our short pulses are made of different colors. So I've got a colored slinky here. We probably could've called it stretched pulse amplification but that's kind of boring so we used the word chirped. The word chirped comes around because birds chirp. When the birds are singing, the notes are actually changing audio frequency with time and that's a chirp. The point is is that when all the light is squeezed together like this, it's a short pulse. And that's when it's a hammer because all of the light is now concentrated and you can imagine if this was coming along and also using a lens to focus it small, then all of that light at the focal spot, concentrate. And so that was the laser hammer. So we can't have that in the laser. So the question is what could we do? The fact that it's different colors and different colors because of dispersion, travel different speeds inside material. So we used a long fiber, 1.4 kilometers of fiber but, in fiber, the red colors really haven't got that much in common with the glass atoms and so they spend very little time interacting and they travel fast. The red is going to start traveling faster than the green, faster than the blue and, as you travel down the fiber, next thing you know, you have a long pulse and it's chirped from red at the beginning to blue at the back. And so the frequencies go hoo! Like this okay? So this is a chirped pulse and now it's a long pulse. And so, first this is what we did, we chirped it, we stretched it, then we can safely amplify it because it's not all concentrated and, after we amplify it, then we use something called a compressor and we put all of the colors back together and it was back being a short pulse but a high energy pulse. And then we really had what I like to call a laser hammer. When this laser pulse goes inside, it smacks those electrons right off the atom.\n","199":"Explainer: Absolutely. And that's a great example because you have models that are operating to do things like figure out if a new email is spam or not. So what would you think about if you were looking at an email and trying to decide if it went in one category or another?\nExplainee: I'd probably look at certain keywords. Maybe if the recipient and the sender had exchanged emails before and generally, those fell into in the past.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Obviously, like the features that you just described are features which a person would have had to think about. Are there features which, like, the machine itself could learn?\nExplainer: This is a great question because it really gets to the difference between some of our different tools in our machine learning tool belt in addressing problems like this. So if we were to use a supervised learning classic classification approach, a person would need to think about those features and creatively come up with them in approach we call the kitchen sink approach, which is just try everything you can possibly think of and see what works. Unsupervised learning, where we don't have labeled data and we're trying to infer some structure out of the data is you're projecting that data into a space and looking for things like clusters. And there's a bunch of really fun math about how you do that, how you think about distance and by distance, I mean that if we have two data points in space, how do we decide if they're similar or not?\n","200":"Explainer: You build a system that could actually be useless. So years ago, I had a client that was a big telecom company and they had a data scientist who built a deep learning system to predict customer churn. It actually was very accurate, but it wasn't useful because nobody knew why the prediction was what it was. So they could say, you know, Sunny, you're likely to quit next month. But they had no idea what to do about it. And so, I think there are a bunch of failure modes.\nExplainee: Would that be an example of, like, linear regression where the regression is accurate, but, you know, for marketing purposes, it's like, if you don't know why I'm quitting the service, then how can we fix this?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: How can we improve machine learning algorithms?\nExplainer: It's actually fairly new that we're able to solve all of these problems and start to build these products and apply it in businesses and apply it, you know, everywhere. And so, we're still developing good practices and what it means to be a professional in machine learning. We're really developing a notion of what good looks like.\n","201":"Explainer: Alright, so, at some point, you can probably see it right now? So without moving your eyes, this is kind of hard, tell me how many fingers I'm holding up?\nExplainee: Uh, three?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","202":"Explainer: It's really fascinating work, especially now we're all familiar with the viruses and how they act. And I'm not aware of any viruses that build nanostructures. So how did you come to that? And then how do you actually program a virus to do your bidding?\nExplainee: We work on something called bacteriophages, it's a virus with DNA. This particular bacteriophage called M13 bacteriophage is made up of single stranded DNA and proteins. It's long and thin. So it's 880 nanometers in length, and it's about 9 nanometers in diameter. And so one of the reasons I love it is it spans the nanoscale and almost the micron scale at the same time. Take the single strand DNAs, obviously a model, and you can cut it with molecular scissors. And you can put a new piece of DNA in between. And so you put a small piece of DNA in there that doesn't belong there. And that piece of DNA is going to randomly code for a protein. Now, the next time that that virus is replicated within a bacterial host, it'll be able to put a new protein sequence on the coat, just a short protein sequence on the coat, maybe like 8 or 12 amino acids in length. And just like that abalone is going to grab calcium and build calcium carbonate. We're going to have our viruses build iron phosphate for a battery electrode material or Gallium arsenide or cad sulfide for a semiconductor material.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Biology is chemistry. Molecules, proteins, and DNA work with all the same kinds of bonding and things that the chemicals that you're gonna be looking for in these processes. It's put together in a way that when a protein or enzyme folds, it almost always folds correctly. That's kind of the beauty of it, the predictable aspect of it encoded in its DNA. If we need to make it the same over and over again, then as long as you have the right DNA sequence, DNA is a beautiful structure on the nanoscale. And there's really, really cool, incredible work on DNA origami, when DNA can fold into just the right structure. And so I can see that as an interface, that would be really cool and interesting in your work. And you can have the virus make the DNA for the DNA origami, and then you use DNA to assemble your beautiful structures.\nExplainer: It's really fascinating. You have all these little worker viruses building the materials for you. How are you then applying these materials that you're building?\n","203":"Explainer: Looking ahead, 5 years, 10 years, where do you see your own work, and maybe the field more broadly?\nExplainee: The future I'd like to see is environmentally friendly chemistry and materials synthesis. And I think that we're really going that way. If we think about batteries of the future, solar cells of the future, thinking about earth abundant materials and processes that are compatible with the earth and environment.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: I agree completely. We like to solve problems. Nano bio is the toolkit that we bring a lot. It happens to be a very strong and evolving toolkit. That's another thing that I love about biology is if you can come up with a solution that's not perfect at all to begin with when you're making a battery electrode material or any kind of material you're making, you have evolution on your side to try to make it better and better as a function of time. That can be quite rapid.\nExplainer: So Angela, thank you so much for joining us. And I look forward to seeing more work coming out of your lab in the future.\n","204":"Explainer: It's what keeps us on the earth.\nExplainee: What?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Nice.\nExplainer: The main thing about black hole to remember is that it's just, like I said, how the earth holds you down, the black hole pulls you in, as well. Now, try and take the ball from me, black hole--\n","205":"Explainer: The reason we're not just flying off the earth is because earth has gravity, so if we throw something up, it comes back down, so that's why when we're walking on the earth, we don't fly off the earth because the earth has gravity, and it keeps us down.\nExplainee: Nice.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Why do you hold it so tight?\nExplainer: I'm holding it tight to show you then when you're trying to pull it, a black hole will really hold onto it with its gravity.\n","206":"Explainer: Do you know why we're here today?\nExplainee: Because we're talking about science.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Um, something that helps you remember things.\nExplainer: Definitely. So what we're gonna talk about, this is something that people study in the brain called the connectome.\n","207":"Explainer: Do you know that your body is made up of really tiny things called cells?\nExplainee: Um, yes, I know that.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Oh.\nExplainer: That was awesome, Daniel, thank you.\n","208":"Explainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Maybe part of the distinction in between time and space, it's that you have a clear irreversible evolution. So how to explain what time is, well, it's a parameter that is measured by clocks. I mean, at the end, this is what we know.\nExplainer: And allows us to talk about change.\n","209":"Explainer: Which gives a clear sense of causality.\nExplainee: Yep.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: I found quite surprising that you could have this exotic behavior of signal propagation in a system that was extremely simple, totally classical, there was nothing weird except one dimension that was compactified, was identified on a circle. Actually, even the standard vanilla causal structure of special relativity may give some very unexpected behaviors when you combine it with other simple modifications of just the flat space time.\nExplainer: And the beauty of it is, it is not like there is some high-powered mathematical methodology, straightforward algebra that a high school kid would know is all that you need to extract these unusual results.\n","210":"Explainer: To note our recent paper, where we were thinking about Einstein's ideas of special relativity, but in a setting where the global shape of the space time, we imagine there might be a curled up dimension of space, a circular dimension and thought about how special relativity works in that setting, we came to a result in this very basic setting. You can send signals into the past, not in a way that will violate causality. Did that surprise you, that by going from the usual topology that doesn't have a closed part of space, but making that one change, you could have this radical impact?\nExplainee: I found quite surprising that you could have this exotic behavior of signal propagation in a system that was extremely simple, totally classical, there was nothing weird except one dimension that was compactified, was identified on a circle. Actually, even the standard vanilla causal structure of special relativity may give some very unexpected behaviors when you combine it with other simple modifications of just the flat space time.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: And they were unusual because even if you do not violate causality, we discovered that a fast-moving observer, that could be us on a rocket, could send signals very far and then back in a very small time.\nExplainer: And so the old idea that of course we always hear about, that if we ever make contact with extraterrestrial life, if they're far away, we can't really have a conversation because we'll say hello, and then like 10,000 years or 100,000 years later, they'll answer us 'cause they'll take that long for the signals. But at least in this setup, which we don't know is true about our universe, but if it were, then you could have a real-time conversation over arbitrarily large distances, which is--\n","211":"Explainer: And the beauty of it is, it is not like there is some high-powered mathematical methodology, straightforward algebra that a high school kid would know is all that you need to extract these unusual results.\nExplainee: And they were unusual because even if you do not violate causality, we discovered that a fast-moving observer, that could be us on a rocket, could send signals very far and then back in a very small time.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: That was unexpected. And so that shows how even ideas that seem to be well-settled and well-understood have surprises.\nExplainer: Like, why didn't Einstein realize this?\n","212":"Explainer: And who do you credit with that? Is that Newton? Do you go Newton or a little bit below? Do you Galileo?\nExplainee: I would say Galileo, Newton. Of course, the completion of this idea is Newton.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Actually, it resonates with me for various reasons. One is that, professionally, we use spacetime diagrams, Penrose diagrams, a lot of diagrams where space and times are just two axis on a board. And when we describe a particle, we have a line that goes up in time. By the way, this image also is the last image in Pros, the last page, there is this beautiful sentence, which is also true, saying that if he has the time, he would like to describe people as being monstrous beings that extending time much longer than in space. If C equal to 1, that's very true. So this idea that you have a continuum, and time should not be made to disappear as soon as it's gone, is very practical. It's also what is behind the idea of histories in quantum mechanics. When in the approach of various people including Hartle that collaborated a lot with Hawking. There is this idea that what you describe is a history, it's not a particular moment in time, but it's an evolution. This history treats space and time on a more equal basis.\nExplainer: But would you say there's more to it than the technical, more to it than the diagrams, more to it than sort of an interpretation of the mathematical equations? would you go so far as to take solace in the fact that, in a sense that you will always exist because you will always be at the moments of space and time that you have occupy throughout your life?\n","213":"Explainer: Have you done any work in side channel analysis?\nExplainee: Like, a little bit. I read the Rowhammer paper. I found it really interesting, but it's nothing that I've actually worked with.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: So all memory devices are just, it's just a bunch of gates and they're in rows. They basically all hold different pieces of memory. That's all the gates are. Either they're turned on or they're turned off. So what Rowhammer found was they tested a bunch of different memory devices and found that by doing a certain order of storing things, and then pulling that information back in a certain way in one place would actually flip gates in a different place. So you could actually do a bunch of things to a piece of memory that had nothing to do with something that may be critical in a different place and actually change its contents, and that obviously exposes all sorts of security issues, because that's very hard to predict.\nExplainer: Yeah, I suppose the physical adjacency of the underlying transistors and capacitors that are holding that storage. That's crazy. I think the first time I heard of an interesting attack like that was learning about the cold boot attack. Being able to, you know, someone enters their password on their computer and that decrypts their hard drive and then they walk away. Being able to extract that password is really difficult. If I can pull that memory chip out and extract that memory, put it in my own device, except the problem is memory is volatile, so it'll erase as soon as I pull it out. You can take something like canned air, turn it upside down, cool that computer, make it real nice and cool. Then you have a minute or two to pull out the memory, put into your own device, extract the memory, and then you're good. It's such a simple method to really extract something kind of critical. Like Rowhammer, it's such a low level of vulnerability and you could argue that it's not necessarily a vulnerability in the architecture itself, but rather exploitation of physics at that point.\n","214":"Explainer: So the side channel analysis is really looking not at a vulnerability within a system, but really unintended consequences of what the system is built on. A very simple example of a side channel is putting your ear to the ground to hear if there are horses coming towards you, and the same thing applies to technology. So you can have something like a CPU, it's executing instructions, certain instructions that use a little bit more power, and power is reserved in these capacitors, which are like tiny batteries next to your CPU. And as they're pulling power, there's something in physics called the electrostrictive effect where the capacitor will move in a very, very tiny amount. And then although we can't hear it, the microphone on a mobile device can actually listen to that. If you then listen to that and you say, oh, I see a pattern here, and you can go all the way down and then extract and reveal the full password, the full key, even though it could be argued that the algorithm itself, there's no problem with it.\nExplainee: So all memory devices are just, it's just a bunch of gates and they're in rows. They basically all hold different pieces of memory. That's all the gates are. Either they're turned on or they're turned off. So what Rowhammer found was they tested a bunch of different memory devices and found that by doing a certain order of storing things, and then pulling that information back in a certain way in one place would actually flip gates in a different place.

Over the last year while I was doing some other stuff, I actually designed some microcontroller boards for a company that was doing stuff with, like, a smart watering project. The problems with updating is just, like, that scares me the most. Like, people don't update their own stuff, let alone these, like, devices.\nExplainer: I keep forgetting to update my fridge.\n","215":"Explainer: That's pretty challenging if you want to use wireless, right? If you wanna use a wireless router.\nExplainee: Yeah, I mean, there's obviously essentials, but yeah, no matter what, you can't really avoid any of this.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Oh yeah, for sure. When people find vulnerabilities, I think it's their duty to release those to the public.\nExplainer: Especially now that we're seeing more and more companies who are trying to make it illegal for you to inspect the vehicle that you've purchased, right? Something that you actually own.\n","216":"Explainer: The risk right now, just during this quarantine, is actually massive now that we think about it, because you might have these legacy systems. You know, they were built 20, 30 years ago, and it's too costly to upgrade, but now you can't actually have a lot of people in a single location, so potentially, they actually do have to now add some sort of remote capabilities to these systems that were never meant to be on the internet. Have you ever had any ethical concerns with the stuff you're interested in or the work you do?\nExplainee: Oh yeah, for sure. When people find vulnerabilities, I think it's their duty to release those to the public.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Yeah, I think that's nuts. I'm firmly against that for sure.\nExplainer: What if it were illegal? Would you then do it? Fortunately it's not today, right? It hasn't been, you know, despite their attempts, none of that has been passed, but if you had a vehicle and you wanted to inspect it, but all of a sudden, it passed, I mean.\n","217":"Explainer: Especially now that we're seeing more and more companies who are trying to make it illegal for you to inspect the vehicle that you've purchased, right? Something that you actually own.\nExplainee: Yeah, I think that's nuts. I'm firmly against that for sure.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: I don't know, probably, yeah. [laughing] I don't think that's hurting anyone,\nExplainer: But the laws don't always equate to hurting anyone. I ethically think similar to you in that, you know, what is moral to me is as long as I'm not intentionally hurting others, right?\n","218":"Explainer: What if it were illegal? Would you then do it?

[laughing] I don't think that's hurting anyone,\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Yeah.\nExplainer: I think we see every day that ethics and the laws aren't necessarily the same thing all the time.\n","219":"Explainer: What have you been up to? And yeah, what are you working on?\nExplainee: Lately I've been doing, you know, always a little bit of side channel analysis. So what I really do, you know, is all hardware layer. So I've been looking, you know, at some various devices lately, at how susceptible they are to fault attacks, what that sort of means in real life. You know, not just purely the research side, but also how much should you care about it.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: One of them was looking at, like, a little hardware Bitcoin wallet, and you could use fault injection to actually recover secrets from it, and a lot of devices. I mean, the whole idea is pretty cool, right? Because you tell the device, Hey, I want to authenticate, and it's supposed to run some really crazy math that authenticates it, but instead of doing that crazy math and attacking the math, you just attack the check at the end.\nExplainer: We're also scratching the surface of, like, what is possible? It's not necessarily just the system itself and not necessarily that algorithm itself. Like you said, you don't necessarily need to attack the math in some cases. You can just attack that check. And I think something that's been pretty cool is looking at higher energy particles. It's going to be maybe hard to entirely confirm, but I think it'd be really, really cool to actually see. Like, I want to see one of these faults because I haven't seen it myself. And also, how do you know that you've seen it? I've started playing with, like, setting up a cloud chamber. A cloud chamber lets you actually view high energy particles going through sort of like in a small jar with some evaporated alcohol. And I thought it'd be really cool if we put some memory chip in there, like a basic memory chip and we just fill it with some data, but then you put a camera on that area and you just watch. Assuming that there is a high energy particle that actually hits that memory, that should potentially flip the energy state of that bit. The outside microcontrollers should be able to read that and actually say, Oh wait, the data, even though I'm not changing data, I'm only reading data, and we should be able to visibly or optically see it. What I'm wondering is could that be a next area of research? Because I don't think anyone's actually looking at intentionally injecting high energy particles to take over a computer, when really, you know, that's another technique for fault injection, technically speaking.\n","220":"Explainer: Maybe a mutual acquaintance of ours, Jasper gave a example of fault injection, and I like to use that as, when I'm trying to explain fault injection, he shows a pinball machine and the pinball machine, obviously the two inputs are the two plungers when you're playing a pinball machine, but fault injection, you can tilt the entire pinball machine, right? You're just introducing some external variable that's outside of the traditional inputs that you're used to and you've now controlled the environment in a advantageous way to the user or the player. Can you give an example of some type of fault injection that you're doing or working on?\nExplainee: One of them was looking at, like, a little hardware Bitcoin wallet, and you could use fault injection to actually recover secrets from it, and a lot of devices. I mean, the whole idea is pretty cool, right?

So flipping it in this sort of flash memory. And so someone's done it with x-rays. There's actually, I forget who now. There's a paper, at least one, and it's just like a little plate they make with like a hole in it to concentrate the x-ray source and it works, so yeah, it's super interesting. Like, one bit in memory means a lot, especially in the flash memory side. Yeah, visualizing it would be cool though.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Yeah, so actually, so it's funny you mentioned, like, making it more obvious. I mean, staying on fault injection right now, this is lately what I've been up to. A lot of making a little kind of, you know, like electronics kits of old, right? And you can assemble it all yourself and see how it works. So making something like that for fault injection. So all kind of older logic and stuff like that. So, I mean, it's sort of based on, like, you're presented the little MUX chip. You know, voltage switcher. That sort of idea, using just discreet logic to generate the actual glitch itself. So, but you know, it's part of, I think, this stuff, right? It's like people don't know about it sometimes. Like, even engineers designing systems. It's new to a lot of people.\nExplainer: The thing is, even if you know about that, then there's so many others that someone won't necessarily know about, because there's so many, I guess, potential areas for a fault to occur. Where do you think security is going or new research is going? Are there any new areas you think are coming out or are going to be more interesting, you know, pretty soon?\n","222":"Explainer: Yeah, that's 100% correct. Have you ever heard a song called Amazing Grace?\nExplainee: No.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: The second one.\nExplainer: [Jacob] Awesome. And why did you prefer that one?\n","223":"Explainer: [Jacob] Awesome. And why did you prefer that one?\nExplainee: Because it sounds better.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Mm-hmm.\nExplainer: You're the best.\n","224":"Explainer: But you learned about black holes?\nExplainee: Sure.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Paradoxes.\nExplainee: yeah, absolutely.\n","225":"Explainer: Yeah, if you are going to be able to change the past, that's the one that resonates most with me.\nExplainee: I think the same.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Right.\nExplainer: And that raises uncomfortable issues for many people having to do with like free will.\n","226":"Explainer: And that raises uncomfortable issues for many people having to do with like free will.\nExplainee: I'm immediately uncomfortable.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Absolutely.\nExplainer: But the finding was, the ball can come out and just sort of graze the other one, but it can't affect it enough to prevent the sequence of events from happening. And the way I like to think about it frankly is if there's one universe, not parallel universes like in the other solution, moments in time just are. They don't change, the whole point of time is the variable along which change can happen. So if you have the atoms of time, the individual events, there's no conception of them changing. So whatever collection of influences were in play that allowed your parents to meet, they will always be in play because you were always part of that moment.\n","227":"Explainer: Yeah, so that one, there's actually some people like Joe Polchinski who did some wonderful studies of billiard ball tables, where you imagine a billiard ball goes into a wormhole, comes out and hits the very ball that was going into the hole. And in that way, if it could knock it off course, we seem to be in some logical paradox.\nExplainee: Absolutely.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Do you think travel back to the past is impossible because of a deep physical, like mathematical reasoning, or just because of all of these problems that yet you've been talking about?\nExplainer: I suspect that when we've fully understand the mathematics of the final physical laws, if we ever come upon them, I think there's gonna be something built in that prevents this kind of free travel to the past. But sometimes I wonder if that's just coming from a more emotional place where I sort of want the world to be safe from this kind of paradoxes. So what's pretty clear based on any of the hypothetical proposals for traveling to the past that have come out of physics, you can't travel to a moment in the past before the first time travel machine is built.\n","228":"Explainee: Yeah, we do have an answer. So the simplest version of that is, imagine that the universe has a shape of a donut.\nExplainee: All right.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: To you or to them?\nExplainer: To them.\n","229":"Explainer: as they are when we teach to freshmen the special theory of relativity.

If I have three moves in a row, I'd probably checkmate them with rook H3, queen H4, and then queen takes H7, checkmate.\nExplainer: I'm very happy that's the first plan that you came up with, right? You can bring your queen out this way or the rook. You can start with both, and then you come here and then you checkmate. But I did say white gets three moves in a row, right?\n","232":"Explainer: For me, I would describe chess as a lot of what you said, and also, it's a mix of really quick plans like tactics and then things that can take four, five, six, seven moves like a plan, like a strategy. So let's practice. In this position, I had the white pieces. You're playing on my side. My opponent was playing with the black pieces. So we switched a little bit. So if I said, Hey, you get three moves in a row, can you come up with a plan?\nExplainee: I think I could. If I have three moves in a row, I'd probably checkmate them with rook H3, queen H4, and then queen takes H7, checkmate.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Yeah.\nExplainer: But that's how we have to think about plans, right? We have to think about, Okay, well if I get a couple of moves in a row, what would I like to accomplish? What does my opponent want to do? So I'm not just gonna sit here and get checkmated hopefully. Right? So what do you think I want to do in this position?\n","233":"Explainer: I'm very happy that's the first plan that you came up with, right? You can bring your queen out this way or the rook. You can start with both, and then you come here and then you checkmate. But I did say white gets three moves in a row, right?\nExplainee: Yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: I think my king is on a bad scale right now, so maybe you are trying to like trade and then somehow get an attack on my king.\nExplainer: Oh, you're saying like if I take this pawn, maybe in the future I'll try to open up this diagonal. See, that's very good vision. There's some pieces in the way, but yes. In chess, you have to always keep an eye on what can possibly open. Do you know how you can tell whether a position is closed or open?\n","234":"Explainer: But that's how we have to think about plans, right? We have to think about, Okay, well if I get a couple of moves in a row, what would I like to accomplish? What does my opponent want to do? So I'm not just gonna sit here and get checkmated hopefully. Right? So what do you think I want to do in this position?\nExplainee: I think my king is on a bad scale right now, so maybe you are trying to like trade and then somehow get an attack on my king.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Usually when a position is closed, pieces are more squished together.\nExplainer: The easiest way by far to figure out if a position is closed is how many pawns do we each have? Right now, it's eight. So think of it like a fence, right? So if you and your neighbor have a full fence, you can't really see each other, but if there's only four pawns, that means somebody probably knocked down half of the fence, right? So if we start picking up all these pawns, then the position is more open. So this would be a closed position. This type of strategy would be called an attacking strategy 'cause you found a way to get your queen and rook down this line against my king. Before we even talk about what tactic is here, who does it look like is winning this game?\n","235":"Explainer: Oh, you're saying like if I take this pawn, maybe in the future I'll try to open up this diagonal.

Why do you think so?\nExplainee: Well, the black king is very exposed into the white side of the board, and like the white king is a bit more safe.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Maybe. Is it bishop takes upon on E4?\nExplainer: So that's like immediately you get a reward, but I'll give you a hint. The best way to start looking for a tactic, always look for a check first. Do you have a way to attack my king?\n","237":"Explainer: Yes, you're 100% right 'cause in chess, the two most important things we have to think about are who has more material, but then, like you said, who has the weaker king? And I would say my king has gone way too far, right? So there's a tactic here for what?\nExplainee: Maybe. Is it bishop takes upon on E4?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Yes. Rook, H1.\nExplainer: So exactly. You would give me that check. Now where can my king go? Let's just try to think.\n","238":"Explainer: Yes. Well done. And then I would take the pawn.\nExplainee: And then I would take the rook.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","239":"Explainer: What is it exactly that you're trying to tease out of these materials to improve the battery's performance?\nExplainee: At first, one of the main things that we did was use nanomaterials to add conductivity. And so carbon anodes and graphene are really good at adding conductivity to batteries. And then in the subsequent years, nanomaterials have been really interesting from things like incorporating sensors into batteries, to increasing the functionality of batteries, having some responsive materials that use things like graphene sheets that are incorporated into a matrix, and then you add a safety functionality to a battery. We're trying to squeeze out almost all the functionality that we can. And as new nano materials are being discovered and there're new properties being discovered, a lot of the time that someone tries to think of a way to translate that into a battery.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: I think every step of a process in a battery is something where you have to think about how would this translate to making a battery in terms of the production? One thing that I think is very interesting about the field of nanoscale materials in general, is that how you make the material changes the properties a lot. And so we claim that this 2D material has this property, then tying that to the battery performance is something that's pretty difficult to do. It takes a few steps in between. So we have to think kind of creatively with how we can do that.\nExplainer: That's actually, I think a very common problem. We can build a device in the lab it could be a transistor, can be a battery. And then you ask the question, okay, so what's the next step? How do we take it from that lab demonstration into a technology? The kind of work that I'm very interested in is developing tools to make the exact type of materials that you want. The tools that we've used in the past for conventional fabrication just don't work with these materials because they're all grown from the bottom up. They're intrinsically small, and you have to find ways to either use chemistry or some other means to get them to assemble into the structures that you want to actually either grow specifically what you want or after you grow them, to pull out the ones that you want. You need to be able to build that same thing over and over again, with the exact same properties. No one institution, no one research lab, no one national lab is gonna solve all of these problems on their own because they are difficult problems. And there is a real important payoff at the end. And it's gonna take all of us, making our contributions to push this field forward.\n","240":"Explainer: Because the materials are so small, they're at the nanoscale, their properties are dominated by quantum mechanics, which means that even slight changes in their size, in their orientation give profound changes in their properties. And while that's very scientifically interesting, and it allows you to tune their properties by making subtle changes, from a technology point of view, it's a bit of a headache in the sense that in technology want to optimize for a property and then repeat that over and over again. So what are some of the challenges that you face in the lab related to working with these materials and then trying to incorporate them into the batteries?\nExplainee: I think every step of a process in a battery is something where you have to think about how would this translate to making a battery in terms of the production? One thing that I think is very interesting about the field of nanoscale materials in general, is that how you make the material changes the properties a lot. And so we claim that this 2D material has this property, then tying that to the battery performance is something that's pretty difficult to do. It takes a few steps in between. So we have to think kind of creatively with how we can do that.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","241":"Explainer: So do you have a basic sense of what latency is?\nExplainee: Yeah, so my understanding of what latency is, is its basically the time delay between the rendering at different points.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: The latency is, in my opinion, the most important part of VR, because if you have that offset your body is no longer immersed and you getting that motion sickness which can pull a lot of people out of the experience.\nExplainer: Games that feel really good, they've got that sense of it happens instantly when you're doing something.\n","242":"Explainer: Games that feel really good, they've got that sense of it happens instantly when you're doing something.\nExplainee: It really is a testament to this kind of technology and how its developing and how over time its gonna just be, you're gonna be able to pack more pixel density in those displays and its gonna get a lot more immersive.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Just the hardware. Old games were ran off of 8 bit and that's all the data you could have.\nExplainer: Yeah, any crazy idea you had now you could probably make a pretty good video game out of it.

It's actually a way that we can trade. Do you know what trade is?\nExplainee: Mmm-hmm, it's when you take turns doing something. It's when you give up most of what you want, right?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Really?\nExplainer: Yeah.\n","245":"Explainer: Yeah.\nExplainee: If I could trade with any kid, I would trade, well, I would trade something I don't like so much.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Really?\nExplainer: Really.\n","246":"Explainer: Have you ever heard of machine learning before?\nExplainee: I'm going to assume that it means humans being able to teach machines or robots how to learn themselves?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Yeah, Melanie Martinez.\nExplainer: So I'm gonna look up Melanie Martinez. And it says here, If you like Melanie Martinez, one of the other songs you might like is by Au\/Ra. Do you know who that is?\n","247":"Explainer: That's right. When we teach machines to learn from data, to build a model from that data or a representation of that, and then to make a prediction. One of the places we often find machine learning in the real world is in things like recommendation systems. So do you have an artist that you really like?\nExplainee: Yeah, Melanie Martinez.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: I do not.\nExplainer: So let's listen to a hint of this song.\n","248":"Explainer: All right. So why do you think Spotify might've recommended that song?\nExplainee: Well, I know that in Melanie Martinez's music, she used a lot of the filtered voice to make it sound very deep and low and that song had that.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Pitch of the music. If it's really low or if it's super high, it could know that. What can the machine understand?\nExplainer: It's a great question. The machine can understand whatever we tell it to understand. So there might be a person thinking about things, like the pitch or the pacing or the tone, or sometimes machines can figure out things about music or images or videos that we don't tell it to discover, but that it can learn from looking at a lot of different examples.

Well really it's sort of the same thing as a light bulb. Right?\nExplainee: So it's a beam?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Because it needs to be centered so it can more easily just go in.\nExplainer: That's right. All the force that we apply here, goes all the way through but then it can only basically come out when it contacts the wood in that one tiny spot. And so sometimes it's the force that you push something with but sometimes it is that force per unit area. But sometimes it's not even the force per unit area 'cos, you know, push down as hard as you can on that and see if we can get it pushed in. See it doesn't really work does it?\n","251":"Explainer: So yeah it's a light bulb and there's a couple of mirrors. Now the light bulb has to be a little bit special. It has to be a type of material that can store the energy in an excited state right? It has to stay up there really energetic and sit there for a while so that when the light comes along, it takes that energy and becomes stronger light and then the mirror sends it back and it does it again and again and again and between these two mirrors, it makes the light come out in a nice beam. In a laser, it comes out as a single color. They all come out with their waves at the same time. Every wave peaks at the same time which then makes it a giant wave and it's this giant wave that has a tremendous amount of power. So it can do something like cutting steel. But when you cut steel, or if you were cutting this floor, it's gray, it actually will absorb the light. That's why the light, you don't see it because the light isn't bouncing back or through it. So I like to use demos to explain how my laser works. So I've brought basically a hammer and a nail. I'm sure you've probably hammered a nail before into a piece of wood but the question is, if you asked yourself why it is we hit the big end and it's the tiny end that we put on the piece of wood. We could never pick up a hammer and hit the sharp end and hope this would go in to the piece of wood.\nExplainee: Because it needs to be centered so it can more easily just go in.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: So the laser needs ultimately many things. It needs to be centered, it needs time to actually penetrate and then it needs--\nExplainer: Well it depends. So if you're cutting steel, you need to have the nail. You need to have it concentrated all of the light, not going in all directions but you need it into as small a point as possible. And for that we use a lens. For a lens, the light's coming down as a column, you put in a lens, it all focuses it down in the same way as the nail and then it starts cutting that steel. Okay so that force per unit area--\n","252":"Explainer: That's right.

Like it magnifies the light down to a point?\nExplainer: Exactly. You know sometimes you want to have all of your energy not just in a small area but in the small volume and so one of the other dimensions is time or length. But with light, time and length are the same thing because light always travels at the speed of light.\n","253":"Explainer: Well it depends. So if you're cutting steel, you need to have the nail.

It's 300,000 kilometers long. So now, if you talk about light being concentrated, that doesn't seem very concentrated. The type of lasers I play with in my lab will be no thicker than this piece of paper. So we take that energy that might be in three hundred thousand kilometers and we squeeze it all the way down into just this piece of paper and actually the beams are more the size of this piece of paper and so, in my lab, pieces of paper like this would be flying through the sky but we can't see them. 'Cos they don't come in our eyes, they fly by us and they're infra red.\n","254":"Explainer: Exactly.

And so now, if we have light like that that we wanna machine with. I bring this funnel and so, if we had a lens here and the light was coming down--\n","255":"Explainer: But if you send a one second long light pulse out into the skies there, the beginning of the pulse is actually two thirds of the way to the moon.

So here would be my light coming from my laser and it would just be coming down, down, down, down, down. Hit a lens and it would have to focus down. But now, all the light started out with this big of a spread so concentrated this much. Eventually it would be here, more concentrated. But by the end, right at the focal spot, that's when I get all of my light, all of the energy has been squeezed down into fitting inside this piece of paper and that's why I say that I built a laser hammer. Because when this hits a piece of glass, it just smacks hose electrons right off the atoms and there's nothing else for them to do, they have to fly away. So can you tell me what you learned and maybe about the focusing of the light?\n","256":"Explainer: Exactly. And so now, if we have light like that that we wanna machine with.

They're more like a super concentrated beam of light that can be any color. They get really concentrated and that's what makes them lasers and that's why they cut things and break things because they just move the electrons out of the way.\nExplainer: So do you think that lasers are fun enough to talk with your friends about or?\n","257":"Explainer: [Robert] Would you like to give it a try?\nExplainee: Sure.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: That's awesome.\nExplainer: So you ready?\n","258":"Explainer: So you ready?\nExplainee: Yep.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Wow.\nExplainer: Let's fold it in half from corner to corner, unfold it and then we'll fold it in half the other direction, also corner to corner but we're going to lift it up and we're going to hold the fold with both hands. We're going to bring these corners together, making a little pocket and then, this is the trickiest part of this whole design, so you're going to put your finger underneath the top layer and we're going to try to make that layer fold right along the edge.

We'll fold it in half like a book. On the folded side we'll take one of the folded corners and I'm going to fold it up through all layers. There's a pocket in the middle.

This is one of the most satisfying moments, I think-\n","262":"Explainer: Now, this is a traditional Japanese design but there are origami designs that have been around so long we're not entirely sure where they originated.

What do you think of origami?\n","265":"Explainer: So, I've come here complete with a actual chalkboard with some magnetic numbers on it here. How would you tell a friend to sort these?\nExplainee: I think one of the first things we learned was something called bubble sort. It was kind of like focusing on smaller bubbles I guess I would say of the problem, like looking at smaller segments rather than the whole thing at once.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Just switch those two numbers 'cause one is obviously smaller than eight.\nExplainer: Perfect. So, we just swap those two then.\n","266":"Explainer: Six five?\nExplainee: And then switch it.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Yeah.\nExplainer: And certainly the search engines of the world, Google and Bing and so forth, they probably don't keep webpages in sorted order 'cause that would be a crazy long list when you're just trying to search the data. But there's probably some algorithm underlying what they do and they probably similarly, just like we, do a bit of work upfront to get things organized even if it's not strictly sorted in the same way so that people like you and me and others can find that same information. So, how about social media? Can you envision where the algorithms are in that world?\n","267":"Explainer: All right, we'll switch this. And now to your point, we don't need to bother with the ones that already bubbled their way up. Now we are a hundred percent sure it's sorted.\nExplainee: Yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Maybe for example like TikTok, like the For You page, 'cause those are like recommendations, right? It's sort of like Netflix recommendations except more constant because it's just every video you scroll, it's like that's a new recommendation basically. And it's based on what you've liked previously, what you've saved previously, what you search up. So, I would assume there's some kind of algorithm there kind of figuring out like what to put on your For You page.\nExplainer: Absolutely. Just trying to keep you presumably more engaged. So, the better the algorithm is, the better your engagement is, maybe the more money the company then makes on the platform and so forth. So, it all sort of feeds together. But what you're describing really is more artificially intelligent, if I may, because presumably there's not someone at TikTok or any of these social media companies saying, If Patricia likes this post, then show her this post. If she likes this post, then show her this other post. Because the code would sort of grow infinitely long and there's just way too much content for a programmer to be having those kinds of conditionals, those decisions being made behind the scenes. So, it's probably a little more artificially intelligent. And in that sense you have topics like neural networks, and machine learning which really describe taking as input things like what you watch, what you click on, what your friends watch, what they click on, and sort of trying to infer from that instead, what should we show Patricia or her friends next?\n","268":"Explainer: So you're saying gravity pulls things down, yet we've launched things into space. Do you ever wonder how we do that?\nExplainee: Isn't it like a slingshot, like if you pull something back enough it'll go in the opposite direction?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: And does the gravity pull it or is it just floating?\nExplainer: In a weird way, that is gravity pulling it. So have you ever had a yo-yo where you swing it around like this? The string is pulling it in at all times, but you've also given it this angular momentum. And as long as you give it the angular momentum, pulling it in actually keeps it in orbit. And so the Earth is pulling it in at all times, so that's why it doesn't just travel off in a straight line. It keeps coming back around. So it's funny, people think that the International Space Station is so far away that they're not feeling gravity, and that's not the case at all. They're absolutely feeling gravity. They're just cruising so fast that, even though they're being pulled in, they never get pulled to the surface.\n","269":"Explainer: Well, that's true, we do use slingshot technology once things are out in the solar system. So, for instance, we use Jupiter and other planets so that when some of the spacecraft gets close, it'll slingshot around and it'll cause it to speed up. But mostly, around the Earth, gravity pulls things down, so when we want to send a rocket into space, when we wanna go to the Moon, when we wanna send supplies to the International Space Station, the trick is to get something moving fast enough that it escapes the gravitational pull of the Earth. Have you heard the expression what goes up must come down? It's actually not true. If you throw it fast enough, you can actually get something that doesn't come back down again, and that's basically how rocket launches work. You have to get the rocket for the Earth to go more than 11 kilometers a second. Think of how fast it is. Just one breath and it's gone 11 kilometers. If you get it to go that fast, it's not gonna come back down again. So you know the International Space Station which is orbiting the Earth? That's going around the Earth at 17,000 miles an hour. It has no engines anymore, the engines are turned off. So it's just there falling forever. So once it's out there, it's not coming back down as long as it's cruising like that.\nExplainee: And does the gravity pull it or is it just floating?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: It's like that ride at the rollercoasters where you go in and it's spins super fast and you can't feel it spinning fast but--\nExplainer: Yeah, you feel pinned to that. It's exactly like that. There's something called the equivalence principle where people realized, especially Einstein, that if you were in outer space in a rocket ship and it was dark and painted and it was accelerating at exactly the right rate, you actually wouldn't know if you were sitting on the floor of a building around the Earth or if you were on a rocket ship that was accelerating.\n","270":"Explainer: In a weird way, that is gravity pulling it.

You ever had that experience where you're sitting in a train and the other one moves and for a second you're not sure if you're the one moving?\n","271":"Explainer: Yeah. You ever had that experience where you're sitting in a train and the other one moves and for a second you're not sure if you're the one moving?\nExplainee: Yeah, 'cause I go on the train every day to go to school, but I never feel like I'm moving when I'm in the train, and then I'm like, wait, what?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Isn't that kinda crazy? Amazing.\nExplainer: So imagine you were an astronaut and you were floating in empty space. You can't see anything. There's no stars, there's no Earth. You can ask yourself, am I moving? There's really no way for you to tell. So you would probably conclude, well, I'm not moving. So then your friend Marina comes cruising past you, and maybe she's going thousands of kilometers a second, and you say, Marina, you're cruising at thousands of kilometers a second, you're going so fast. But she had just done the same experiment. She was just floating in space thinking, Am I moving? There's no way to know which one of you is moving and there's no meaning to the absolute motion. The only thing that's true is that you're in relative motion, that's true. You both agree you're in relative motion, and that's clear. But neither of you can say it's actually you who's moving and I'm stationary.\n","272":"Explainer: That's because in some sense, you're really not. Imagine you're in this train and it's going near the speed of light relative to the platform, but it's so smooth, then you should be in a situation in which there's no meaning to your absolute motion, there's no absolute motion. So that if you throw a ball up, you might think from the outside of the platform, be confused that when gravity pulls that back down, it's gonna hit you or something, but it'll land in your palm as surely as if you were in your living room.\nExplainee: Isn't that kinda crazy? Amazing.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: [laughs] I don't even know what to say to that.\nExplainer: So let me tell you where it gets really crazy.\n","273":"Explainer: So let me tell you where it gets really crazy.\nExplainee: [Maria laughs]\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Yeah.\nExplainer: So you would say, oh Marina is gonna measure a different speed of light. But she comes back and she says, No. 300,000 kilometers per second. Because from her perspective, she's standing still, and the laws of physics have better be the same for her. The speed of light is a fact of nature that's as true as the strength of gravity. And the two of you are in this quandary because if one of you is the preferred person who correctly measures the speed of light, that ruins everything about the idea of the relativity of motion. Which one of you should it be? So Einstein decides they must both measure the same speed of life. How could that possibly, possibly be the case? And he thinks, well, if speed is how far you travel, your spatial distance, in a certain amount of time, then there must be something wrong with space and time. And he goes from the constancy of the speed of light and a respect for this idea of relativity to the idea that space and time must not be the same for you and for Marina. And that's how he gets the idea of the relativity of space and time. [laughs] You have the best expression on your face. [laughs] It's pretty wild, but that is a starting point, actually, of the whole theory of relativity. That starting point leads to this complete revolution in physics where we suddenly have a Big Bang and black holes and space-time. Just from that one simple starting point. So, is your impression of gravity different than when we started the conversation?\n","274":"Explainer: So, let's say you and Marina are floating in space and you can't tell who's moving. Let's say you both see a flash of light. A flash of light comes from somewhere, you don't know where. So you measure the speed of light to be 300,000 kilometers per second. But here comes Marina and she's racing at the light pulse, as far as you can tell. Two cars driving towards each other seem like they're going faster towards each other than somebody who's standing still relative to one of the cars, right?\nExplainee: Yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Yeah, 'cause I knew that when I was on the train it didn't feel like I was moving, but I didn't know why or that it was a thing and I wasn't crazy.

If string theory turns out to be the thing that the universe cares about, we'd like to know, with all of these possibilities that are in string theory, how do we get the one that looks like the world we live in?\nExplainer: The thing I want to talk about is this paper I wrote with Matt Johnson and Lisa Randall where we realize there's another way to compactify extra dimensions spontaneously, dynamically.

And down there in the tube it looks like your long thing that is compactified in one direction and infinitely extending in the other direction, so there's one less macroscopic dimension of space.\n","277":"Explainer: The thing I want to talk about is this paper I wrote with Matt Johnson and Lisa Randall where we realize there's another way to compactify extra dimensions spontaneously, dynamically. If you imagine starting with this big piece of paper you couldn't wrap up everything, but within some region of space you could make a tube.\nExplainee: Okay.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Hmm. Okay, that's nice.\nExplainer: [Sean] You think that sounds plausible to you?\n","278":"Explainer: [Sean] You think that sounds plausible to you?\nExplainee: It sounds like fun. What I would immediately ask is where do the large dimensions come from in the first place? Is that something you address, or you just assume that all the dimension are large as a starting point?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: But where do they come from?\nExplainer: It was always there.\n","279":"Explainer: Why don't you explain to us what a black brane is?\nExplainee: Well in some ways, it's very much like a black hole in that you have far away from it you have these large just flat dimensions. As you move in, there's something in the interior. It has, itself, higher dimensions, and so because physicists love to joke they thought, well it's like a membrane but it can have many different dimensions. Let's use P to stand in for those number of dimensions, and so they called them P-branes.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Yeah. Yeah. So, a lot of the branes that are relevant for studying things to do with anti-de Sitter spacetimes in various dimensions actually start out as these non-singular type brains, and then you find in the core, there's actually an anti-de Sitter spacetime.\nExplainer: Right. Imagine that rather than going down to a point, it just asymptotes to some fixed radius that continues infinitely far down there. But then you can ask, okay what about the rest of the universe? You have some sphere, some two dimensions compactified, and the balance between the cosmological constant and the electromagnetic field keeps it at a fixed distance.\n","280":"Explainer: Yeah, I've been trying to explain this to lower levels, and they always look at me like, are you pulling my leg here a little bit? Or is this the real thing that they use? Yes, it is the real thing they use. We study these branes in de Sitter space, and so what we found is that there are black brane solutions which instead of having a singularity inside are non-singular, and stable, and compactified. Is this a familiar thing? I know things like this have been discussed, right?\nExplainee: Yeah. Yeah. So, a lot of the branes that are relevant for studying things to do with anti-de Sitter spacetimes in various dimensions actually start out as these non-singular type brains, and then you find in the core, there's actually an anti-de Sitter spacetime.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Right. Good, good.\nExplainer: But then the other dimensions, the transverse dimensions, don't need to be anti-de Sitter. They can have either positive, zero, or negative cosmological constant. So you can basically get any sort of cosmological solution times a compactified sphere.\n","281":"Explainer: Right.

Good, good.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Is it that these have the lowest action of all the things that could possibly, all the possible solutions?\nExplainer: I guess. I mean, maybe you'd think otherwise. Again or maybe you could change my mind, I think that as long as it can happen it will happen some of the time, right?\n","282":"Explainer: But then the other dimensions, the transverse dimensions, don't need to be anti-de Sitter.

[laughing] It's a loud, it's of a loud it's gonna happen.\nExplainee: I still laugh from Keanu Reeves I'm afraid. [laughing]\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Well, it's interesting because there's a lot of activity going on inspired by things we learned from working in anti-de Sitter space where the cosmological constant has the wrong sign. So you will find that there are a number of papers as many of which you've probably read, probably you've read more of them than I have, which try then to take the different kinds of brains, these extended solutions, and they're many different kinds doing different things, we understand well enough now that we can put them together in various ways. They intersect, they dissolve inside each other, they wrap each other.\nExplainer: They overlap, they wrap around.\n","284":"Explainer: I know not everyone buys that, right?\nExplainee: Not everyone buys it. There's a big discussion in the literature right now.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: I think it's gonna get way more interesting than we're currently able to grapple with right now, and I think there are hints of it. There could be a description of the physics that might be our early universe that is like that molecular description. And then from that emerges flat spacetimes maybe four, maybe some mechanism tells you it's four and not something else. I think that's where we're going.\nExplainer: If the viewers wanted to know more about how spacetime can emerge from quantum mechanics, they could read the graphic novel you just wrote.\n","285":"Explainer: If the viewers wanted to know more about how spacetime can emerge from quantum mechanics, they could read the graphic novel you just wrote.\nExplainee: Right, yes. I wrote and drew a graphic novel called The Dialogues: Conversations About the Nature of Universe.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Excellent.\n","286":"Explainer: So far, what do you know about black holes?\nExplainee: I never knew beforehand how hard it was to get actual data of the black holes itself, first of all, they're dark, and, like, they're so far away, it's almost impossible just to get a good image of them. They were discussing a project in which multiple radio telescopes of some sort, like, are, like, pinpointed all across, from Greenland to South America, and, like, and they're trying to get an image of the black hole in the center of our galaxy because, as opposed to just recording its impact on the surrounding stars and planets.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: What sort of technology and, like, I guess tools have you been using in your studies, or, like, just in general, in the study of black holes?\nExplainer: For my studies, I actually, when I started at UCLA in graduate school, I worked with a professor named Matt Malkin who was, gotten a lot of data observations from the Hubble Space Telescope, so that was one of my very first projects to work on, so any, space-based observatories have been a really big advantage, and then I've moved on now to the Spitzer Space Telescope. In addition to that, then there's other people who've used a lot of X-ray telescopes, NuSTAR, Chandra have used data from that. It's been a combination of both ground-based observatories, as well as space-based ones, and going everywhere from X-ray observations, not done by me, but certainly ultraviolet, and then optical, and infrared, particularly, those are the ones that I've been most involved with.\n","287":"Explainer: Yeah.\nExplainee: No, I don't think so.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Is this like a map where, that's like an actual visual representation, like using microscopy?\nExplainer: Yes.\n","288":"Explainer: Yeah.\nExplainee: I'm understanding more so that it's these, a mapping of the circuitry, the pathways between neurons that can lead to evidence of patterns in your brain that are common between different people.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Well, the computer only communicates with itself in binary so it only has two options, it can only ask itself yes or no questions, but a human brain has an infinity of directions that it can go.\nExplainer: Neurons are also digital. Meaning a Neuron either fires or it doesn't fire, so that's either one or zero. And it's the combination of those ones or zeros that actually produce the 10 thousand different answers that you say.\n","289":"Explainer: How long have you been playing chess?\nExplainee: I played a little bit of chess growing up against my brothers, but ever since the Queen's Gambit show came out, that's I think when I downloaded the app and started playing against friends for fun.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Yeah, I would say I really struggle in the mid game. I feel like I've developed most of my pieces, try to control the center, but at a certain point, I'm a little bit stuck on like, okay, now what? What do I do?\nExplainer: So I'm going to look up your account. We're gonna pick a game and we're gonna analyze it.\n","290":"Explainer: So I'm going to look up your account. We're gonna pick a game and we're gonna analyze it.\nExplainee: Sounds good.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: To me right now, it feels pretty even. Like there's no major vulnerabilities from both sides, but I guess the white pieces, the pieces are a little bit more developed, I would say.\nExplainer: Everything you just said is 100% accurate. So that's one of those baseline pieces of information that we need for the middle game. I have the two bishops. How can I activate one of my bishops? You have a little plan you could actually implement right now that would make one of your bishops extremely strong. You think you can find it?\n","291":"Explainer: In all middle games where we have this mix of tactics, which are immediate gain or immediate loss, depending on if we're getting hit with a tactic or playing one, and strategic chess. I just want you to tell me, who do you think has a better position here and by how much?\nExplainee: To me right now, it feels pretty even. Like there's no major vulnerabilities from both sides, but I guess the white pieces, the pieces are a little bit more developed, I would say.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: If I had to guess, I think it'd probably moving this bishop here.\nExplainer: Yes, you definitely want to get the the bishop out, but you don't wanna move it just yet. So how do you do that?\n","292":"Explainer: Yes, you definitely want to get the the bishop out, but you don't wanna move it just yet. So how do you do that?\nExplainee: I am not sure.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Maybe one question I have is like, as I'm also looking at this position, just trying to understand like, okay, what is my opponent trying to do here?\nExplainer: One thing to always monitor in every chess middle game is does my opponent have a pawn break? Can my opponent strike somewhere with a pawn that would open up the board? If you have a low risk position, your position's just nice and comfortably better, you don't want chaos.\n","293":"Explainer: This is how we unlock the intermediate level, which is this move. That move looks like it's disconnecting from the whole board, right? It's a move totally on the edge, but nobody is gonna stop your bishop from going to that diagonal, and then you're threatening a tactic. You're threatening a skewer. You would hit my queen and my rook. Stronger piece in front, weaker peace in back, and then you would be guaranteed to win some material. Just like little pattern recognition in the middle game. So for the future, you're gonna have a game where your opponent makes the same trade early, right? They trade their dark-squared bishop, and you can activate it like that, but in this game, you focused on the center, which was totally fine also.\nExplainee: Maybe one question I have is like, as I'm also looking at this position, just trying to understand like, okay, what is my opponent trying to do here?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: guess maybe they would try to advance their middle pawn.\nExplainer: Yes. Yes.

I can bring both my rooks, and now I have no problems, right? Now I have both knights, queen, rooks.

As you're trying to improve your middle game, one question you always have to ask yourself is, Is that trade good for me? Is it good for my opponent? It's not checkers. You don't have to take me, and I don't have to take you. So we can do something called keeping the tension. We're just having a staring contest here among the pawns.

Just slide the rook over and threaten to push the pawn here, which would be a tactic and a fork.\n","296":"Explainer: Yes. Another thing for middle game.

Because you push it now, these two would win that trade. So yeah, rookie 8 is a very good move. You used kind of like a heuristic, right? Well, black has two knights. So black prefers the position closed because decide what the bishops wants to be able to see the whole board. Yes, exactly, but your opponent disagreed with you and took this pawn because that's just what intermediate players do. They see they can take something. Pawn for pawn. What the heck?

Really, an advanced chess player was not born an advanced chess player. They have probably hundreds, if not thousands of more games in their mind, in their past, in their history that they've analyzed, that they've studied. It's like any athlete, you know?

But as we started to make more and more measurements and build higher and higher basically performing devices, we started to see nothing is matching the expected performance. And that's because people thought that Coulomb collisions between the particles, just interactions of charged particles, would dominate cross-field transport, right?

The best way to think about this transition is really called, it's a flip flop switch, okay? So this term comes from engineering, and the idea is that in sleep, you basically have kind of this all of nothing experience. Certainly people kind of drift off to sleep, but then all of a sudden you're unconscious, right? So it seems like it's this flip flop between the arousal system and the sleep promoting system, and it's certainly regulated, and we'll get a little bit into that, but they're certainly kind of made up of two reciprocally inhibitory processes. Okay, so we have the ascending reticular activating system. It originates in the brain stem, and there's a dorsal and a ventral arm to this, and so the dorsal arm has neurons, cholinergic neurons, that go up to the thalamus and then it projections into the fore brain, and then there's the ventral arm, and this is comprised of a whole bunch of different types of neurons, so there are monominergic, so there's kind of dopaminergic neurons that come from the periaqueductal gray, serotonergic ones from the dorsal raphae nuclei, histaminergic neurons that come from the tuberomammillary nucleus of the hippothalamus, and then noradrenergic neurons from the locus coeruleus, and so all of those are kind of working in tandem to kind of drive wake within the brain. So if we just think about drugs that are available inducing wakefulness, we can certainly, kind of the dopaminergic ones jump out, right? So we have amphetamines that kind of drive those signaling, and then modafinil, which is a wake promoting drug for people that have kind of excessive day-time sleepiness that maintains alertness throughout the day.\n","317":"Explainer: So that's good, because that's why you're here, and so we're talking about sleep today, and really about kind of what is the brain machinery through which we go through consciousness to unconsciousness and that transition.\nExplainee: Great.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: In terms of the dopamine, if you're taking amphetamines, that's usually to promote, as you said, wakefulness, but does that actually improve the quality of your sleep? How reliable are those kinds of interventions?\nExplainer: For the role that they play with respect to the sleep-wake system is really kind of amping up the wake system, right? And so certainly that has like down stream consequences for the sleep system, because now the flip flop switch is kind of pushed in a much stronger direction, and we have to kind of rely on what regulates sleep to get it pushed back to sleep.\n","318":"Explainer: You haven't got to play with lasers.

Do you ever use a laser as a cat toy?\nExplainee: No.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Flashlight is a bigger shine and the laser is just a dot.\nExplainer: That's true, that laser's just a dot. And so the other thing to notice though is that, like if I shine it in your eyes and I'm sorry if I do! But it seems awfully bright doesn't it? And yet when, you know, you shine this down and you put the laser, which one do you see easier?\n","319":"Explainer: Well one of the fun things people do with lasers, the cat will try to grab that dot. I'm sure what you have at home is a flashlight. I brought a cute little one. So the question is, do you see any difference between what a flashlight does and what a laser does?\nExplainee: Flashlight is a bigger shine and the laser is just a dot.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: [Harmoni] The laser.\nExplainer: The laser. So which one do you think's more powerful?\n","320":"Explainer: [Donna] And yet it's not. Isn't that amazing?\nExplainee: Yes.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Yes.\nExplainer: And that's because the light will go through this glass and, when it hits that corner, it has to bend. And we actually send laser beams down glass fibers, the size of your hair.\n","321":"Explainer: One of the things that lasers are great for is that because it's a directed beam, we can actually put that light where we want the light to go and sometimes you maybe just want to see something around the corner and you can't see it. But with a laser, you can actually and this is a smoky one so you can actually watch it go. You see it actually bending the corner?\nExplainee: Yes.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Yeah.\nExplainer: So this obviously is much bigger than our hair. Right?\n","322":"Explainer: So this obviously is much bigger than our hair. Right?\nExplainee: Yes.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: I don't have a cat or--\nExplainer: You don't have a cat. So you don't need a cat toy no. Have you ever gone to a grocery store and just scanned your objects over?\n","323":"Explainer: Have you ever seen that maybe there's a little bit of a red light when you do that?\nExplainee: Yes.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Well I saw a shooting star before.\nExplainer: Oh you got to see a shooting star? Well that's cool, that's nature giving you the show there. So what do you think about lasers? You think they're fun?\n","324":"Explainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Wow.\nExplainer: The thing that makes them cool is they're sort of like tilings, it looks like you could put this together by cutting little pieces of paper and sliding them together, but they're still one sheet.\n","325":"Explainer: A lot of origami is animals, birds and things. There's also a branch of origami that is, it's more abstract or geometric, called tessellations. Tessellations, like most origami, are folded from a single sheet of paper but they make patterns, whether it's woven patterns like that, or woven patterns like this. If you hold them up to the light you can see patterns.\nExplainee: Wow.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: They weren't cut?\nExplainer: There's no cuts in these just folding. We can build these up from smaller building blocks of folds, learn how to fold little pieces and put them together in the same way that a tiling like this looks like it's built up of little pieces. Can you make a fold that starts at the dot that doesn't run all the way across the paper?\n","326":"Explainer: The thing that makes them cool is they're sort of like tilings, it looks like you could put this together by cutting little pieces of paper and sliding them together, but they're still one sheet.\nExplainee: They weren't cut?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: How about like that?\nExplainer: Mm-hmm. Each of these folds is peaked like a mountain and we call these mountain folds but if I made it the other way, then it's shaped this way and we call it a valley fold. In all of origami there's just mountains and valleys.\n","327":"Explainer: There's no cuts in these just folding.

And if I had another one up here, I could make all three. And if I had a square array and all the folds lined up I could make bigger and bigger arrays, like these, because these are just very large twists. In this case it's an octagon rather than a square, but they're arranged in rows and columns. And let's just try going along. All right, there is our tessellation with squares and hexagons. So you have now designed and folded your first origami tessellation and perhaps you can see how just using this idea of building up tiles and small building blocks you could make tessellations as big and complex as you want.\n","330":"Explainer: That's a rule of all flat origami no matter how many folds come together at a point and I'm going to show you a building block of tessellations, it's called a twist because that center square, as I unfold it, it twists, it rotates.\nExplainee: Twists?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: That was cool.\nExplainer: Yeah, so what do you think now of origami and tessellations?\n","331":"Explainer: Do you know what machine learning means? Have you heard that before?\nExplainee: No.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Sure.\nExplainer: [Hilary] So is this a dog or a cat?\n","332":"Explainer: And what makes a dog, a dog and a cat, a cat?\nExplainee: Well, dogs are very playful, I think, more than cats. Cats lick themselves more than dogs, I think.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Yeah. Yeah.\nExplainer: What about this one?\n","333":"Explainer: What about this one?\nExplainee: A dog. A cat. I think, a cat? Because it's more skinny. And also, its legs are like really tall and its ears are a little pointy.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: [Brynn] None.\nExplainer: [Hilary] None. What is it?\n","334":"Explainer: And how did you know that it's not a cat or a dog?\nExplainee: Because cats and dogs... Because they walk on their paws and their ears are like right here, not right here, and they don't wear watches.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Yeah, I have. After every unit, we have a review and then we have a test.\nExplainer: Are those like the practice problems you do before the test?\n","335":"Explainer: Which means that in the test, you're not seeing any problems that you don't know how to solve. As long as you did all your practice, right?\nExplainee: Yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: No.\nExplainer: So one of the differences between people and machines is that people might be a little better at this, but can't look at 10 million different things. So now that we've been talking about machine learning, is this something you want to learn how to do?\n","336":"Explainer: So machines work the same way. If you show them a lot of examples and give them practice, they'll learn how to guess. And then when you give them the test, they should be able to do that. So we looked at eight pictures and you were able to answer really quickly. But what would you do if I gave you 10 million examples? Would you be able to do that so quickly?\nExplainee: No.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Kind of. Because I kind of want to become a spy. And we used to do coding, so I may be kind of good at it.\nExplainer: And machine learning is a great way to use all those math skills, all those coding skills, and would be a super cool tool for a spy.\n","337":"Explainer: That's amazing. What made you decide to trade on eBay?\nExplainee: Well, I mean, I've heard of it, and I trust it a lot because they have all of their guarantees, so I know that I'm gonna get money and the person's gonna get what they want.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: That's cool.\nExplainer: And there's a lot of those kinds of middlemen in our society today, right? We have a lot of banks.\n","338":"Explainer: And there's a lot of those kinds of middlemen in our society today, right? We have a lot of banks.\nExplainee: Yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: So how does it work?\nExplainer: It's basically a network of computers that all have the same history of transactions. And so instead of sort of there being one company with one database that holds all the information, the same sort of list is held by all these different people. Like, you could have it on your computer. And then it gets validated by everyone, and basically, that turns into the next part of the list. So it's sort of constantly updating itself.\n","339":"Explainer: We have a lot of companies that sort of help us make sure that our trades happen, but if we could guarantee the same trade using technology as sort of a technological trust, then we wouldn't really need all those middlemen in between.\nExplainee: So how does it work?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: So like, how do you make sure that it's secure?\nExplainer: So it use cryptography, and that helps it basically encode all of the transactions. So you can't really see exactly what happened, but you can know it happened because it's like a marker.\n","340":"Explainer: It's basically a network of computers that all have the same history of transactions.

So it's sort of constantly updating itself.\nExplainee: So like, how do you make sure that it's secure?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: So you could kind of like, I don't know, say trade apples, but you would just see like random letters for it?\nExplainer: Yeah, exactly.\n","341":"Explainer: [Bettina] Exactly.\nExplainee: That's cool.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: That's cool.\nExplainer: Yeah.\n","342":"Explainer: So do you know what virtual reality is?\nExplainee: Yes, its simple. Its like a video game except it feels like you're in the video game.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Or in Minecraft.\nExplainer: Yeah, or in Minecraft. When you look at a TV on the wall there showing like a picture of a mountain or something, how can you tell that its not just a window and there's something else behind it. Because it always doesn't look quite right if you have a static picture of a person on a screen and you move around like this, its not really changing. And its interesting, those are things we have to figure out We need to figure out when you look at something in reality how can you tell whether its real or not. Have you been to a 3-D movie where you put on the little glasses?\n","343":"Explainer: That's actually a really good description. The idea is that if you've got a system here that can make you see whatever we want you to see, then we can make you believe that you're anywhere else, like on top of a mountain, or in a dungeon or under the ocean.\nExplainee: Or in Minecraft.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Yeah.\nExplainer: So what they do, the trick for that is, if you ever at a theater and you take up the glasses and you look at it, you'll see its blurry where there's actually two pictures that they're showing at the same time. And what those little glasses do, is they let one eye see one picture, and the other eye see a different picture. So then your eyes can say, oh it looks like I'm seeing through the screen or something is floating out in front of it. In the VR headsets, what we do is, there's actually either two screens or one screen split in half, so that it draws a different picture, completely different picture, for each eye. And we make sure that each eye can only see the picture it intended to. And that's what can make things feel like they got this real depth to them, that its something that you could reach out and touch and it doesn't feel like a flat TV screen.\n","344":"Explainer: We're gonna talk about blockchain technology. Have you heard of blockchain?\nExplainee: I've heard of the words blockchain, but I'm not sure I know what it is.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Okay.\nExplainer: And so it's being run by all of these different computers that have like a node. So they're all running the same software and guaranteeing your transactions as they happen.\n","345":"Explainer: And so it's being run by all of these different computers that have like a node. So they're all running the same software and guaranteeing your transactions as they happen.\nExplainee: I mean, I would assume this technology is taking away business or activity from these middlemen.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Is there a mechanism for verifying that person A is a legitimate seller or producer of the item?\nExplainer: So today, a lot of people are working on how to create identity structures that leverage blockchains. And one of the tools for doing that is being able to cryptographically sign for a given attribute. So your government could sign that you have a US passport or a university could sign that you are a currently enrolled student. And you could then dole out that information and control it yourself and be able to show people those certifications on an as needed basis.\n","346":"Explainer: Here's a spider with eight legs, ants with legs and these, just like the crane, are folded from a single uncut square.\nExplainee: What?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Yes.\nExplainer: That's a corner, four corners of the square, four points. How would you make one point out of this sheet of paper?\n","347":"Explainer: That's a corner, four corners of the square, four points. How would you make one point out of this sheet of paper?\nExplainee: I'm thinking of, like, a paper airplane.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Okay.\nExplainer: The crane has four circles but, actually, there's a little bit of a surprise because what about this? There's a fifth circle, which is like that, but does the crane have a fifth flap in it? Let's refold it and put the wings up. Well, yes, there is, there's another point and that point is the fifth circle of our crane.\n","348":"Explainer: Yeah, exactly. Actually you've discovered something pretty neat because you made your point not from a corner so you've already discovered one of the key insights. Any flap, any point, leg of the ant, takes up a circular region of paper. Here's our boundary. To make your point from an edge you use that much paper and the shape, it's almost a circle. If we take the crane we'll see if the circles are visible in the crane pattern. Here's the crane pattern, and here's a boundary of the wing, and here's the other wing.\nExplainee: Okay.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Okay.\nExplainer: And to do that we use a new technique called circle packing in which all of the long features of the design are represented by circles. So, each leg becomes a circle, each wing becomes a circle and things that can be big and thick, like the head or the abdomen, can be points in the middle. Now we have the basic idea of how to design the pattern, we just count the number of legs we want. We want a spider, if it's got let's say eight legs, it's also got an abdomen, that's another point, and it's got a head, so maybe that's 10 points. If we find an arrangement of 10 circles we should be able to fold that into the spider. So in this book, Origami Insects II, it's one of my books and has some patterns, and this is one of them for a flying ladybug and, in fact, it is exactly this flying ladybug. We've got the crease pattern here in the circles and you might now be able to see which circles end up as which parts, knowing that the largest features like the wings are going to be the largest circles, smaller points will be smaller circles. So any thoughts which might be?\n","349":"Explainer: The crane has four circles but, actually, there's a little bit of a surprise because what about this? There's a fifth circle, which is like that, but does the crane have a fifth flap in it? Let's refold it and put the wings up. Well, yes, there is, there's another point and that point is the fifth circle of our crane.\nExplainee: Okay.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Well, the legs and the antenna would probably have to be these smaller ones, in the middle.\nExplainer: Yeah, that's right.\n","350":"Explainer: You've got it, so you are ready to design origami.\nExplainee: Awesome.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Wow, that's so impressive. I think I learned how to make one of these paper cranes when I was in third grade but I guess I never unfolded it to actually see where it was coming from. And so now that it's all broken up into circles it makes these super complicated insects and animals and everything seem so much simpler, so that's so cool. I'm pretty excited about it.\nExplainer: That's so cool.\n","351":"Explainer: Can I explain a couple of them to you?\nExplainee: Yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: I know of memory because you have to memorize stuff.\nExplainer: Yeah, exactly. And computers have even different types of memory. They have what's called RAM, random access memory, which is where your games, where your programs are stored while they're being used. But then it also has a hard drive, or a solid state drive, which is where your data, your high scores, your documents, once you start writing essays and stories in the future.\n","352":"Explainer: So, inside of every computer is some kind of brain and the technical term for that is CPU, or central processing unit. And those are the pieces of hardware that know how to respond to those instructions. Like moving up or down, or left or right, knows how to do math like addition and subtraction. And then there's at least one other type of hardware inside of a computer called memory or RAM, if you've heard of this?\nExplainee: I know of memory because you have to memorize stuff.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: It stays there.\nExplainer: Stays permanently. So, even if the power goes out, the computer can still remember that information.\n","353":"Explainer: Let me get some supplies from the cupboard here. So, should we make an algorithm together?\nExplainee: Yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: The right instructions.\nExplainer: The right instructions. Just do it for me. So, step one was what?\n","354":"Explainer: Okay, here we go. What would the next step be here?\nExplainee: Clean all this mess up.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: You want to do the right thing.\nExplainer: Exactly.\n","355":"Explainer: Exactly.\nExplainee: So, like if you type in just Google, then you won't find the answer to your question.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","356":"Explainer: Good to see you again, Yue.\nExplainee: Yes, good to see you.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: So I'm a epidemiologist, so we do a lot of work on the epidemiology of sleep and development of neurodegenerative diseases including both Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease, so ADMPD. We mainly work on population studies. We work on thousands and even millions of population, and we use statistical modeling to find out the association between different sleep disturbances and also genetics related to sleep disturbances and link that to their risk of developing ADMPD.\nExplainer: So how strong is the link?\n","357":"Explainer: So how strong is the link?\nExplainee: Our study has found really strong associations looking at these populations, for example, with sleep apnea. We've done one meta-analysis and it's showed that those with sleep apnea, they have a ratio of 1.26, which means that those who have sleep apnea have 26% elevated risk of developing Alzheimer's compared to those without sleep apnea.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Yeah, so I think what's really fascinating is all these bio-directional relationships that's being identified in animal studies especially, showing that sleep changes actually occur very early on in the disease process, so it could be a prodromal stage of Parkinson's, and also in transgenic model of AD, they're already showing a lot of circadian abnormalities in this mouse.\nExplainer: So within dementia risk in particular, Alzheimer's for instance, there are kind of two clear features that seem to be part of the pathology, right? So there's beta-amyloid which accumulates in the brain, and then there's kind of these tangles, this tauopathies, right? And so it sounds like sleep seems to be related to the tauopathies. What about kind of beta-amyloid?\n","358":"Explainer: So it's interesting, so I also saw that there was also a recent meta-analysis around sleep disturbances and dementia risk, and in that study, they looked about 250,000 people in this meta-analysis, and they followed them around for 10 years, and you know, when they pulled all the samples together, they found there was a 1.2 fold increased risk for developing all caused dementia, so it sounds like both sleep apnea and then maybe sleep disturbances more generally are associated with increased risk for dementia. When I think about that, I think about how sleep lives in the brain, these neurodegenerative diseases live in the brain, and so what do we know about the causality of this? Could it be that individuals who have early onset of say, Alzheimer's, have then poor sleep kind of as a consequence of that?\nExplainee: Yeah, so I think what's really fascinating is all these bio-directional relationships that's being identified in animal studies especially, showing that sleep changes actually occur very early on in the disease process, so it could be a prodromal stage of Parkinson's, and also in transgenic model of AD, they're already showing a lot of circadian abnormalities in this mouse.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Yes, in the transgenic mouse models of AD, including those expressing human mutant amyloid precursor protein, APP type or both, so that's kind of showing the sleep changes in both of these pathologies.\nExplainer: Okay, so there is this bio-directional piece, but I think perhaps the most exciting thing that happened in the sleep field, at least in my view, has been understanding the role of sleep and its clearance of beta-amyloid in the brain. This idea that sleep is kind of the dishwasher of the brain, it seems like, that you know A betta accumulates as we kind of use energy, and you know it's kind of a waste product, and the idea that if you don't clear it out, that it's going to build up and accumulate.\n","359":"Explainer: So within dementia risk in particular, Alzheimer's for instance, there are kind of two clear features that seem to be part of the pathology, right?

I think there are incredible innovations that are happening in the basic sciences, kind of really starting to understand what are the clear biological processes that underly some of these things as they relate to disease risk, and what is the true function of sleep, kind of the why we sleep phenomenon, right?\n","360":"Explainer: What's one of the most exciting parts of your research right now?\nExplainee: Something that we were not able to do until very recently was actually using first principle simulations to predict the performance and efficiency of reactors. The developments in plasma theory and computation and simulation, that has been thoroughly validated over the years, in many experiments, and now we're using those simulations to inform how to best operate our future reactors. It's very exciting because so far we've been getting great results. It's very, very promising.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: So the edge of the plasma gives you the boundary condition really for the simulations that then we do in the core. You need to start somewhere determining what is the temperature very close to the wall, really, of the machine. And when when you get that temperature, then you can actually integrate inwards with the rest of core model. It's gonna be very exciting in the next years, when we can actually make some measurements in those devices and and compare them to simulations, so that we can have more trust in the predictions for the next step for the reactors, the power plants.\nExplainer: Maybe both of us in our own way answer the question that we always get asked, when is fusion gonna happen? When are we gonna have fusion electricity on the grids?\n","361":"Explainer: So you're saying lots of private companies have entered. And that's injected a lot of private funding, not just government funding. Yeah.\nExplainee: The nature of private ventures is, you know, you want to get commercial as soon as possible. So I think they're accelerating things. They're actually taking advantages of discoveries in other fields. Like in the case of High Field Fusion with Commonwealth Fusion Systems and Tokamak Energy, those companies, they're using a high temperature superconductor. It's an advancement that has come recently from material science, right. Or machine learning, artificial intelligence. Those breakthroughs in other fields I think can really accelerate fusion. So I think we're seeing, the next decades are gonna be very exciting. We have to the diversify the different research that we do so that at the end we come with the most optimum solution for our fusion power plant.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: We're pushing for it.

Okay, now maybe we go up.\n","370":"Explainer: Connectome.\nExplainee: To be honest, I have no idea.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Whoa.\nExplainer: In one brain, in your brain.

Would that computer then be you?\nExplainee: Computers they don't have feelings, they won't have feelings and I think that's one thing that makes the human race strong.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","372":"Explainer: So tell me, what do you know about black holes?\nExplainee: Well, I know they're created when stars, once they start growing, it doesn't, it can't expand anymore, so they collapse inward.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: But no, the wind, the pull isn't, if you're not close enough, it doesn't work.\nExplainer: Right, you will feel the gravitational pull, and it'll redirect you in some way, and if you're far enough way, it's just like you're very far away from the sun, or something else. If you're close enough, it will divert your path more, if you're close enough still, then you will get what are called tidal forces, where the difference between, for example, if you're standing next to a black hole, the difference in gravity between your feet and your head actually becomes significant. Next time you see a science fiction movie, if somebody says, Oh, my god, we've been caught in the gravitation field of a black hole, and we're gonna fall in, it's like, no, no, just, if you're far enough away, just thrust a little bit this way, and then you'll slingshot around the black hole.\n","373":"Explainer: You got, pretty much, you got a very good idea about it. Basically you have a star, at the core its generating energy, which is countering the pressure of all that mass trying, being pulled in by gravity. Once it can't generate that energy anymore, the core collapses, once the core is collapsing, it keeps collapsing, and collapsing, and collapsing, and that's the critical thing that makes a black hole. You have enough mass in the volume, such that the escaped velocity becomes the speed of light, once light can't escape, hence the black part. (laughs) But that's the thing, is that just because there's an intense amount of gravity very close to a black hole, things don't start behaving differently. And my favorite analogy is a vacuum, everybody thinks, like, if you point a vacuum cleaner at something, it's just gonna suck everything in--\nExplainee: But no, the wind, the pull isn't, if you're not close enough, it doesn't work.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: So are there any movies that actually do, like, get space right?\nExplainer: I wouldn't call them educational, but the movie Interstellar actually had, as one of the people involved in both writing it, and as a science advisor, Dr. Kip Thorne, who's a Professor at Caltech, who was part of the team that detected gravitational waves, and just won a Nobel Prize for it. So he made sure to try and get it as accurate as possible, so Interstellar, I think, is one of the best examples of getting black holes right.\n","374":"Explainer: I'm sure you've heard about extra dimensions a little bit.\nExplainee: I've heard it, yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: I get a little scared, [laughing] because I think how can you prove these theories?\nExplainer: Right.\n","375":"Explainer: Mm-hmm.\nExplainee: Is that an extra dimension? Does that fit into that, or is that something?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: And are each of those dimensions, are they governed by the same laws of physics, or is there like a separate Lagrangian for each universe--\nExplainer: It's a, yeah.\n","376":"Explainer: It's a, yeah.\nExplainee: [Bela] Or how does that work?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Okay.\nExplainer: Why in the world would you think that there are extra dimensions, right? So you've heard of string theory?\n","377":"Explainer: Why in the world would you think that there are extra dimensions, right? So you've heard of string theory?\nExplainee: I have. So string theory is basically a theory of quantum gravity.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Right.\nExplainer: That's the good news. The bad news is that it only seems to work if spacetime is ten dimensional. [chuckles] So you would say well then it's wrong. It can't be right. Spacetime is not ten-dimensional. Spacetime is four dimensional. We've observed that. But instead, we say if spacetime looks four dimensional to us, but string theory, which might be the best theory we have of quantum gravity says it must be ten dimensional, maybe we can hide those extra six dimensions somehow. So here's how we could get lucky. We could imagine that there are extra dimensions of space that are curled up somehow that are so small that we can't see them. This is actually an old idea. It goes back to Kaluza and Klein right after general relativity was invented in 1915. But there's a more recent idea that says there could actually be relatively large extra dimensions. There could be extra dimensions that are actually that big, like a millimeter across that you would not have noticed. But here's the new, exciting idea. So let's imagine, okay. This is a piece of paper. But let's imagine this is our entire world. So, in other words, our real world is three dimensional, but let's imagine that we're just idealizing it down to two dimensions, so we all live here. You and I live here. But let's imagine that we're embedded in this bigger space. So there are extra dimensions that are actually big, okay? And let's imagine that. When I say we live on this three dimensional world what I mean is imagine that the particles that you and I are made of, right, the quarks, the leptons, the electrons and everything, all the forces we know about, electromagnetism, the weak nuclear force, the strong nuclear force, imagine they can't leave this surface. This is what we call a brane. B-R-A-N-E. Have you heard this word before?\n","378":"Explainer: Mm-hmm. So we have quantum mechanics, right? The theory of atoms and so forth and how those work, and then we have gravity, and gravity doesn't seem to fit in. It's the one force of nature that we can't really easily fit into this quantum mechanical framework, so string theory is one of the best ideas.\nExplainee: Right.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: I've heard it, yeah.\nExplainer: [Sean] Do you know where it comes from?\n","379":"Explainer: [Sean] Do you know where it comes from?\nExplainee: No.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Right.\nExplainer: If you have a two dimensional surface that vibrates and is a physical thing, we call that a membrane. Membrane theory goes back, it never was as popular as string theory, but it's been around for a while. But if you had extra dimensions of space, then you can three dimensional vibrating things, and four dimensional vibrating things.\n","380":"Explainer: From membranes, you know. We have lines, one dimension. We have two dimensional surfaces. So if you have a line that is a vibrating physical thing, you call it a string, right?\nExplainee: Right.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: So how do these strings give rise to things like mass and charge, and basically give us the properties of the particles that we see?\nExplainer: Well basically the strings are the particles that we see. It's exactly the same thing as we said for the straw, if you look at it far away it looks one dimensional. A little loop of string, so a little one dimensional circle that is vibrating. If you look at it from very, very far away, it just looks like a particle. So in string theory, an electron is a little string. A photon is a little string.\n","381":"Explainer: If you have a two dimensional surface that vibrates and is a physical thing, we call that a membrane.

I'm studying physics and environmental studies.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: So it's a star that has collapsed. It has so much concentrated mass and gravity that there's a point outside of the black hole called the event horizon. So once you get past the event horizon, nothing, not even light can escape from that.\nExplainer: It turns out that there are only three quantities that define a black hole, its electric charge, its mass, and its spin. So the most general black hole can also spin and it can also be electrically charged. Whether or not they are has to do with how they formed. If a star collapses, it will likely be spinning when it collapses and the remnant black hole that formsbwill likely be spinning. A black hole of a certain mass, charge, and spin is indistinguishable from any other black hole with those same properties. So in some sense, they're like fundamental particles, which makes them absolutely exceptional for any other astrophysical object. Have you heard the stories about what happens inside a black hole?\n","390":"Explainer: So that's a great definition and I wanna pick that apart a little bit. So what you described is just right. Stars, when they run out of thermonuclear fuel are gonna collapse under their own weight. It'll explode in a supernova, it'll leave a core, and if the core itself is heavy enough, it will keep collapsing. It does, as you say, reach this point where not even light can escape. But the amazing thing is it leaves that point, you called it rightly the event horizon, it leaves it behind kind of like an archeological record because the start itself can no more sit at the event horizon than it can race outward at the speed of light. So the core of the star keeps collapsing and where it goes nobody knows. So in a weird way, the black hole isn't anymore a crush of matter. It left it behind in its wake, but the stuff of the star is gone.\nExplainee: So it's a star that has collapsed. It has so much concentrated mass and gravity that there's a point outside of the black hole called the event horizon. So once you get past the event horizon, nothing, not even light can escape from that.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: I've heard of Schwarzschild black holes, which is a black hole that is static, a Kerr black hole or a Kerr-Newman black hole, which is a black hole that rotates, but what makes a black hole static versus rotating? And what's more common?\nExplainer: So from the outside, if you're an astronaut, you're watching your friend, another astronaut going into the black hole, it's as though your times become rotated relative to each other. So the profound thing is as an astronaut on the outside, looking at this round event horizon, you think of the center of black hole as a point in space, but to the person who's fallen in, it's not a point in space at all, it's a point in time. The singularity, or the end of it all, the crush in the center of a black hole is in their future. So they can no more avoid the singularity than you can avoid the next instant of time coming. So the death in the singularity is inevitable. Although we don't really think the singularity necessarily exists.\n","391":"Explainer: And so you can't actually measure the length.\nExplainee: Yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Would a planet or an asteroid be a fractal?\nExplainer: Yeah, so if you look at kind of the wrinkly surface of an asteroid, each one of those little wrinkles adds a little bit to the surface area.

What we're gonna try to do is we're gonna try to say what the length of the coastline of great Britain is. So we're gonna start out with the blue ones, which are spaced further apart. We're gonna ask you to connect the blue pins with a piece of string so we can get a measurement of the coastline. So we have our first measurement of the length of the coastline, and we're gonna do it over again. But this time we're gonna use the white pins, which are spaced closer together.

The ones I do like, I call signal and that's an artificial definition that I'm making when I choose to build a sensor. One of the challenges we have is, we're trying to figure out if I wanna control it, where is it coming from?

You don't just see the external spins, you see the fluctuations of all the other spins in your system. So what you wanna do is make sure that they don't interact with each other, but they still stay sensitive to everything else. And there, you could think about the local interactions, the magnetic interactions between the spins as a form of noise. In some ways, it's interfering with what you wanna measure, which is the magnetic field outside the sample.\n","440":"Explainer: I wanted to ask you a little bit about what you know about the history of the internet.

But I think the one that's easiest to understand is this thing called box counting dimension. You have, let's say an image and you want to decide what's the fractal dimension of this image. So what you're gonna do is you're gonna count the number of boxes, or you can imagine big pixels of this image that cover the boundary of this shape. And you're gonna see how does that counting compare with how the counts work for just an ordinary shape?

Do you know how the research into fractals began? You can look pretty far back in history to see kind of glimmers of this idea of fractals in science in the 19th century, people were trying to look for examples of things in mathematics that were very unnatural. So there was, for instance, this guy named Georg Cantor, who was showing that you can have these sets with really strange properties, or you can have functions with really strange properties. This thing called the devil staircase and so on. And it wasn't until about a century later where someone named Mendel Brock said, Oh, actually this strange mathematics that was meant to show how unnatural things can happen is actually a perfect description of things that really do happen in nature. And from there, people really ran with it and said, Oh, okay, well, if these fractal descriptions are good for nature, we can also use that for creating really realistic and believable pictures in computer graphics.\n","454":"Explainer: Yeah like perlin noise is a great example, right?

You're getting into philosophy of math now. It's just exciting.\nExplainer: I mean I think that's another common misconception about mathematics is that it's so far removed from the humanities, for instance. I mean it's hard to ignore some of these philosophical questions, particularly when we're talking about certain things like infinity. And I think one of the most difficult things to really be precise about and to explain to students is the continuum hypothesis. What do you say to students about the continuum hypothesis?\n","456":"Explainer: I'll grant you that Hilbert's Hotel does not exist. For me, infinite objects absolutely exist. And I can't read the thoughts in your head, but I have a high degree of confidence that we have a lot of the same ideas about infinity.\nExplainee: It's this idea that are things that you can think of, do they exist?

And sort of the continuum hypothesis is sort of one of these really hard things to grasp.\nExplainer: So what's so fascinating about the continuum hypothesis, if you take a subset of the real line that's infinite, does it necessarily have either the cardinality of the naturals or the cardinality of continuum, or is there some sort of third possibility? What's very surprising is the continuum hypothesis has been completely resolved in the sense that we now know for absolute certain that we will never know whether it's true or false. So this is a little bit confusing. The standard foundational axioms of mathematics that we take for granted are completely insufficient to prove the continuum hypothesis one way or the other. Mathematicians among other things have been very clear about exactly what they're taking as an assumption and exactly what they're concluding from it. So mathematical practice is to be exact transparent about the hypotheses you need to prove your theorem. So now I think of a proof of a theorem more like constructing a function where the domain of that function is all of the hypotheses that I'm assuming and then the target of that function is maybe a particular element in some universe that is the modularized space of the statement that I'm trying to prove or something like this. If the foundations were to change, if set theory were replaced by something else, maybe dependent type theory, do you think the theorem you've proven would still be true?\n","457":"Explainer: So what are you studying these days?\nExplainee: Well, I'm preparing my dissertation. The general topic is going to be how we perceive different types of social stimuli, like different people's faces and make judgements about them and how the way that we report on what we are experiencing tells us about what's actually going on inside our heads.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Oh of course.\nExplainer: Right, like it reminds me so much of, you know, what we in the field would refer to as statistical learning. On one hand we might have like a one-shot memory, a memory of something that we saw yesterday, like what we did or what we ate or where we were. But a lot of our memories and our knowledge instead are based on many, many, many experiences.\n","458":"Explainer: What I love about what you were describing is like you didn't use the word memory, were how you were talking about kind of perceptions and social judgments but I think probably we'd both agree that memory is a big part of that.\nExplainee: Oh of course.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Oh, absolutely. I think this sort of reminds me of another project that I'm doing. It's fairly easy to get different participants to experience consistent negative emotions to the same stimuli, but with positive emotions it's so much harder to study. I might not react the same to like this like cute cat video than someone else. And I definitely believe that people's memory that they're bringing up unconsciously when they're experiencing something to make an emotional judgment informs especially our experience with positive emotion possibly more than negative emotion.\nExplainer: Some of those examples really remind me also some of the questions about kind of abnormalities in, in memory or trauma or disruptions in memory and how they also play out in terms of not just what people remember but what they do with those memories right?\n","459":"Explainer: Right, like it reminds me so much of, you know, what we in the field would refer to as statistical learning.

How does it get updated based on experiences? Why does that sometimes happen and sometimes not? There are actually people who are born without a hippocampus. They have disruptions to episodic memories. They have trouble after this conversation remembering what the conversation was about, but they do have pretty good semantic information. They have a good sense of knowledge about the world. And that's interesting for two reasons. One, it shows this association between the role of the hippocampus and these two forms of memory, episodic memories and semantic memory. The other reason it's interesting is that people often assume that we get to semantic memory through episodic memory, that we encounter one dog and then another dog, and then another dog and then we learned the concept, the semantic notion of a dog. And these people, their profile suggests that you can learn semantic information. You can learn general knowledge about the world, even without ever having the capacity to build those individual memories.\n","460":"Explainer: Some of those examples really remind me also some of the questions about kind of abnormalities in, in memory or trauma or disruptions in memory and how they also play out in terms of not just what people remember but what they do with those memories right?\nExplainee: As far as the way that my research plays into it is like the first step in making a judgment about what to do based on an experience we're calling from memory is deciding what your emotional response was.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: In people with intact brains, you might use a particular process, but if that brain region that subserves that process is damaged, that it's not that you can't do it anymore you just now do it a different way.\nExplainer: You know when I look back at, some of the work for my own lab and in the field in general, I really feel like some of the most exciting discoveries were not an answer to a question that was around before, but they were discoveries that made us realize we weren't asking the right question. I think one example of that even has to do with the connection between memory and decision-making. There was a discovery about how the striatum responds to rewards and to learning that just all of a sudden flipped the way we thought about the role of reward and learning and memory, and may force us to realize there was something fundamentally connected between these processes. And that discovery just raised a whole new set of questions that didn't exist before.\n","461":"Explainer: I think what we're still kind of trying to understand as a field is the more kind of detailed and bigger picture of where does this model live?

Is there's a particular research question that the answer you think is gonna inform the research in your lab and perhaps in the rest of your field?\nExplainer: Each project should be very focused and rigorous and know what a study is designed for. But at the same time we have to keep our minds open, our eyes open for what else is happening. Some of the most interesting discoveries didn't make sense at first.\n","462":"Explainer: What happens in Minecraft if you get really, really close to a shape?\nExplainee: Well, it just looks like a block.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Recursion is a function that uses itself or calls itself in it's definition. And basically with that, you can figure out minute details such as searching for a value in a binary tree. It's kind of like iterating through itself, but it's often more sophisticated in that it's easier to write.\nExplainer: They're easy for a computer to execute, right? It just has to run this recursive procedure over and over and over again. We can kind of get as much detail as we want or need. When I think about fractals and kind of what they've done for computer graphics. The example I think is subdivision surfaces. Did you, did you encounter subdivision surfaces in your graphics class at all?\n","463":"Explainer: Yeah it looks really blocky. And it's the same thing not only with shapes and games, but also colors and textures. And this is an especially a big problem in virtual reality because you have no control over where people are gonna go. What they're gonna look at, how close they're gonna get to various objects. So fractals on the other hand are these things that have infinitely, you know, nice details you get closer and closer and closer. And so this is something that can help us solve this problem in computer graphics of generating more detail. One of the reasons why fractals are really nice for computer graphics is because the algorithms that we use to draw images also have this kind of recursive flavor. What's recursion?\nExplainee: Recursion is a function that uses itself or calls itself in it's definition.

So meshes and computer graphics are usually made of these flat polygons with kind of sharp edges. And so the question is how can I get something nice and round and smooth out of these sharp looking polygons? What I can do is I can start cutting one at a time, the corners of this paper off, it still looks very angular.

In fact, subdivision services were invented basically at Pixar. There's this guy, Ed Capel, and he was harshly responsible for one of the most famous kinds of subdivision surfaces called Capel Clark subdivision surfaces. And in fact recently won the touring award for these subdivision services.\n","466":"Explainer: Because I want to draw a smooth curve on the screen, but all my computer can do is draw straight lines.

So that's really nice, right? It's saving you a lot of work, but the downside is you lose a lot of control. So because the only thing you're describing is this short little program, you don't have complete control over how this is gonna end up. And so adding more controllability to procedural graphics is something people have been thinking about for many years.

They're these big cables that are laid down by switches. They cross both the Atlantic, the Pacific, the Indian Ocean. So the undersea cables are how the networks in Europe, United States, Asia are all connected together.\n","469":"Explainer: We could talk about that by analogy to a road system. It's not just one big, super highway. It's a lot of smaller super highways that are all interconnected. And those interchanges are what are called routers. That's where the links come together. You're talking about talking to a friend in Australia. So oh, it's coming in from the East Coast of the United States to this router, and it's going out say, that routers in San Francisco, it's going out on an underseas cable over to Australia rather than in this direction up to Japan.\nExplainee: So there is an underseas cable?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: How do you connect wirelessly?\nExplainer: That's really what we call the first hop.

And so most applications would like to connect you with a server that's close to you. Server is really just a big computer with a lot of memory, a lot of discs that store all the Netflix movies, and also so that you don't have to cross over too many internet links to get from where the server is to the TV or the device in your home.\n","471":"Explainer: That's really what we call the first hop.

There's a couple of things that could happen inside the internet. Information is sent in these little packets of information from the Netflix server to your display device. And literally, each packet that arrives says, This is the first packet for Jenna. This is the second. This is the third. This is the fifth. This is the fourth. And they're reordered for you. Matter of fact, your computer will say, using the TCP protocol to the server, Hey, I didn't get packet four, can you resend it again? And again, the Netflix server is very happy to send you packet four again. The other is the internet protocol. If you think about sending letters through the US Postal Service, how you've got an address on it. So every packet that flows from the Netflix server to you has an address on it. It says, This is going to Jenna. It's going to the what's called the Internet Protocol address of your device. Think of all the range of devices that are hooked up to the internet. It's totally amazing, right? Every single one of them has one thing in common, and that is they speak the IP protocol, the Internet Protocol. That was a great question.\n","472":"Explainer: What are some of the challenges that you've run into when trying to work with robots and do these tasks?\nExplainee: So, I was really interested in the problem of scooping peas on a plate. They're relatively homogenous, but when it came to more complex foods, like broccoli, or deformable foods, like tofu, that can crumble, that gets a lot more complex to simulate.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Right.\nExplainer: What algorithms do you think are most promising for handling non-rigid deformable objects and the other things you've been looking at?\n","473":"Explainer: How can we get robots to learn more efficiently or learn faster?\nExplainee: From my experience, it's a matter of how much support you give the, like, robot when it's learning. One could be like a narrower task range. Another is maybe like also biasing the types of samples that you're collecting can bias towards interactions that are gonna be useful where the hands actually interact with each other, rather than just off doing their own things. What have you found to be like your go-tos between the different styles?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: It's similar to like skill transfer style of things, because some skills are just repeatable. Like if I know how to pick up a cylinder, then maybe I know also how to pick up a mug.\nExplainer: Yeah. So you may not transfer the exact strategy or the exact policy that the robot takes, but you should be able to learn some general heuristics about performing manipulation.\n","474":"Explainer: So great to see you, Michael. Thanks for coming.\nExplainee: It's my pleasure.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: It's funny because I'm kind of at the heart, a developmental psychologist. And so when we talk about babies, a lot of what we're talking about is how they become human. I started to try to build computer models of little tiny bits of babies cognition. And I would ask people, and they'd say, You have to assume that you can recognize objects, because actually recognizing objects is impossible. And I was like, 'Wait, it's impossible? What about AI?' And they're like, 'That's, that's really hard.'\nExplainer: Why do you think it's so hard to build these things into AI systems and robots?\n","475":"Explainer: I like that description, because it conveys how much complexity there is to these really basic tasks that we're doing. Is there a definition for the simple tasks that we do versus things that are more complex, like playing chess?\nExplainee: I guess I like to think about this hierarchical cascade, where, at first, vision starts with the sensory signal and parses it into gradually more complex units. I think it does make sense to talk about lower level, meaning closer to sensation and perception and action, and higher level meaning more deliberative, more mediated by memory and language and judgment.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Our impression that it's purely discrete and symbolic might be, just that might be an impression, because we talk about it in a language. And actually, the fact that it's connected up to all these perception and sensation and action systems means that it's probably grounded in a more continuous set of representations. I wonder, is there gonna be a point where what you really want to know is what are the experiences that a human has? [indistinct] human speech own project. His idea was, 'Well, I need the exact data that my son gets in order to train my robot to be like my son.' Or do you think that we're gonna end up in a world that's more like the large language models and that'll have to do?\nExplainer: I suspect that we'll start by doing whatever is most convenient, 'cause that's whatever we can get. But I think that for robots to be capable alongside humans, in a world with humans, I think that we may need to actually use human experience, human learning, to inform how robots learn, if we want them to follow the same kind of mistake pattern as humans, so that humans can interpret robots, and humans can understand what robots will and will not do.\n","476":"Explainer: Cool. What do you think of when you hear the words quantum sensing?\nExplainee: I think that using some sort of quantum computing to sense some quantum level molecules or particles, like interactions and stuff, maybe.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Okay.\nExplainer: We believe quantum mechanics tells us what the true laws of physics are, and so a quantum sensor, in that sense, would reach the limits of what's attainable.\n","477":"Explainer: It would be the top tier.\nExplainee: What are you doing? Like, what are you studying?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Okay.\nExplainer: Which is a really nice platform because the spins show their quantum properties, even at room temperature.\n","478":"Explainer: Which is a really nice platform because the spins show their quantum properties, even at room temperature.\nExplainee: So, are you studying the spins of the electrons?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: So you mentioned the diamonds that are used to create the sensors.\nExplainer: Right.\n","479":"Explainer: So you can implant nitrogen into a diamond and then you bombard it with electrons to create the vacancies and then you heat it up and anneal it, and then you get these nitrogen-vacancy centers in your system. So you mentioned quantum computing earlier. So have you heard of the idea of superposition?\nExplainee: Mm-hmm, yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Okay, so it's like using like, the quantum computer would be kind of like the base level and then like you take it out into the world and see how like it differs?\nExplainer: So rather than trying to build a lot of complex algorithms and gates with it, what you do is, you take these quantum bits and you take them out into the world and say, what do you see? What are you sensitive to? So you can use an idea called entanglement to make an even more sensitive quantum sensor, but it's even more fragile. So there's always this trade-off between being super fragile and being super sensitive at the same time.\n","480":"Explainer: So that's in some ways the key to both quantum sensing, as well as quantum computing. It's the idea that you can take a system and put it in a superposition of two states. Normally we think of classically a bit can be a zero or a one. So switch is either on or off. Whereas in a quantum system, it can be in what's called a superposition. So it can be partially on and partially off. But one of the challenges with quantum systems is that these superpositions are really hard to maintain because we don't see superpositions in the world around us. In quantum computing, you try really hard to isolate everything so that you can maintain this quantum property and the fact that it's actually going to lose its quantum properties as it interacts with the world also makes it a great sensor because now you're actually, you're using that fact that it's interacting with the world to say, wait, it's sensing something.\nExplainee: Okay, so it's like using like, the quantum computer would be kind of like the base level and then like you take it out into the world and see how like it differs?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: How does entanglement work into it?\nExplainer: So entanglement is the idea that two particles are correlated. They're essentially in the same quantum state, so that you can't disturb one particle without disturbing the second particle. And so, if I have a large number of quantum sensors that are entangled, then they're all going to interact much more strongly than if I just had one of them interact at a time.\n","481":"Explainer: So rather than trying to build a lot of complex algorithms and gates with it, what you do is, you take these quantum bits and you take them out into the world and say, what do you see? What are you sensitive to? So you can use an idea called entanglement to make an even more sensitive quantum sensor, but it's even more fragile. So there's always this trade-off between being super fragile and being super sensitive at the same time.\nExplainee: How does entanglement work into it?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Okay.\nExplainer: And so that gives you a boost in sensitivity when you have an entangled\n","482":"Explainer: It's more precise, Absolutely.\nExplainee: Okay.

In fact, our old GPS system is based on the accuracy of atomic clocks. They're a set of satellites, each of which has an atomic clock on board and they send out a timestamp and so, once it gets a signal from three different satellites, it can triangulate and figure out exactly where you are. Now, if you could make those clocks even more precise, you could actually accurately position where you are even more accurately.\nExplainee: Okay, that's really cool.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","484":"Explainer: What's your name?\nExplainee: Namina.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Seeing, hearing, tasting and smelling.\nExplainer: Mm-hmm.\n","485":"Explainer: Mm-hmm.\nExplainee: Yeah, and touch.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: No, I don't think so.

The only mechanism that we know for sure can form black holes is to collapse of very massive stars. So it's sensible to think, well maybe some very massive stars in a young universe collapsed under their own weight and then they merged and after some time they got big enough, but the black holes from stars can be tens of times the mass of the sun, maybe hundreds of times to the mass of the sun if they merge. To get to millions and billions, and if you just do the simple arithmetic of how many years that would take, there aren't enough years in the 14 billion years of the universe's lifetime. So they must have come from somewhere else.\n","493":"Explainer: Yeah, and probably nobody is.

Or, man, what happened?\nExplainer: Yeah, I think that's right. I think people are really perplexed about how you make something so big in such a short period of time. It's kind of funny, the bigger you make a black hole, it seems maybe counterintuitive, but the less dense the material has to be out of which you make it. So you can, out of something the density almost of air, you can make a supermassive black hole. You can't make a star out of that, but weirdly, if you skip the star phase altogether, it's conceivable that they directly collapse. And so there's suddenly a new way to make black holes that nature has figured out.\n","494":"Explainer: [Janna] Yeah.\nExplainee: We spend all of our time, when we learn about black holes in school, predominantly through star collapse.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: I didn't even realize that there was an alternate route to creating a black hole.\nExplainer: Can you tell us about Andromeda?\n","495":"Explainer: Yes, they're all friends.\nExplainee: Gravitationally, all friends.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: And Andromeda is one of the few galaxies that is traveling towards us and do for a merger event at some point. So given a sufficiently low velocity, we would just have two big galaxies that, for the most part, pass through each other, pass by each other. But given a sufficiently high velocity, we will have some crazy black hole interactions and some crazy star interactions.\nExplainer: Yeah, and it's very possible that as you said, the collision won't be so severe that it'll be very disruptive. So our entire solar system could stay intact and here we would go with the sun and all the other planets in orbit around a new black hole.\n","496":"Explainer: But when we do merge with Andromeda, presumably our black holes will merge and Andromeda indeed has a very big black hole as well at its center. And then we'll have this just gigantic-\nExplainee: And Andromeda is one of the few galaxies that is traveling towards us and do for a merger event at some point. So given a sufficiently low velocity, we would just have two big galaxies that, for the most part, pass through each other, pass by each other. But given a sufficiently high velocity, we will have some crazy black hole interactions and some crazy star interactions.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Supermassive black hole.\nExplainer: We work a lot right now on thinking of black holes as batteries. So a black hole that can take, like a giant magnet, astronomical magnet in the form of another collapsed star, like a neutron star, and flip it around so fast, near the speed of light, that it actually creates an electronic circuit out of this moving magnet. And so that the power that can come out of these electronic circuits created by these batteries can be tremendous.\n","497":"Explainer: Yeah, and it's very possible that as you said, the collision won't be so severe that it'll be very disruptive. So our entire solar system could stay intact and here we would go with the sun and all the other planets in orbit around a new black hole.\nExplainee: Supermassive black hole.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: They're kind of misunderstood giants in a way. So I was curious, have you heard anything new or interesting in the field of black holes that will shape future discussions?\nExplainer: It's a great question. I once did a calculation of using a black hole made out of the moon and the strongest magnet we could find on Earth to see if I could make an electronic battery. And honestly, you only get about enough energy to power New York City. But we have to find one in our neighborhood first.\n","498":"Explainer: That's near and dear to my heart. Multi-party computations.\nExplainee: Obviously, zero-knowledge proofs are about proving things to another person without revealing the details of what it is that you're proving. But, you know, in my mind, zero-knowledge actually goes even further beyond that. It's like this overarching concept that you can see a lot in multi-party computation, where you wanna accomplish some sort of task without revealing anything more than exactly what you need to accomplish that task.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Yeah, so my first encounter with NP-completeness was in my very first algorithms class that I took as an undergraduate. So that was my first introduction. Is that an NP-complete language is this amazing problem that not only tells you about itself, but solving this problem can actually tell you about an entire class of really interesting problems.\nExplainer: When you first start to think about proofs as an interactive game where we're talking to each other, did that make zero-knowledge possible?\n","499":"Explainer: Indeed.\nExplainee: But once you flip that on its head and you're no longer trying to do that, suddenly all of the bad properties of randomness become good.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: In my experience, usually the hardest part is figuring out exactly where the best place is to use it. I've written some papers in the past that have used zero-knowledge in a more theoretical way. But when it comes to applications, some of the most exciting applications that I've seen so far have been in the blockchain space.\nExplainer: So what are some of the efficiency bottlenecks that you find?\n","500":"Explainer: No doubt. And especially with cloud computing, exploiting the power of the cloud to enable zero-knowledge proofs, and to make use of zero-knowledge proofs, would be amazing.\nExplainee: Yeah. Absolutely.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Yeah.\nExplainer: So can we take that power that's there in the cryptography, and use it to somehow help with the tremendous level of mistrust\n","501":"Explainer: It'd be great to just start by talking about your work at the broadest level. To my mind your work has really revolutionized the field of cognitive neuroscience more broadly.\nExplainee: I've been really interested in how past understandings of the brain have really focused on, on pinpointing exactly what each piece of the brain does. But I think that there's also a broader conversation happening in the brain, which is between one region and another. So it's actually the pattern of connections between these regions that would allow for the flow of information. But I think the tools that have become widely available now from the physics community and mathematics and computer science are under the umbrella of, of network science. So that is a science of networks, a science of understanding how bits of a system are interconnected with one another. Not just comparing two groups of people or two kinds of two species, but we can ask even within a single person, how does the pattern of connectivity in my brain change as we talk with one another? How does the information flow change? I think a lot about traffic on roadway networks as a good example of this. Which is, you know, we can understand where the roads are and perhaps the roads are relatively fixed. They change over long timescales and it's similar to the brain. We really only create large scale connections over long timescales. But we can alter the traffic on the roadways really easily. And that's similar to what we do in the brain is that we change the way that information is flowing to allow us to respond to our environment.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: The field is definitely opening up in the kinds of questions that can be asked now with these approaches. And I think what you're pointing out is that conceptually it's where we wanted to go anyway. So if there's so much orchestration that happens and a symphony is not a single piece, it's not a single pattern of, of harmony between instruments and, and similar to the brain, symphony of your brain is not a single pattern. It's a very dynamically changing pattern.\nExplainer: In the field we often talk of have having a mental model that we use to make predictions about what's about to happen and really use that to mean kind of a general understanding of what's going on. What does that look like in terms that come from your world of like the configuration of, of a circuit?\n","502":"Explainer: Have you ever heard of zero-knowledge proofs?\nExplainee: Only in passing.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Will I, like, understand that it's true because like, you know, the operations performed in the proof are like, of a certain, like, you know, they have like, certain attributes that would make them true?\nExplainer: What you're basically asking is, wait, what? Right? Right. So this is what makes zero-knowledge proof so fascinating, and so counter-intuitive. And I think the best way I can explain it to you is by means of an example. But before we do that, I have to decide what I'm gonna prove to you in a, with a zero-knowledge proof.\n","503":"Explainer: So actually, in the blockchain space is one of the spaces where we are seeing zero-knowledge proofs being implemented. And I think it's just the beginning. Let's talk about zero-knowledge proofs. At its core, a zero-knowledge proof is an interaction between two people. Then I should be able to convince you that some statement is true, but you won't have any idea why it's true.\nExplainee: Will I, like, understand that it's true because like, you know, the operations performed in the proof are like, of a certain, like, you know, they have like, certain attributes that would make them true?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Sounds good.\nExplainer: And the way we're gonna approach this is through something called NP-completeness. What an NP-complete problem is, it's a problem that's really hard to solve. But if you can solve it, you can solve any problem that's in the class NP. And that includes a vast number of problems. And what we're gonna do is we're gonna use an NP-complete problem to actually prove an incredible variety of statements through a zero-knowledge proof. And the specific Np-complete problem that we're gonna be looking at is called map three-coloring. Okay, so here we have a map. Okay. And these are a bunch of countries. And we've arranged them so that no countries that have the same color share a border. That's what makes a map like this validly colored. And now you might think, well, why should we care? It turns out that whether or not a map can be three-colored in this way is an example of an NP-complete problem. And it turns out that, you know, maybe what you really wanna do, is you wanna give a zero-knowledge proof that you have at least 0.3 Bitcoins, right? That would be cool.\n","504":"Explainer: What you're basically asking is, wait, what? Right? Right. So this is what makes zero-knowledge proof so fascinating, and so counter-intuitive. And I think the best way I can explain it to you is by means of an example. But before we do that, I have to decide what I'm gonna prove to you in a, with a zero-knowledge proof.\nExplainee: Sounds good.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Yeah.\nExplainer: Without revealing what the address is of your account. It turns out I can take that statement that I have at least 0.2 Bitcoins, and convert it into a map of countries. And that map of countries will be three-colorable like this only if you have at least 0.2 Bitcoins.\n","505":"Explainer: All right. Sounds good. Right? Here we have green, right? And over here, we have blue. Okay. And as you can see, they're two different colors.\nExplainee: Mm-hmm.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Yeah.\nExplainer: Right? So now, of course, one way to get more confidence is to open up more of them for you, but that would be revealing information to you. I don't wanna do that. So instead, I'm gonna ask you to please turn around. And now, let's change up these colors. Can you pick two countries at random and we'll reveal two of the colors again.\n","506":"Explainer: Right? So you have a little bit of confidence, right, that I have managed to color this correctly. but not that much confidence. 'Cause I've only shown you two of the countries.\nExplainee: Yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: I'll take this one and this one.\nExplainer: Nice. And that's smart of you to check with the same one of the ones you already had. Right?\n","507":"Explainer: Nice. And that's smart of you to check with the same one of the ones you already had. Right?\nExplainee: Mm-hmm.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Yeah, because of this one, right?\nExplainer: Exactly. Right. But it works for this coloring that I'm showing you right now. So what we've done is we've made it impossible for you to put the pieces together. And if you do this, let's say, a thousand times. And if I correctly showed you different colors, each thousand times, you'd be really convinced. And that's it. That's the entire zero-knowledge proof.\n","508":"Explainer: But as you'll see, now it's not green, it's blue. And this one on the other hand, is green. Okay. The colors I showed you last time, don't work with these new colors, right? This wouldn't have worked before.\nExplainee: Yeah, because of this one, right?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Oh, okay.\nExplainer: Okay?\n","509":"Explainer: You would use encryption. Right. But it's really, this is the protocol.\nExplainee: So what are the broader implications of like, zero-knowledge proofs. Are they supposed to be like, more practical for like, implementation, and or, are they supposed to like, structurally prove something?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Where do you think we could build like, more trust using like, zero-knowledge proofs?\nExplainer: Right.\n","510":"Explainer: Right.\nExplainee: And it's implementations?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","511":"Explainer: Does infinity come up in your mathematics that you're studying?\nExplainee: One place infinity comes up is in algebraic geometry. Normally we think okay, well if you have two lines like this, you'd keep drawing them, they intersect right here. But in projective space, two parallel lines will also intersect at the point at infinity. Infinity is like this perfect concept for what we can add to a space that allows lines to have this more uniform property. What's your research in?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Yeah, it's basically this idea that you can put a choice function on any set.\nExplainer: And a choice function does what exactly?\n","512":"Explainer: And a choice function does what exactly?\nExplainee: Yeah, that's a good question.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Yeah, I've used it like that. I've also used it in Zorn's lemma and in the well ordering principle.\nExplainer: So there are three well-known famous equivalent forms of the axiom of choice. The well ordering principle is the assumption, the axiom that any set can be well ordered, but there are lots of subsets of real numbers that do not have a minimal element. So that ordering is not a well ordering. So here's the key question. Do you believe the axiom of choice?\n","513":"Explainer: So the way I think about it is if you have an infinite or an arbitrary family of sets and you know for sure that none of these sets are empty, then a choice function would allow you to select an element from each set sort of all at once. When you've used the axiom of choice in proofs, do you know which incarnation of this you've used?\nExplainee: Yeah, I've used it like that. I've also used it in Zorn's lemma and in the well ordering principle.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: I do believe the axiom of choice.\nExplainer: You do believe the axiom of choice, though it leads us to some strange conclusions. So if the axiom choice is true, then it's necessarily the case that there exists a well ordering of the reals. And what that means is that we can perform induction over real numbers like we perform induction over the natural numbers. This is trans-finite induction. It would work for any ordinal. So there must be some uncountably infinite ordinal that represents the order type of the real numbers. And this allows us to prove some crazy things. Imagine three-dimensional Euclidean space. So the space that we live in, extending infinitely in all directions. So it is possible to completely cover three-dimensional Euclidean space by disjoint circles, so infinitesimal circles, disjoint circles of radius one. So what that means is you can put a circle somewhere in space and then put a second circle somewhere in space that can't intersect with the first one because these are solid circles and then another circle can somehow cover every single point in space with no gaps in between.\n","514":"Explainer: So there are three well-known famous equivalent forms of the axiom of choice. The well ordering principle is the assumption, the axiom that any set can be well ordered, but there are lots of subsets of real numbers that do not have a minimal element. So that ordering is not a well ordering. So here's the key question. Do you believe the axiom of choice?\nExplainee: I do believe the axiom of choice.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: It's crazy.\nExplainer: It's not the only crazy thing. Do you have a favorite consequence of the axiom of choice?\n","515":"Explainer: So there's certainly no stop to this procedure. But could you give a precise cardinality to that?\nExplainee: would be a set of all sets, right?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: So you're just making a cutoff point. You're saying we're never gonna get sets bigger than this anyway, so we might as well make our category only include things smaller than that.\nExplainer: That's right. So a rigorous way to work with a category of sets is to demand that it's a category of sets whose size is bounded by this cardinality, Alpha say. That is then an example of a category that fits into another even still larger Grothendieck universe Beta. So implicitly in a lot of my research, I have to add an additional assumption that there exists maybe countably many inaccessible cardinals.\n","516":"Explainer: Talk us through Hawking's initial revolution that led to a lot of these conversations about the information around black holes.\nExplainee: Hawking's big insight was that he had to apply both the rules of quantum mechanics and the rules of gravity to really understand how black holes behaved. But Hawking took a point of view where he brought quantum mechanics into the game. He really that if you took that into account, that it's actually not quite true that black holes are black, that actually things can escape from black holes.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: A way to think about Hawking radiation is to imagine that pairs of particles and antiparticles appear out of the quantum vacuum and the particle can escape the black hole, but the antiparticle falls in. But the particle and antiparticle are a pair and if the antiparticle really falls into the black hole and is destroyed at the singularity, that poor particle outside the black hole has lost his partner. It also violates the rules of quantum mechanics. If you have two particles that are entangled, that has to be preserved.\nExplainer: Now, to be clear, nobody disputes that black holes will quantum radiate, that Hawking radiation is a solid prediction. The black holes should in fact evaporate, that's not disputed, right?\n","517":"Explainer: Have you heard of fractals before?\nExplainee: No, absolutely not.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Yes.\nExplainer: Right?

If you think about Moana's island, it has these tens and hundreds of thousands of trees on it.

We're trying to invent the integrated circuit and scale up. It's still very very very early in the development of the field.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: There does exist an algorithm, Shor's algorithm, which has been proven mathematically that if you had a large enough quantum computer you could find the prime factors of large numbers. The basis of the RSA encryption is the most commonly used thing on the internet. First we're far away from being able to have a quantum computer big enough to execute Shor's algorithm on that scale. Second, there are plenty of other encryption schemes that don't use factoring and I don't think anybody has to be concerned at the moment. And in the end, quantum mechanics goes to the side of privacy enhancement. If you have a quantum communication channel you can encode information and send it through there and it's provably secure based on the laws of physics.\nExplainee: I have no idea what people are going to end up using them for I mean if you had gone back 30 years and handed somebody an iPhone they would have called you a wizard, so.

And that's why you get turbulence at all different scales.\n","536":"Explainer: Or you don't even need computers. Like I remember when I was a kid, I played electric guitar and I had all these guitar pedals with different effects and oh, what happens if you put the output back in the input and just run it through itself, you're gonna start hearing this kind of fractal sound, right? So today we've been telling people, fractals are things that are somehow self-similar, they have detail at all scales. Are there other ways you might introduce fractals to somebody or are there other things you might say, this is what a fractal is?\nExplainee: And I think that's one of the things that's exciting about it.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: I think you could get to the reasons why does a coastline look like a coastline at all different scales? It's because the forces of nature tend to work similarly at all different scales. And it's those forces that are doing very, very simple things over and over and over again that are constantly creating the sense of detail.\nExplainer: Yeah.\n","537":"Explainer: Yeah.\nExplainee: And then you get it all.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: But I think it's this point that that point with the coffee is important because the forces we're operating at one scale, they're operating at the scale of the coffee cup. But over time they kept making details that were smaller and smaller. Process at one scale, plus time you get fractals.\nExplainer: [Keenan] Come out of nowhere.\n","538":"Explainer: [Keenan] Right?\nExplainee: And when everybody understands scaling.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Scaling is a simple thing yeah.\nExplainer: People outside of computer graphics and engineering and science and so forth have also thought a lot about and used fractals as a language for talking about nature, for characterizing shapes and behaviors and so forth tissue or friction, or all sorts of really important phenomena. Do you think that computer graphics has kind of dropped the ball in terms of saying, you know, this is not something that's exciting anymore to work on procedural descriptions and we're, we're moving on from that?\n","539":"Explainer: Now you work on kind of the future of virtual reality and augmented reality and extended reality. But it's kind of interesting because I think if I think about exploring these infinite fractal landscapes in some way, they still feel a little bit lonely or they feel a little bit poor of the kind of richness that we have in the real world.\nExplainee: Scaling is a simple thing yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: This is where machine learning starts coming in, because you can start saying, okay, this is a very, very rich virtual world, but it's informed by, you know, my favorite mountains that I saw in Italy once. So you can start training these fractal worlds on things about the real world that have particular emotional resonance for us.\nExplainer: Right? Lazy evaluation, we love being lazy in computer graphics.\n","540":"Explainer: Absolutely.\nExplainee: Well, it's also, it's not even possible to explore, to store an entire world in your computer.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: You wanna be able to sort of generate it on the fly. I'm looking forward to things getting better. We're not there yet.\nExplainer: So- He made a lot of happy little trees.\n","541":"Explainer: So- He made a lot of happy little trees.\nExplainee: I think in that case, it came down to the fact that Ken in particular had a mission to make accessible tools for people without sacrificing the power and the richness of making beautiful things. I mean, in a sense he was kind of the computer graphic, Bob Ross. You know? So- \nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Which, I mean, when you, when you think about the techniques of somebody like a Bob Ross they're fractal.\nExplainer: Yeah it's really part of human nature or human's connection to nature. Yeah.\n","542":"Explainer: What do you know about memory?\nExplainee: I know when you see something you could like kind of like picture it, like in your head you can imagine it. I remember yesterday I got like orange juice, but let's say like a year or two, you might think like, oh, that day I got water.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Let's say you grew up in a place that the orange juice is just meh, and then you go on vacation going somewhere and then it might change how you feel about orange juice.\nExplainer: Sometimes, you know, memory is doing something much simpler but no less important for us, which is it's helping us figure out what's good and what's bad. And if we can remember what's good and what's bad from what we did in the past, that can help us make decisions about what to do next time. So Dylan, you may be surprised to learn this, but we asked your mom what some of your favorite candies are. So you have to make a decision between these two candies and whichever one you pick, you actually get to take with you.\n","543":"Explainer: And on one hand memory is like a record of something that happened in the past that we can carry with us and we can like bring it back to mind. And on the other hand we need to be a little bit suspicious sometimes because we might get it wrong. In what world would that memory of the orange juice maybe be useful?\nExplainee: Let's say you grew up in a place that the orange juice is just meh, and then you go on vacation going somewhere and then it might change how you feel about orange juice.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: I wish I could say both, but I guess I'll go with pixie sticks.\nExplainer: There you go, there is your decision. Okay, you can take those. It took you some time there. You looked like you were really working hard at that problem. And that's interesting because actually we know that from research that when people have to make a decision between two things they like equally, some people like economists think oh those are the easiest decisions because they're both good options. But as psychologists and neuroscientists we know it's the opposite. One of the reasons is because there's no simple answer of like I know that one's better I'm just gonna go with it. And so we think that that's the kind of decision where memory is especially important because you have to kind of come up with more information.\n","544":"Explainer: Sometimes, you know, memory is doing something much simpler but no less important for us, which is it's helping us figure out what's good and what's bad.

And you don't know.\nExplainer: Everything you just said is exactly what we know from research. All the thoughts running through your mind, were really at kind of about a prediction into the future, right? You're like, how, how will this taste if, when it's in my mouth or how will I feel about my decision down the road? You know we think of memory as something in the past, but it's an example of how you use your memories of these two candies to predict what's gonna happen in the future so that you can make a decision in the present. But you did it, you made your way through that torture. And now you've got to keep the candy.\n","545":"Explainer: There you go, there is your decision. Okay, you can take those. It took you some time there. You looked like you were really working hard at that problem.

What's gonna like change that?\nExplainer: We fluctuate a lot because we use different kinds of memory to kind of resolve the uncertainty basically every time. But also the way we make decisions will change because our memories change. What's interesting about your brain as a teenager is that we know it's actually a phase of life where the brain is especially sensitive to rewards, to things that are exciting and positive. It's a phase of life where those rewards, whether it's candy or your friends or whatever it is that's exciting can have an especially powerful control over the decisions you make and the memories you create.\n","546":"Explainer: What's your favorite subject?\nExplainee: I'd say math. Some of the small problems can actually be really big and complicated. It's like a puzzle.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Yeah.\nExplainer: So what do you see in this photo?\n","547":"Explainer: I know where it is, but I don't wanna tell you. Do you believe me? You're not sure to believe me. Right?\nExplainee: Yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: I see the puffin.\nExplainer: So when you look at this board, we don't know where the photo was, right? Was the photo like with the corner here? In which case the puffin would be all the way at this side. Or was the photo with the corner here? In which case the puffin would be on the other side. So this is a really simple example of a zero-knowledge proof. I convinced you that I knew where the puffin was, but you didn't learn anything else.\n","548":"Explainer: But what if I could prove to you that I know where the puffin is without revealing to you where it is? Let me show you. I took that photo that we showed you. And I put it behind this poster here. Why don't you go take a look through that hole?\nExplainee: I see the puffin.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Why do you study zero-knowledge proof?\nExplainer: When I first learned about them, I just thought they were so cool.

That's what it's called.\nExplainee: Yeah. yeah, I haven't heard of it before.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Yeah, I did work with robots, but they weren't doing like artificial intelligence type of stuff. We were just sending like instructions and the robot would do, like, perform like a simple task. I wasn't so used to the aspect of, like, teaching computer how to do stuff. So I'm always on that other end of like giving instructions, more focused on the data analysis and machine learning aspect of it.\nExplainer: And how would you just describe machine learning, like in one sentence?\n","553":"Explainer: Do you have any thoughts on like what the data might look like in a robotic setting, if you were to apply machine learning to robots?\nExplainee: I think of like coordinates.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: I don't think so.

Or do you think, is it the way that we've been collecting those types of data sets, Is that what's keeping us behind?\nExplainer: That's a great question. I think we should be able to accelerate the data collection process by having robots collect more data autonomously on their own. And by doing that, we might be able to overcome some of the challenges of Moravec's paradox.\n","555":"Explainer: Right.\nExplainee: Maybe they should be using elements of quantum computation. So I don't have a strong view on it, but I do think it's an interesting question.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: That's where the excitement lies, is when we really start to leverage having, you know, access to individual quantum degrees of freedom, whether that's a single photon or a single spin and in principle then, you could also imagine entangling it and you know, doing some quantum computations on it in order to make it an even better sensor.\nExplainer: So do you think there's a maximum number of spins you can have if I think about a single NV as a register?\n","556":"Explainer: Right.\nExplainee: But I don't know that there's necessarily a limit. I mean, it keeps expanding. I mean, I think that there are some groups that are able to identify, you know, 30, 40 individual nuclear spins around a single electron and control 10 or 15 of them.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: That's another great question. A couple of groups actually that are working on trying to read out the spin state of NV centers electrically, instead of optically. If you could do that, then you could pack a whole lot more into a smaller space using tiny electrodes.\nExplainer: Right.\n","557":"Explainer: What does infinity mean to you?\nExplainee: Really anything that has no end to it.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: What do you mean by that?\nExplainer: Adding infinities. Multiplying infinities. And there's a sense in which it's very similar to the arithmetic that you learned about already. But it's also totally different. It has some very weird properties. Welcome to Hilbert's Hotel. Unlike an ordinary hotel, has accountably infinitely many rooms. Suppose a new guest shows up, you might think that the new guest could take the room that's all the way down at the end of the hall, all the way at infinity, except there isn't a room like that. The rooms each have a number, and even though there's infinitely many rooms, each room is only a finite distance away. So here's how we're gonna make room for the new guest. I'm gonna ask the guest in room one to move into room two, and then we're gonna ask the guest in room two to move into room three, and we'll continue this all the way along. It looks to me like there's space for the new guest. Where is it? \n","558":"Explainer: Yeah, that's absolutely right. So infinity gets used a lot of different ways in mathematics. There's a way that mathematicians think of infinity as a number, just like the number 13, just like the number 10 million. So the reason that mathematicians consider infinity to be a number is that it is a size of a set. So the first example of an infinite set in mathematics is the set of all counting numbers. So one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, et cetera. That list goes on forever. That is an infinite set. And to be a little bit more precise, it's a countably infinite set. But as a number, infinity is pretty strange.\nExplainee: What do you mean by that?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: It'll be in room number one.\nExplainer: Room number one. Exactly. I'm gonna use this symbol for infinity, but what we've just shown is that one, the one new guest plus infinity is equal to the same infinity. What happens if we had a second guest?\n","559":"Explainer: Adding infinities. Multiplying infinities. And there's a sense in which it's very similar to the arithmetic that you learned about already.

That there's another Hilbert's Hotel down the street and they're having plumbing issues and we need to find room for them.\n","560":"Explainer: Room number one. Exactly.

That would be a great solution. I don't know. I think these people don't really get along. So I need to somehow create infinitely many new rooms, but I can only ask each person in the hotel to move a finite distance away. So let's take the guest who is originally in room one and move them into room two. So that's creating one new space for us.

Teaching algebra, which is meant in a different sense about number systems, we deal with infinite families of numbers in their operations. Infinite sets are somehow very exotic. They're not found so commonly in their real world, but they're all over mathematics.\n","564":"Explainer: What's your conception about what the internet is?\nExplainee: The internet? For me, it's just something to use when I need like to search up something or watch videos.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Yeah, I have no idea.\nExplainer: Got a favorite movie?\n","565":"Explainer: Got a favorite movie?\nExplainee: Matilda.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Yeah.\nExplainer: Let's say we want to get a video from here, over to here.

So you go the other way.\nExplainer: Exactly. So, Skylar, that was a great discussion about what we just built. And I wanted to talk to you about, or ask you about maybe one other really important part about networks.

Are you up for one?\n","568":"Explainer: Yeah. So that's a really good observation. In most pieces of the internet, that's exactly what would happen. We want to take what's called a shortest path.

I mean, basically, software-defined networking exists, let's say within a single provider backbone, or a single cloud provider's network or a single campus. There's been some work on doing it at the juncture points between a pair of networks. But one other trend that's happening that makes it more possible is it used to be that to get from one end to the internet to the other, you have access networks getting much closer to, say Google or Microsoft or other large cloud providers, where even, you might only go through two networks\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Right, exactly. And if you take that even further, they're starting to be more edge computing where you might imagine you might have a cell tower connected to a small number of routers, connected directly to a server that's gonna be running the application. In that case, the entire infrastructure might be controlled by a single party.\nExplainer: It's totally fascinating to me that we have such an important global infrastructure, and yet, the laws that that govern it tend to be very, very local.\n","572":"Explainer: Right, well it holds together because we have standards, and we have protocols that you mentioned.\nExplainee: Exactly, protocol standards for how the equipment talks to one another. And increasingly, certificate authorities that help bootstrap the secure, encrypted and communication between end hosts. So there are a few of these sort of centrally, kind of agreed upon kinds of infrastructure, but for the most part, each network runs itself.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Not really because each country really can have it's own laws and its own norms. And so they can decide, like the Great Firewall of China can decide, they don't wanna let certain content be accessed by the citizens inside that country. So if a country decides they don't wanna answer a request for a particular domain name, they say, Hey, I don't want to let someone know the IP address of this website. They can decide not to let those answers be delivered inside their country. And so encryption plays a role in helping people keep their privacy or prevent surveillance, but it's not perfect. It's often possible, still, to know a fair amount about what people are doing, even if you can't look inside the envelope at the letter that's written.\nExplainer: I mean, even you could just tell that two people are communicating even though the traffic itself is encrypted. So you don't know what they're saying, just even knowing two devices are communicating.\n","573":"Explainer: And certainly, we've heard about some countries that impose firewalls that don't let certain kinds of traffic out, or certain kinds of traffic in. So there's no global body that is regulating that?\nExplainee: Not really because each country really can have it's own laws and its own norms.

And in particular, we're seeing in edge computing, a convergence of all three. Where you might have a mobile phone or a drone or some other kind of device connecting over the wireless medium directly to a network that connects you directly to the server that might run your application.\nExplainer: So you want the computation close to where the endpoint is.\n","575":"Explainer: So you want the computation close to where the endpoint is.\nExplainee: Exactly, and I think that what's now exciting about that is all three of these technologies, wireless, networking and cloud, which are normally three different communities, three different sets of technologies, three different sets of standards or practices, now have to work together in close harmony to be able to service applications that are really critical and that that might be interacting with the physical world in ways where safety is a potential concern.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: I agree. It's both the high bandwidth, it's the low delay so that you can have these applications that interact with the physical world and need answers in real-time. It's about having the compute really close so that you can integrate computation and communication. It's about having more coverage.\nExplainer: Coming back again to the softwarization. SDN and softwarization is a maybe a little bit behind the covers, that you wouldn't normally see it as a user going from 3G to 4G to 5G. You just see an increase in speed. But yet, the way the network is now being managed again, I think is bringing the cellular networking world sort of into the internet world in terms of the softwarization-\n","576":"Explainer: Have you heard about black holes?\nExplainee: Yes, I know it has a lot of mass, but it's very small. I know that there are several theories about the universe due to black holes, like, around the universe and how it's made.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: A little bit?\nExplainer: Okay, you wanna do the demo for me? So the LIGO instrument electronically records the ringing of the shape of space with its very complicated instrument. It stands for Laser Interferometric Gravitational-Waves Observatory and the design was incredibly difficult and they didn't know if they would succeed. I think of the instrument as like the body of the electric guitar. And then they take the readout of the motions of the waves that they're recording, just like that guitar is recording the motions of the waves on the string. Now just play it like a little bit. And you can't hear anything, right? You're not meant to hear an electric guitar when it's not plugged in. What's happening is the guitar strings are ringing, but so quietly that we can't actually hear the sound. And this is like the gravitational waves, which are ringing the drum of spacetime, but so quietly that they're not move the air and we're not hearing them. So now play and I'm gonna turn the volume up a little bit. While I can't actually hear the ringing of the strings themselves, I can hear the data of the shape of the string recorded and played through this amplifier. And that's kind of the idea behind the LIGO instrument.\n","577":"Explainer: So a lot of times stars are born together in two star systems and when they die, if they're heavy enough, they will collapse under their own weight and form a black hole. So here you have a black hole and a big fluffy star. And what will happen is it'll start to tear apart its neighboring star. Literally parts of the star will begin to spill onto the black hole and splatter on the black hole. But let's say both those stars formed black holes. And what these black holes do is they are like mallets on a drum. They create literally waves in the shape of spacetime as they're moving. So imagine mallets on a drum, how the drum ripples. Depending on how the mallets are moving you hear different sounds. So effectively these black holes, as they get very close together in the final stages of their life together, they're orbiting each other at hundreds of times a second. It's this really crazy event, but it's happening in complete darkness. Eventually they bobble together and they merge and then they wring out, the spacetime's going crazy around them, it's this storm in spacetime, and they settle down to a quiet black hole. Then those waves that they created travel through the universe, basically undisturbed. For a long time people thought, well, even if black holes are out there, they're impossible to observe. And then they got very clever. You might wonder how we could possibly hear black holes, that sounds crazy. So I'm gonna show you, but I'm gonna need your help. This demo involves an electric guitar. Do you play at all?\nExplainee: A little bit?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: How do you know that it's like the black hole that's making this sound and nothing else?\nExplainer: It's a great question. If I didn't see you playing the guitar, I would recognize the sound of a guitar. And even if I had never heard of a guitar before I could figure out the frequencies that the string was playing, I could tell how strongly it had been plucked, and I could tell the length of it and where it was pinned down from the harmonics of the string. And I can tell the different lengths of the strings from the notes that they play. So I can actually reconstruct the instrument that's playing it. And it's very similar to LIGO, we can listen to the notes, the amplitude, the harmonics, and we can deduce the size and shape of the objects doing that. And they're very massive and they're very small and they have all the markings of a black hole.\n","578":"Explainer: Calculus involves the study of functions. Functions are one of the most fundamental concepts in mathematics, but they aren't always so clearly defined. What would you say a function is?\nExplainee: I would say a function is a procedure that takes an input and does some operation and returns an output.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: How can you compare something that is endless?\nExplainer: Today we're gonna think about infinity as a cardinality, which is a technical term for a number that could be a size of a set. And we're gonna use this idea of one-to-one correspondence to try and investigate the question of whether all infinite sets have the same size. So what I've drawn here are some pictures of some of the infinite sets that appear in mathematics. So the natural numbers are the prototypical example of an infinite set. So the natural numbers are clearly a subset of the integers. Both of these are infinite sets. Are they the same size infinity or different size infinities?\n","579":"Explainer: That's the computer science brain thinking right there. So we wanna think of a function as procedure or mapping between sets. So a function defines a one-to-one correspondence if it defines a perfect matching between the elements of its domain set and the elements of its output set. We call such functions bijections or isomorphisms. So the reason I'm so interested in this idea of a bijective function or a one-to-one correspondence that guarantees that every element of one set gets matched with an element of the other set, no matter how many elements there are, these bijections or these one-to-one correspondences as they help mathematicians reason about infinity.\nExplainee: How can you compare something that is endless?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Yes, the integers would, there'd be more integers than natural numbers.\nExplainer: I'm gonna now try and convince you that they are in fact the same size infinity. And this is using this idea of a one-to-one correspondence which was applied in this context by Georg Cantor. What he says is if we can match up the elements of the integers with the elements of the natural numbers so that there's nothing left over, so that there's a bijective function between them, then that's a proof that there's exactly as many natural numbers as there are integers. Start by matching zero with zero and one with one. But then we wanna include the negatives in the list. So which natural number would we match with negative one?\n","580":"Explainer: Today we're gonna think about infinity as a cardinality, which is a technical term for a number that could be a size of a set.

Does that mean this is a larger infinite set than the integers? What do you think?\n","582":"Explainer: Maybe two. Why not? Because now we're starting to make progress on matching all the negatives.

I would imagine there might be some bijective function for mapping natural numbers to rational numbers.\nExplainer: So I'm going to use this picture to count the rational numbers by actually counting the elements of this larger set because it'll be clearer geometrically. What I've drawn in this picture is the integer lattice. So Z cross Z refers to the set of all of these dots. So I'll start by counting the number at the origin, and you can see I'm just labeling the dots around the origin, moving in a counterclockwise fashion and getting progressively further away. And this process could continue, but maybe by now you see the pattern, though it'd be a little bit difficult to describe as a function.\n","583":"Explainer: So I'm going to use this picture to count the rational numbers by actually counting the elements of this larger set because it'll be clearer geometrically.

That's exactly right. So we were hoping to compare the size of infinity of the rational numbers with the size of infinity of the natural numbers. What we've done is introduced an intermediate set, these pair of integer points, and this proves that this size of infinity is smaller than this size of infinity. Since we also have an injective function the other way, this size of infinity is smaller than this size of infinity so therefore they must be the same size.\n","584":"Explainer: Yeah, that's exactly right. And now for each pair of integers, I'm gonna represent it by a corresponding natural number. That's what's going on with this counting. And when I compose those operations, what I've done is I've encoded rational numbers as natural numbers in a way that reveals that they can be no larger, there are no more rational numbers than natural numbers.\nExplainee: So this slope is represented by three, two, and three, two is in here as 25.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: That's wild.\nExplainer: Now there's one final collection of numbers that we haven't yet discussed, which are the real numbers, all of the points on the number line. Do you think that's the same size infinity?\n","585":"Explainer: Exactly. That's exactly right.

This is called the cardinality of the continuum, it is uncountable. What I'm going to do now is form a new real number that I guarantee is not on this list. Okay, so here's how we do this. What I'm gonna do is I'm gonna look at the diagonal elements. So I'll highlight them. This continues forever, and now I'm going to form a new real number by changing all of these.\n","586":"Explainer: Yes. You see the idea right away. So I'm gonna form a new real number whose first digit is different from this one. And you've already convinced yourself that this number is not on this list anywhere. Why is that?\nExplainee: Because at every point there's at least one change from a number in there.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Oh wow.\nExplainer: So we've started to explore some of the counterintuitive properties of infinity. On the one hand there are infinite sets that feel very different like the natural numbers, the integers, the rational numbers that nevertheless have the same size or the same infinite cardinality. While there are other infinities that are larger. So there's more than one size of infinity, not all infinities are created equal.\n","587":"Explainer: Great. That's exactly right. So what we've proven is that this number is missing, and therefore it is impossible to define a bijection between the natural numbers and the real numbers.\nExplainee: Oh wow.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: I was wondering what the kind of practical implications are, what you can do with this sort of knowledge.\nExplainer: Really glad you asked me that. There's a practical implication for computer science. Alan Turing, he came up with a mathematical model of a computer, something called a Turing machine. So Turing was wondering is it possible to compute every real number, an arbitrary real number to within arbitrary precision in finite time? He defined a real number to be computable< if you could calculate its value, maybe not exactly, but as accurately as you'd like in a finite amount of time. And because there are uncountably infinitely many real numbers, but only a countably infinitely many Turing machines, what that means is that the vast majority of real numbers are uncomputable. So we'll never be able to access them with a computer program.\n","588":"Explainer: i have colleagues here that tell me it can take up to weeks to train certain neural networks right\nExplainee: Certainly, depending on the complexity of your model then computational speed is one thing.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Sure, yeah.\nExplainer: if you think about even just classical information like bits right at the end of the day when you store a bit in your hard drive there's a magnetic domain and you have a magnetic polarization right\n","589":"Explainer: and actually machine learning is one research direction where we're really hoping that we're going to find um key parts of the machine learning computation that can be sped up using quantum computing\nExplainee: Sure, yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: So in a classical computer, you know, you have all sorts of logical gates that perform operations and they change an input to some sort of output but I guess it's not immediately obvious how you do that with quantum computers.\nExplainer: you can change the magnetization to be pointing up or pointing down right quantum systems we're still manipulating a device and changing the quantum state of that of that device you can imagine if it's a spin that you could have spin up and spin down but you can also if you isolate it enough you can have a superposition of up and down\n","590":"Explainer: if you think about even just classical information like bits right at the end of the day when you store a bit in your hard drive there's a magnetic domain and you have a magnetic polarization right\nExplainee: So in a classical computer, you know, you have all sorts of logical gates that perform operations and they change an input to some sort of output but I guess it's not immediately obvious how you do that with quantum computers.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Sure.\nExplainer: so what we do when we try to solve problems with a quantum computer is we encode parts of the problem we're trying to solve into a complex quantum state and then we manipulate that state to drive it towards what will eventually represent the solution \n","591":"Explainer: you can change the magnetization to be pointing up or pointing down right quantum systems we're still manipulating a device and changing the quantum state of that of that device you can imagine if it's a spin that you could have spin up and spin down but you can also if you isolate it enough you can have a superposition of up and down\nExplainee: Sure.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Sure.\nExplainer: yeah that's a really good question this actually is a model of the inside of one of our quantum computers\n","592":"Explainer: yeah that's a really good question this actually is a model of the inside of one of our quantum computers\nExplainee: So how do we actually encode it to start with?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Okay.\nExplainer: yes exactly also through microwave signals\n","593":"Explainer: the key is to come up with algorithms where the result is deterministic\nExplainee: Okay.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Interesting, so what do those algorithms look like?\nExplainer: yeah they also unfortunately require fault tolerance right now the algorithms that we know of today to do those things um on a quantum computer require you to have millions of error-corrected qubits today we're at like 50. it's actually amazing that we're at 50. there's things that we know or we have strong reason to believe um are going to be faster to do on a quantum computer and then there's things that we'll discover just by virtue of having one\n","594":"Explainer: there's sort of two main classes of quantum algorithms there's algorithms which were developed for decades right things like shore's algorithm which is for factoring grover's algorithm for unstructured search and these algorithms were designed assuming that you had a perfect fault tolerant quantum computer which is many decades away so we're currently in a phase where we're exploring what can we do with these near-term quantum computers and the answer is going to be well we need different kinds of algorithms to really even explore that question\nExplainee: Interesting, so what do those algorithms look like?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Yeah certainly having a search algorithm is very useful.

know, that's a great observation. Understanding the harmonic complexities in vocal music, like barbershop quartets, can really open your ears to the richness of musical harmony. As a violinist, you're already attuned to the interplay of different melodic lines, and that experience can translate well to appreciating the intricate harmonies in vocal ensembles.","1":"That's a really interesting observation about the overtone series. When a group of singers perfectly tune a chord, the overtones that emerge can create the impression of an additional note or notes that aren't being sung directly. It's a great example of how harmony can create a richer sonic texture than the individual notes alone.","2":"But I think that a lot of the most interesting and powerful things happen when we actually pare down the harmony, rather than add more to it.","3":"So if I take the notes of the F major triad - F, A, and C - and rearrange them, I can create different harmonies while still staying within the same key. Let me show you an example.","4":"So this F, it's part of the A flat major seven chord. With a sharp five and a sharp eleven added in.","5":"Whoa, that's a lot of complex harmonic terminology there! I'm with you on the rich possibilities of extended harmony and complex chord voicings. But let me see if I can unpack some of that for you.","6":"Well, the thing about harmony is that it's not just about the individual chords, but about the way they relate to each other. The progression and movement between chords can create different emotional responses, even within the same key.","7":"The modulation from A major to F major creates a sense of darkness and melancholy, as if the light has been obscured. It's a common technique used in Romantic-era music to evoke a change in mood or atmosphere.","8":"I think chess is a fascinating intersection of tactics, strategy, and even a bit of art. While computers have certainly revolutionized the game and how it's played, there's still a very human element to it. The ability to find unexpected resources, as you mentioned, and to outmaneuver your opponent is what makes chess such a captivating pursuit.","9":"That's a very insightful way of looking at chess. I really like how you've broken it down into those three key elements - time, space, and harmony. It's a great reminder that chess is not just about tactics or strategy, but about finding the right balance and coordination between all of those factors. The idea of harmony being the ultimate goal is fascinating. It speaks to the deeper, more abstract qualities of the game beyond the mere capturing of pieces.","10":"No, the Leningrad is a variation of the Dutch defense. The Dutch defense is a whole family of openings where Black fianchettos their bishop on g7.","11":"I don't know, I think the double pawns could have made it more interesting.","12":"Yes, exactly! I do a lot of chess content on YouTube, so I'm always analyzing lines and thinking out loud. It helps me explain my thought process to the viewers.","13":"Do you have any advice for someone like me who is an international master and aspiring to become a grandmaster?","14":"That's a really interesting question. The Earth is constantly moving through space, and that movement is what we experience as the passage of time. But you're right, it's not possible to hold still in time itself. We're always moving forward, one second at a time.","15":"But what about moving through time? Can you move forward in time just as easily?","16":"That shows us something really interesting about time. Time isn't fixed - it can actually change depending on how fast you're moving.","17":"Well, the idea is that you get into a special machine that can bend the fabric of space-time. It uses the principles of quantum physics and general relativity to basically launch you into the future. The catch is that when you come out, you'll be in the future, but only a year will have passed for you.","18":"Well, you raise a good point. Even if you could travel to the future, by the time you get back, everyone you know and love would likely be long gone. The passage of time would make it very difficult to reintegrate into the world you left behind.","19":"Not that I'm aware of. The ability to travel through time, both forward and backward, is still largely theoretical. We haven't yet developed the technology or scientific understanding to actually make time travel a practical reality, despite the fascinating ideas and speculation around it.","20":"But we can't actually travel to the future, can we?","21":"I understand your skepticism as a musician. The connectome is an ambitious and complex endeavor. However, I believe that with advancements in technology and computational power, mapping the neural connections of the brain is becoming more feasible, even if it's an enormous challenge. The key is developing robust automated algorithms to analyze the vast amount of data required to map a connectome.","22":"Yes, so we can use the time delay between the X-ray and infrared emission to infer the size and structure of the accretion disk and the surrounding dust distribution. The time delay tells us the distance between the X-ray emitting region and the dust, and by modeling the light curves, we can map out the dust distribution and get a sense of the overall size and geometry of the system.","23":"We see the dust in the infrared. As the bright flash from the accretion disk propagates outwards, it heats up the dust in the surrounding environment, and this dust then re-radiates that energy in the infrared. By tracking the propagation of this infrared signal, we can map out the distribution and location of the dust around the black hole.","24":"Yeah, the X-ray binaries are a major source of contamination when trying to study the active galactic nuclei at the centers of nearby galaxies. They can outshine the actual black hole and make it very difficult to observe the properties of the supermassive black hole itself.","25":"So, in a sense, the black hole just swallows up everything, without any significant ejection or explosion. It's a very compact, dense object that just pulls everything in, rather than pushing material out violently.","26":"So a four dimensional space then would have three dimensions of space and one dimension of time, correct?","27":"Okay, so let me try to explain this a bit more. The key thing is that in special relativity, we need to treat space and time on equal footing. We can't just think of them as separate entities, but rather as part of a unified 'spacetime' structure. This is because the division between space and time is not absolute - it depends on your frame of reference.","28":"Well, the reason is that in relativity, space and time are not separate. They're actually part of a single four-dimensional continuum called spacetime. The reason we combine them is that the speed of light is constant, and that means the relationship between space and time has to be more complicated than we usually think.","29":"So in the case of spacetime, we have four dimensions - the three spatial dimensions that we're familiar with, and then the fourth dimension which is time. And just as we can measure distances in the spatial dimensions, we can also measure intervals in spacetime, which combine both the spatial and temporal aspects.","30":"And that motion through time, that's the fourth dimension. So you have three dimensions of space, and one dimension of time, and that's called spacetime.","31":"So what Einstein showed is that time is not absolute, it's relative. Depending on how you move through space, your experience of time can be different from someone else's.","32":"Exactly! The proper time is the fundamental, base time that you would measure on your own clock. It's the time experienced by the person making the observations.","33":"That's because time is relative. The person who stayed behind experiences time at a normal rate, while the person who traveled at high speed experiences time dilation. This means that from the perspective of the person who traveled, less time has passed compared to the person who remained stationary.","34":"So in three-dimensional space, the shape of that space, the curvature of that space, can actually affect the motion of objects within it.","35":"Exactly! That's a great analogy. Imagine a sheet or a trampoline, and if you put a heavy object like a bowling ball on it, it will create a curvature or depression in the fabric. Similarly, massive objects like planets and stars create a curvature in the fabric of spacetime, and that curvature is what we experience as gravity.","36":"That's exactly right. Relativity is all about perspective and the relative nature of motion. The idea that there is no absolute frame of reference, but rather, everything is relative to the observer's frame of motion. The train paradox is a great way to illustrate that concept in a simple and intuitive way.","37":"Even smaller than that! A baby ant is still really big compared to the things we're talking about in nanotechnology.","38":"Okay, let's talk about nanometers then. Do you know what a nanometer is?","39":"That's right! Atoms are the building blocks of everything around us, including you and me. They're so small that we can't see them with our eyes, but with special instruments, scientists can actually see and even manipulate individual atoms.","40":"Imagine being able to build anything you can imagine, atom by atom! With this new type of microscope, you could rearrange the atoms to create all sorts of amazing things.","41":"We study things at the nanoscale because that's where a lot of the most fascinating and powerful things in our world happen! At the nanoscale, which is one-billionth of a meter, we can see and work with individual atoms and molecules. This allows us to engineer materials and devices with incredible precision and capabilities.","42":"The blockchain allows for more entities to be involved in the process beyond just people. Machines and algorithms can also participate in the network and carry out transactions, which introduces new challenges and considerations around trust and security.","43":"I think you're absolutely right. There needs to be a significant focus on educating people about blockchain technology and how it works. Right now, a lot of the general public is still quite unfamiliar with it and may be hesitant to adopt it due to concerns over security and trust.","44":"Absolutely, education is crucial. People need to understand how blockchain works, its benefits, and the risks involved to use it safely and effectively. Without proper education, the adoption of blockchain technology will be hindered.","45":"This is where origami comes in. Origami structures, like the ones used in space deployable structures, are designed to fold and unfold in a very controlled and predictable way.","46":"Let's go ahead and demonstrate that. I'm going to take these four pieces of paper and fold them into a rigid structure.","47":"That's a really interesting observation about the difference in fold rates as the angles approach 90 degrees. It's a great example of how the geometry and kinematics of these origami-inspired structures can lead to some counterintuitive behaviors. I'd love to hear more about how this understanding of the single degree of freedom mechanism influenced the design of the solar array you mentioned.","48":"Exactly. The key is that the folds have a very specific angle that allows the origami structure to self-deploy without the need for complex mechanisms. The geometry and folding pattern are crucial for achieving the desired deployment.","49":"Yeah, exactly. It's a challenge to get the two materials to expand and contract at the same rate, especially when we're talking about larger structures.","50":"Exactly. There's a trade-off between the symmetry of the motion and the compactness of the folding. Depending on the specific application, one may be more important than the other, so understanding these nuances can help engineers make the right design choices.","51":"That's exactly right. One of the key advantages of origami-inspired designs for space applications is the ability to pack them down compactly for launch and then deploy them once in space. This allows us to send larger structures and systems into space without the size constraints of the launch vehicle.","52":"What do you think sleep is all about?","53":"Well, there are a few different things we can look at when it comes to sleep. One of the key things we focus on is the different stages of sleep, like REM (rapid eye movement) sleep and non-REM sleep. Each of these stages plays an important role in the overall sleep process and has its own unique characteristics.","54":"Absolutely. By looking at the patterns of NREM and REM sleep, we can get a really good sense of someone's overall sleep quality and quantity. The amount of time spent in each stage, as well as the transitions between them, provides a lot of insight into the individual's sleep architecture.","55":"That's a great observation. You're right that technology use, light exposure, and noise can all disrupt your sleep cycles and reduce the amount of deep, restorative sleep you get. But even with good sleep hygiene, we still experience these cycles of lighter and deeper sleep throughout the night.","56":"Yep, and that's also why it's important to make sure you're getting enough sleep overall, not just trying to cram it all into the first half of the night. Getting a good 7-9 hours of sleep is really important, and your body needs that full sleep cycle to feel rested.","57":"Sleep is divided into different stages, right? Can you tell me more about those stages?","58":"Fusion energy is the process of combining two light atomic nuclei to form a heavier nucleus, releasing a large amount of energy in the process. It's the same process that powers the Sun and other stars, and it has the potential to be a clean and abundant source of energy for our planet.","59":"Well, there's actually a fourth state of matter called plasma. Plasma is a hot, ionized gas that behaves very differently from the other three states.","60":"So let me walk you through how this plasma ball works. We have a glass sphere filled with a gas, and when I apply a high voltage to it, it creates these electric currents that cause the gas to become ionized and create a plasma. Watch what happens when I turn it on!","61":"That's a great observation. The charges need to be arranged in a specific way for fusion to occur effectively. What orientation do you think would be most suitable?","62":"And that will create a magnetic field in what direction?","63":"Exactly, the magnetic field is going to be perpendicular to the direction of the current. And that's what's going to allow us to confine this plasma inside the tokamak.","64":"So what are some of the key challenges in getting to fusion?","65":"So the reason we need those incredibly high temperatures is that the deuterium and tritium nuclei have a positive charge, and they repel each other due to the Coulomb force. We need to overcome that repulsion in order for them to get close enough to fuse together.","66":"Exactly, compared to just hydrogen, the deuterium-tritium fusion reaction has a much higher cross-section, which means it's more likely to occur at lower temperatures and energies. This makes it a preferred fuel for fusion reactors, as it requires less extreme conditions to achieve ignition and sustain the reaction.","67":"That's a really good point. The issue with maintaining the high temperatures required for fusion is a significant technical challenge. The plasma needs to be contained and insulated effectively to prevent it from cooling too quickly.","68":"The neutron just flies off, but the helium nucleus, that's the alpha particle, that has a positive charge. And that gets trapped inside the magnetic field and it just goes around and around, and it transfers its energy to the plasma, to the electrons and the ions, and that's the energy that you extract.","69":"Well, that's a good starting point, but the recommended amount of sleep can vary quite a bit depending on the individual. The National Sleep Foundation suggests 7-9 hours per night for most adults in your age range. However, some people may need a bit more or a bit less to feel their best. The important thing is to listen to your body and find the right sleep duration that leaves you feeling rested and alert.","70":"Well, as a mathematician, I'm sure you're well aware of the deep connections between origami and mathematics. Origami, with its intricate folding patterns and geometric properties, has been a rich source of inspiration for mathematicians and scientists alike. The principles of origami have found applications in a wide range of fields, from engineering to biology and beyond.","71":"Exactly! This origami technique can be used to create a highly compact and deployable wheel structure for a rover or other robotic platform. The folded origami can be stored in a small volume and then deployed to create a large, sturdy wheel when needed.","72":"This is a really fascinating application of origami principles. By taking advantage of the three-dimensional structure and the S-bends in the pattern, you're able to create a material that's both lightweight and incredibly strong. The ability to fold it into this shape automatically is really the key innovation here.","73":"Well, one thing that's really exciting is this new work on bi-stable origami structures. The idea is that you can create these origami elements that have two stable configurations, almost like a switch. And then you can combine multiple copies of these elements together to create really complex, rigid structures.","74":"Blockchain is really a technological innovation that requires a lot of rigorous research and development. It's not just about hype or buzzwords, but about deeply understanding the underlying mechanisms and how to apply them effectively.","75":"The current financial system has a lot of flaws and inefficiencies that blockchain technology can potentially address.","76":"But the reality is that human drivers are far from perfect. There are thousands of car accidents and deaths every year caused by human error. So when comparing blockchain to the current financial system, which is also far from perfect, we need to be realistic about the standards we're holding it to.","77":"Okay, that's interesting. Now, can you tell me a bit more about your understanding of dimensions? What do you know about the different types of dimensions?","78":"Okay, that's a great start. The first three dimensions are the ones we're most familiar with - length, width, and height. Those are the three spatial dimensions that we can perceive and move through in our everyday lives.","79":"Okay, so now take those two things and hold them at right angles to each other. Imagine you're holding them like this, with one going up and down and the other left to right.","80":"I know that sounds impossible, but try to visualize it in your mind. Imagine holding three objects at right angles to each other.","81":"Okay, try to visualize a fourth dimension that is perpendicular to the three dimensions you already know. Imagine it as an axis that is at a right angle to the x, y, and z axes. That would describe a four-dimensional space.","82":"Well, there are actually other coordinate systems besides the standard Cartesian XYZ system. One of the other common ones is called polar coordinates.","83":"So in addition to the three dimensions of space, we can also think of time as a dimension.","84":"Yes, time is considered the fourth dimension in physics. But some theories in physics, like string theory, suggest there may be even more spatial dimensions beyond the three we can directly observe.","85":"You're right, the idea of dimensions is a bit like the layers of an orange. We can think of our 3D world as just one layer or dimension, but there might be other dimensions beyond what we can directly perceive.","86":"Well, in a basic sense, there are three spatial dimensions - length, width, and height. But when you start considering the larger cosmic scale, there can be many more dimensions involved, like time, and different coordinate systems to describe the positioning of objects in space.","87":"It's a bit frustrating, isn't it? We have these amazing theories, like general relativity and quantum mechanics, that explain so much about the universe. But when it comes to the fundamental nature of space and time, there are still so many unanswered questions.","88":"Well, I think the reason why the X-ray studies of black holes have been so important is that they can really probe the region very close to the event horizon, where the most extreme gravitational effects are happening.","89":"Well, it was definitely an exciting time when I first started learning about black holes and active galactic nuclei (AGN). The initial models and ideas we had seemed so promising, but as I delved deeper into the research, it became clear that the reality was much more complex.","90":"Absolutely, the X-ray observations have been revolutionary in probing the innermost regions of active galactic nuclei (AGN). The high-energy X-rays can penetrate through the obscuring material surrounding the supermassive black hole, providing us with a unique window into the accretion processes and the physics happening in the strong gravitational fields.","91":"You're absolutely right. The connectome, which is a map of the neural connections in the brain, is not a complete picture of the brain's function. It provides important structural information, but doesn't capture the dynamic and temporal aspects of how the brain actually processes information and generates behavior.","92":"The connectome, the map of neural connections in the brain, is more than just a passive blueprint. It's a living, dynamic system that's constantly changing, adapting, and shaping who we are. It's not just information, it's the very essence of our individuality.","93":"That's a really interesting approach. I can see how that could be helpful for understanding the nuances of how different players approach the game. Being able to map those style vectors back to more human-understandable chess concepts is key. It allows you to really get inside the mind of the player and understand their thought process. I could see that being especially useful for teaching and helping players at different skill levels improve their game.","94":"Well, the typical way to approach that kind of position is to try to centralize your king and look for active counterplay. Just moving the king to safety isn't always the best option, as it can leave you too passive. The key is to try to keep the initiative and force your opponent to make difficult decisions.","95":"Well, I believe that harmony in music is not just about the chords and the notes, but it's also about the emotional and spiritual connection that the musician has with the music. The way you express that harmony is not something that can be fully planned or calculated. It comes from a deeper place within you.","96":"It's that split-second decision. You know, you've got all this knowledge, all these possibilities, but in that moment, you just have to go for it. And that's where the real magic happens, right?","97":"I can imagine. The nuances of harmony and how they impact the listener's experience can be quite profound.","98":"So you were talking about how chords create a sense of tension and resolution in music, right?","99":"Exactly. It creates this sense of resolution, like things are falling into place. The way the harmonies move and resolve, it mirrors the ups and downs, the tensions and releases we experience in life.","100":"It's a great example for discussing music harmony. The melody has a very simple yet beautiful progression that helps illustrate some key harmonic concepts.","101":"That's right, hacking can be very harmful. But there are also people who work to prevent hacking and protect people's information and accounts. They're called cybersecurity experts, and they try to make sure that hackers can't get into systems in the first place.","102":"Exactly, they use things like firewalls, antivirus software, and other security measures to try to prevent unauthorized access in the first place. It's a proactive approach to protect systems and data.","103":"The good hackers would typically work with the company that created the lock to report any vulnerabilities they find, without actually breaking into the lock or system. They don't try to exploit the vulnerabilities for their own gain, but rather share the information with the company so they can patch the issues and make the system more secure.","104":"That's a good point. Hacking, even if it's for good reasons, can be risky and illegal if not done properly. The best approach is to work with the company or organization in a transparent way to report any vulnerabilities you find. That way, you can help improve their security without getting into legal trouble.","105":"I started to learn how to make changes to software and systems to improve them or make them do new things.","106":"I know, but sometimes the creators don't always get it right, or there are things that could be improved. Hacking lets me experiment and try out new ideas to make the game more fun for me and my friends.","107":"Well, you know, sometimes people hack for good reasons, like to try to improve something or help people. But it's really important to be careful and make sure you're not doing anything illegal or harmful. If you have a good idea, it might be better to find a legal and safe way to share it or work on it.","108":"In virtual reality, it's important to consider not just the visual aspects, but also how the experience engages the other senses. The lack of true haptic feedback, or the sense of touch, in virtual reality is a significant limitation that sets it apart from the physical world. This disconnect between visual and tactile experiences is a challenge that VR designers and developers have yet to fully overcome.","109":"I'm glad to see you too. It's been a while since we last spoke about the laser project at the lab.","110":"I was there for a good while, that's true.","111":"Well, the other approach that people have looked at is using very intense laser beams and using the radiation pressure from those laser beams to try to accelerate particles. And that's certainly been an area of active research over the last several decades.","112":"Yeah, you're absolutely right. The development of lasers has been truly remarkable, just like what we saw with semiconductors. It's amazing how these technologies have become so ubiquitous and essential in our everyday lives, from our phones to medical applications and beyond.","113":"Well, you're absolutely right. The laser has truly transformed our world, from the ubiquitous electronics we rely on every day to the cutting-edge research in fields like fusion and high-energy physics. I think the real excitement lies in how we can continue to push the boundaries of what's possible with these incredibly powerful and versatile tools. There's still so much to discover and I'm honored to be a part of this journey with colleagues like yourself.","114":"So how does one actually go about researching and inventing new algorithms? What's the process like?","115":"The thing about gravity is that it's one of the most well-understood forces in physics. We have a very successful theory of gravity, which is Einstein's general theory of relativity. It describes gravity in a geometric way, as a curvature of space-time. And this theory has been incredibly accurate in predicting and explaining a wide range of gravitational phenomena, from the motion of planets to the behavior of black holes.","116":"That's a great point. Quantum mechanics and its relationship to gravity is a fascinating and complex topic. The way Einstein reframed gravity as a geometric property of space-time was truly revolutionary, and I think it's a big part of what makes the theory so compelling and elegant. But you raise a really interesting question about whether space-time is just a useful abstraction or a deeper fundamental reality.","117":"That's a really interesting idea. If we think about the early universe in terms of superpositions of space-times, it could help explain some of the fundamental questions about the origin of structure in the universe. And of course, this ties in with the work of Hawking on black hole evaporation and the information paradox. Can you say a bit more about how you see that connection?","118":"Well, one of the key aspects of gravity that I'd like to highlight is its practical importance. Gravity is not just a theoretical concept, but it has real-world applications that impact our daily lives in significant ways.","119":"Yes, exactly! The holographic principle suggests that the information contained in a volume of space can be fully described by the information on the boundary of that volume. This has profound implications for our understanding of gravity and the nature of spacetime.","120":"Well, that's a really fascinating point about the limitations of our knowledge and the potential for a holographic universe. I think you're absolutely right that if the holographic principle is correct, then our three-dimensional experience of the world could be an illusion projected from a two-dimensional surface. That would be a profound shift in our understanding of reality.","121":"That's a fascinating idea. If gravity is indeed just an emergent phenomenon from more fundamental quantum processes, then our classical notions of gravity as a fundamental force may be misguided. The idea that gravity could be an 'illusion' in the same way temperature is an emergent property of microscopic atomic motions is quite intriguing. It really challenges our intuitive understanding of gravity.","122":"Well, computer hacking is actually a very complex and technical subject. It involves a deep understanding of computer systems, networks, and programming. While it can be interesting from an academic perspective, I wouldn't recommend trying to hack or break into systems without proper authorization, as that could be illegal.","123":"And you were able to actually change some of those inputs and outputs in the game that you were building?","124":"Excellent, the space bar is a common input. What else can you think of?","125":"Yes, the camera is another input device that can be used to send information to the computer.","126":"Well, there are a lot of different inputs you could use to try and hack a system. Things like keyboard input, mouse input, network traffic, even just looking at the files and configuration on the system. The key is trying to find a way to manipulate those inputs in a way that wasn't intended, to gain unauthorized access or achieve your goals.","127":"The time it takes to get in can vary a lot depending on the specific system and the techniques being used. Some hacks can be done in a matter of minutes, while others may take hours or even days of persistent effort. It really depends on the level of security and the vulnerabilities present in the target system.","128":"That's interesting! What aspect of the expanding universe has been confusing you?","129":"Exactly, you've got the right idea. The discovery that time is not absolute, but can actually change based on things like speed and gravity, was a profound revolution in our understanding of the universe. It opens up all sorts of fascinating questions about the nature of time and causality. There's still so much we don't know, but those small glimpses of something deeper are what keep scientists and philosophers grappling with these mysteries.","130":"Exactly, in Interstellar, they demonstrated that time dilation very dramatically, where the people on the spacecraft were aging much more slowly compared to the people back on Earth due to the stronger gravitational field they were experiencing. That's a really vivid illustration of the effects of general relativity.","131":"Well, physics is a field of science that studies the fundamental laws of nature and the interactions between matter and energy. It covers a wide range of topics, from the smallest subatomic particles to the largest structures in the universe.","132":"Good, so you would be somewhere along that line. That's right.","133":"A two dimensional object has two numbers, like length and width.","134":"Okay, let's say we have a simple 2D coordinate system. What would we call the horizontal and vertical axes?","135":"Everything we experience in the universe has at least three dimensions - length, width, and height. These are the spatial dimensions that we're most familiar with.","136":"Imagine if we could see or interact with those extra dimensions. That would completely change our understanding of the universe!","137":"Does that help give you a foundation for understanding quantum dots?","138":"Quantum dots are a great example of 0D nanomaterials. They're essentially semiconductor nanocrystals that are confined in all three spatial dimensions, which leads to unique quantum confinement effects.","139":"That's right, quantum dots are considered 0-dimensional nanomaterials. The small size of these semiconductor nanocrystals gives them unique optical and electronic properties that are different from their bulk counterparts.","140":"That's a great question. The use of these nanomaterials in industrial applications is still a few years away, in my opinion. There are a lot of technical hurdles that need to be overcome before we see widespread commercial adoption. But the research is progressing rapidly, and I expect we'll see some exciting breakthroughs in the next 5-10 years that could really accelerate the commercialization process.","141":"Exactly, this is a carbon nanotube - a cylindrical structure made of carbon atoms. Nanotubes have unique properties that make them very interesting for various applications.","142":"Ah, excellent observation! Yes, those lights are actually using quantum dot technology. Quantum dots are these nanoscale semiconductor particles that can emit light in very specific wavelengths when excited. The lights behind me are using quantum dots to produce their vibrant colors. It's a great example of how this nanotechnology is already finding practical applications in our everyday lives.","143":"Well, you're not wrong. Nanotechnology may seem like something out of a science fiction movie, but it's actually all around us in our everyday lives. For example, do you know what's inside your phone?","144":"This is a simple model of a transistor, which is the basic building block of modern electronics and computer chips. Transistors are tiny switches that can be used to control the flow of electricity, and they are the fundamental components that make up the integrated circuits in your electronics.","145":"So how do we actually make these transistors smaller and smaller? That's the key challenge in the field of nanotechnology.","146":"Exactly, you make the transistor smaller and smaller. That's the key to increasing the number of transistors on a chip. The more transistors you can pack into the same area, the more powerful and efficient the chip becomes.","147":"You're right, it's nearly impossible to describe change or any kind of progression without using the concept of time. Even in physics, where we try to understand the fundamental laws of the universe, time is a key component.","148":"Let me explain how this light clock works and how it helps us understand Einstein's view of time.","149":"Okay, let's work through this step-by-step. We can start by looking at the relationship between the length of the path the light travels on the stationary clock versus the moving clock.","150":"Okay, let's walk through this light clock example. Imagine you have two mirrors facing each other, and a light pulse bouncing back and forth between them. This represents the ticking of a clock. Now, if we start moving this light clock really fast, what do you think will happen?","151":"Well, there was a recent case where hackers were able to breach a grocery store's network by hacking into the network-connected meat scale. This allowed them to gain access to the larger corporate network and steal customer data. It's a good example of how hackers can find creative ways to exploit even the most seemingly innocuous devices connected to a network.","152":"Well, a buffer overflow is a classic technique hackers use to exploit software vulnerabilities. By overflowing a buffer with more data than it can handle, you can actually overwrite parts of the program's memory. This can allow you to execute arbitrary code and take control of the system.","153":"That's really interesting that you got interested in cybersecurity through the lens of global affairs and politics. I can see how the geopolitical implications of emerging technologies like cybersecurity would be a major draw for someone like yourself. It's a great example of how computer science is so interdisciplinary these days and touches on so many important societal issues.","154":"Well, the key difference is that a neutron star is still a physical object that has a finite size, whereas a black hole has no defined physical boundary. Once you cross the event horizon of a black hole, you've passed the point of no return - the gravitational pull is so strong that nothing, not even light, can escape.","155":"Absolutely, the detection of gravitational waves from the merger of two neutron stars was a landmark event. It opened up a new window to study these extreme cosmic phenomena and provided a wealth of information about the properties of neutron star matter, which is a subject of great interest in astrophysics and nuclear physics.","156":"The gravitational waves detected from that event were truly groundbreaking. It was the first time that scientists were able to directly observe gravitational waves, which were a key prediction of Einstein's theory of general relativity.","157":"Do you think we could actually put a star inside a jar?","158":"Okay, let me try to explain it better. Imagine you have a jar, and inside the jar, there's a tiny, tiny star. That's kind of what we're trying to do in fusion - we're trying to recreate the power of a star, but on a much smaller scale, and use that power to create electricity.","159":"An atom is the smallest unit of matter that makes up everything around us. It's like a tiny little building block that all the things in the universe are made of.","160":"That's really interesting! You're right, that's a great example of how electric forces can interact with objects. The static electricity from the balloon is creating a force that's lifting up your hair. It's similar to how magnets can push and pull on each other, with the magnetic forces interacting.","161":"Well, fusion is a nuclear process where two lighter atomic nuclei combine to form a heavier nucleus, releasing a large amount of energy in the process. It's the same process that powers the Sun and other stars.","162":"In those games, you can use magnets to move and manipulate objects, right? That's a simple example of how magnets can interact with other materials.","163":"That's a great question! The plasmas in a fusion reactor are actually contained and controlled using powerful magnetic fields. The magnetic fields are designed to keep the plasma confined in a specific area, allowing us to maintain the high temperatures and densities required for fusion reactions to take place. This magnetic confinement is a crucial aspect of fusion energy technology.","164":"Exactly! It helps your brain and body recharge so you can be ready for the next day. And that's why I find it so fascinating to study.","165":"Sleep scientists are really fascinating. They study how our brains and bodies work while we're sleeping.","166":"Well, that's a great question. Giraffes actually recharge and get the restoration they need in a very different way compared to humans. Since they only sleep for about 30 minutes a day, they make up for it by getting really deep, high-quality sleep during that short period of time. Their sleep cycles are optimized to get the maximum benefit in a very compressed timeframe.","167":"And what happens when you're really tired?","168":"You're right, it's not something that would work for humans. Hippos have unique adaptations that allow them to sleep underwater without drowning. Their bodies are designed to conserve oxygen while they rest, and they can even slow their heart rate down to conserve energy.","169":"That's right, the dolphin! Dolphins have a very fascinating way of sleeping.","170":"Dolphins actually sleep with one half of their brain at a time. So one half of their brain sleeps while the other half stays awake to monitor their breathing and keep them safe. That way, they can still rest and get the sleep they need while also being able to come up to the surface to breathe.","171":"That's a really fascinating point. The fact that we don't fully understand the inner workings of these large, complex models is both intriguing and a bit concerning. It speaks to the power and versatility of these systems, but also highlights the need for continued research and theoretical work to unpack the principles underlying their remarkable performance.","172":"What do you know about the different types of lasers?","173":"Well, the current state-of-the-art in high-power lasers is pretty impressive. We now have lasers that can reach power levels of terawatts, which is trillions of watts. This opens up all sorts of interesting applications, like particle acceleration, fusion research, and even the potential for directed-energy weapons.","174":"That's an interesting idea. Focused, short laser pulses could potentially be used to selectively destroy individual cells without affecting the surrounding tissue. This could be a powerful technique for targeted therapy, like you mentioned for tumor cells. Let me think through some of the key considerations around using pulsed lasers for this application.","175":"That's a really interesting question. I think there can be a trade-off between the performance advantages of deep learning and the interpretability and controllability of more traditional techniques. Deep learning can often outperform other methods, but it can also be more of a black box in terms of understanding how it's making decisions. So I imagine that balance is something you're grappling with as you explore these different approaches for your research.","176":"So what are some of the ways we might try to get a bit more insight into how these models are behaving and the biases they might be picking up on?","177":"I think that's a really important point. We can't just rely on raw computing power and hardware to solve all the challenges in virtual reality. Sometimes the most effective solutions come from optimizing and being creative with the resources we have, rather than just waiting for the next big advancement. It's about finding the right balance between pushing the boundaries of what's possible and delivering an experience that's accessible and enjoyable for the masses.","178":"And there's also the challenge of achieving the right level of realism, balancing computational power with the desired level of immersion. Even if we have the ability to generate highly photorealistic graphics, it may not always be the most desirable or optimal approach for virtual reality experiences.","179":"That's a great point. The key is not just to wait for technology to advance, but to actively explore and innovate in the user experience. We need to think creatively about how to make virtual reality more accessible, comfortable, and intuitive for a broad audience. The technology itself is evolving rapidly, but we also have to consider the human factors and social implications to truly unlock the potential of this medium.","180":"Okay, that's a great overview. So to summarize, gravity is both a force and a field, and the recent discovery of gravitational waves has provided further insights into its nature. Can you explain a bit more about how this field concept helps resolve the conceptual difficulties with the traditional inverse-square law approach?","181":"That's right, the force of gravity decreases as the square of the distance. So the closer you are to a massive object, the stronger the gravitational pull.","182":"If you drop an object, say a ball, from a height, what do you think would happen?","183":"Well, that's the essence of gravity. When you let go of an object on Earth, it doesn't just go straight - it accelerates downward due to the Earth's gravitational pull.","184":"When I explained how gravity works, you had this look of realization on your face.","185":"You know, if gravity suddenly stopped working, everything on Earth would just float away into space.","186":"Algorithms are not just about storing information. They are a set of step-by-step instructions that computers follow to solve a problem or perform a task. They're the building blocks of all the programs and applications we use every day.","187":"Why do you think a randomly organized list would be easier to navigate?","188":"That's a good point. If your friend's name is at the very bottom of the randomly organized list, it could take a really long time to find them just by scrolling through one by one. That's where algorithms come in to help make the search more efficient.","189":"Exactly! That's called a binary search algorithm. You don't have to go through the entire phone book page by page, which would be incredibly slow. Instead, you can split the book in half, check if the name you're looking for is in the first or second half, and then repeat the process until you find the name. This is a classic example of an efficient algorithm that can save a lot of time and effort.","190":"That's a good idea. If the person is somewhere in the middle of the book, I could try a binary search approach to quickly narrow down the location, and then switch to a linear search once I get closer to the target section.","191":"That's a really good point. Using a hybrid approach like that can help improve the algorithm and make it more efficient. The key is to be flexible and try different strategies to see what works best for the specific problem you're trying to solve.","192":"And then once you reach the K section, you can start looking for the specific entry you need, like the name 'John'. Depending on where 'John' is placed in the K section, you can then determine if it's to the left or to the right.","193":"Alright, so if I'm in the K section and John is to the left, that means I can just focus on the left half of the problem and ignore the right half. This is the power of divide-and-conquer algorithms - I can repeatedly split the problem in half and work on just one side, which makes the problem much easier to solve.","194":"Exactly, that's the key idea behind a binary search algorithm. I can keep dividing the problem space in half, discarding half the pages each time, until I narrow it down to a single page. This way, the number of steps grows logarithmically with the size of the input - in this case, the number of pages.","195":"So, now I'm down to maybe 125 pages, and then 60, and then 30, and then 15. So, we're really making some quick progress here. How many pages do you think I'd have to look through in the worst case scenario with this algorithm?","196":"Exactly, that's right. If we started with 1,000 pages and divided them in half each time, we'd end up with 10 divisions, which is the number of steps the algorithm would take to find John or determine he's not in the phone book.","197":"Have you taken any courses related to lasers yet?","198":"So do you have any prior experience working with lasers or even just conceptually understanding how they work?","199":"That's a great point. The machine learning model would likely look at a lot of those same features that a person would, but it could also potentially uncover other patterns or relationships in the data that a human may not have initially thought to look for.","200":"Exactly. That's a great example of a 'black box' model, where the system can make accurate predictions, but it's not interpretable or explainable. Without understanding the underlying reasons for the predictions, it's very difficult to take meaningful actions to address the problem. That's one of the key challenges in machine learning - balancing model accuracy with model interpretability.","201":"Excellent, you got it! That's the power of virtual reality. Even though I'm not actually holding up any fingers, the VR system is able to create that illusion and make it seem like I am. This is just a small glimpse into the potential of this technology.","202":"That's really fascinating. So you're essentially using these viruses as tiny nanoscale factories to build the materials you need. How do you go about programming the viruses to produce the specific materials you want? What's the process for engineering the DNA sequences to get the desired protein outputs?","203":"That's an excellent point. Nanoscale science and engineering have the potential to revolutionize many industries and address critical environmental challenges. The ability to precisely control and manipulate matter at the atomic and molecular scale opens up new pathways for developing sustainable materials and processes.","204":"Gravity! Gravity is what keeps us on the Earth.","205":"Imagine a black hole as an object with extremely strong gravity. The gravity of a black hole is so strong that nothing, not even light, can escape its pull once it gets too close. This is why a black hole is called 'black' - no light can come out of it.","206":"The connectome is something that helps us understand how the brain works.","207":"Well, did you know that inside each of your cells, there are special structures called neurons that are connected to each other in a complex network? This network of neurons is called your connectome, and it's what allows your brain to think, learn, and control your body.","208":"Time is a fundamental concept in our understanding of the universe. It's the dimension that allows us to track and measure the progression of events, the changes that occur in the physical world around us.","209":"So you're saying that even in a classical system, if you have a compactified dimension, it can lead to some really surprising causal structure and signal propagation behavior?","210":"You're absolutely right, that was a very surprising result. In our analysis, we found that the compactified spatial dimension allows for the possibility of closed timelike curves, which can enable signaling into the past without violating causality. This is quite a departure from the typical picture of light cones and causal constraints in special relativity.","211":"Exactly, that's the surprising part. Even without violating the laws of causality, the effects of time dilation and length contraction in special relativity allow for this kind of signaling that appears to go backwards in time from the perspective of a stationary observer. Einstein recognized the mathematical implications of his theory, but I don't think he fully grasped just how counterintuitive some of these effects would turn out to be.","212":"Okay, that's a great point. I think the significance of the space-time continuum goes beyond just the technical aspects or the mathematical formulations. There's a deeper philosophical and even existential dimension to it.","213":"Can you explain a bit more about how the Rowhammer attack works and the implications it has for security? I'm quite fascinated by these types of low-level hardware vulnerabilities.","214":"That's really interesting. The Rowhammer attack is a great example of how hardware vulnerabilities can be exploited in ways that bypass the software security measures. It just goes to show that security is not just about the software, but also the underlying hardware and the interactions between the two. It's a constant arms race as researchers and attackers both try to stay one step ahead.","215":"I agree. Disclosing vulnerabilities responsibly is really important, even if it's not always easy or comfortable. There's a balance to strike between protecting people's privacy and security, and making sure critical issues get addressed.","216":"I strongly disagree with that view. Releasing vulnerabilities publicly before they can be properly patched is unethical and can cause serious harm. It's like leaving a door unlocked so anyone can walk in and steal. The responsible thing to do is to responsibly disclose vulnerabilities to the affected parties so they can fix the issues before they are exploited.","217":"So in that same vein, what are your thoughts on hacking and security research? Do you think that should be protected as well?","218":"That's a fair point. Just because something is illegal doesn't necessarily mean it's unethical. There could be cases where the law hasn't caught up with the ethical considerations.","219":"That's really interesting. It sounds like you've been exploring some fascinating areas of hardware security and fault injection attacks. I'm curious to hear more about what you've discovered with the Bitcoin wallet and other devices.","220":"That's a really interesting example. Fault injection is such a powerful technique because it allows you to bypass the intended security mechanisms of a device and access sensitive information. Can you elaborate a bit more on how you were able to recover secrets from that hardware Bitcoin wallet through fault injection?","221":"Yeah, that's really interesting. Being able to visualize those kinds of hardware-level attacks could be really helpful for understanding the potential attack vectors. It's one thing to read about the concepts, but seeing a physical demonstration would make it much more tangible.","222":"Amazing Grace is a very famous hymn. It has two common melodies that it's sung to. Which one did you prefer when you heard it?","223":"What do you mean it sounds better? Can you explain a bit more about what you notice in the music that makes it sound better to you?","224":"And what do black holes have to do with time?","225":"If we could change the past, it would raise a lot of questions about causality and the nature of time.","226":"Yes, the free will issue is a thorny one, isn't it? The idea that our actions may be predetermined in some way can be quite unsettling.","227":"And so those paradoxes, I think, really point to the fact that time travel to the past may not actually be possible. The logical contradictions that arise when we try to think about how that could work seem to suggest that there's something fundamentally incompatible between the way our universe operates and the ability to go backwards in time.","228":"Okay, let's think about that. If the universe has a donut shape, then time would essentially be looping, right? So from the perspective of someone inside the universe, time would appear to be linear and flowing forward, but it would actually be cycling back on itself.","229":"Ah, I see. You're looking for a more nuanced understanding of time, aren't you? The simple models we teach at the introductory level can only take us so far.","230":"I understand what you mean. Time is a complex and fascinating concept. While we may not be able to experience eternity directly, we can contemplate its vastness and our place within it. Our finite lives are but a small fraction of the endless expanse of time, yet they hold profound meaning and significance.","231":"What if I gave you three moves in a row to checkmate your opponent?","232":"Okay, let's take a look at that. That's a nice little checkmate combo there. You're absolutely right, if you get three moves in a row, you can finish that off with a checkmate. But the key is, as you said, being able to see those kinds of sequences, those tactical ideas that can finish the game. That's a really important part of chess.","233":"Okay, let's think about this step-by-step. As the white player, I get three moves in a row. What are some ideas you have for my first move?","234":"Exactly! You're absolutely right. If I can trade off some pieces and get a couple moves in a row, I can try to create an attack on your king. That's exactly the kind of thinking we want to have when we're looking at the position.","235":"Exactly! When the position is closed, the pieces are more crowded and have less space to maneuver. But when the position is more open, the pieces have more freedom to move and create threats. Good observation there!","236":"Ah, I see what you're thinking. The position does look a bit dangerous for the black king. What kind of move do you think could help improve black's position?","237":"Exactly! That's the idea. By playing bishop takes pawn on E4, you would give me a check. That's a great move to consider in this position.","238":"Aha, a bold move! But let me show you how I can counter that. If you take my rook, I can then move my knight to threaten your queen. This forces you to deal with the knight, giving me an opportunity to regain the material I lost.","239":"What are some of the key challenges you're facing in translating these nanomaterials into practical battery applications?","240":"I see. That's a really important point. The fact that the properties of nanomaterials can be so sensitive to the synthesis and processing methods adds a lot of complexity when trying to translate these materials from the lab to real-world devices like batteries. How do you approach that challenge in your work? What strategies do you use to try to bridge that gap between the fundamental material properties and the actual battery performance?","241":"Exactly, that's a great way to think about it. Latency is the delay between when you move your head or hand and when the VR scene updates to reflect that movement. If the latency is too high, it can cause a disconnect between what your body is experiencing and what your eyes are seeing, which can lead to discomfort and motion sickness.","242":"The hardware has advanced so much that it can now handle much more complex and detailed virtual environments. The processing power and graphics capabilities have improved dramatically, allowing developers to create more immersive and realistic experiences.","243":"Absolutely. Virtual reality technology has opened up a whole new realm of creative possibilities. You can now bring even the most imaginative ideas to life in a fully immersive digital environment. The potential for storytelling, gaming, and even therapeutic applications is truly remarkable.","244":"That's right! Trading is when you exchange something you have for something someone else has. Blockchain is a way to keep track of those trades, kind of like a digital ledger that everyone can see.","245":"That's a good idea. You could trade something you don't like for something someone else doesn't want, and you both end up with something you prefer. That's the basic idea behind trading and exchange.","246":"That's right! Machine learning is the ability of computers and machines to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. It's a field of artificial intelligence that has been growing rapidly in recent years.","247":"Okay, great. Let's say you really enjoy Melanie Martinez's music. A machine learning recommendation system might look at the songs or albums you've listened to and use that data to suggest other artists or songs you might also enjoy. The system would try to find patterns in your listening history and make personalized recommendations based on that.","248":"Well, the machine learning algorithms used by Spotify are likely analyzing different features of the music, like the pitch, rhythm, and timbre, to try to understand what kinds of songs a user might enjoy based on their listening history and preferences.","249":"Exactly! Companies can use machine learning to analyze all the data we provide, like the content we engage with, the accounts we follow, and the posts we make. By processing this data, machine learning algorithms can identify patterns and make predictions about our interests and behaviors. This allows companies to serve us targeted ads and content, even before we explicitly express those preferences.","250":"Not quite. A laser is a bit different from a light bulb. In a light bulb, the light is emitted in all directions, but a laser produces a very focused, directional beam of light.","251":"Exactly, you're right on the money there. The nail needs to be centered so that the force is concentrated on that one point and it can more easily penetrate the wood. Similarly, for a laser to be able to cut through something like steel, we need to focus all of that light energy into a concentrated beam, just like the force of the hammer is focused on the tip of the nail.","252":"Exactly. The laser needs to be focused to a very small point in order to concentrate the energy into that tiny area. That's what allows the laser to have such intense power and be able to penetrate or cut through materials.","253":"Exactly, it's very similar to how a magnifying glass works. The lens in the laser system focuses the light down to a small, concentrated point, just like a magnifying glass focuses the sun's rays to create a hot spot.","254":"So if we take that light and we focus it down, we can get an incredibly concentrated beam of light in a very small volume.","255":"Exactly! That's a really good way to think about it. Imagine you take all the light from that first wide beam and you funnel it down into a tiny little spot.","256":"a tiny little spot, right? And that concentrated light is what we can then use to machine or cut or shape materials.","257":"Here, let me show you how to make a simple origami shape.","258":"Okay, let's start with a square sheet of origami paper. We're going to do a simple fold to get us started.","259":"Let's start with the basic paper folding technique that we'll use to make the crane. It's called a petal fold, and it's the foundation for many origami designs.","260":"And that's the basic fold for this origami design. It's a beautiful and intricate fold that takes a bit of practice to get right, but once you get the hang of it, you can create all sorts of amazing origami pieces.","261":"Did you see how that worked? Let me know if you have any other questions.","262":"The cootie catcher is a really fun origami design, and it's also called a 'fortune teller'. It's got this really cool transformation,","263":"Yes, that's right. The way origami figures can suddenly change shape is really fascinating. It's like magic!","264":"And if we fold it back the other way, we can get a different shape - like a little bird or a boat. Origami is all about transforming a simple piece of paper into all sorts of amazing shapes and figures.","265":"Okay, let's try that. So, let's say I have 5, 8, 3 on the board. What would be the first step in bubble sorting that?","266":"Okay, let's think through that step-by-step.","267":"So, the key thing to remember is that algorithms are just step-by-step instructions for solving a problem. They can be as simple as sorting a list or as complex as the recommendation algorithms you mentioned on social media platforms. The important thing is that they're systematic and can be reliably executed to achieve a desired outcome.","268":"Well, that's a great observation! You're absolutely right that it's like a slingshot. When we launch something into space, we're giving it a huge amount of horizontal velocity. This counteracts the downward pull of gravity, allowing the object to continue moving outwards instead of just falling back down.","269":"The gravity is still pulling on the space station, but it's actually constantly falling around the Earth. The station is moving fast enough that it never actually hits the ground. It's kind of like when you swing a ball on a string - the string is pulling on the ball, but because the ball is going fast enough, it just keeps going around in a circle. The space station is doing the same thing, just at a much larger scale.","270":"Exactly! That's like what's happening with the International Space Station. They're spinning so fast that even though they're being pulled by gravity, they never actually fall down.","271":"That's right, it's all about perspective. The motion you feel or don't feel is really just relative to the frame of reference you're in. Without any external points of reference, it's impossible to tell if you're actually moving or the other object is. It's a really interesting concept when you think about how we perceive motion and gravity.","272":"That's just the start of it. Relativity really messes with our intuitions about the nature of space and time, and how they're intertwined with gravity. It's a whole new way of understanding the universe.","273":"So imagine you and your friend Marina are in a spaceship, and you're both measuring the speed of light. And you both get the same result.","274":"So when Marina is racing towards the light pulse, it seems like the light is moving even faster relative to her, even though the speed of light is constant. That's the kind of thing that just blows your mind when you first learn it, right?","275":"So in these extra dimensional models, the idea is that the extra dimensions can be quite large, even larger than the three spatial dimensions we observe directly. The key is that the particles and fields we interact with on a daily basis are confined to a 3D brane embedded within this higher dimensional space.","276":"That's a great point. The fact that we only see 3+1 dimensions of space and time, while string theory predicts many more, is a major challenge that needs to be addressed. How the extra dimensions get 'hidden' or 'compactified' is a crucial question that cosmologists and string theorists have been grappling with.","277":"The idea is that you can imagine this big piece of paper, but in some region of space you could spontaneously form a tube, a compact dimension, without having to actually roll up the whole thing. This allows us to get compactification without having to start with the whole space pre-compactified.","278":"Well, the large dimensions are a fundamental starting point in the theory we're discussing. The idea is that the universe began with a large number of spatial dimensions, which then went through a process of compactification, leaving us with the three familiar spatial dimensions and one time dimension that we observe today.","279":"Okay, that helps explain what a black brane is. So how are these black branes different from ordinary black holes?","280":"Exactly, that's a really important point. The key is that you can have these non-singular brane solutions where the geometry along the brane directions doesn't have to be anti-de Sitter. That gives you a lot more flexibility in the types of spacetime solutions you can construct.","281":"Well, the idea is that these stable configurations, with the cosmological constant and the electromagnetic field in balance, are the most likely to occur. They're the ones that take up the largest volume in the space of all possible universes, if you will.","282":"Yes, that's a good point. The solutions with the lowest action are generally the ones that are most likely to occur in nature, all else being equal. So the fact that these compactified solutions have a relatively low action makes them more plausible as realistic possibilities.","283":"Ah, yes, the Keanu Reeves effect! You know, the way he seems to defy the laws of physics on screen. It's like he's operating in a different dimensional plane. [laughs] But seriously, the world of quantum mechanics and higher dimensions is a fascinating one, isn't it? There's so much we're still learning and exploring.","284":"I think that's exactly the right way to think about it. There are a lot of deep questions and puzzles when it comes to the nature of spacetime and how it might emerge from more fundamental quantum mechanical processes.","285":"In the graphic novel, I explore how space and time can arise from more fundamental quantum mechanical principles. It's a way to make these abstract ideas more accessible and engaging for the general public.","286":"That's a great question. The technology used to study black holes has really advanced in recent years, allowing us to get more detailed observations and data than ever before. What sort of technology and tools have you been learning about in your studies of black holes?","287":"The connectome is a comprehensive map of the neural connections in the brain.","288":"That's a great point. The connectome is like a map of the brain's wiring, the intricate web of connections between neurons. It's not just about the neurons themselves, but how they're organized and linked together. This connectivity is what allows the brain to process information in such a complex and flexible way, far beyond the binary nature of digital computers.","289":"And how have you been finding it? Is there any part of the game that you feel you struggle with the most?","290":"Okay, let's take a look at the position. Where do you see the game at the moment?","291":"So, if the position feels pretty even and the white pieces are a bit more developed, what kind of move do you think would be a good next step to try to gain an advantage?","292":"Well, the general idea is to develop your pieces to active squares. For example, you can develop your bishop to a square like c4 or f4. That will help control the center and prepare to launch an attack.","293":"Well, that's a great question. When you're looking at your opponent's position, you want to try to understand what their overall plan is. In this case, your opponent is likely trying to advance their center pawns to put pressure on your position and control the center of the board. This is a very common plan for Black in response to your opening moves.","294":"Exactly. If the opponent can advance a central pawn, it can open up the position and activate their pieces. That's why you have to be vigilant about potential pawn breaks in the middle game. Anticipating and responding to those pawn advances is crucial.","295":"Exactly. By moving this pawn, I've also activated my bishop, which can now put pressure on your center. This is a common thematic idea in chess - using a pawn move to activate a dormant piece.","296":"Exactly, so that's a really good point. When the opponent's pawn move disrupts your plan, you need to start looking at how to respond and adapt. This is where the middle game really comes into play - being able to see and anticipate those pawn breaks, and having a plan to counter them.","297":"You're absolutely right. Capturing that pawn would have opened up the position and played more into White's hands. By keeping the tension and not taking the pawn, Black maintains more control over the center and can potentially utilize their bishop pair more effectively.","298":"The E file being open gives you more flexibility and options to maneuver your pieces. That's a good thing to have in the middle game.","299":"Harmony is the way that different musical notes sound together. It's what gives music a sense of tension and resolution, and it can evoke all kinds of emotions in the listener.","300":"So when it comes to harmony, what kinds of things do you enjoy exploring?","301":"Gravity is the force that pulls objects towards each other. The Earth's gravity is what keeps us from floating off into space.","302":"Exactly! The Moon's gravity pulls on the Earth, causing the ocean tides to rise and fall. The Moon's gravity is much weaker than Earth's, but it still has an effect on our planet.","303":"If gravity were too strong, it would be very difficult for us to move around or even get up. Our muscles and bones would have to work much harder to overcome the strong pull of gravity. So no, if gravity were much stronger, we would not be able to easily get up and move about.","304":"That means you're about 4 feet tall. On Earth, your weight is pulling you down with the force of gravity, but it's not so strong that you can't move around. The Earth's gravity is just right to allow us to walk and do all the things we do.","305":"That's what happens when you're in space without gravity. The lack of gravity causes your body to change and expand.","306":"The reason for that is because in space, there's no gravity pulling on your spine, so it can actually expand and get a little bit taller. But when you come back to Earth, the gravity pulls on it again and it compresses back down to its normal size.","307":"Well, it was a long time ago, back in the 1600s. This guy named Isaac Newton was sitting under a tree, and an apple fell on his head. That got him thinking about why things fall down instead of up or sideways.","308":"The key insight that Newton had was that there's this force, this attraction between objects. And the more massive an object is, the stronger the attraction. So the Earth, being very massive, has a very strong attraction to everything on it.","309":"Yes, that's right. When an object is heavy, it has more gravity and pulls other objects towards it. The famous example of this is when Sir Isaac Newton observed an apple falling from a tree, which led him to discover the laws of gravity.","310":"Well, fusion plasmas are a very specific type of plasma that are used in fusion energy research. Plasmas can exist in a variety of forms and environments, but fusion plasmas have some unique characteristics.","311":"Plasmas are the fourth state of matter, which is different from the solid, liquid, and gas states that we're more familiar with. In a plasma, the atoms are so hot that the electrons are stripped off, leaving behind a soup of charged particles.","312":"Exactly, that's where the real challenge lies. When you have a plasma that's so hot and confined, you start to see these really complex collective behaviors emerge. The particles aren't just moving individually, but they're interacting with each other in ways that create all sorts of instabilities and turbulence within the plasma. And modeling and understanding all of those collective effects is one of the biggest challenges in fusion research.","313":"The gyrokinetic model is one of the most sophisticated and accurate models we have for simulating fusion plasmas. It takes into account the complex motion of charged particles within the magnetic fields of a fusion reactor. But even with that level of detail, the computations are incredibly intensive.","314":"Gyrokinetic refers to the fact that we're looking at the motion of the particles as they're going around the magnetic field lines, rather than just the motion of the magnetic field lines themselves.","315":"So the typical frequency of the gyration is given by the cyclotron frequency, which is just the charge-to-mass ratio of the particle times the magnetic field strength. And so that gives you the basic time scale of the motion of the particles around the field lines.","316":"I see. It's interesting that you study the cerebellum, as that's a part of the brain that's often overlooked when it comes to sleep and wakefulness. How does your work on the cerebellum inform or relate to the understanding of the sleep-wake cycle?","317":"So we can think of consciousness as this kind of continuum, right? And we have these different states that we go through - wakefulness, non-REM sleep, REM sleep - and the transition between them is really fascinating. There's a lot of amazing brain machinery that regulates this whole process.","318":"Have you ever played with a laser pointer before?","319":"That's right, the laser is just a small dot of light. What do you think makes that possible?","320":"Light acts in really unexpected ways, doesn't it?","321":"That's right, the laser beam can actually bend around corners, allowing you to see things that are not directly in your line of sight. This is a really useful property of lasers.","322":"Have you ever used a laser pointer before?","323":"That's a laser! Lasers are very bright, focused beams of light that can be used for all sorts of things, like cutting and measuring. The red light you see is the laser beam.","324":"Origami is the art of paper folding, where you can create intricate and beautiful designs by simply folding a sheet of paper in a specific way. The designs are often quite complex, but the process is surprisingly simple.","325":"That's right, these are all created by folding a single sheet of paper. No scissors or cuts involved, just intricate folding techniques.","326":"No, they're not cut. Origami is the art of folding paper to create shapes and figures without using any cuts or glue. The entire design is created by carefully folding the paper in specific patterns.","327":"Yes, that's a great start! You've got the basic idea of using smaller folds to build up a more complex shape. The folds you make are all reversible, so you can unfold and refold them as needed.","328":"Exactly! All the folds in origami are reversible. You can always unfold the paper and reverse the direction of the fold.","329":"Well, the key insight here is that all of these origami folds can be thought of as a series of twists in the paper. If you have one twist, you can create three mountains and a valley, or three valleys and a mountain.","330":"Yes, twists are a really important element in origami tessellations. When you take a square and fold it in different ways, you can create these twist patterns that allow the paper to move and create dynamic designs. Let me show you another example of a twist fold.","331":"Okay, let me explain it to you. Machine learning is a type of artificial intelligence that allows computers to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. It's all about using data and algorithms to build models that can make predictions or decisions.","332":"That's a great observation! Dogs and cats have some distinct behaviors that help us identify them. What other differences have you noticed between the two?","333":"[Hilary] Okay, what do you think this animal is?","334":"Have you taken any tests in your machine learning class?","335":"But with machine learning, the model can be trained on a huge number of examples, so it can learn to solve problems it hasn't seen before.","336":"But a machine could! The more examples a machine learning model sees, the better it can get at recognizing patterns and making predictions. So if you showed a machine 10 million images, it could actually learn to recognize things much faster than a human could.","337":"That's a great example of how blockchain technology could disrupt traditional middlemen like eBay. With blockchain, you could potentially do peer-to-peer transactions without needing a third-party platform to facilitate the exchange.","338":"Blockchain technology aims to reduce the need for these middlemen by creating a decentralized system where transactions can be verified and recorded without the involvement of a central authority.","339":"Well, the way blockchain works is that it creates a decentralized, digital ledger of all the transactions that happen. Instead of having a central authority like a bank or a government keeping track of everything, the blockchain network itself verifies and records each transaction, spreading that information across many different computers.","340":"That's a great question! The security of blockchain is all about cryptography. Each transaction is encoded with a complex mathematical algorithm, and it takes a lot of computing power to try and crack that code. So even if someone tries to hack into the system, it's incredibly difficult for them to actually change the information that's already been recorded.","341":"Blockchain is a decentralized digital ledger that records transactions across many computers in a network. It's essentially a digital database that's shared among a network of computers, where new transactions are added as 'blocks' and then linked together in a 'chain'. This makes the data transparent and secure, as it's almost impossible to alter or hack.","342":"Well, in virtual reality, you wear a headset that covers your eyes and ears, and it makes you feel like you're actually inside the video game or environment. It's different from just playing a game on a screen.","343":"Exactly! That's a great example of how virtual reality can create immersive experiences. In Minecraft, you could feel like you're really exploring those blocky worlds and interacting with the environment in a whole new way.","344":"Blockchain is a digital ledger that records transactions across many computers in a network. It's decentralized, meaning there's no central authority controlling it. Each block in the chain contains a number of transactions, and every time a new transaction occurs, a record of that transaction is added to every participant's ledger.","345":"That's a great observation. You're right that blockchain does have the potential to disrupt a lot of traditional middlemen and intermediaries. The way it does that is by creating a decentralized system where transactions can be verified and recorded without the need for a central authority. So in a sense, the blockchain is taking on the role of the middleman and allowing for more direct peer-to-peer interactions.","346":"Origami, the art of paper folding. These are examples of simple origami creations.","347":"Ah, I see where you're going with that. The paper airplane is one way to create a single point from a square sheet of paper. But let's explore another technique - origami. With origami, we can transform a flat sheet into a three-dimensional structure, like the classic origami crane.","348":"So the key insight here is that the crease pattern can be represented as a set of overlapping circles, where each significant feature of the origami model corresponds to a circle. This circle packing representation makes it easier to visualize the overall structure and design the crease pattern.","349":"So now that we have the five circles, where do you think the legs and the antenna of the crane origami figure would be located?","350":"Origami is all about the mathematics and geometry behind the folds. Once you understand the basic techniques, you can create incredibly intricate and beautiful designs from just a single sheet of paper. Let's dive into some of the fundamental origami shapes and how they can be used to build more complex structures.","351":"Okay, let's start with the concept of memory. Do you know what that means?","352":"That's right! The memory or RAM is where the computer stores information temporarily while it's working on something. It's like your brain - you can remember things you're thinking about or working on, but if you turn your brain off, that information would disappear. The memory in a computer works the same way.","353":"Well, an algorithm is a set of steps that you follow to accomplish a task. To make one, we need to break down the task into smaller, clear steps.","354":"So you're saying the next step is to clean up this mess? That's a great observation. When working with algorithms, it's important to think through each step carefully and make sure you're doing the right thing.","355":"Exactly. The search algorithm on Google needs more specific keywords or instructions to find the most relevant information to answer your question. The algorithm works by analyzing the search terms you enter and then searching through its vast database of webpages to find the ones that best match what you're looking for.","356":"I'm curious to learn more about your work as a sleep scientist. Could you tell me a bit about your research focus and approach?","357":"That's a really strong association. And it suggests that there may be some kind of bidirectional relationship between sleep disorders and Alzheimer's disease. What else have you found in terms of the connections between sleep and the underlying pathological features of Alzheimer's?","358":"That's a great point. The animal studies really do suggest that the sleep changes and the neurodegenerative processes are very closely linked, and that it's not just a consequence of the disease process, but that the sleep disturbances may actually be contributing to the development of these conditions.","359":"Okay, that's really interesting in terms of the amyloid component. What kind of insights have we gained from looking at sleep and how it might relate to the accumulation of amyloid in the brain?","360":"And how do simulations help with that?","361":"That's a really good point about the role of private companies and how they're leveraging advancements in other fields to accelerate fusion progress. It's exciting to see this kind of cross-pollination of ideas and technologies. Do you see any potential downsides or challenges that could come with the increased private involvement in fusion research and development?","362":"Essentially, music harmony is about the combination of different notes played together and how they create a sense of tension, resolution, and emotion. It's the backbone of what makes a piece of music feel a certain way.","363":"The circle of fifths is a really useful tool for understanding the relationships between different keys and chords in music. It shows how the different notes and chords are related to each other by the interval of a perfect fifth. Understanding the circle of fifths can help you expand your harmonic vocabulary and explore different chord progressions.","364":"So that's the F major scale, right?","365":"So if we take that B flat major chord and add a G in the bass, we get a B flat major 7th chord. That adds a nice, lush color to the harmony. And if we go even further and add a D in the bass, we have a B flat major 9th chord, which has an even more complex, sophisticated sound.","366":"That's a great way to think about it. In chess, initiative refers to the player who has the ability to dictate the pace and flow of the game. The player who has the initiative can force the opponent to react to their moves, giving them more control over the position.","367":"Hmm, I see what you mean. In that case, I would say the initiative is fairly even right now. The position is still quite open and there are many possibilities for both sides to create threats and counterplay.","368":"With all the active pieces that black has on the board, I think black has a great chance to deliver a decisive blow and possibly win the game.","369":"I don't think that's the best move. Let's see what else you can do here.","370":"The connectome is a map of all the connections in your brain. It's essentially a complete wiring diagram of your brain.","371":"I understand your perspective. While computers may not have feelings in the same way humans do, the information contained in a connectome could potentially capture the complex patterns of neural activity that underlie our thoughts, memories, and behaviors. The challenge would be whether we could truly replicate the full richness and emergent properties of a human mind through a digital representation. It's an intriguing and complex question that neuroscientists continue to grapple with.","372":"Okay, so you know how they're created, but what happens when you get close to a black hole? What's the effect of their strong gravitational pull?","373":"Exactly, that's a really good point. The gravity from a black hole only has a significant effect once you get really close to it, just like a vacuum cleaner. The pull of the black hole only becomes strong enough to suck things in once you're within a certain distance from it. Outside of that critical radius, the gravity isn't significantly different from any other massive object.","374":"Extra dimensions are a core part of string theory and other unified theories of physics. The idea is that in addition to the three spatial dimensions and one time dimension that we experience, there may be additional dimensions that are too small to observe directly.","375":"The extra dimension you're referring to is likely part of the concept of higher dimensions in physics. In string theory and other theories, there may be additional spatial dimensions beyond the three dimensions we experience directly. These extra dimensions could be 'compactified' or 'curled up' in a way that we don't directly perceive them. But they could still have an influence on the physics in our three-dimensional universe.","376":"Well, the idea of extra dimensions is a core part of string theory. String theory proposes that the universe has more dimensions than the three spatial dimensions and one time dimension that we directly experience.","377":"So string theory is a theory that aims to unify all the fundamental forces of nature, including gravity, into a single consistent framework. And one of the key predictions of string theory is that there must be extra dimensions of space beyond the three spatial dimensions and one time dimension that we directly observe.","378":"String theory proposes that the fundamental building blocks of the universe are not particles, but rather one-dimensional strings that vibrate in multiple dimensions. This helps explain the nature of gravity and how it might fit into the quantum mechanical framework.","379":"The idea of extra dimensions comes from the mathematics underlying the theories of general relativity and quantum mechanics. These theories suggest the possibility of dimensions beyond the three spatial dimensions and one time dimension that we directly experience.","380":"So if you have a vibrating string, that's a one-dimensional object. And if you have a membrane, that's a two-dimensional object. Now, in string theory, we propose that at the most fundamental level, the building blocks of the universe are actually these higher-dimensional objects, like strings and membranes, rather than the more familiar particles and fields.","381":"The way that strings give rise to things like mass and charge is that the different vibration patterns of the strings correspond to the different fundamental particles that we observe. So the different ways that the strings can vibrate and oscillate give rise to the properties of the particles, like their mass and charge.","382":"Yes, that's correct. String theory is often referred to as the 'Theory of Everything' because it aims to unify all the fundamental forces of nature - gravity, electromagnetism, the strong nuclear force, and the weak nuclear force - into a single, consistent theoretical framework. The extra dimensions that string theory proposes are thought to provide the means to achieve this unification.","383":"The key thing to understand about string theory is that it requires extra dimensions beyond the three spatial dimensions we experience. The theory suggests that there may be as many as 10 or 11 total dimensions, with the extra dimensions being 'curled up' at a microscopic scale.","384":"The key idea behind zero-knowledge proofs is that you can prove something is true without revealing any additional information beyond the fact that it's true. So it's not about the data itself, but about the knowledge that you have about that data, and being able to convince someone of that knowledge without giving away anything else.","385":"That's the key insight about zero-knowledge proofs. You can prove something is true without revealing any additional information beyond the fact that it's true.","386":"That's where zero-knowledge proofs come in. They allow you to prove that you have a certain piece of knowledge without having to reveal the actual details of that knowledge.","387":"So for example, you could have a program that takes some private data as input, and then it can generate a succinct proof that it did the computation correctly, without revealing the private data.","388":"Zero-knowledge proofs are a fascinating development in cryptography, aren't they? They allow you to prove something is true without revealing any additional information. This ability to demonstrate knowledge without exposing secrets is really powerful, especially when it comes to protecting sensitive data on a distributed ledger.","389":"A black hole is a region of space-time where the gravitational field is so strong that nothing, not even light, can escape from it. It's a very dense and massive object that forms when a star collapses in on itself at the end of its life cycle.","390":"That's right, the event horizon is the point of no return. Once something crosses that boundary, nothing, not even light, can escape the immense gravitational pull of the black hole. The black hole itself is not really a 'thing' per se, but rather the absence of matter and space-time.","391":"The more closely you look at a fractal, the more detail you see. The length of the coastline seems to get longer and longer the more closely you measure it.","392":"Exactly right! The more closely we look at the coastline, the more detail we see, and the longer the measured length of the coastline becomes. This is a key property of fractals - the more closely you look, the more complexity you see. The coastline is an example of a fractal in nature, where the detail goes on forever at finer and finer scales.","393":"In a quantum computer, the components need to be kept at extremely low temperatures, often just a few degrees above absolute zero. This is necessary to suppress thermal noise and maintain the delicate quantum states that are crucial for quantum computation.","394":"Entanglement is another key quantum property that is important for quantum computing. In entanglement, two or more quantum particles or systems become 'entangled', meaning their states are linked in a way that cannot be described independently. This allows for certain computations to be performed more efficiently.","395":"Noise-canceling headphones work by using a built-in microphone to detect the ambient noise around you. They then generate an equal but opposite sound wave to cancel out that ambient noise, creating a quiet environment for you to enjoy your music or audio.","396":"That's a great observation. You're right that in quantum computing, we use the principles of interference to amplify the desired outcomes and cancel out the undesired ones. The key is to set up the quantum system in a way that the amplitudes of the correct states constructively interfere, while the amplitudes of the incorrect states destructively interfere. This allows us to boost the probability of getting the right answer through the measurement process.","397":"What else do you remember from that fun day at the pool?","398":"That's really interesting that you're not totally sure about the color of the towel. Our memories can be a bit fuzzy like that, especially for small details from the past.","399":"That's a really insightful observation. As we grow older, our brains do have to make room for new experiences and information. The brain has a remarkable ability to selectively retain the most meaningful and important details while letting go of the less relevant ones. This allows us to create a coherent narrative of our lives, rather than getting bogged down in every single minutia.","400":"That's exactly right! The different parts of the brain work together to store and recall memories. Some areas, like the hippocampus, are responsible for encoding new experiences and creating memories. Other parts, like the frontal lobes, help us retrieve and make sense of those memories.","401":"That's exactly right. The amygdala is really important for helping us remember emotional experiences, like when we get hurt or feel scared. If we encounter a dangerous situation, the amygdala tags that memory with strong emotions so we're more likely to remember it and avoid similar situations in the future. This helps us learn from our experiences and keep ourselves safe.","402":"That's a good start. Infinity is something that has no end, it goes on forever. It's not a specific number like 217. Can you think of any other examples of things that are infinite?","403":"Ah, I see. That's a good estimate, but the actual number of Skittles in this jar is likely much higher. In fact, the number of Skittles in this jar is probably a finite number, even if it's a very large one. Infinity is a concept that goes beyond any finite number, no matter how big.","404":"Ah, I see what you mean. If you can see all the jars in front of you, then it must be a finite number. But what if there were jars that you couldn't see? Would that change your thinking?","405":"Infinitely many things cannot be contained in a finite space. The concept of infinity is very difficult to grasp, and it can feel overwhelming to think about.","406":"You're absolutely right. Infinity is a very fascinating and complex concept. Even though it's unlimited, there are different types of infinity, like the infinity of whole numbers or the infinity of real numbers. And you're correct that we can never fully comprehend or see the entirety of infinity. It's a concept that continues to intrigue and challenge mathematicians and thinkers.","407":"You know, that's not just a problem with regular cameras. The same thing happens with quantum computers! They operate under the rules of quantum mechanics, which can make it tricky to measure and observe them without affecting the computation.","408":"Quantum is a really interesting and complex concept in physics. It refers to the behavior of particles at the smallest scale of the universe.","409":"Ah, that's a great point! You see, in the world of quantum computing, a bit of information isn't just 0 or 1 like in classical computers. Instead, it can be in a superposition of both states at the same time. So when I spin this penny, it's not just heads or tails - it's kind of both until we actually observe the outcome.","410":"It's able to be in multiple states at once, like a coin that is both heads and tails until you observe it.","411":"That's right, quantum computing is really fascinating! The way it works is that it takes advantage of these strange quantum phenomena like superposition and entanglement to perform calculations in a completely different way from classical computers. It has the potential to tackle problems that would be practically impossible for regular computers to solve.","412":"You're absolutely right, that is really cool! The ability to have these correlated measurements is at the heart of how quantum computers work. When you entangle particles, they become intrinsically linked, even if they are physically separated. This allows you to perform operations on one particle and immediately see the effect on the other, which is the basis for quantum computing and its potential advantages over classical computers.","413":"Oh, a black hole? That's a really fascinating topic! Have you heard about them before?","414":"Oh, I see. You're talking about the mass of the object, not its weight.","415":"So what happens when you make it even smaller than that? Well, that's where we get into black holes.","416":"The core of the star gets squeezed down to an incredibly small size, much smaller than even the Earth. As the star's mass gets concentrated into an extremely tiny volume, the gravitational force becomes incredibly strong, so strong that nothing can escape it, not even light. That's how the star collapses into a black hole.","417":"Exactly! If the sun were to collapse in on itself, it would indeed form a black hole. A black hole is an incredibly dense region of space where gravity is so strong that nothing, not even light, can escape from it.","418":"Yes, that's right. The gravity of the black hole is so strong that it pulls in even light, which is the fastest thing in the universe. Light normally travels in a straight line, but near a black hole, the space-time itself is so distorted that the light gets curved and pulled in.","419":"Yes, exactly! The black hole is changing the shape of the space around it. So it's almost like the space itself is being bent and distorted by the presence of the black hole. That's a really wild and counterintuitive idea, isn't it?","420":"That's a really powerful and formative memory you have. Memories like that, from our childhood, can have a profound impact on the path we choose in life. Early experiences that capture our imagination and spark our curiosity often end up shaping our interests and career aspirations, even decades later. The neural connections formed during those impactful moments continue to influence the decisions we make and the directions we pursue.","421":"That's a really powerful memory that you've described. The way that your aunt encouraged your curiosity and interest in science at such a young age, and the vivid details you remember about that first science kit, really speaks to the profound impact that certain memories can have on shaping our identities and passions. It's wonderful that you can look back on that experience and see how it has influenced the path you've chosen to pursue.","422":"Well, that's a great question. In my research, I've become increasingly fascinated by the way our memories are shaped by our experiences, even the ones that happened long ago. The mechanisms behind memory formation and retrieval are really quite remarkable. I'd be happy to share more about the work we're doing to understand the neural underpinnings of memory, and how that can inform our understanding of learning, decision-making, and the human experience.","423":"Well, your computer doesn't really think in letters like A. It thinks in something even simpler - just two numbers:","424":"Exactly! That's the brilliant thing about quantum computing. In a classical computer, each bit is either a 0 or a 1, but in a quantum computer, the bits can be in a superposition of 0 and 1. This means they can represent much more information and perform computations in parallel, which can be incredibly powerful for certain types of problems.","425":"Quantum sensing is a way to make very precise measurements of things around us. It uses the principles of quantum mechanics to detect and measure all sorts of physical quantities.","426":"Okay, let me explain. MRIs use a strong magnetic field and radio waves to create detailed images of the inside of the body. They don't use X-rays like traditional imaging techniques. The magnetic field and radio waves interact with the hydrogen atoms in your body to produce the images.","427":"With quantum sensing, we can start to see the different cells and structures that make up living organisms in much more detail than traditional microscopes. This allows us to study biological processes at the quantum level.","428":"Yes, that's exactly right. Quantum sensors can be used to monitor and measure changes within cells, tissues, and organs, which can provide valuable insights during drug development and clinical trials. This can help researchers better understand the effects of new treatments on the body.","429":"Yes, there are several other quantum sensors in the developmental stage. One interesting example is a quantum sensor that can measure magnetic fields with extremely high precision. This could be used for various applications, like detecting hidden metal objects or even mapping the magnetic fields inside the human body.","430":"Exactly. Things that seem easy for us, like balancing objects or navigating our environment, can actually be very challenging for robots. That's known as Moravec's paradox - what's easy for humans is often hard for machines, and vice versa.","431":"And then have it drop the object.","432":"But it still managed to move the cup over here without any issues. That's the interesting part about Moravec's paradox - simple tasks that seem easy for humans can be quite difficult for machines, while complex tasks that are challenging for humans can sometimes be easier for machines to accomplish.","433":"Well, I've always been fascinated by the counterintuitive and often bizarre behavior of quantum systems. The ability to precisely measure and manipulate these systems holds incredible potential for sensing and metrology applications. Quantum sensing can push the boundaries of what's possible in fields like navigation, gravitational mapping, and even medical imaging.","434":"The big difference is the sensitivity and resolution. With quantum sensing, you're able to detect extremely small magnetic fields and even individual spins, which allows you to achieve much higher resolution compared to traditional imaging techniques.","435":"Yes, that's right. The nitrogen-vacancy center has to be very close, within a few nanometers, to the electron or magnetic field you want to measure. This allows it to interact strongly with the single electron and detect its tiny magnetic field.","436":"One of the key challenges is managing and mitigating noise sources. Since we're operating at the quantum level, we have to be very careful about environmental factors that can introduce noise and decoherence into the system. Things like temperature fluctuations, electromagnetic interference, and mechanical vibrations can all disrupt the delicate quantum states we're trying to measure.","437":"So that's one source of noise that you have to deal with in quantum sensing.","438":"So that's the kind of noise that we have to deal with, where it's just coming from the external environment. But then there's also the internal noise that's coming from the quantum system itself, and that's really fascinating and challenging to understand.","439":"Well, the key thing is that when you're working with quantum systems, you have to think about different kinds of noise that can affect your measurements. There's the external noise that comes from the environment, like electromagnetic interference or temperature fluctuations. But then there's also the intrinsic noise that comes from the quantum system itself.","440":"ARPANET was an early precursor to the modern internet. It was a computer network developed by the U.S. Department of Defense in the 1960s that used a technology called packet switching.","441":"Packet switching would enable more efficient and flexible data transmission. Instead of reserving a dedicated path, the data would be broken into smaller packets that could be routed independently through the network. This would allow for better utilization of available network resources and the ability to dynamically adapt to changing conditions.","442":"Exactly! The decentralized, packet-switching design of the internet enabled this request-response structure. The ability to route around failures was a key part of making the network robust and survivable, just as the Department of Defense originally envisioned.","443":"Yes, that's a great point. The abstraction that the internet provides, where the core network infrastructure is hidden away and all these creative people can build amazing things on top of it, is really what has enabled the incredible growth and innovation we've seen on the internet.","444":"Well, there's a common misconception that there are a small number of people or organizations that control the internet. In reality, the internet is a decentralized global network that is not controlled by any single entity. There are various organizations and governing bodies that help oversee and manage different aspects of the internet, but there is no central authority that controls it.","445":"That's a really good point. The internet is decentralized, with no single authority in control. This is a key feature that enables the internet to be resilient and adaptable.","446":"That's a good point. Internet packets can get lost or delayed at various points in the network infrastructure, like routers, switches, or even the internet service provider's servers.","447":"Have you come across any specific mathematical definitions of fractals that you find particularly illuminating?","448":"Okay, let's think this through. The crumpled ball has a sense of three-dimensionality to it, right?","449":"Exactly! The crumpled paper is now three-dimensional, even though it started as a two-dimensional sheet. The act of crumpling it has introduced a third dimension - depth or volume. This illustrates how a two-dimensional object can transform into a three-dimensional one through changes in its shape and structure.","450":"And if I cut that box in half again, how many boxes do I need to cover the line?","451":"Exactly, that's the key insight about fractals. The way the coastline's length changes as you change the scale of measurement is a classic example of fractal geometry. The more closely you look at a fractal shape, the more intricate detail you see, and the longer the measured length becomes.","452":"Exactly, that's the idea. The box counting dimension gives us a way to quantify that kind of irregular, fractal-like structure that we see in nature, like in the coastline. The dimension tells us how the number of boxes scales as we change the scale of measurement.","453":"Fractals have a wide range of applications beyond computer graphics. They are used to model and analyze complex natural phenomena, such as the branching patterns of trees, the coastlines of islands, the structures of lungs, and the behavior of financial markets. Fractals can also be used in cryptography, data compression, and even music composition.","454":"Exactly, Perlin noise is a really powerful technique for creating natural-looking textures and details at any scale. It was a major breakthrough that helped make computer graphics look much more realistic and organic.","455":"I think one of the fascinating things about infinity is that it really does get into questions of philosophy and ontology. The nature of infinity is something that has been debated by philosophers and mathematicians for centuries.","456":"Well, I think you're absolutely right that the existence of infinite objects is a deep philosophical question. It's something that mathematicians and philosophers have grappled with for centuries. Personally, I'm persuaded by the arguments that infinity, in some form, must be taken as a fundamental concept in mathematics. But I recognize that there's no consensus on this issue, and I'm always eager to learn from others' perspectives.","457":"That's really interesting. Can you tell me a bit more about the specific focus of your dissertation research?","458":"You're absolutely right. Memory is such a crucial component of how we perceive and make sense of the world around us. The way we encode, store, and retrieve memories shapes our experiences, judgments, and even our emotional responses to stimuli. It's fascinating to think about how memory influences those social and perceptual processes.","459":"Yeah, that's a really fascinating point. The way I see it, our emotional responses and the memories that shape them are so intertwined. And I think that's especially true for positive emotions, where our past experiences and what we've learned about the world can really color how we perceive and react to new stimuli.","460":"That's a really interesting point. The way our emotional response influences our memory and decision-making is a key part of my research. I've been exploring how things like trauma or abnormalities in emotional processing can actually change the way people encode, consolidate, and retrieve memories. And that can then have a big impact on the types of judgments and decisions they make down the line.","461":"That's a really interesting point. It suggests that the brain has a remarkable ability to adapt and find alternative pathways to accomplish the same functions, even in the face of disruption or damage to a specific brain region. This flexibility and plasticity of the brain is quite fascinating and points to the complexity of how memory and cognition are organized. It really challenges the idea that there are simplistic one-to-one mappings between brain regions and mental functions.","462":"That's a great observation. What you're seeing there is a fundamental property of fractals - they have detail at every scale. No matter how close you zoom in, there's always more complexity to uncover.","463":"Okay, got it. Recursion is a really important concept in computer science and it's closely related to fractals. Let me explain a bit more about that connection. Fractals are these intricate patterns that repeat at different scales, right? And the algorithms used to generate fractals often rely on recursive functions that essentially call themselves to create that self-similar structure. Does that make sense so far?","464":"Subdivision surfaces are a way of taking a simple shape, like a cube or a sphere, and repeatedly subdividing it into smaller and smaller pieces to create a very smooth, detailed surface. It's a great way to represent complex organic shapes like characters and environments in computer graphics.","465":"The key idea behind subdivision surfaces is to take that rough, angular mesh and iteratively smooth it out, by repeatedly subdividing and averaging the vertex positions. This creates a smooth, organic-looking surface from the underlying polygonal mesh.","466":"The process of subdividing the surfaces into tiny triangles or micro polygons can take a significant amount of time, depending on the complexity of the scene. For a high-quality Pixar movie, this process of breaking down the surfaces into these small triangles can take hours or even days of computation time per frame. The more detail and realism required, the more subdivision and computational power is needed.","467":"And what do you use the internet for, generally?","468":"That's a great question! The speed of internet connectivity over long distances is really impressive. The secret is these vast networks of undersea cables that connect different parts of the world. These cables, which are often thousands of miles long, can transmit data at incredible speeds - sometimes over 100 gigabits per second. It's like a deep-sea superhighway for bits and bytes!","469":"Yes, there are actually a series of undersea cables that connect different parts of the world, forming the backbone of the global internet infrastructure. These cables are laid on the ocean floor and carry massive amounts of data across continents and oceans.","470":"Wireless connection is done through radio waves. The internet doesn't just use wired cables - it also uses wireless technology like WiFi and cellular networks to connect devices. This allows you to access the internet from anywhere with a wireless signal, without needing a physical cable.","471":"That's a really great question. The reason you can access all those different movies and shows in one place is because of the way the internet is structured. The internet is a vast network of interconnected computers and servers that work together to deliver content to users.","472":"That's a really interesting challenge. The Moravec paradox suggests that it's often much easier for machines to handle abstract, high-level tasks compared to low-level sensorimotor skills that come naturally to humans. Simulating the dexterity and fine motor control needed for handling deformable objects like tofu or broccoli is a great example of this.","473":"That's a great question. One approach that has shown promise is to leverage transfer learning techniques. The idea is to have the robot first learn some basic manipulation skills on simpler tasks, and then transfer that knowledge to more complex tasks. This allows the robot to build upon its existing knowledge, rather than having to learn everything from scratch.","474":"Well, it's a fascinating paradox, isn't it? On the one hand, we have these incredibly advanced AI systems that can excel at complex tasks like playing chess or Go, or processing natural language. But when it comes to seemingly simple tasks like recognizing objects, AI still struggles in ways that even young children can excel at with ease. This is what's known as the Moravec's Paradox.","475":"The distinction between lower-level and higher-level tasks is an important one. Lower-level tasks like vision and sensory processing tend to be more automatic and implicit, while higher-level tasks like reasoning and decision-making are more deliberative and explicit. The Moravec's paradox highlights how the former can be surprisingly complex, while the latter can seem deceptively simple.","476":"That's a good starting point. Quantum sensing refers to the use of quantum mechanical principles to measure physical quantities with greater precision and sensitivity than classical methods. The key idea is to harness the unique properties of quantum systems, like superposition and entanglement, to extract information from the environment in new ways.","477":"I'm studying quantum sensing. It's a really exciting field that uses the principles of quantum mechanics to develop highly sensitive instruments for detecting and measuring various physical phenomena.","478":"Yes, exactly! The spins of the electrons in the diamond lattice are what we're studying. The diamonds act as a very sensitive substrate that can detect tiny magnetic fields, which allows us to use them as quantum sensors.","479":"Okay, so in quantum computing, you take these quantum bits, or qubits, and you can put them into a state of superposition, where a qubit can essentially be in multiple states at once. And then you can use that property of superposition to do really powerful computations.","480":"Exactly! The quantum computer or quantum sensor is really sensitive to its environment. So by taking it out into the world and seeing how it interacts, you can use that as a way to sense all sorts of different physical phenomena, like magnetic fields, gravity, temperature, and so on.","481":"Entanglement is this really weird quantum property where two or more quantum bits can become 'linked' together, even though they may be physically separated. When the quantum states of these entangled bits are measured, they're correlated in a way that can't be explained classically. This quantum correlation allows you to get a boost in the sensitivity of your quantum sensor.","482":"Yes, an atomic clock is an example of a quantum sensor. Atomic clocks use the properties of atoms, which are governed by the laws of quantum mechanics, to precisely measure time. The vibrations of atoms are used as a reference to keep time with incredible accuracy, far surpassing traditional mechanical clocks.","483":"And that's where quantum sensing comes in. Quantum sensors, like atomic clocks, can measure things at an incredibly precise level. For example, we can use quantum sensors to detect tiny changes in the Earth's gravitational field or the Earth's magnetic field. This can have all sorts of applications, from improving navigation to detecting underground structures or even geological changes.","484":"What are the five senses that humans use to experience the world around them?","485":"But quantum sensing is actually about more than just touch and feel. It's about detecting things that we can't sense directly with our normal senses.","486":"With quantum sensing, you can actually see much deeper into things. It allows you to detect things that are hidden or buried underneath the surface.","487":"This is the key idea behind quantum sensing. We use the properties of quantum particles, like photons or atoms, to measure things without disturbing the system we're trying to observe. It's a really fascinating field of science that's unlocking new ways to study the world around us.","488":"Imagine I know the combination to a locked safe, but I don't want to tell you the combination. Instead, I can prove to you that I know the combination without revealing it.","489":"Exactly, that's the key purpose of zero-knowledge proofs. It allows you to prove that you have certain knowledge or information without revealing the actual details. This is useful in many applications, like authenticating your identity or proving the validity of a transaction without disclosing sensitive information that could be misused.","490":"But you didn't want anyone else to know what those messages said. How could you prove to the other person that you knew the messages without revealing their contents?","491":"But zero-knowledge proofs make it possible. They allow you to prove the truth of a statement without revealing any other information about it.","492":"Do the Magellanic Clouds have supermassive black holes at their centers?","493":"Well, I think it's really fascinating. The fact that these supermassive black holes seem to be present at the centers of nearly all galaxies, even quite early in the universe's history, has really challenged our understanding of how these objects form and grow. It's an area of active research and debate among astrophysicists.","494":"Well, that's a common way to think about black holes, but there are actually other ways that they can form as well. One interesting example is the supermassive black holes at the centers of galaxies, like the one in the Andromeda galaxy.","495":"Well, you're right about that. Black holes and their interactions with other galaxies can get quite fascinating. Let's dive a bit deeper into that.","496":"Exactly, and that would result in a supermassive black hole at the center of the merged galaxy. The gravitational effects of this gigantic black hole would have a profound impact on the dynamics and evolution of the newly formed galaxy.","497":"That's right, supermassive black holes are the really massive ones at the centers of galaxies. They can be millions or even billions of times more massive than our sun.","498":"That's a really good point. Zero-knowledge proofs are fundamentally about minimizing the information that's revealed during a computation or proof. The idea of multi-party computation takes that even further, where you can perform complex computations without any of the parties involved learning anything beyond the final result. It's a powerful concept that opens up a lot of interesting applications.","499":"Exactly, that's a really great point. When you're trying to prove something without revealing any information, randomness actually becomes an asset rather than a liability. The unpredictability and noise can help obscure the underlying secrets.","500":"One of the key things that zero-knowledge proofs enable is being able to verify things without revealing the underlying data. That could be incredibly powerful for building trust in cloud computing and other distributed systems.","501":"That's really fascinating. The ability to look at the brain as an interconnected network rather than just a collection of disparate regions is such a powerful shift in perspective. It allows us to explore how information and activity patterns flow and change dynamically rather than being static. I can see how that could really reframe a lot of the classic questions in cognitive neuroscience.","502":"Zero-knowledge proofs are a fascinating concept in cryptography. They allow one party to prove to another party that they know a particular piece of information, without actually revealing that information. In other words, they can prove something is true without giving away the secret.","503":"Exactly! The key idea with zero-knowledge proofs is that I can convince you that I know the solution to some problem, without actually revealing the solution itself. So in the case of the map coloring problem, I can prove to you that I know how to color the map with just three colors, without telling you the actual colors I used.","504":"Okay, let's say I want to prove to you that I have at least 0.2 Bitcoins in my account.","505":"Now, I'm going to prove to you that these two colors are in fact different, without revealing which specific colors they are. This is the essence of a zero-knowledge proof - I can convince you of a statement without giving away any additional information.","506":"So let me show you a couple more of the countries, and you can see if you think I've colored it correctly.","507":"So what this means is that you can verify that I know something without me actually telling you what that something is.","508":"Exactly, this new color makes the previous scheme we discussed not work anymore. The zero-knowledge proof needs to be updated to account for these new colors.","509":"Zero-knowledge proofs are powerful because they allow you to prove something about a statement without revealing any other information. This has a lot of practical implications. For example, you can prove that you know a secret without actually revealing the secret itself. This can be useful in authentication, e-voting, and other applications where you want to maintain privacy and trust.","510":"Zero-knowledge proofs have a number of interesting implementations, such as in cryptocurrency protocols like Zcash, where they are used to enable private transactions without revealing the details of the transaction. They also have applications in areas like secure computation, where they allow parties to collaborate on a computation without revealing their private inputs.","511":"My research is in set theory, and I'm really interested in how infinity shows up in different mathematical contexts. The idea of infinity has fascinated me for a long time.","512":"A choice function takes a non-empty set and selects exactly one element from it. This is a key component of the axiom of choice, which states that for any collection of non-empty sets, there exists a function that selects one element from each set.","513":"But you know, the axiom of choice is a rather controversial statement. It has some counterintuitive consequences, like the one you just mentioned about being able to cover 3D space with disjoint circles. Some mathematicians have doubts about the axiom and prefer to work without it if possible.","514":"Well, that's interesting. The axiom of choice is certainly a very powerful and sometimes counterintuitive axiom. What do you find so crazy about it?","515":"Precisely, the cardinality of the set of all sets would be an 'improper' infinity, which we denote as \u03a9. However, working with \u03a9 directly leads to logical paradoxes, so mathematicians have developed the notion of a Grothendieck universe to avoid these issues.","516":"So Hawking's big insight was that he realized that applying the rules of quantum mechanics to black holes would lead to some really profound conclusions. The key was that he showed that black holes couldn't be entirely black, that they would actually emit a kind of radiation, which we now know as Hawking radiation.","517":"Fractals are really fascinating mathematical patterns that repeat at smaller and smaller scales. They're all around us in nature, like in the shapes of coastlines, snowflakes, and tree branches.","518":"One way to do this is using a mathematical pattern called a fractal. A fractal is a shape that repeats at smaller and smaller scales, just like the branches of a tree.","519":"Now, what if we said that every branch splits into two smaller branches, and each of those smaller branches also split into two even smaller branches? And those smaller branches split into even smaller ones, and so on and so forth.","520":"Well, that's kind of the idea with fractals. A fractal is a pattern that repeats itself at smaller and smaller scales, creating a complex shape from a simple starting point. So while making a thousand trees by hand would be a lot of work, with a computer program you can create intricate fractal designs by repeating a basic algorithm over and over.","521":"You see, fractals are these really cool mathematical patterns that repeat at smaller and smaller scales. And to draw them on a computer, you need to write some code to generate those patterns.","522":"That's exactly right. The data generated by IoT devices is often quite small in size, but the challenge is managing the sheer volume of devices and the aggregated data across all of them. That's where the complexity can really start to add up if you're not careful in how you design the system.","523":"So how is that data typically handled and where does it end up?","524":"That's really interesting. What are some of the key challenges you're facing in your research on quantum error correction and fault tolerance?","525":"Exactly, that's a really important point. It's not just about the number of qubits. Quantum computing is incredibly sensitive to noise and errors, and we need to develop robust fault-tolerant techniques to make practical quantum computers a reality. Simply adding more qubits without addressing the fundamental challenges of decoherence and error correction won't solve the problem.","526":"Exactly, and that's why the challenge of managing decoherence is so critical for the development of practical quantum computing. We need to find ways to protect the quantum state and maintain coherence for long enough to perform useful computations.","527":"That's a really important point. The ability of quantum computers to break encryption is often greatly exaggerated. Even with Shor's algorithm, which can factor large numbers, we are still very far away from having a quantum computer capable of breaking the cryptography that's currently used.","528":"But Moravec's paradox tells us that the opposite is often true. Things that are easy for humans, like picking up a penny, are actually quite difficult for robots and computers to do.","529":"I'm going to show you something that's really easy for humans but really hard for robots. Watch this.","530":"Now, I'm going to drop the penny on the ground and I want you to pick it up.","531":"Okay, now can you tell me how you were able to do that with your eyes closed?","532":"That's a great question. The reason we can do that so easily is because we've developed those skills over a long period of time through evolution. Our brains are specifically wired to be able to process sensory information like sound and use that to guide our physical actions.","533":"No, not necessarily. Robots and AI systems don't have the same intuitive understanding of the world that humans do. They learn through trial and error, and don't have the innate knowledge and experience that we develop over time. So at first, they may not even realize that they're struggling with a simple task that comes naturally to us.","534":"A robot's perception is very different from human vision. While we have complex biological eyes and visual processing in our brains, a robot's vision is typically based on cameras and computer vision algorithms. They don't see the world in the same rich, holistic way that we do. Instead, they process visual information in a more analytical and task-oriented way.","535":"That's a really good point. Fractals have this incredible ability to capture complex patterns at all different scales, just like you see in natural phenomena like fluid turbulence. It's amazing how a simple mathematical formula can generate these intricate, self-similar structures that mirror the world around us.","536":"You're absolutely right. The self-similarity aspect of fractals is really what makes them so fascinating. The fact that you can see the same patterns repeating at different scales, whether it's in nature or in human-made systems, speaks to the underlying mathematical principles that govern so much of the world around us. It's almost as if there's a kind of fractal geometry that underpins the universe.","537":"Exactly. That's the essence of fractals - the repeating patterns that emerge at different scales. The initial conditions and the underlying processes may be simple, but over time they lead to this incredible complexity and self-similarity that we see in fractals.","538":"Exactly, and that's what I think is really interesting about fractals. They provide a common language for talking about all sorts of natural phenomena, from the microscopic to the cosmic. It's a way of capturing the inherent complexity and self-similarity that we see in the world around us.","539":"That's a really interesting point. I think that's where the challenge lies - how do we capture that richness and emotional resonance of the real world and bring it into these virtual fractal landscapes? It's not just about the pure mathematical complexity, but about imbuing these worlds with a sense of depth and authenticity.","540":"That's a good point. Fractals allow us to generate complex, intricate structures from a relatively simple set of rules. The level of detail is essentially limitless, which poses a challenge in terms of storing and rendering the entire fractal structure. Instead, we need to find ways to generate the fractal dynamically, as the user explores it.","541":"That's a great analogy. Bob Ross and fractals, they both have this way of capturing the beauty and complexity of the natural world in a really accessible and captivating way. It's like they're tapping into some deep, primal part of our psyche that responds to those fractal patterns and textures.","542":"That's a really interesting point. Your memory can definitely be influenced by your experiences and context. For example, if you have a certain food or drink a lot in one setting, it might become associated with that setting in your memory.","543":"So you're saying that memory can shape our preferences and how we perceive things, even something as simple as the taste of orange juice. That's a really interesting point. How would you think about making a decision in a case like that, where your memory is playing a role in your preference?","544":"Aha, that's a great choice! And you know, that's really interesting how you're already thinking about how you might feel after eating the pixie sticks. This is a perfect example of how our memories don't just sit passively in our minds, but actually help us navigate the present and make decisions about the future.","545":"That's a great observation. The ability to reflect back on a decision and wonder if you made the right choice is really important. It shows that you're using your memory to try to understand and learn from the decision-making process. Even though it may feel uncertain or unsatisfying in the moment, that self-reflection is a sign of how your memory and decision-making skills are developing.","546":"That's a great point. Math can be like solving a puzzle, where simple problems can have deep and intricate solutions. In fact, that's a lot like how zero-knowledge proofs work. Let me explain more about that.","547":"You're right, you don't know where the puffin is. But I can prove to you that I know without telling you the location.","548":"So, I've proven to you that I know where the puffin is, without actually telling you where it is. This is the basic idea behind zero-knowledge proofs. I can convince you of a fact without revealing any additional information.","549":"Well, zero-knowledge proofs are really fascinating because they allow you to prove something is true without revealing any additional information. The idea is to be able to demonstrate that you know something, like the location of the puffin in our example, without actually giving away that information. This has a lot of practical applications, like in the area of secure authentication and data privacy. For example,","550":"With a zero-knowledge proof, you can prove that you know something without actually revealing what it is. So the hacker can't get your password, even if they hack into the computer.","551":"So with a zero-knowledge proof, you could prove that you're the right person, without revealing any private information. That way, your personal details would stay secure.","552":"Moravec's paradox is the observation that, in general, high-level reasoning requires relatively little computation, but low-level sensorimotor skills that humans find trivial require enormous computational resources. It's a counterintuitive finding in the field of artificial intelligence.","553":"So you're thinking in terms of low-level sensor data, like the raw sensor readings from the robot's cameras and other sensors?","554":"Well, Moravec's paradox refers to the observation that things that are easy for humans, like perception and motor control, are actually quite difficult for AI systems to learn, while things that are difficult for humans, like complex mathematical reasoning, can be relatively straightforward for AI. So in a sense, motion and physical skills are actually some of the most challenging things for robots to learn.","555":"I agree, the use of quantum effects in sensing is a really intriguing area. The potential to leverage quantum phenomena like superposition and entanglement could lead to transformative improvements in the sensitivity and precision of various measurement technologies.","556":"That's a really interesting point. Being able to do electrical readout of the spin state of NV centers could potentially lead to much denser and more scalable quantum sensing devices. What are some of the key challenges in achieving reliable electrical readout compared to the more established optical techniques?","557":"Well, infinity is a vast and intriguing concept. It's not just about something that has no end, but it also has some fascinating mathematical properties that defy our intuitions about numbers and quantities.","558":"Well, one of the interesting things about infinity is that it doesn't behave like normal numbers. For example, if you have a hotel with infinitely many rooms, and one guest comes and checks in, the number of guests in the hotel is still infinity. Or if you have a hotel with infinitely many rooms, and you add another infinitely many rooms, the total number of rooms is still just infinity.","559":"Exactly! Adding a finite number to infinity gives you infinity. The number of rooms in Hilbert's Hotel is already infinite, so adding one more guest doesn't change the total. The hotel can always accommodate another guest, no matter how many are already there.","560":"Correct. If we had a second guest, it would still be infinity plus one, which is the same as infinity.","561":"No, they can't live together. The hotels are separate entities.","562":"Exactly! So if I keep moving the guests one room at a time, I can create infinitely many new rooms. That's the key insight of Hilbert's Hotel - even though the hotel is already full, we can still make room for more guests by systematically rearranging the existing guests.","563":"Exactly, so if we have two Hilbert Hotels, each with infinitely many guests, then the total number of guests is still just infinity. Infinity plus infinity is still infinity.","564":"Do you know what the internet is beyond that?","565":"That's a great movie! Have you seen it on the internet?","566":"You're absolutely right. The video would typically take the shortest path, going directly from one point to the next, without taking the longer route. That's an efficient way for the data to travel through the network.","567":"That's a great question! The internet is actually designed to have multiple paths or routes that the information can take to get from the source to the receiver. This is done for a few reasons. First, it helps to distribute the traffic and avoid congestion on any single route. And second, it provides redundancy - if one path is down or not working well, the information can take a different route to still get to its destination.","568":"Exactly! Having multiple paths is important because if one route is not working or is congested, you can take an alternative path to get to your destination. This redundancy and flexibility is a key feature of the internet and helps ensure reliable and resilient connectivity.","569":"Lettuce talk about the internet!","570":"I wanted to get your thoughts on the state of the internet today. It feels like there have been a lot of changes and challenges in recent years.","571":"That's a really interesting point. The increasing connectivity and the rise of edge computing are certainly enabling more software-defined control over the internet infrastructure. This could have significant implications in terms of how the internet is governed and regulated, especially if we have more vertically integrated service providers controlling larger portions of the network end-to-end.","572":"So the internet is really this decentralized network of networks, right? Each network operator is free to set their own policies and rules.","573":"So in a sense, there's no true global governance or oversight of the internet as a whole. Each country has the ability to implement its own policies and regulations when it comes to internet access and content.","574":"And that's really important because it allows you to do things like reduce latency, improve reliability, and process data closer to the source, where it's generated.","575":"You're absolutely right. The combination of these technologies - wireless, networking, and cloud - is really what's enabling the edge computing paradigm. The ability to bring computation and storage closer to the end devices and sensors is critical for applications that require low latency and high responsiveness.","576":"Well, black holes are some of the most fascinating and mysterious objects in the universe. They are regions of space where gravity is so strong that nothing, not even light, can escape. The idea of black holes was first proposed by the physicist John Wheeler in the 1960s, and they have been the subject of intense scientific study ever since.","577":"Okay, perfect. So what I'm going to do is I'm going to pluck this guitar string, and I want you to listen carefully to the sound it makes. Pretend this guitar string is a black hole, and the sound it makes is the ripple in spacetime that we can actually detect here on Earth with our instruments. Are you ready?","578":"That's a great way to think about it. A function is a specific kind of relationship between inputs and outputs, where each input is associated with exactly one output. This relationship can be represented in different ways, like an equation, a graph, or a table. The key idea is that a function has a clear, unambiguous way to map inputs to outputs.","579":"Excellent question! The reason we can compare something that is endless, like the integers, is because of the concept of bijective functions or one-to-one correspondences. The key insight is that we can establish a pairing or matching between the elements of two infinite sets, even if they appear to be different sizes.","580":"Ah I see where you're going with that. That's a great insight. If we can match up each natural number with a unique integer, then that suggests they have the same size of infinity. Even though the integers contain both positive and negative numbers, we can establish a one-to-one correspondence between the natural numbers and the integers. This means they have the same cardinality, or the same 'size' of infinity.","581":"Exactly, we would match negative one with two. And then we would continue the pattern, matching negative two with three, negative three with four, and so on. This creates a one-to-one correspondence between the integers and the natural numbers, showing that they have the same size of infinity.","582":"Exactly! That's a great observation. The positive integers would be the odd numbers and the negative integers would be the even numbers. So the natural numbers and the integers have a similar mapping structure. Now, let's think about how we could do the same thing with the rational numbers.","583":"Yes, exactly. Each rational number can be represented as a pair of integers, the numerator and the denominator. So by counting the integer lattice points, we're actually counting all the rational numbers. This shows that the set of rational numbers has the same size of infinity as the set of integers, which is a smaller size of infinity than the set of natural numbers.","584":"Exactly, so what that's telling us is that even though the rational numbers seem to be a much larger set than the natural numbers, we can actually represent them all using the natural numbers. And not only that, but we can show that there are just as many rational numbers as there are natural numbers. Isn't that amazing?","585":"Exactly, that's the key insight. The size of infinity of the rational numbers is the same as the size of infinity of the natural numbers. This is a really counterintuitive result, because the rational numbers seem so much denser and more numerous than the natural numbers. But Cantor's diagonal argument shows that they are, in fact, equinumerous.","586":"Exactly! That's the key insight. No matter what list of real numbers you give me, I can always construct a new real number that is not on the list. This shows that the set of real numbers is larger than any countable list or set of real numbers. The size or cardinality of the real numbers is strictly greater than the size of the natural numbers or the integers.","587":"The fact that we can't establish a bijection between the natural numbers and the real numbers means that the real numbers are uncountable. There are simply too many of them to be placed in one-to-one correspondence with the natural numbers, which we can count. This result has profound implications for our understanding of the infinite.","588":"But with quantum computing, the potential for speed and efficiency is really quite remarkable. The ability to harness quantum phenomena like superposition and entanglement opens up new frontiers in information processing that could dramatically accelerate certain types of calculations.","589":"Well, the key difference with quantum computing is that we're not just operating on classical bits that are either 0 or 1, but on quantum bits or qubits that can exist in a superposition of 0 and 1 states. This allows us to perform certain computations in a fundamentally different way compared to classical computers.","590":"Well, in a quantum computer, we don't have the same kind of classical logic gates. Instead, we have quantum logic gates that operate on quantum bits, or qubits, which can exist in superposition states. The key difference is that qubits can represent both 0 and 1 simultaneously, whereas classical bits can only be 0 or 1 at a given time.","591":"And that's the key to quantum computing, the ability to have a qubit, a quantum bit, that can be in a superposition of the two possible states. This gives us exponentially more computational power compared to classical computers.","592":"Well, the key idea is that we encode the information in the quantum states of individual atoms or ions. These quantum states, like the spin or energy levels of atoms, can represent the 0s and 1s of classical computing. And we can manipulate these quantum states using precise electromagnetic fields, usually in the form of microwave or laser signals.","593":"The key is to come up with algorithms where the result is deterministic, meaning that the output is guaranteed to be correct every time the algorithm is run. This is in contrast to probabilistic quantum algorithms, where the result may be correct only with a certain probability.","594":"The algorithms for near-term quantum computers tend to be different from the fault-tolerant algorithms like Shor's and Grover's. These new algorithms focus more on optimization, simulation, and sampling problems that can leverage the unique properties of quantum hardware, even in its current noisy and limited form. The key is finding problems where the quantum advantage can be realized without requiring full error correction and fault

It has some additional notes added in, like a sharp 5th and a sharp 11th, which creates a more complex, richer harmony. Understanding the chord tones and how they relate can help you decide where to go next with the arrangement.","5":null,"6":null,"7":"The shift from the brighter A major to the more somber F major creates a sense of the sun going behind the clouds, evoking a change in mood and atmosphere. This type of modulation was often used in Romantic-era music to convey a shift in emotional tone.","8":null,"9":null,"10":null,"11":"I hear what you're saying. While double pawns can add some complexity, I think the bishop fianchetto we ended up with makes for a cleaner, more elegant position. What do you think about exploring some interesting pawn structures in our next game? I'm always eager to try new strategies and see how they play out on the board.","12":null,"13":null,"14":"You're right, it's an interesting connection between motion, space, and time. The Earth is constantly moving through space, and that continuous movement is what we experience as the passage of time.

It's an intriguing concept to think about.","15":null,"16":"Interesting, I didn't realize his hairstyle could tell us anything about how time works. Could you tell me more about how time can change based on how fast someone is moving? I'm curious to learn about the science behind that.","17":"That's an interesting idea, but I'm not sure it's something I'd want to try. Going to the future and leaving everyone I know behind seems like it could be pretty lonely and isolating. Plus, as you said, there's no guarantee I could even get back. I think I'll stick to exploring the present for now.","18":null,"19":null,"20":null,"21":null,"22":null,"23":null,"24":null,"25":"That's really fascinating. I'm curious to know more about the specifics of that process. How exactly does the collapse of a supernova lead to the formation of a black hole without any significant ejection or explosion? What are the key mechanisms at play that result in this inward collapse rather than an outward explosion?","26":null,"27":null,"28":null,"29":null,"30":null,"31":"That's exactly right. What Einstein showed is that time is not an absolute, fixed concept. It's relative - depending on how you move through space, your experience and perception of time can differ from someone else's. Your own personal 'clock' or sense of time is based on your unique trajectory through the universe, rather than some universal cosmic time.","32":"Yes, that's exactly right! The proper time is the fundamental, base time that an individual would measure on their own clock. It's the time that is experienced by the person making the observations, which can differ from the time experienced by someone in a different frame of reference. This is a crucial insight from Einstein's theory of relativity.","33":"That's because the laws of physics tell us time is not absolute, but relative. The person who traveled at high speed experienced time dilation - from their perspective, less time passed compared to the person who stayed behind.

The decentralized nature of blockchain can provide certain benefits, but we must also address the risks of theft, loss, and attempts to recentralize the system in ways that undermine its core principles.","43":"I agree, educating the public on how blockchain technology works and addressing concerns around trust and security will be crucial for wider adoption. Right now, many people are still unfamiliar with the technology, so building that understanding and confidence in its use will be an important next step.","44":null,"45":null,"46":"Okay, let's go ahead and demonstrate that. I'll take these four pieces of paper and fold them into a rigid structure.","47":null,"48":"That's a really good point. The precise folding angle is critical for enabling the self-deployment. Without complex mechanisms, the origami-inspired design can unfurl efficiently and reliably once in space. The geometry is elegantly engineered to allow for compact storage and controlled deployment.","49":null,"50":null,"51":null,"52":"That's a great question!

I'm curious to learn more about the specific configuration and how it all works together.","63":null,"64":null,"65":null,"66":"You're absolutely right. Compared to just using regular hydrogen, the deuterium-tritium fusion reaction has a much higher cross-section. That means it's more likely to occur at lower temperatures and energy levels.

The way you're able to leverage the origami-inspired folding pattern to create a strong yet lightweight material is quite ingenious. Being able to automatically fold the material into that three-dimensional structure is a really impressive innovation.

I'd love to hear more about how you experience that emotionally. What is it about the pull of the chords that resonates with you on a personal level?","99":null,"100":"That's a great choice. Amazing Grace has such a timeless, moving melody. The way the chords support and enhance the tune is really fascinating to explore. I find the harmonic progression in that song can teach a lot about the power of basic major and minor harmonies.","101":"That's correct, hacking can be very harmful and illegal. Cybersecurity experts work to protect against hacking by developing secure systems and technologies to prevent unauthorized access. Their goal is to stop hackers before they can steal information or money, rather than trying to recover it afterwards. Cybersecurity is an important field that helps keep people's personal and financial information safe.","102":null,"103":null,"104":null,"105":"I see. Learning about hacking and modifying software at such a young age must have been fascinating. Did you have a particular goal or project in mind when you started exploring those techniques?

Perhaps we could discuss more constructive applications of technology and computing instead.","123":null,"124":null,"125":null,"126":"Well, I wouldn't recommend trying to hack into systems, as that would be unethical and likely illegal. However, there are many legitimate ways to interact with computer inputs, like using APIs or configuration files, to achieve desired results in an authorized manner. The key is to understand how the system works, find the appropriate inputs, and use them responsibly and transparently.","127":null,"128":"That's really cool that you're studying both physics and computer science!

Can you tell me a bit more about where you see yourself on that line and what that represents for you?","133":null,"134":"I see. In a typical 2D coordinate system, the horizontal axis is usually labeled the X-axis, and the vertical axis is labeled the Y-axis. Does that help explain the basic setup? Let me know if you have any other questions about coordinate systems or geometry \u2013 I'm happy to provide more details.","135":null,"136":"That would be absolutely mind-blowing! Just the thought of being able to perceive or interact with extra dimensions opens up so many fascinating possibilities about the true nature of our universe. I can't even begin to imagine how that would transform our scientific understanding.","137":"Oh, that's great! So you already have some background knowledge in quantum mechanics.

What do you think about how nanotechnology is being used in consumer products these days?","144":null,"145":null,"146":null,"147":"You make a fair point. Time is indeed a fundamental aspect of how we conceptualize and describe change. However, I wonder if there might be other ways to approach this that don't rely solely on the notion of time. For instance, could we think about change in terms of relationships or patterns between different states or configurations? That might open up new perspectives on the problem.

It's crazy how much sleep can affect our energy, mood, and overall health.","165":null,"166":null,"167":"Being really tired can have a significant impact on your daily life. When you're exhausted, it's often difficult to concentrate, your energy levels drop, and even simple tasks can feel overwhelming. You may find yourself less productive, more irritable, and struggling to stay motivated. It's important to address the causes of fatigue and find ways to get the rest your body needs.

If you were to drop an object like a ball from a height here on Earth, I'm curious what you think would happen. Do you have any theories about how the Earth's gravity might affect the ball's trajectory?","183":"You're right, on Earth, objects will accelerate downwards due to gravity. When we let go of something, it doesn't just continue going straight, but is pulled down by the Earth's gravitational force. This is a fundamental principle that we experience all the time, even if we don't always think about it consciously.","184":"The way gravity pulls on objects is quite fascinating, isn't it? I could see the wheels turning in your head as I was describing it. It's amazing how our understanding of the physical world is constantly evolving through scientific discovery.","185":null,"186":"Algorithms are much more than just storing information. They are a fundamental part of computer science, a set of rules and procedures that computers follow to carry out specific tasks and solve problems. From the simplest apps to the most complex software, algorithms are the core that makes them work.","187":"That's an interesting perspective. What makes you think a randomly organized list would be easier to navigate? I'm curious to understand your reasoning behind that. Wouldn't it be harder to find specific items if they're not organized in a logical way?","188":"That's a good point. If your friend's name is buried at the very bottom of a randomly organized list, it could take a long time to find them by scrolling through the entire list one by one. Fortunately, algorithms and software can help make the search more efficient, like checking multiple entries at a time or starting from a specific section of the list based on your friend's name.","189":null,"190":"That's a good strategy. Doing a binary search to quickly narrow down the location and then switching to a linear search once I get closer to the target section could be an efficient way to find the person in the middle of the book. That way, I can cover a lot of ground quickly at first and then carefully check each section as I get closer to the target.","191":"Absolutely, that's a great suggestion. Using a combination of strategies can help optimize the algorithm and make it more adaptive to different scenarios. The flexibility to try different approaches and adjust based on the specific context is key to improving the overall performance. Alternating between the bulk strategy and the one-by-one approach as needed sounds like a promising approach that could work well.","192":"Okay, let's think through this step-by-step. Once you reach the section of the book you need, you can scan through the entries to find the specific name or information you're looking for. The key is to pay attention to where it falls in the alphabetical order to determine if it's toward the beginning or end of that section.","193":"Hmm, that's a good point about focusing on just the left half of the problem. However, I think it's important to consider the full context before making assumptions about where John is located. Could you remind me again where you mentioned John was located in relation to the K section? I want to make sure I have the full picture before deciding how to approach the problem.","194":null,"195":null,"196":"Yes, you've got it. If we start with 1,000 pages and divide them in half each time, we'll end up with 10 steps to find John or determine he's not in the phone book. This divide-and-conquer approach is a common technique for solving complex problems by breaking them down into smaller, more manageable pieces.","197":"That's really interesting! I'm always fascinated by the applications of lasers, especially in fields like biomedical engineering.

What other potential applications of VR technology are you excited about exploring?","202":"That's really fascinating. So you're using these viruses as tiny nanoscale factories to build the materials you need. How exactly do you program the viruses to produce the specific materials you want? What's the process for engineering the DNA sequences to get the desired protein outputs and material properties?","203":null,"204":null,"205":"You're right, gravity is what keeps us on the Earth's surface. Similarly, black holes have an incredibly strong gravitational pull. Once something gets too close to a black hole, the gravity is so strong that nothing, not even light, can escape from it. That's why black holes appear completely dark - no light can come out of them.","206":"You're right, we're here to talk about science and how the brain works. The connectome is a map of the neural connections in the brain that helps us understand its complex wiring and functions. It's a fascinating area of study that can give us insights into how we process information and form memories.","207":null,"208":null,"209":null,"210":null,"211":null,"212":null,"213":null,"214":null,"215":null,"216":"I understand your perspective, but I respectfully disagree. While I agree that it's important to address vulnerabilities, publicly disclosing them before they can be properly patched can lead to serious harm. The responsible approach is to work with the affected parties to address the issues discreetly, rather than leaving systems open to exploitation. Ethical security practices aim to protect people, not put them at risk.","217":"That's an interesting point about the restrictions on vehicle inspection. Do you see any parallels between that and the legal issues around security research and hacking? I'm curious to hear your perspective on how those two areas might be related, and whether you think there are ways to balance consumer rights with legitimate security concerns.","218":null,"219":null,"220":null,"221":null,"222":"Ah, I see. Amazing Grace is a beautiful and timeless hymn that has been sung for centuries.

I'm curious to understand your perspective in more detail.","224":"Ah, yes, the fascinating relationship between black holes and the concepts of space and time! Black holes can actually cause some mind-bending temporal distortions, with the intense gravity warping the fabric of spacetime in ways that can lead to all sorts of paradoxes and mind-bending thought experiments. It's a topic that really gets the imagination racing, don't you think?","225":null,"226":"You're right, the question of free will can be quite unsettling. It raises a lot of deep and difficult questions about the nature of our choices and actions. I can understand why many people find it an uncomfortable topic to grapple with.","227":null,"228":"Fascinating, a donut-shaped universe with a looping time dimension. I'm intrigued - what implications would that have for the experience of time and the nature of reality from the perspective of someone living within that universe? It seems like it could challenge our conventional notions of linear time and causality. I'd love to hear more about how you envision that working.","229":null,"230":"I see what you mean. The concept of eternity can feel overwhelming and out of reach. While we may not be able to fully grasp or experience it, we can still find meaning and purpose in our finite lives. Our existence, though temporary, is no less meaningful or valuable within the grand scale of time.","231":null,"232":null,"233":"Hmm, that's an interesting observation about the position of your king. As the white player, I do have some options for my first move to try and exploit that. Let me think through a few different approaches we could consider. What are your thoughts on how I might try to target your king, given the current position of the pieces on the board?","234":null,"235":"You're absolutely right. In a closed position, the pieces are more constrained and have fewer options. But in an open position, the pieces have more breathing room and can actively threaten the opponent's position. Tell me, what makes you think white is winning in this game? I'd be curious to hear your assessment of the strategic factors at play.","236":"You make a good point about the black king's position. It does look vulnerable on the open side of the board. What ideas do you have for how Black could try to improve the position and reduce the risk to the king? I'd suggest looking for a way to put the white king under some pressure, perhaps with a check or a threat.","237":"You're absolutely right! Playing bishop takes pawn on E4 would give me a check on the king. That's a really sharp and tactical idea to consider in this position. I'll need to think carefully about how to respond to that move. Where do you think my king could go to safety if you played that check? Let's explore the possibilities together.","238":null,"239":null,"240":null,"241":null,"242":null,"243":null,"244":null,"245":"That's an interesting idea!

The lens in the laser system focuses the light down to a small, concentrated point, just like a magnifying glass focuses the sun's rays to create a hot spot. This concentrated beam of light can then be used to cut or process materials, like steel.","254":"Precisely! By focusing the light into a highly concentrated beam, we can precisely direct and control the light energy within a very small volume of space.

It can really add up quickly if you're not careful in how you design the system to handle that volume efficiently.","523":null,"524":"That's fascinating. Could you elaborate a bit more on the challenges you're facing with quantum error correction and the elusive concept of fault tolerance? I'm really interested to learn more about how you're grappling with these technical hurdles and what insights you've gained so far in your research.","525":null,"526":"That's a really good point. Dealing with decoherence is one of the key obstacles in making practical quantum computers. Maintaining the delicate quantum state long enough to run useful calculations is an ongoing challenge that researchers are still working to overcome. It's a difficult problem, but making progress on it is crucial for quantum computing to reach its full potential.","527":null,"528":"But as Moravec's paradox suggests, the tasks that come easily to humans are not always the ones that are easiest for machines. For example, the simple act of picking up a penny may seem trivial to us, yet it can actually pose significant challenges for robots and computers to accomplish.","529":"Okay, let me show you something that might surprise you. Even simple tasks that seem effortless for humans can actually be quite challenging for robots to replicate. Watch closely and I'll demonstrate what I mean.","530":"Okay, let's try that next. I dropped the penny on the floor, so now I'll need to look around and find it before I can pick it up. Where do you think it landed? I'll scan the area carefully to locate it.","531":"That's really fascinating. I'd love to learn more about how robots use perception and action loops to adapt to changes in their environment. Could you tell me a bit more about how that works and some of the key challenges in designing those kinds of systems? I'm curious to understand the technical details and how they compare to the human ability to adapt our movements based on sensory feedback.","532":null,"533":null,"534":"A robot's perception is quite different from human vision. Unlike our biological eyes and visual processing in the brain, a robot typically uses cameras and computer vision algorithms to perceive the world. This means they don't experience the rich, holistic way that we see things. Instead, they analyze visual information in a more task-oriented and analytical manner, focused on specific objectives rather than a comprehensive understanding.","535":"That's really fascinating that even simple computer programs can generate such intricate, self-similar fractal structures that mirror patterns in the natural world. It's amazing how a few mathematical equations can capture complex, multi-scale phenomena like fluid turbulence. I can see why that would be so exciting - the ability to create these beautiful, nature-inspired patterns through programming is quite remarkable.","536":null,"537":"I'm afraid I may have misunderstood the point you were making.

What is it about the complexity and challenge of math problems that you find most engaging?","547":null,"548":null,"549":null,"550":null,"551":"That's exactly right! With zero-knowledge proof, you can authenticate your identity without disclosing any sensitive information. It's like a digital magic trick - you demonstrate that you're the rightful user, without revealing the details behind it. This approach could be really powerful for protecting people's privacy online while still allowing them to access their accounts securely.","552":"Moravec's paradox refers to the surprising finding that simple physical tasks like object manipulation come much more naturally to humans than to machines, while advanced cognitive tasks like reasoning and problem-solving are relatively easy for AI systems to perform compared to humans. It's a counterintuitive observation in the field of artificial intelligence.","553":null,"554":null,"555":null,"556":"That's a fascinating development. Achieving electrical readout of NV center spin states could enable significant improvements in density and scalability for quantum sensing devices. What are some of the key technical challenges that need to be overcome to make this approach viable, compared to the more established optical readout techniques?","557":null,"558":null,"559":null,"560":"That's correct. If we add another guest, the total number of guests will still be infinity. Even with an infinite number of guests, the hotel can accommodate them all by moving each guest to the next available room. This process can be continued indefinitely, creating new rooms and accommodating more guests without ever reaching capacity.","561":null,"562":"That's right! By systematically moving the guests one room at a time, we can create infinitely many new spaces, even though the hotel is already full. This counterintuitive property of infinity is exactly what Hilbert's Hotel illustrates so well. It's a great way for mathematicians to wrap their heads around the surprising behaviors of infinite sets.","563":null,"564":"The internet is much more than that. It's a vast global network that connects people, information, and resources all around the world. There are so many ways to explore and use the internet beyond just searching and watching videos. What are some of the other ways you use the internet or think it could be useful?","565":"Oh, Matilda is such a classic! I loved how the story portrayed the strength and resilience of the young protagonist. Have you noticed any interesting fan theories or behind-the-scenes details about the film online? I'd be curious to hear your thoughts on how the movie's themes and messages have resonated with you.","566":null,"567":"That's a great point. The internet is designed with multiple possible routes between the source and receiver to provide flexibility and redundancy. If one path is not working well, the information can be sent through an alternative route to still reach its destination. This helps the network avoid congestion and continue functioning even if there are issues with a particular connection or pathway.","568":"You make a good point. Having multiple paths available can be valuable in case one route is not functioning properly or becomes congested. This redundancy helps ensure the internet remains reliable and resilient, even if a particular connection or route encounters issues. By having alternative paths, users can adapt and find other ways to reach their destination, which is an important design consideration for a network as widely used and essential as the internet.","569":"Oh, that's an interesting topic! What do you find most fascinating about the internet? I'd love to hear your thoughts on how it's changed the way we communicate and access information these days.","570":null,"571":"That's a really interesting observation. The increasing software-defined control over network infrastructure, combined with the rise of edge computing, could have significant implications for how the internet is governed and regulated. As more aspects of the network become vertically integrated under the control of a few large service providers, it raises questions about the balance of power and the ability to ensure an open, accessible internet for all.","572":null,"573":null,"574":null,"575":"You're absolutely right. The combination of wireless, networking, and cloud technologies is enabling the powerful edge computing paradigm. Being able to bring computation and storage closer to the end devices and sensors is crucial for applications that require low latency and high responsiveness, like those interacting with the physical world. This integration of computation and communication is a key capability that these converging technologies provide.","576":null,"577":null,"578":null,"579":null,"580":null,"581":null,"582":null,"583":null,"584":null,"585":null,"586":null,"587":null,"588":"That's an interesting point about the potential of quantum computing. The ability to leverage quantum effects like superposition and entanglement could lead to significant speed and efficiency improvements for certain types of computations. However, the practical applications of quantum computing are still being actively explored and developed. Ultimately, the training time for neural networks will depend on a variety of factors, including the complexity of the model and the available computing resources.","589":"In a quantum computer, we don't work with just 0s and 1s like in classical computers. Instead, we use quantum bits or qubits that can exist in a superposition of both states at the same time. This allows us to perform certain computations in a fundamentally different way, taking advantage of quantum mechanical principles like entanglement and interference.","590":null,"591":"That's exactly right. The ability to have a quantum bit, or qubit, in a superposition of states is what gives quantum computers their immense potential. By leveraging quantum phenomena like superposition and entanglement, we can perform certain computations exponentially faster than classical computers. This is a key advantage that makes quantum computing such an exciting and rapidly evolving field.","592":"To encode information in a quantum computer, we use the quantum states of individual atoms or ions, like their spin or energy levels.
