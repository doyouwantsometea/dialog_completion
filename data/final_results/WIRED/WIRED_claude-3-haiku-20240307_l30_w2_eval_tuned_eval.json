The amazing thing about harmony is that it exists in nature. So, take the harmonic series of the note F, for example. Okay. You have the ups on the fifth and the fourth and then the, (hums) That seemed a little bit sharp, but that's fine. And then tones get increasingly small. Beneath that note, you have the undertone series, which essentially is like a reflection of something. In the same way that when a tree grows in nature, you have the branches which grow upwards and the roots which go downwards. So it's quite a nice thing to thing about, this being the key center, the floor, the ground, and then these two different directions of ways in which it can express itself, and the differences in the sensations with that. Lots of the time I think when it comes to reharmonization or harmonization, people think that the solution to the problems come when we add more notes.","2":"I think that people forget that you can work with the notes you already have by just rearranging them, just the simple idea of inversion, inversion of the simple triad, of F major. \u266aI once was lost and now I'm found \u266a \u266a Was blind \u266a \u266a But now I see \u266a Now how home do I want to go here, you know? Is there another verse to come?","3":"Because I can delay the gratification of going home. First of all, just by using inversions, even before we add the notes to the chord. One thing that I was very joyful to discover is that every single melody note works with every single base note.","4":"F major, F minor, D flat major seven G flat diminished, G flat minor major seven, G minor seven, G soft, G seven, G seven sharp 11. And then, G seven with a flat 13","5":"That's it! (laughs) A flat soft, A flat major seven. A flat major seven sharp five, with a sharp 11. Essentially, what that demonstrates is that every note and every base note are compatible. So once we realize this its like, that's great! Now what should we do? What, how, what should we, what should we, how, what am I supposed to do? What to do, right. And sometimes the paralyzing thing when it comes to arranging, there are too many options, too many things are possible. So that's when it becomes super, super important to be aware of what you wanna try and say emotionally.","6":"Exactly, yeah. No, for sure. And, you know, F major can be something you arrive in from, if you arrive in F major from D flat, then it's like the sun's come up.","7":"So, there's a lot about context, I think. Once you have a language, it's about using it and applying it in those emotional ways. I think that's what makes the difference.","8":"Generally in five levels, level five is the ultimate master, the person that's played the game 20, 30 years, has the highest pedigree. Actually, that's you in this case, and we're still on level four because computers have been better than humans at chess for like 30 years. How has it changed the way you approach the game?","9":"So I've never thought of chess that way. This is very interesting to me. So of those three, what would you say is the one that you have more mastery over than the other?","10":"I think I like to be creative. So I find fun in chess by learning 10 different openings, trying different positions. I like chaotic positions. I like positions where I can attack. I like positions where I'm getting attacked and I can maybe defend and find some creative way to turn things around, and I really, really struggle when I need to sit there and just do nothing.","11":"I think G6 is Leningrad. I've tried to find a name. I don't actually know the name of this one. I guess there's also like the Stonewall, right? You can play.","12":"I play like a lot of openings poorly. That's my approach to chess. I just play things that I think will be fun. Then the game starts going, and I'm like, Why did I play this? I should learn real openings. Okay, I guess I'll... Yeah, this is nice and boring.","13":"Yes. Well, actually, it's not a good thing. I would've preferred that it might, you know, it might hang, but oh, we only have like 90 seconds. We have to make conversation and also play some semi-decent moves.","14":"You are the eight-time United States women's chess champion. You also have the highest title in all of chess grandmaster. I'm an eternal runner up. Like what is the championship mentality, and how have you succeeded at it so many times?","15":"in some way. But there are differences, right? If I asked you to move through space, you could do it freely, right? Can you get up? And let's see how easy it is to move through space. Can you move over to that location? And can you come back? Anything getting in your way? Easy to do?","16":"If I were to ask you to sit perfectly still in space, can you do that? I mean, hold perfectly still. That's good. But if I ask you to hold still in time, to not go to the next second or the next second, can you do that?","17":"He does have crazy hair, and I think I'm maybe heading in that direction actually.He showed us an approach to travel to the future. You want me to tell you how you do it?","18":"You build a spaceship. You go out into space really quickly. You turn around and you come back to planet Earth, and he showed us that when you're on that ship, your clock will tick off time more slowly. You will age more slowly. So that journey may only take you, say, a year, six months out and six months back, but you know what? When you step out of the ship, it'll be 100 years into the future or 1,000 years, a million years into the future. Would you do that if you could?","19":"I don't think so. That same guy with the crazy hair, Albert Einstein, showed that there's actually a limit to how fast things can go. And you know what the limit is? The limit is the speed of light, because light travels 671 million miles per hour, that is fast enough to go around the entire earth seven times in one second. So if we could build a spaceship that would go as fast as light, we'd be able to do what Einstein noted. There's something else that's really curious about time. Things tend to go in one direction, and we call it the arrow of time. It sort of points from the past into what we call the future. If you're to ask me why is there an arrow to time, ask me.","20":"Maybe, that's absolutely right. I think it's unlikely we'll learn how to travel to the past, but it's not been ruled out. That's kind of exciting that it's still at least an open possibility.","21":"Yeah. We do a lot of X-ray in addition to EM and this is actually, I'm not saying it's the only problem, but it's the only problem that needs to be solved right away, is that the data analysis, right? In fact, I think we calculated that there aren't enough humans ever to map a mouse brain where you collect every connection and et cetera so the problem is to get algorithms to trace, to recognize things in brains the way humans would recognize things in brains, or map things, trace things in brains. It's gonna cost a lot of money to imagine setting the gold standard for the wiring diagram even once and those are the kinds of ethical concerns that I'm worried about.","22":"So fortunately there's, I'm also doing it from space with the Spitzer Space Telescope, so particularly in the infrared, and my main interest has been to try and study the environment around the super massive black holes, not as close as where the X-rays are coming from, but clearly there's something from the X-ray corona that illuminates the rest of the accretion disk, and the dust that's further out. And so fundamentally, that's one of the key things that I'm trying to use, is trying to see how long, once you've got this sort of pulse that's generated close to the black hole, it propagates out, and so you can use optical wavelengths to see that the accretion disk lights up in the optical a little bit as it gets heated up from the X-ray, and then later on, the infrared dust, the dust absorbs it, and emits it in the infrared. And so that, I love that, the ability to exchange time for resolution, because these structures are so far away that we're never gonna get a telescope big enough where that has the resolution to see the accretion disk, or the dust distribution around--","23":"So you do see it, basically the dust sublimation radius, and you see it at, and it tells you, depending on what kind of dust it is, and it's actually one of the problems for me studying, whenever we try and do X-ray studies of low luminosity active galactic nuclei in your, by galaxies, because there're all these X-ray binaries that are also emitting X-rays, which make our lives difficult. But they're also in black holes, when it's this really interesting sort of both, it's great, but ugh, it's also a source of noise for those of us who are trying to do X-ray observations of nearby galaxies.","24":"It's a weird thing to be sitting in your own galaxy, but not be able to separate all these, four million solar mass black hole creating, next to, how massive, it's like two to three solar masses for the X-ray binaries?","25":"Which was one idea, but again, it's, I'll leave this to your theoreticians, I think there are problems with that, as well. I call it job security. That's right. (both laugh) We have a lot of things about black holes, both in terms of their formation, or even how they exist as they are, and how they're interacting with their environment that we're still not understanding.","26":"Now, in some sense that's kind of trivial to you and me, because of course you have space, which is three dimensional, you have time which is one dimensional, so spacetime is four dimensional. But it didn't turn out, it didn't occur to anyone that that was a sensible way to talk until really relativity. This is the crucial thing, right? Is that what Einstein realized is that sure there's both time and space, but how we divide spacetime into time and space can be different for different people, and really there's a real sense in which four dimensional spacetime is kind of a generalization of three dimensional space. And I think to really explain this we're gonna need a blackboard.","27":"Let's bring one in. All right. The thing about relativity is that they really want you to think of spacetime as one four dimensional thing, right? It's kind of like space. It's not just three dimensions of space and one dimension of time.","28":"Why? This is a very good question. So, let's just start with space, right? We know a little bit about space. So here's my simple minded way of drawing space two dimensions, because that's how many I can draw on the blackboard. Let's say X and Y. And what is special about space, there's many things, but one is that if I have a curve or a path between two points, there's a distance that you can calculate, right? And the distance between those two points doesn't depend on your coordinates. It doesn't depend on whether you're in radial coordinates or Cartesian coordinates, or whatever. I'm allowed to imagine a curve that does something like this between those two points, and if I were a person walking on that curve, I would have an odometer with me maybe, and I would know, you would know, even without having done that, this path is always gonna be longer than that path. There's a formula, Pythagoras' Theorem that tells you what the shortest distance path is. That's the point. The physical-ness of what is real is the distance along a certain curve. So spacetime is like that. That's why it is useful to think about spacetime.","29":"So let me draw spacetime. Here's how we usually draw it. I'll just say X, but all of space is condensed in this one direction, and this is time, okay? So if you're a little person and you started some event, so you start, you're located somewhere in space, somewhere in the three coordinates of space, and whether you like it or not, you're moving through spacetime just by getting older.","30":"When people ask me can you travel through time? I say yes, yesterday I traveled 24 hours into the future and here I am, a day later. So that's just this. Okay, you're moving through time, like it or not. So what Einstein says is look, I can travel through spacetime in different ways, like I could hop in a rocket ship and fly out and then fly back, and then I could meet you there. So this is a different trajectory through spacetime, right?","31":"And it's almost exactly like the space story. The space story says there's a distance, distance is different along different curves. Einstein says there's something that measures the length of these curves, and we call it the proper time. It is literally the time that you would read on your wristwatch.","32":"Well kind of. What Einstein wants to get across is there's no such thing as fundamental, like there's the universe's time, this big letter T that might tell you how old the universe is, but then every individual has a clock with them, and they measure their own time depending on how they're moving through the universe.","33":"There is what we call a metric on spacetime, and when we talk about Euclidean space versus a curved space, versus a sphere or something, that's a different metric. And spacetime has its own metric which says the following thing, that the path between two events in spacetime that is a straight line, will always be the longest time.","34":"So when Einstein had this idea, oh gravity could be related to the curvature of spacetime, he did some equations, so he got it, that's a long story, we'll put that aside. What he figured out was that rather than gravity living on top of spacetime, it's a manifestation of the curvature of spacetime so when you have like the earth, the sun, the moon, they cause a gravitational field, they're actually warping the spacetime around them. They're giving it a different geometry.","35":"Yeah, that's right. And it goes exactly back to what we drew on the board where how those two people in the train and on the ground would divide spacetime up differently to space and time.","36":"A baby ant? Very good. So I have over here a meter stick, let me show it to you. And so that's a meter and if I divide it by 1000, I get a millimeter. So milli just means 1000. There's all these little lines on the ruler. And each of those little lines is one millimeter. So a baby ant is probably a couple of millimeters. So even the thing, that's the smallest thing you can think of, it's a million times bigger than a nanometer. Tiny, tiny, tiny.","37":"If I took this stick and I was to draw 1 billion lines, the distance between those two lines would be one nanometer. So that's really all it is. It's just a measure of size. But it's really, really, really tiny, smaller than anything that we can see with our eyes. The reason why, in nanotechnology, scientists, we care about things that are that small, is because there are objects called atoms. Have you ever heard of atoms before?","38":"That was a perfect explanation. But what if I told you that scientists invented a special type of microscope that not only lets you see atoms, but also lets you move them around and build things with them. Would you think that would be pretty cool?","39":"So it's called a scanning tunneling microscope. And not only can you see the atoms, but you can move them around. Atoms are kind of sticky. You can actually build things using this instrument with actual individual atoms. So if I gave you that machine, would you want to make something? Would you want to look at something very carefully?","40":"We're gonna have to create entire new concepts of how they do trade and how they work with us, too. What kind of barriers or road blocks would you imagine are gonna happen in the blockchain space?","41":"Yeah. One of the problems that Bitcoin has faced is Bitcoins getting stolen or lost. But a lot of that actually comes from people trying to recentralize Bitcoin in different ways making themselves actually a pretty easy target.","42":"Yeah. To actually transition into the mainstream and make it useful for average people to use, we're going to need to make sure we have a lot more education, a lot more standards and probably work with a lot of enterprises to create sort of a user experience around this being a technology that is safe and usable and understandable. What is the current state of blockchain in your understanding? What's gonna have to happen next?","43":"These are the building blocks of many, many origami deployable shapes, it's called a degree-4 vertex. It's the number of lines. So in this case, we use solid lines for mountain, we use dash lines for valley. We're going to fold it and use these two to illustrate some important properties of origami mechanisms. It's important in the study of mechanisms to take into account the rigidity. So what we're going to do to help simulate rigidity is to take these rectangles and we're going to fold them over and over so that they just become stiff and rigid.","44":"So this is what's called a single degree of freedom mechanism. You have one degree of freedom, I can choose this fold, and then if these are perfectly rigid every other fold angle is fully determined. One of the key behaviors here is that with the smaller angles up here, the two folds that are the same parity and the folds that are of opposite parity move at about the same rate but with this, as we're getting closer to 90 degrees, we find they move at very different rates and then at the end of the motion, the opposite happens. This one is almost folded but this one goes through a much larger motion so the relative speeds differ.","45":"So when we start sticking together vertices like this, if they're individually single degree of freedom then we can make very large mechanisms that open and close but with just one degree of freedom. So, these are examples of a pattern called the Miura-Ori. When you stretch them out they're pretty big.","46":"Yeah, so typically the mechanism will run from corner to corner, to diagonally to opposite corners because then you can stretch it out that way. Notice some differences between the one you have and the one I have in how this one sort of opens out almost evenly but this one opens out more one way and then the other.","47":"And it's exactly the difference between the motions of these two vertices. So these angles are closer to right angles and the closer you get to a right angle the more asymmetry there is between the two directions of motion. And then the other difference is how efficiently they pack, so these started at about the same size but when they're flat notice that yours is much more compact. So if I were you making a solar array, I'd say, oh, I want that one. But if I say, well, I want them to open at the same rate, then I want this one.","48":"There's an engineering trade-off to get them both to work. And there's another place that shows up in deployable structures in a very cool structure. This is a folded tube, it sort of pops out like this but it has this neat property that if you twist it quickly, it changes color. There's a Mars Rover application where they need a sleeve that protects a drill and as the drill goes down, the sleeve is going to collapse and they're using a pattern very much like this.","49":"There are many open mathematical questions and so room for mathematicians, like yourself, to have a big impact on the world of origami and mechanisms. And even though those studies are mathematically interesting, they're going to also have real-world applications in space, solar arrays, drills, telescopes, and more. Any questions or thoughts about this?","50":"You try, we all gotta try. You've probably heard about sleep as this kind of, you know, it's a biological process that happens in your brain. It's really important for your body, but it's a lot more complex than that. Sleep is made up of different parts. You know, when you think about sleep, what do you think about?","51":"So our sleep is made up of different types, okay? The first one is called non-rapid eye movement sleep, or non-REM, okay? Or NREM. And then the other one, which might not be a surprise, is called REM. Rapid eye movement sleep. And those are the two main types of sleep that happen. The way that we measure that as a sleep scientist is that we'll actually bring people into the lab where they can do this at home, where we put electrodes on their scalp while they're sleeping, and that allows us to measure the brain activity that's going on during the night.","52":"When we measure all of that, we're able to see how much time someone's asleep, and how many times they wake up and stuff during the night. You know, we're also really interested in kind of, the amount of non-REM sleep someone gets and the amount of REM sleep that someone gets, because each part of those types of sleep do different things for the body. And so it's important to get both of those. And so within non-REM sleep, there are three stages ranging from N-1 to N-2 to N-3. So not particularly clever in our naming, but that's how we know what stages they are. And what they do is it moves from lightest to deepest sleep, okay? N-1, it's more kind of light, wakefulness sleep, kind of in and out of sleeping. Then you go into N-2, which is where we spend 45 to 55 percent of our sleep. And it's more this kind of light sleep, but then we get into kind of the really restorative sleep, and that's N-3. And in N-3, when we look at someone's EEG wave, we see these big slow waves, and it's called slow wave sleep. And so we spend about 20% of our sleep in slow wave sleep, though it can vary on a day to day.","53":"You know, some of that is totally accurate, that like when your brain's more engaged by being on your phone or doing things that you really enjoy or things that stress you out or any of those types of things, it's harder to get to sleep and to kind of fall into that deeper levels of sleep. Most of the REM sleep, this dreaming sleep, happens in the second half of the night.","54":"Okay? So we wake up a lot during the night, and we just don't remember it. And you'll go back down into deep sleep, and then up again into REM, you know, in kinda these cycles.","55":"Okay. Usually we want to keep naps, like 20 to 30 minutes. When people drop into deep sleep, and then they're woken up out of a nap, most people report that they feel way worse than they did before they took the nap, and that's because you've been in deep sleep, and it's this term called sleep inertia. So what are the stages of sleep?","56":"The way our sun generates energy is by fusion reactions. It fuses hydrogen, the lightest element we know about, into helium, and that gets fused into heavier and heavier elements. So here on earth we're going to take some special kinds of hydrogen, a special flavor of it if you will, which we call an isotope. And we're going to combine them to create new particles. And we can only get that combination of particles to happen if they are in a plasma. What's your favorite exhibit at the science museum?","57":"Absolutely, we take the gas, and we add heat, and we get a plasma. And a plasma is a state of matter where you have an ionized gas. If we break down that gas, and we add enough energy to ionize it, where you can take the electrons and the ions and the atom and separate them, and now there's this soup of charged particles that are moving around, that's the plasma. And it is what creates the beautiful light in lightning. So you've already seen a plasma in fact. So I'm gonna show you this fun demonstration. You've probably seen one of these before, right?","58":"Yeah. So the way this is happening is this glass ball here is a container for our plasma. And we've taken most of the air out of the container, so there's not a lot of particles inside the glass ball, and very, very low temperature plasma. So it's continuously ionizing and then recombining, and becoming neutral again. And we see those energy transitions as the visible light. So if we're gonna put this plasma to use and do something helpful with it, like maybe make some clean electricity, we would have to control it. And another word for controlling it is confining it. So let me turn this off and set it back down. You're probably wondering what is this thing on this table? It's a model of a tokamak, and that's the name of a device that I work on with the goal of creating clean energy. Have you played with magnets in school?","59":"This is all very important to sort of understand how we would create a container that would let us hold a plasma in place and control it. Have you ever played around with an electromagnet in class? It's a coil of wire, much like this big red coil of wire right here. And when we push an electrical current through this wire, it creates a magnetic field that goes around the wire perpendicular. So if you want to know the direction of the magnetic field that's being created by pushing the current through the wire, put your thumb in the direction of the current and then curl your fingers like this. Yeah, and that's the right hand rule. So if we push the current this way we're creating a magnetic field in this perpendicular direction. So if I drive a current in this red wire like this, which direction will the magnetic field go?","60":"Exactly, yeah, the long way, perpendicular. Now this is a bit of a trickier one. The blue wire is gonna act like a transformer action. And so by changing the current in the blue coil, we are going to be able to run a current in this direction around the tokamak. And now think back to how the wires worked. If I have a current going like this, where's the magnetic field?","61":"Exactly, back this way, the short way around the tokamak. We can now put together the pieces and understand the three magnetic fields that we need to confine a plasma in our tokamak. So our plasma will be inside this vessel in the shape of a donut.","62":"I'm so glad you asked. So what we want to use the tokamak for in real life is to confine a super hot plasma, and we're talking a hundred million, 150 million degrees. Because the plasma is so very hot, the particles have enough energy to interact with one another and fuse. When those fusion reactions occur, we are releasing energy that's inside the nucleus, and we can harness that energy to make clean electricity.","63":"So we are trying to bring a star to earth. We are not going to be using hydrogen the way our star in our solar system, our sun, uses hydrogen to make helium and generates fusion energy that way. Instead on earth we're gonna be using isotopes of hydrogen, deuterium and tritium. What do you know about charged particles? If I want to try and push two positively charged particles together, two protons together, what do you think is gonna happen?","64":"Or we're gonna call the pushback a Coulomb interaction, or a Coulomb collision. So you can sort of imagine if I were to take a deuteron and a triton, and so those are the positively charged ions of deuterium and tritium, and I try and combine them together, those two positively charged particles just sort of bounce off of each other. So we have to give them enormous amounts of energy, and it has to do with getting up to very high temperatures. So we're talking about over 100 million degrees Celsius. And we typically put that into an energy unit that we use a lot in plasma physics called an electron vault. And so we describe being up at 100 million degrees that we're at sort of 15 kiloelectron volts.","65":"So that's very, very hot temperature. But the other thing we need is a lot of particles. That's the density. We are able to combine a deuteron and a triton in a fusion reaction at lower temperatures, at lower energies than other fuel. And this has to do with some very nice properties of the deuteron and the triton that when we get them close enough to one another to fuse, there's actually a resonance which is predicted by quantum mechanics, and that really helps have a little bump up in the cross section for the deuterium-tritium fusion reaction.","66":"Yes, exactly, exactly. That little bump up is good for us. Because it means that we have a higher probability of getting the deuterium and the tritium to fuse than otherwise at those manageable temperatures. And when we say manageable, for fusion scientists, yeah, 50 million, a hundred million, 150 million Celsius.","67":"We've come so far in the study of magnetically confined plasmas, which is what I work on, that we sort of tamed all the other types of major instabilities that would cause loss of the plasma. So you might be asking yourself what is the energy that's coming out of the fusion reaction? So we've got the deuteron and we've got the triton, and so they combine in a fusion reaction, and that produces a neutron and a helium nucleus. But the neutron doesn't have any charge.","68":"Exactly. So it comes right out. And it's the kinetic energy of the neutron. And we want it to interact with our overall energy system. And as it interacts with that material, it heats the material up. It transfers its kinetic energy to this material. Take that thermal energy and run a turbine, run a generator, and convert it into electricity. So once you get to that stage, it starts to look a lot like any other thermal power plant. Whether it's fission or natural gas. So a fusion plant could basically be the plasma core coming in, setting it in place, and driving your thermal system to make electricity. We often call it an alpha particle. And that is a charged particle, right. So it's actually going to stay in the plasma. It's an energetic particle compared to the fuel. So it actually is going to give its kinetic energy back to the fuel via Coulomb collisions. So now they're good, now we like them.","69":"It turns out, for people that are between the ages of 18 and 65, the agreed upon amount of sleep that people should get is between seven and nine hours, and it's really at least seven hours per night, to maintain optimal health as an adult. So at least seven hours. When we look at across all of the data that is available on like sleep and health, and sleep and psychiatric illness and those types of things, the largest risk is when people get five hours or less. What do you think is responsible for driving how much sleep you need, and things like that?","70":"The first thing I want to show you is origami in the real world. This is the origami lamp. It comes shipped flat but it folds, clip holds it together. The lamp has LEDs on the inside so when we power it up we get light, we have a lampshade and we get the base.","71":"New problems arise when we try to make origami out of things other than paper, but also new opportunities. An example here which is a kind of a variant of the Miura-Ori. It's got a three-dimensional structure. If I stretch it one way, it expands the other but because it has these S-bends in the pattern, if you squeeze it, it doesn't go all the way flat. This is a epoxy impregnated aramid fiber and so if I put this fold pattern into it and then compress it and then put a skin on the top and bottom, this becomes incredibly lightweight but incredibly strong.","72":"Another origami challenge that comes up with these patterns is if we're going to make an aircraft out of this thing we're going to need hundreds of yards of folded origami. We're not going to do it by hand and this might be the new frontier in origami engineering, which is the design of machines that can fold patterns that have applications.","73":"It's something we've talked about a little bit that with all the richness of behavior of origami from a flat sheet, it seems like there ought to be an equally rich world of things that don't start flat but are still made from flat sheets of paper.","74":"It will develop. It will take five years. It will take 10 years. That kind of time is necessary. One of the areas that brought me to supply chain research is the fact that we're not just gonna see blockchain emerge. We're gonna see artificial intelligence continue to evolve. We're gonna see connective devices and this sort of growing internet of things and machinery that can do a lot more and have a wallet and transact on their own. And so I actually think a lot of where blockchain and other technologies are headed is this interesting synergy that will help us elevate the kinds of institutions we've used in the past and cobbled together to create that identifiable, verifiable trust.","75":"In that it's hard to compare it to some perfect future. Just like you compare autonomous vehicles to this very high standard because machines are doing it. It should be perfect. There should be zero car deaths.","76":"When you say, well, there's hundreds of thousands, millions of car deaths on the road due to human error today. I think we're in a similar place. We're going to see problems with this technology, and we are going to need to develop multiple kinds of standards that also have some flexibility. But it's going to also be a version, a system, that allows us to fix some of the things that are broken today.","77":"All right, you're in the wrong place. [laughs] We're not gonna be talking about biology or computer science. So we wanna talk about the idea of dimensions. Do you know what dimension is? How we would define dimensions?","78":"Right, you know the difference between like one dimension two dimensions, three dimensions, et cetera. So let's do a little experiment here. So there's one dimension. I'll give that to you. Now, here's your task. I'm going to give you another dimension, and I'm gonna ask hold those two things at right angles to each other. It's easy to do. Yeah, so there's no trick here.","79":"I'm not trying to fool you here. Okay. Now this is going to be slightly trickier. I'm going to give you this. I want you to hold all three of them at right angles to all the others at the same time.","80":"There you go. So what that's doing is when you had just two that was describing a two dimensional plane, right? Like the two things pick out a plane, the three things pick out all three dimensional space. I'm gonna give you one more, and I'm gonna ask you to hold that fourth one so that it's at a right angle to all the other three at the same time.","81":"All right, now I am tricking you. It can't be done. Yeah. Right? You can't do it. So we just experimentally proved that space is three dimensional. That's sort of what it means to be three dimensional, that there are three different directions you can move in and there's not four or five or six directions you can move in.","82":"Well, we could also say how far we are away from the center, just the distance. And then the angle that our little line makes with let's say the X axis.","83":"So that's a different way of giving you two numbers and locating yourself, and we call those polar coordinates. It's a different coordinate system. What we want to do as physicists is look for extra dimensions. Can you imagine, can you think of any way that there could be extra dimensions?","84":"Time. Yes, Einstein said that we can think of time as a fourth dimension, and that's a very fascinating thing that we could talk about all by itself. But what about space? What about the solar system? Like, if you wanted to tell me where a certain star was in the sky, do you know how we do that?","85":"So you can define something as, well you know, how high above a certain location on earth it is, but the earth is rotating and revolving around the sun so we have to define separate celestial coordinates.","86":"We don't know. You know, the optimistic view is that there are six, but the thing is, some of them might be really, really, really, really, really small, like way too small for us to ever see.","87":"You know, honestly out there, if you go out onto campus and talk to the physicists, half of them will say probably extra dimensions exist, and half of them say no, that's just nonsense.","88":"That was, it was like, oh, wow, this might be it, and then, but very early on, it was, as I just started my, it was basically my second year of graduate school, it was like, uh, this is not that simple.","89":"You know, everybody's been just coming at it from different wavelengths at the optical infrared, and, but definitely the X-rays has been one of those things where it's like, oh, finally.","90":"It does seem to be that it may not even, in parts, it may not be even connected to this tiny, little torus at all because part of the work that I did, and others have done, is that type twos preferentially live in different kinds of galaxies than type ones, which should not in any way have to do with something such a small scale. They tend to be in smaller bulged, SB and SC type spiral galaxies. So there's something also having to do with environment that gets you to be a type two, and you can still maybe, timing wise, but there's something else that's going on on a larger scale because the type of the AGN should not really correspond to the host galaxy, but it seems to. And that was one of the things that we were finding out, and that was one of the early little ideas that the, individually, just as the torus model, the unified model, can't explain everything that we were observing at the time. But it is one of those things that it's, they're super luminous, they're all over the place, and we don't have a really good picture of it, which makes it exciting to study.","91":"This is where it gets really crazy. Could we simulate that map inside a computer and would that computer then be thinking like that original brain from which we made the map?","92":"Huh. It would be like if you simulated a hurricane. Imagine we could keep track of every variable of a hurricane. Ever. Wind speed, every water molecule, et cetera, et cetera. Temperature. And we put that inside a super-fast computer and we simulated it, right? I don't think anyone would think that the inside of the computer would get wet. Even though we had simulated the hurricane perfectly, that wetness is consciousness, it's what we are. Is it ethical to imagine mapping a male brain versus a female brain to look for differences between those, to explain alleged behavioral differences between them?","93":"I think my audience once pulled 92% or below the level of 1,200, but it's really hard to learn chess because you don't get to experience learning content based on people who are your level. Like how did you really deduce how a 1,200 will play?","94":"Onto to E5 on the third move is the most challenging move against the Caro-Kann. It restricts the knight and the main line. So the move is bringing out the bishop, Bringing out the bishop. so you don't get locked. I play that move, but the move that I also added to my toolbox and is the only move I teach now is this move to try to undermine the center. It's not commonly played at the highest level. If you study master games, this is probably one in every six games or something compared to, right? So now we go down a totally different path. We're taking a totally different train to our destination, but just this undermining of the position, you know, splitting up these pawns and then slowly capturing them both, that does wonders at intermediate and early advanced level. This move, despite it being move three, according to databases, already gives black like a 53% chance of winning, which is crazy because normally white is about 52%, right? White just doesn't know what to do about this move.","95":"A lot of people will see you as somebody who's drank in harmony their whole life. They've seen so much harmony, heard so much harmony. How do you make the choices, there's so much that's possible when you know stuff. How do you have the courage to make a choice?","96":"Yeah, yeah, yeah. I find it fascinating in music to think about, you know, say I arrive in a place, if I'm going, say I'm going to D flat major. And there's something you once taught me. You taught me this song Don't Follow the Crowd.","97":"'Cause, you know, I just wouldn't think to use that chord in that situation. And there it was! And, you know, if you read the rule book, it's, that not in it.","98":"Something like that. And that's not 'cause like emotionally, it's almost like I'm here, I'm arriving here. But, if the base note is the same, it's like this inevitability about it, it's like I was there all along.","99":"Yeah, yeah. It's like one thing is moving in one direction and one thing has arrived, so it's this tension and it's glorious. I love thinking about these things emotionally, just because that's a feeling, I know that feeling in my life.","100":"And so, we could play a bit of that if you want to. And we could talk about some stuff. I've been doing it in F. (keyboards playing Amazing Grace) (laughing) Thanks Herbie, that was a trip.","101":"Yeah, it's crazy. They're really a lot of bad or malicious hackers out there who are doing just that. They're going into people's accounts and they're stealing money, but there's also another side of computer hacking where there are people who are trying to learn how those bad hackers are actually breaking in to the bank accounts.","102":"Yeah, exactly. They're looking for ways that they can create protection. It's kind of like the lock on your front door. That lock is to essentially prevent bad people from coming in or people accidentally coming in when they shouldn't. A hacker is essentially looking at a way, how can I get into this lock? But then there are the good ones who are trying to unlock it so that they can tell the company that made the lock, hey, we can actually protect people by making the lock a little harder.","103":"In many cases, they'll send them a new lock. So it's an upgraded, better version. Sometimes that's new features, but sometimes that's bug fixes and ways to protect you as well.","104":"That's a very good point. You should definitely make sure that you're obeying the law. They might work with the lock company and say, I'm trying to improve your product. And they're trying to find these holes or problems, and then share that with the company. Even though the good hacker is doing exactly the same thing as the bad hacker, it's the same exact skillset, and you're using the same exact techniques and information to try to break that lock, but your goal as a good hacker is really to help everyone like you and me to make sure that our stuff is protected. So hopefully they don't get in trouble because they're the good guys.","105":"I started going on the computer and playing video games, but I had some ideas of my own, and that's where I started to learn how to hack. I wanted to play with my friends on this video game and just change the way that things look.","106":"That's entirely possible. They may have done it for a reason, but you may have come up with a really good idea that, do you think there are other people who might like the idea that you came up with?","107":"When you have creative ideas like that, hacking can actually allow you to change the way a system works, and that means you can change a game and how the game is played, and then you can share that with your friends and other people who like that game. Once I started learning how to do it, I found that, things that were harder for me, I could make easier.","108":"You know an interesting topic is: what are the limits to what we can do with virtual reality? Where I'm pretty pleased with what we have today. What we can show people and say virtual reality, its cool. People get an amazing response from it. But we're still clearly a very, very long ways from reality.","109":"Right. And so, to say that another way, when you're collecting data from the real world and then building machine learning systems that automate decisions based on that data, all of the biases and problems that are already in the real world then can be magnified through that machine learning system. And so, it can make many of these problems much worse.","110":"And so, it's not just the provenance of that data, but it's, sort of, deeply understanding, Why does it look the way it looks? Why was it collected this way? What are the limitations of it? We need to think about that in entire process, how we document that process. This is an issue in companies where somebody might create something that even their peers can't recreate.","111":"Good to see you Mike, nice to have you here with me. So we go way back. 1991, the year I got married, I moved across the country, left my husband in New Jersey, to work with you in Livermore.","112":"And I've been talking sort of, started with sort of what is a laser through linear optics, non linear optics, high intensity laser physics, and saying that you know, we're trying to get to that Schwinger limit of 10 to the 29 watts per square centimeter. We're about somewhere just shy of 10 to the 23 I think at this point. But even if we get to 100 petawatts and focus that down to a wavelength, we're not at 10 to the 29. So you're hoping to build the biggest laser.","113":"Or we need, going around and giving my talks now, I show how we're plateauing. I showed how there was a plateau, CPA raises it up, but we're sort of starting to plateau again and we need another Nobel Prize winning idea. And so do you think it's on the horizon? Do you see anything out there that really says, oh yeah that's a good way to go? 'Cos we're gonna have to get out to the x-rays right? We can't stay in the visual.","114":"Okay so there's a lot of us working around the world on these high intensity lasers and so, what do you think the real fun is? What do you see the real excitement being?","115":"Nowadays there's a lot of concerns around some applications of machine learning like deep fakes where it can kind of learn how I talk and learn how you talk and even how we look, and generate videos of us. We're doing this for real, but you could imagine a computer synthesizing this conversation eventually.","116":"So we've been talking about gravity from Newton and celestial bodies, the Earth, the Moon, pulling on each other in the conventional sense of gravity being an attractive force, to the Earth creating curves in space-time, then we moved on to just diffused seas of energy and space-time as the real universe and gravitation is really just talking about space-time in general, and here we are, and you're really hardcore in theoretical physics. Where would you take the exposition of gravity from that point?","117":"So when we think about quantum mechanics, we think about particles and their quantum charges in the Feynman way, the way that Feynman taught us. They come in and they exchange a force carrier and then they come out again, so that's how we think of an electron and light scattering, for instance, or something like that. And the language that Einstein gave us is so different. It's completely geometric, it's all this space-time. And it's also unnecessary.","118":"This idea that the darkest phenomenon in the universe actually is forced to radiate quantum particles is pretty wild. I think everyone understood that it was a correct calculation, but I don't think a lot of people understood the implications, that it meant something really terrible was happening. Because this black hole, which could have been made of who knows what, is disappearing into these quantum particles which, in some sense, have nothing to do with the material that went in. So do you think that's a big crisis? The black hole evaporates, the information is lost?","119":"So this is a huge crisis 'cause either quantum mechanics is wrong, and as you described it, it's the most accurately-tested paradigm in the history of physics, how could it be wrong, right? Or the event horizon is letting information out and violating one of the most sacred principles of relativity.","120":"That's a nice way of looking at it. So that you're not actually violating classical relativity once you're in a regime where the wave function has really peaked around a very well-defined stage.","121":"Do you think it's possible that gravity is really ultimately just quantum mechanics and doesn't exist at all in the fundamental ways that we've been talking about so far, like the Newtonian way and the space-time way, that those are just these kind of macroscopic illusions? Sometimes I talk about it in terms of temperature. Temperature is not a thing. There is no single thing called temperature. It's a macroscopic illusion that comes from the collective behavior, really quantum behavior of random motions of atoms. And is it possible that the whole of gravity is some kind of emergent illusion from what's really quantum phenomenon underlying it?","122":"So that's just like saying there's the idea of a dual description. It's just saying there's a perfect dictionary between these two descriptions, and so to belabor which one's real is silly. It's like saying, is French or is English real?","123":"So on code.org, one of the things you've been doing is actually building a game or that they have a game and then you can actually rewire some of the inputs and outputs of that. Is that right?","124":"Okay. With computer hacking, it's actually the same thing. Really, you have some sort of system and you have a bunch of inputs and you have some sort of output, and actually you, as the designer, you're essentially designing games and software. You're saying, well, I will only allow a user to really control these inputs. Can you think of any inputs the computer might have?","125":"Yep, there's also things like your mouse and there's even things like the microphone itself is actually an input device. It's taking something from you, which is the sound and it's then transmitting that, ad it's actually sending it to me. Are there any other things that you can talk to a computer? You can give it information.","126":"That's absolutely another input that exists on your computer. That's how I try to think of things is there's just a bunch of inputs. Often, if you're trying to break something or hack something, you're really saying, okay, how can I control these inputs in a way that wasn't necessarily expected?","127":"Typically, it's going to be something like the keyboard, right? I'm just going to be typing keystrokes to be talking to some piece of software or hardware, but other times it can be other things like even the temperature of a computer can actually affect how the computer operates, and it might be advantageous to me to cool down the computer and actually slow down the movement of electrons in something like memory, so that if a computer shuts off, it stores something that wasn't memory like a password and stores it for a long enough time that I might be able to actually extract it through some other methods.","128":"So have you spent any time thinking about this weird quality of the laws of physics, that there's no mathematical distinction in the laws between forward in time and backward in time? Is that something you're familiar with?","129":"Well, certainly it starts with human subjective experience, but then we are able to elevate it to a more objective description, for instance, when we introduce words like disorder and order, and entropy in the second law of thermodynamics. And the equation, usually the way we say it, is S equals K log W, entropy equals Boltzmann constant times log of a particular quantity, which is ultimately counting the number of distinct configurations that a system can be in. What Boltzmann and others showed is that entropy tends to increase toward the future. But the key word there is tends to increase. So this arrow of time going from the past to the future rests on a curious foundation. It's a statistical foundation, which says that it's more likely for eggs to splatter than unsplatter. It's more likely for glasses to smash than unsmash, but not that it's impossible for things to happen. You just have to wait a really long time for there to be a reasonable chance of it ever taking place.","130":"If I take a film of that electron, and it's a little fanciful to describe it that language because you know about quantum mechanics and so forth, but I take a film of a little particle moving around, and I show you that film, you'll be really hard-pressed to determine whether I've shown you the film running forward in time or whether I've shown you the film going in reverse time. If I had two, or three, or four,or a gazillion particles into the mix, then it will be much easier for you to determine whether the film is going forward in time or backward in time. But order and disorder don't have much meaning if there's only one particle. And that's why the fundamental laws don't draw a distinction, but the macroscopic experience does, but it raises a key question. Where'd the order of the egg come from? If everything goes toward disorder, how did I get this orderly collection of atoms called an egg? Well, you probably would say from--","131":"Do you remember the scene in Interstellar? They're going to a planet that's near a black hole. They go down to the planet, and they spend just a couple hours there, but when they go back to the ship, it's 23 years later on the ship because time is elapsing slowly near the strong gravitational field, comparatively quickly far away. And that's not science fiction, that's actually how time behaves.","132":"Well, but that's even a really, really good point. The GPS would become completely inaccurate in a very short period of time if the satellites weren't taken account of, or the software wasn't taking account of the fact that time elapses differently for the clocks on the satellite compared to the clocks down here on earth. So we walk around with general relativity in our pockets even though most of us perhaps don't really know that.","133":"Okay. I just think of physics as the study of everything. What stuff is, what stuff does. So today we're gonna talk about space, and in particular the idea of dimensions. Have you heard about dimensions?","134":"But here's what I want you to think about. If I say I'm at this point on the line, I could translate that into saying I'm at the three centimeter point, if I were here I'd be at the four centimeter point, the five centimeter point, right?","135":"We need one number to tell you where we are. That's one dimension. That's what it means to be one dimensional. I only need to tell you one number to figure out where we are.","136":"So those are the dimensions. That's how we think about dimensions. Remember, we just needed one number to find ourselves on the line, we need two numbers to find ourselves on the plane.","137":"This is why physicists think about things we don't know about. We're wondering whether there could be extra dimensions you've never seen. Yeah. That are tinier than atoms. So, okay. So what have you learned? What do you know about dimensions now? How do you think about dimensions in a slightly different way than you did before?","138":"I think so. I think you're right. All right Hank, we want you to keep up studying, learn a lot of math and physics and help us discover new dimensions some day. Does that sound like a fun idea?","139":"I think to really get deep into nanomaterials and nanoscale devices, you really have to understand to some level, quantum mechanics. What it teaches us as we make these devices smaller and smaller, their properties begin to now depend on the size and the orientation of these devices. There are materials, and you're taking a 2D materials class, you know about this, that are intrinsically thin. As they're grown, as they're fabricated, they're already at the nanoscale and they possess these quantum confinement properties that as a nanotechnologist, you try to exploit. And so the first ones I wanted to talk to you about are quantum dots, have you heard of quantum dots before?","140":"So these are typically semiconductors. They can be cadmium selenide cadmium sulfide, zinc selenide and they're small clusters of atoms. They can be from 2 to 10 nanometers. What's interesting about these materials?","141":"That's correct. Yeah. Because of quantum confinement, once you get below this 15 nanometer range, the band gap of the material depends completely on the size of the material. So in bulk materials, if you want to change the band gap, you have to change the material, right? But in these quantum dots specifically, just by changing the size, you can change their band gap. And because their band gap is changing, their optical properties are different. And you can precisely tune the wavelength of light that they emit just by changing their size.","142":"Carbon nanotube, right. So if you roll up graphene, depending on how you roll it and the angle, you roll it with, it has different properties. So if I roll it one way, it'll act like a metal. If I roll it a different way, it'll act like a semiconductor. The one that gets everyone most excited is that the electrons and holes move very fast through graphene. And so there's a lot of interest in using these for certain types of high-speed electronics. The other interesting application is because it's one atom thin, it's very sensitive to changes in the environment. And so there's a lot of interest in using them as diagnostics. It's on us researchers to find ways to A, control that process and then B, to actually build some sort of interesting technology from them.","143":"Yeah. 100%. That's right. And that's the motivation for looking at these emerging materials. But I would never bet against the innovation and the creativity in this nano electronic space. Tens of thousands of scientists, every time they hit a barrier, at least historically, as a guide, they have found a way to overcome it. It's a real marvel in ingenuity.","144":"It's just pretty lights. [laughing] But now that you suggested it, these were inspired by the array of quantum dots that we showed earlier. So that's the story I'm going to stick with. [laughing] I like it.","145":"You know, you're right. When you read about some of these technologies, it does feel like science fiction. But the part of nanotechnology I wanted to talk to you about is stuff that you probably use every day, most of your day, all of the time. Can you guess what aspect of nanotechnology I'm gonna talk to you about?","146":"So this is a silicon wafer, and they're embedded in basically almost every object that you use, from a laptop, to a phone, to cars, television sets, appliances. We ended up cutting these into little squares and those repeating patterns, each of those is a processor. And those chips are what goes into all of these objects. What I want to talk to you about is how we got from where we started, and how we're able to actually fit 18 billion of these little devices in a little one inch by one inch area. They're called transistors. It's a switch. Very simply, think of it as a light switch that turns on and turns off using an electric field by applying a voltage.","147":"I went through my kid's Lego bins to build a very simple model of a transistor. And these are wired together in circuits so that you can do computation. You can do logic with them. Where nanotechnology comes into play, the way you double the number of transistors on a chip. Can you guess what you would have to do to this transistor?","148":"You have to make it smaller. Exactly. But here's the problem. So about 10 to 15 years ago, the devices got so small that if you shrunk them this gate, that actually turns it on and off loses its ability to control the channel. And so what they did, was they took devices like this into these things, we call them, FinFETs, kind of like a fin on a fish. So they're very thin transistors. The width of these fins is only six nanometers. Okay? So 6 nanometers is 25 to 30 atoms across. And they repeat this over the entire wafer just about perfectly. It's just a huge feat in engineering. But these types of devices are exactly the kind of devices that your phones and computers either have, or will have in the near future. And it's a way that nanotechnology is directly impacting you right now.","149":"Even if it is a human-made concept that the universe evolved, developed, changed through time, ultimately giving rise to galaxy, stars, planets, and on this particular planet, life. That conception of time gives a feel that it's like universal, that it's out there, it's the same for everybody. It's independent of our actions or activities. Do you know that Albert Einstein shattered that view of time? He found that if you and I, say, have identical wrist watches, I'm sitting still and I'm watching you move, I will find that your clock is taking off time more slowly than my clock. But you know what's really remarkable? You can figure out this quality of time if you know one fact, that the speed of light is constant. Have you ever heard that phrase?","150":"Yeah, if you're clever, you can use that with high school algebra, maybe even a little high school trigonometry to make it even easier, to derive that clocks take off time at different rate. Do you want me to show you how that goes?","151":"All right, so to figure out the effect of motion on time, I'm gonna use a really simple clock, it's called a light clock. It's two mirrors that are facing each other.","152":"So where people are swiping credit cards, those credit card numbers were stolen. They hired a company to come in and perform a penetration test to see, can the good guys essentially break in again to prevent this sort of thing in the future? And when this team came in, they found they actually were able to get pretty much to the same point of sale system, and the way they did that was by exploiting an internet-connected deli meat scale. Once the company was able to essentially get into the deli scale, because the deli scale was on the internal network, then they were able to really escalate privilege and find a vulnerability within another system. Essentially, that just got them into the network. and once you're in the network, it's often really easy to then escalate from there.","153":"Yeah, that's another interesting concept. It's really just different layers that we have for protection, because often when you're talking about something like a corporate network, or even your home network, you typically have sort of one level of defense, right? If someone can break that or it can get in through some other system that is connected or exposes some other protocol, like Bluetooth, right? You can connect to a Bluetooth device without being on the wireless network, without being on the LAN. That potentially gives you another place that you can pivot on and then access other devices, because if something has both Bluetooth and also Wi-Fi, well, if you can get in through Bluetooth, then you can then access the Wi-Fi and get to other devices on the network. Are you familiar with buffer overflows?","154":"If we were to write a program that asked for your name and you typed in your name, but before you could type in your name, in a low leveling, which is like C or C++, you'd have to allocate some memory. So you might allocate a buffer of a hundred bytes because whose name is going to be longer than a hundred bytes or a hundred character? But what happens if you were to not really check that they limited to a hundred bytes? Do you know what happens if they essentially start typing over that hundred bytes?","155":"But what's really cool about that is, when you're going into memory, you're starting to cross over that boundary of that hundred byte allocation, and now you're starting to write over additional memory. That other memory is really important stuff. So you have your name, the hundred bytes there, and then right next to your name is the return address, and that's the address that the code is gonna execute and it's going to return to after that function is done, and it's going to jump to that address, but after you type your hundred bytes, the next few bites that you type, you're actually going to overwrite that return address. So that return address could essentially be another address in memory. So what you end up doing is you type a name and it's not really a name, it's really just code. And that code, you keep typing until you get to the return address, and you start typing an address, which is really the beginning of your name and your computer or your processor is actually going to read that address and it will jump back to the beginning and then execute that payload. So that was sort of the very first thing that I think was super exciting to me when I started learning about really reverse engineering.","156":"Black holes are so amazing that when the neutron star stops and there's something actually there. There's material there. If it's so heavy it becomes a black hole, so it keeps falling, once the event horizon of the black hole forms, which is the shadow, the curve that's so strong that not even light can escape, the material keeps falling. And like you said, maybe space-time breaks down right at the center there, but whatever happens, the star's gone, that black hole is empty. So in a weird way black holes are a place and not a thing.","157":"[Janna] Yes, they ring space-time also like a drum, and you can record the sound of that ringing after a billion years, when it's traveled through the universe. But then the next thing that happens is those neutron stars collide, and because of this incredibly high energy state of matter, which you study, it becomes this firework of different explosions. It's really quite spectacular.","158":"So when the gravitational waves were recorded and they realized, oh this sounds like, you can reconstruct the shape and size of the mallets of the drum from the sound, these sounds like neutron stars colliding, not black holes. And so, like you said, there was a trigger for satellites and experiments all over the world to point roughly in the direction that the sound was coming from. So, from your point of view, they're like two super-conducting giant magnets colliding, an experiment you could never do on Earth. That's just the most tremendous scales and peculiarities of matter.","159":"So my son is five years old. And he asked me what kind of science I do. And I said fusion. And I said I put a star in a jar. Does that make sense?","160":"That's a good answer. Because it sounds a little ridiculous, right? How can we put a star in a jar? Well, we're not actually gonna put the sun, which is a star, inside a jar, but instead we're gonna take the same kind of material that the sun is made out of, and we're going to hold it for a really long time in some kind of container. So fusion is about bringing things together. That's what fusing means. When those fusion reactions occur, a new particle is created, and energy is also released. Do you know what an atom is?","161":"All right, so an atom is what everything in our world is made of. And at the very center of the atom is what we call a nucleus. And inside that nucleus is a proton. We want to take those protons and push them together to make them combine and release energy, fusion energy, that we can use to make electricity. And there's a lot of different energies and forces that we have to think about. Have you heard of gravity?","162":"There you go, yeah! And so if we want to take those protons and push them together to make them combine and release energy, fusion energy, that we can use to make electricity, then we have to actually overcome that strong electrostatic force that just want to make those balls bounce off of each other. There's another force which you might be familiar with, which is like a magnetic force.","163":"You know, scientists are still studying exactly how magnetism works, right? It'll still be there for you to tackle when you become a scientist. Have you ever seen one of these games?","164":"With the iron filing. So if you take this and you take the magnetic end, maybe you can show us what's gonna happen with it. While you move around those iron filings with the magnet, you're totally in control of that material. You're pushing, you're pulling it, you're moving it around. And so you're using this magnetic force to also do something useful for you. Have you learned about the states of matter?","165":"Yes, we absolutely do. We hold it inside the container with the magnetic fields. So you didn't have to actually touch the iron filings in the toy to move them around. You could pass the magnetic field through the plastic and control them with it. So it's the same thing. We don't have to touch this very, very hot plasma to control it and hold it in place because we use magnetic fields. You are so smart. I'm so glad that science is your favorite subject.","166":"[laughs] That's exactly right. It kinda is like recharging your battery, right? And sleep is so critical for so many parts of our body and our mind, right? It plays a really important way that we learn, and it helps us kind of recover from the day before. It affects our immune system and our metabolism, all of these things that we need to kinda be healthy.","167":"And so what's really cool about this is that giraffes need to sleep like everybody else, and so the way that it does is it kind of slumps over and it gets down on its legs and it kind of becomes this ball, but what's crazy about the whole thing is they only sleep for like 30 minutes a day. 30 minutes! Because it can't waste any more time, because it can't be vulnerable for any longer. It can get eaten by lions and that kind of thing. It has kind of evolved in a way that it can still survive and still get all the restoration it needs under such a short period of time.","168":"So we think it works the same way, but maybe just like more efficiently. And so we're still really learning about how this works. Sleep science itself is kind of a new field.","169":"Really tired. Do you think you were a little crankier than usual? Yeah. That's actually really interesting, because what happens is humans and everything needs to sleep eventually, and so you can't stay up indefinitely, right? What do you think happens if you don't sleep?","170":"Right, right! So how do they do it? In the area that they live in, they need to stay cool, right? And so they spend a lot of time in the water, and so then as a consequence, they need to sleep in the water, but how do they do it? So it's really fascinating. What they do is while they're sleeping, they actually float back up to the surface and breathe without waking up. They're able to go about their whole sleep cycles but still able to breathe, because their body has adapted in a way that they can still get the oxygen that they need. It's a really amazing thing. What do you think?","171":"A dolphin! Yes. So dolphins, kind of like hippos, have to sleep in the water, okay? But because they're mammals, right, they need to breathe. Dolphins breathe air. They have to go up to the surface and breathe, right? And for an animal like that, it needs to figure out a way that it can sleep but also still survive, right? You know how dolphins sleep?","172":"One half of their brain at a time. So half of their brain goes to sleep, and the other half stays awake, so that they can continue to breathe and swim, and they do it in this four hours a time, so like their right part of their brain sleeps, they're able to go up to the surface and breathe. Then their left part of their brain sleeps for four hours, and it goes back and forth, back and forth, so they can kind of maintain alertness, still breathe, and survive. Is that amazing or what?","173":"And is this a good thing, do you think? Or an inevitable thing that we, the programmers, we, the computer scientists, the data scientists who are inventing these things, can't actually explain how they work? Because I feel like friends of mine in industry, even when it's something simple and relatively familiar like auto complete, they can't actually tell me why that name is appearing at the top of the list. Whereas years ago when these algorithms were more deterministic and more procedural, you could even point to the line that made that name bubble up to the top.","174":"In classes I teach, certainly spend a lot of time on fundamentals, algorithms that have been taught in classes for decades now, whether it's binary search, linear search, bubble sorts, selection sort or the like, but if we're already at the point where I can pull up chat GPT, copy paste a whole bunch of numbers or words and say, Sort these for me, does it really matter how Chat GPT is sorting it? Does it really matter to me as the user how the software is sorting it? Do these fundamentals become more dated and less important do you think?","175":"Okay. So this is about high intensity lasers. Not only how do you make them, but what was really stopping them being made in both cases is non linear optics. We wanna do something that requires a huge photon density application, and so that's how come we came up with chirped pulse amplification, so that we could stretch the pulse, safely amplify it, then compress it at the end, and then we're ready to do whatever we want at the end. So what do you think the main difference is between the continuous wave laser that you have that runs at 10 watts and a chirped pulse amplifier?","176":"And so we get the power with a lot less energy 'cause its power is energy per unit time. So we aren't depositing much energy in comparison. Can I just ask, 'cause you are using the thermal process of it heating up, but have you ever had the opportunity to use laser tweezers?","177":"So chirped pulse amplification took us sort of from, we were at 10 to the 12, but when I was working the 10 to the 12 sort of sat on a football sized field. It was a kilojoule laser with a nanosecond pulse. And we brought it down to something we call tabletop terawatt. So it was the same terawatt but now it was one joule and one picosecond, so it could fit on a basic optical bench like you would have in your lab. We were able to take that up to, I think the record is right around somewhere between 10 to the 22 and 10 to the 23 watts per square centimeter. So then in going forward, one of the holy grails is can we reach 10 to the 29 watts per square centimeter? So we still have six orders. So we've gone from 10 to the 12 to 10 to the 23. So we've done 11 orders, so you think six isn't so much harder. I have to tell you, over time, it's rolling over. We need another Nobel Prize winning idea. But if we get out there, that's where, if you focus the intensity, the energy in that volume is enough to break the vacuum.","178":"I don't know if people are working on that because I'm not so much in the medical field, but I should look into that and see if that's a possibility. So after hearing about high intensity lasers, can you think about next time you go back to the lab and you're wondering how to do something in the lab with lasers, can you see how short pulses might help you?","179":"Do you think there are going to be general principles that guide those decisions? Because right now, it's generally up to the machine learning engineer to decide what tools they want to apply.","180":"If you train a model off of language off the internet, it sometimes says uncomfortable things or inappropriate things and sometimes really biased things. Have you ever run into this yourself? And then how do you think about that problem of potentially even measuring the bias in a model that we've trained?","181":"The end goal of reality, of course in computer graphics people chase photo-realistic form for a long time. And basically, we've achieved it. Photo-realism, if you're willing to throw enough discreet path traced rays at things, you can generate photo-realistic views. And we understand the light really well. Of course it still takes a half hour per frame like it always has, or more, to render the different things. So its an understood problem and given infinite computing power we could be doing that in virtual reality. However, a point that I've made to people in recent years is that, we are running out of More's Law. Maybe we'll see some wonderful breakthrough in quantum structures or whatever--","182":"But if we just wind up following the path that we're on, we're gonna get double and quadruple, but we're not gonna get 50 times more powerful than we are right now. We will run into atomic limits on our fabrication. So given that, I'm trying to tell people that, start buying back into optimization, start buying back into thinking a bit more creatively. Because you can't just wait, its not going to get to that point where it really is fixed to those highest degrees just by waiting for computing to be advanced. If we want this to be something used by a billion people then we need it to be lighter, cheaper, more comfortable.","183":"You know there's tons of opportunities for the synthetic case where you want to be able to have your synthetic fantasy world where everybody is a creature that's created by the computer and simulated reasonably. But of course we've got, you know we still don't do people well simulated. That's a hard problem, we've been beating our heads against it for a long time. I do think we're making progress and I wouldn't bet on that being solved in 10 years, but maybe 20 years. Because it is going to take a lot of AI. Its going to take a lot of machine-learning, where its not going to be a matter of us dissecting all the micro-expressions that people do. Its gonna be lets take every youtube video ever made and run it through some enormous learner that's going to figure out how to make people realistic.","184":"So, when you say it's an inverse-square law, that means that the closer you are, the more strongly you feel the gravitational pull. And that makes sense. There's very few things that are stronger when you're further apart.","185":"So you can also think of a gravitational field, something that permeates all of space. Even though the earth is three stories below us, it's not as though it's pulling at us from a distance. We're actually interacting with the field at this point and there's a real interaction right here at this point. And that's nice, because people were worried that if things acted at a distance, that the way that old-fashioned inverse-square force law describes it, that it was as spooky as mind-bending a spoon, that it was like telekinesis. If you don't touch something, how do you affect it? And so the first step was to start to think of gravity as a field that permeates all of a space. And it's weaker very far from the Earth and it's closer very close to the Earth. So one way to think of this field as a field that's really describing a curved space-time that is everywhere. Forget the difficulty of the math, just the intuition comes from two kind of simple observations. One was what Einstein described as the happiest thought of his life. So, right now, you might feel heavy in your chair, and we might feel heavy on the floor and our feet, or standing in an elevator cab. And Einstein said, what does the chair have to do with it, or the floor, or the elevator? Those aren't gravitational objects. So he wanted to eliminate them, and one way to do the thought experiment is to imagine standing in an elevator that you can see out of, a black box. And imagine the cable is cut and you and the elevator begin to fall.","186":"You're in total free fall. Now, because things fall at the same rate, including the elevator and you, you can actually float in the elevator. If you just floated in the elevator, the two of you would drop, and you might not even know you're falling. You could take an apple and drop it in front of you, and it would float in front of you. You would actually experience weightlessness. It's called the equivalence principle. It was Einstein's happiest thought that what you're really doing when you're experiencing gravity isn't being heavy in your chair, it's falling weightlessly in the gravitational field. And that was the first step, to think of gravity as weightlessness and falling.","187":"You can make somebody look like they're in the International Space Station by flying up in a plane and then just free-falling, the plane just drops out of the air. And while it's falling, they will float weightlessly, and there's been a lot of experiments about it, but you don't want it to end unhappily, so the plane has to scoop back up, and then you see them become pinned to the floor of the plane, because then the plane is interrupting their fall. So that's the first thought, and then the next is, what is the shape that's chased? So if you were floating in empty space, really empty space, and you had an apple, and you threw the apple, what shape do you think it would chase, the path?","188":"Yeah, it would chase a curve, it would chase an arc. And the faster you throw it, the kind of longer the arc. So the second step to think about curved space-time is to say that when things fall freely around a body like the Earth, they trace curved paths, as though space-time itself, space itself was curved.","189":"You went, Oh. [Janna and Lisa laugh] So, that's the intuition, that's how Einstein gets from thinking that space-time is curved from the idea that, well, there's this field that permeates all of space, and what is really describing is the curves that things fall along. And from there, it's a very long path to finding the mathematics and the right description, that's really hard. But that intuition is so elegant and so beautiful and just comes from these two simple thought experiments.","190":"So you described learning in a class about light the theory of special relativity where Einstein is really adhering to the constancy of the speed of light and questioning the absolute nature of space and time. And it seems like that has nothing to do with gravity, but he later begins to think about the incompatibility of gravity with his theory of relativity. So suppose the Sun were to disappear tomorrow. Some evil genius comes and just figures out a way to evaporate the Sun. In Newton's understanding of gravity, we would instantaneously know about it all the way over here at the Earth. And that's incompatible with the concept that nothing can travel faster than the speed of light. No information, not even information about the Sun, could possibly travel faster than the speed of light. So we shouldn't know about what happened to the Sun for a full eight minutes, which is the time it would take light to travel to us. And so he begins to question why gravity is so incompatible with relativity, but he already knows he's thinking about space and time in relativity. So then he gets to his general theory of relativity where he realizes if I eliminate everything but just the gravitational field of let's say the Earth and I look at how things fall and I see that they follow curves, well, then he realizes that space and time don't just contract or dilate, that they can really warp, that they can bend and that they can curve. And then he finds a way to make gravity compatible with relativity by saying if the Sun were to disappear tomorrow, the curves that the Sun imprinted in space-time would actually begin to ripple, and those are the gravitational waves, and they would change and they would flatten out, 'cause the Sun was no longer there. And that would take the light-travel time to get to us to tell us that the Sun was gone, and then we would stop orbiting and just travel along a straight line.","191":"And I dare say, even though you might not have put this word on it, odds are you executed as a human, multiple algorithms today even before you came here today. Like what were a few things that you did?","192":"Okay, so all of those, frankly, if we really dove more deeply, could be broken down into step-by-step instructions. And presumably your mom, your dad, someone in the past sort of programmed you as a human to know what to do. And then after that, as a smart human, you can sort of take it from there and you don't need their help anymore. But that's kind of what we're doing when we program computers. Something maybe even more familiar nowadays, like odds are you have a cell phone. Your contacts or your address book. But let me ask you why that is. Like why does Apple or Google or anyone else bother alphabetizing your contacts?","193":"That, in of itself, is kind of a problem or it's an inefficient solution to the problem. So, it turns out that back in my day, before there were cell phones, everyone's numbers from my schools were literally printed in a book, and everyone in my town and my city, my state was printed in an actual phone book. Even if you've never seen this technology before, how would you propose verbally to find John in this phone book?","194":"Yeah. So, let me propose that we start that way. I could just start at the beginning and step by step I could just look at each page, looking for John, looking for John. Now even if you've never seen this here technology before, it turns out this is exactly what your phone could be doing in software, like someone from Google or Apple or the like, they could write software that uses a technique in programming known as a loop, and a loop, as the word implies, is just sort of do something again and again. What if instead of starting from the beginning and going one page at a time, what if I, or what if your phone goes like two pages or two names at a time? Would this be correct do you think?","195":"Yeah, so sort of accidentally and frankly with like 50\/50 probability, John could get sandwiched in between two pages. But does that mean I have to throw that algorithm out altogether?","196":"Okay, that's nice. So, you could kind of like go twice as fast but then kind of pump the brakes as you near your exit on the highway, or in this case near the J section of the book.","197":"And maybe alternatively, if I get to like A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, if I get to the K section, then I could just double back like one page just to make sure John didn't get sandwiched between those pages. So, the nice thing about that second algorithm is that I'm flying through the phone book like two pages at a time. So, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12. It's not perfect, it's not necessarily correct but it is if I just take one extra step. So, I think it's fixable, but what your phone is probably doing and frankly what I and like my parents and grandparents used to do back in the day was we'd probably go roughly to the middle of the phone book here, and just intuitively, if this is an alphabetized phone book in English, what section am I probably going to find myself in roughly?","198":"Yeah. So, John is going to be to the left or the right and what we can do here, though your phone does something smarter, is tear the problem in half, throw half of the problem away, being left with just 500 pages now. But what might I next do? I could sort of naively just start at the beginning again, but we've learned to do better. I can go roughly to the middle here.","199":"Yeah, exactly. So, now maybe I'm in the E section, which is a little to the left. So, John is clearly going to be to the right, so I can again tear the problem poorly in half, throw this half of the problem away, and I claim now that if we started with a thousand pages, now we've gone to 500, 250, now we're really moving quickly.","200":"And so, eventually I'm hopefully dramatically left with just one single page at which point John is either on that page or not on that page, and I can call him. Roughly how many steps might this third algorithm take if I started with a thousand pages then went to 500, 250, 125, how many times can you divide 1,000 in half? Maybe?","201":"That's roughly roughly 10. Because in the first algorithm, looking again for someone like Zoe in the worst case might have to go all the way through a thousand pages. But the second algorithm you said was 500, maybe 501, essentially the same thing. So, twice as fast. But this third and final algorithm is sort of fundamentally faster because you're sort of dividing and conquering it in half, in half, in half, not just taking one or two bites out of it out of a time. So, this of course is not how we used to use phone books back in the day since otherwise they'd be single use only. But it is how your phone is actually searching for Zoe, for John, for anyone else, but it's doing it in software.","202":"So, here we've happened to focus on searching algorithms, looking for John in the phone book. But the technique we just used can indeed be called divide and conquer, where you take a big problem and you divide and conquer it, that is you try to chop it up into smaller, smaller, smaller pieces. A more sophisticated type of algorithm, at least depending on how you implement it, something known as a recursive algorithm. Recursive algorithm is essentially an algorithm that uses itself to solve the exact same problem again and again, but chops it smaller, and smaller, and smaller ultimately.","203":"Excellent. I got an engineering physics degree. There you go, something in common. We're here today talking about lasers. So have you have had much exposure to lasers yet at school?","204":"Okay. As opposed to the experimental side and seeing things? Okay so I'm much more, I like to see the things happening. So then the question is, what's so special about making a light that's intense enough to actually possibly blow things up? Certainly we can blow atoms up with the laser hammer and when the laser light comes in and just smacks the electrons right off the atom. And so the question really is how do you make that? Back in the 70s and into the 80s, I know that was a long time ago for you, we had big energy lasers and we had short pulse lasers, we couldn't have big energy, short pulse lasers and actually it was my supervisor and I that figured the way around that and we got something called chirped pulse amplification. Have you heard of chirped pulse amplification by any chance?","205":"Well I brought a little bit of a prop to explain how chirped pulse amplification works. Our short pulses are made of different colors. So I've got a colored slinky here. We probably could've called it stretched pulse amplification but that's kind of boring so we used the word chirped. The word chirped comes around because birds chirp. When the birds are singing, the notes are actually changing audio frequency with time and that's a chirp. The point is is that when all the light is squeezed together like this, it's a short pulse. And that's when it's a hammer because all of the light is now concentrated and you can imagine if this was coming along and also using a lens to focus it small, then all of that light at the focal spot, concentrate. And so that was the laser hammer. So we can't have that in the laser. So the question is what could we do? The fact that it's different colors and different colors because of dispersion, travel different speeds inside material. So we used a long fiber, 1.4 kilometers of fiber but, in fiber, the red colors really haven't got that much in common with the glass atoms and so they spend very little time interacting and they travel fast. The red is going to start traveling faster than the green, faster than the blue and, as you travel down the fiber, next thing you know, you have a long pulse and it's chirped from red at the beginning to blue at the back. And so the frequencies go hoo! Like this okay? So this is a chirped pulse and now it's a long pulse. And so, first this is what we did, we chirped it, we stretched it, then we can safely amplify it because it's not all concentrated and, after we amplify it, then we use something called a compressor and we put all of the colors back together and it was back being a short pulse but a high energy pulse. And then we really had what I like to call a laser hammer. When this laser pulse goes inside, it smacks those electrons right off the atom.","206":"Well a lot of lasers and when lasers first came along, they were only single color. Your cat toy, would only be a single color, probably a red one and so that's just one color. And one color means that it has to really be there for the whole time. One color is one wave length of light and so it's just one wave that goes on and on and on. If you want a short pulse, you actually have to have all the colors. And if you can imagine that one point in time, and I like to say it's like a conductor of an orchestra. When you're listening to an orchestra warm up, they sound terrible, they're all playing their own notes. But when the conductor conducts them, they all play different notes but, together, it's beautiful music. So we have something in the laser called a mode locker and it's like the conductor and it says go now. And all the colors will start together but some colors are long wave length and others are shorter. So next thing you know, you have peaks meeting valleys and they cancel each other. And the more colors you can bring in, the faster that happens and the shorter the pulse you can make.","207":"The necklace is something that was designed for my Nobel prize. It's sold at the Nobel museum and it is a chirped pulse. So we've been talking a lot about lasers and applications, what have you learned about chirped pulses?","208":"Absolutely. And that's a great example because you have models that are operating to do things like figure out if a new email is spam or not. So what would you think about if you were looking at an email and trying to decide if it went in one category or another?","209":"So these are things we would call features. And we go through a process where we do feature engineering, where somebody looks at the example and says, Okay, these are the things that I think might allow us to statistically tell the difference from something in one category versus another. So for example, perhaps you don't speak Russian, you start getting a lot of email in Russian.","210":"This is a great question because it really gets to the difference between some of our different tools in our machine learning tool belt in addressing problems like this. So if we were to use a supervised learning classic classification approach, a person would need to think about those features and creatively come up with them in approach we call the kitchen sink approach, which is just try everything you can possibly think of and see what works. Unsupervised learning, where we don't have labeled data and we're trying to infer some structure out of the data is you're projecting that data into a space and looking for things like clusters. And there's a bunch of really fun math about how you do that, how you think about distance and by distance, I mean that if we have two data points in space, how do we decide if they're similar or not?","211":"You can just barely tell. And you can see that even, like if you hold out your hand and you focus on your hand, then your foot would be blurry because there's that difference there. And you can change between that, like you can then focus on your foot and your hand gets blurry. Because your eyes can see different amounts of detail in different places. So we're hoping in the future, that hardware can be like that. Where we can make a display that puts lots of detail right where you're looking. And every time you look someplace else, it moves the detail over to there. So we don't need to render a hundred times as much as we've got right now. Figuring out where you're looking is a pretty hard problem. What we try to go about this, is by taking a camera and looking at people's eyes and then try to figure out is the eye looking over here or up here. We're working hard on stuff like this right now so we hopefully can have a virtual reality that's as detailed and realistic feeling as the reality that we've actually got around us. But its going to be a long time before we get to where we can really fool people.","212":"It's really fascinating work, especially now we're all familiar with the viruses and how they act. And I'm not aware of any viruses that build nanostructures. So how did you come to that? And then how do you actually program a virus to do your bidding?","213":"So you've evolved, and I suppose, trained these viruses to build the materials that you want them to build by exposing them to the raw materials and then evolving their function. We're talking about the electronics from nanomaterials. That critical issue that we're facing is how do you go from those single experiments with a single material, understanding its properties, how do you scale that to the billions of devices that you need in a technology? It is a chemistry driven approach. We're not going to grow them exactly where we want them, but to take that one step, and to tie into what you're doing, tt sounds like there could be an area of collaboration where instead of using conventional chemistry, that we can train some of these biological elements to do that work work for us.","214":"One of the things I love about about nanoscience is it tends to break up the silos between those traditional scientific disciplines. My training was in chemistry, but I had to very quickly merged chemistry and physics. And now I see an area where chemistry, physics, and biology are coming together to produce new materials and new technology, and to advance the field forward. And so being in this field, you kind of have to cross pollinate between these different disciplines and kind of advance the field together.","215":"The reason we're not just flying off the earth is because earth has gravity, so if we throw something up, it comes back down, so that's why when we're walking on the earth, we don't fly off the earth because the earth has gravity, and it keeps us down.","216":"The main thing about black hole to remember is that it's just, like I said, how the earth holds you down, the black hole pulls you in, as well. Now, try and take the ball from me, black hole--","217":"Yes, we're gonna talk about science and we're gonna talk about a very specific kinda science, about people who study brains. Do you know what a brain is? What is it?","218":"Okay, well there's more cells in your brain, like way more cells, than all the stars we can see. (Daniel gasps) (Bobby laughs) And so what the connectome is, is we'd like to know where every cell in your brain is and how it talks to every other cell in your brain.","219":"So often, when we try to give the basic idea of what time is, I'm fond of saying, Look, space is the language that allows us to say where events take place, and time is the language that allows us to specify when they take place. Where would you jump off from there and trying to give a deeper understanding of the basics of time?","220":"To note our recent paper, where we were thinking about Einstein's ideas of special relativity, but in a setting where the global shape of the space time, we imagine there might be a curled up dimension of space, a circular dimension and thought about how special relativity works in that setting, we came to a result in this very basic setting. You can send signals into the past, not in a way that will violate causality. Did that surprise you, that by going from the usual topology that doesn't have a closed part of space, but making that one change, you could have this radical impact?","221":"And the beauty of it is, it is not like there is some high-powered mathematical methodology, straightforward algebra that a high school kid would know is all that you need to extract these unusual results.","222":"And so the old idea that of course we always hear about, that if we ever make contact with extraterrestrial life, if they're far away, we can't really have a conversation because we'll say hello, and then like 10,000 years or 100,000 years later, they'll answer us 'cause they'll take that long for the signals. But at least in this setup, which we don't know is true about our universe, but if it were, then you could have a real-time conversation over arbitrarily large distances, which is--","223":"Many people have begun thinking about the possibility that space and time may be so-called emergent quantities that they're not as fundamental as perhaps Newton or Einstein would've thought. Where do you stand on that idea?","224":"One of the things that relativity also sheds a light on is what exists, that if someone's moving relative to me, what they consider now might be in my past, what they consider now might be in my future, which would suggest that all of time exists much as we're willing to accept that all of space exists. Is that cold water?","225":"So the side channel analysis is really looking not at a vulnerability within a system, but really unintended consequences of what the system is built on. A very simple example of a side channel is putting your ear to the ground to hear if there are horses coming towards you, and the same thing applies to technology. So you can have something like a CPU, it's executing instructions, certain instructions that use a little bit more power, and power is reserved in these capacitors, which are like tiny batteries next to your CPU. And as they're pulling power, there's something in physics called the electrostrictive effect where the capacitor will move in a very, very tiny amount. And then although we can't hear it, the microphone on a mobile device can actually listen to that. If you then listen to that and you say, oh, I see a pattern here, and you can go all the way down and then extract and reveal the full password, the full key, even though it could be argued that the algorithm itself, there's no problem with it.","226":"Yeah, I suppose the physical adjacency of the underlying transistors and capacitors that are holding that storage. That's crazy. I think the first time I heard of an interesting attack like that was learning about the cold boot attack. Being able to, you know, someone enters their password on their computer and that decrypts their hard drive and then they walk away. Being able to extract that password is really difficult. If I can pull that memory chip out and extract that memory, put it in my own device, except the problem is memory is volatile, so it'll erase as soon as I pull it out. You can take something like canned air, turn it upside down, cool that computer, make it real nice and cool. Then you have a minute or two to pull out the memory, put into your own device, extract the memory, and then you're good. It's such a simple method to really extract something kind of critical. Like Rowhammer, it's such a low level of vulnerability and you could argue that it's not necessarily a vulnerability in the architecture itself, but rather exploitation of physics at that point.","227":"The risk right now, just during this quarantine, is actually massive now that we think about it, because you might have these legacy systems. You know, they were built 20, 30 years ago, and it's too costly to upgrade, but now you can't actually have a lot of people in a single location, so potentially, they actually do have to now add some sort of remote capabilities to these systems that were never meant to be on the internet. Have you ever had any ethical concerns with the stuff you're interested in or the work you do?","228":"Especially now that we're seeing more and more companies who are trying to make it illegal for you to inspect the vehicle that you've purchased, right? Something that you actually own.","229":"What if it were illegal? Would you then do it? Fortunately it's not today, right? It hasn't been, you know, despite their attempts, none of that has been passed, but if you had a vehicle and you wanted to inspect it, but all of a sudden, it passed, I mean.","230":"But the laws don't always equate to hurting anyone. I ethically think similar to you in that, you know, what is moral to me is as long as I'm not intentionally hurting others, right?","231":"Maybe a mutual acquaintance of ours, Jasper gave a example of fault injection, and I like to use that as, when I'm trying to explain fault injection, he shows a pinball machine and the pinball machine, obviously the two inputs are the two plungers when you're playing a pinball machine, but fault injection, you can tilt the entire pinball machine, right? You're just introducing some external variable that's outside of the traditional inputs that you're used to and you've now controlled the environment in a advantageous way to the user or the player. Can you give an example of some type of fault injection that you're doing or working on?","232":"We're also scratching the surface of, like, what is possible? It's not necessarily just the system itself and not necessarily that algorithm itself. Like you said, you don't necessarily need to attack the math in some cases. You can just attack that check. And I think something that's been pretty cool is looking at higher energy particles. It's going to be maybe hard to entirely confirm, but I think it'd be really, really cool to actually see. Like, I want to see one of these faults because I haven't seen it myself. And also, how do you know that you've seen it? I've started playing with, like, setting up a cloud chamber. A cloud chamber lets you actually view high energy particles going through sort of like in a small jar with some evaporated alcohol. And I thought it'd be really cool if we put some memory chip in there, like a basic memory chip and we just fill it with some data, but then you put a camera on that area and you just watch. Assuming that there is a high energy particle that actually hits that memory, that should potentially flip the energy state of that bit. The outside microcontrollers should be able to read that and actually say, Oh wait, the data, even though I'm not changing data, I'm only reading data, and we should be able to visibly or optically see it. What I'm wondering is could that be a next area of research? Because I don't think anyone's actually looking at intentionally injecting high energy particles to take over a computer, when really, you know, that's another technique for fault injection, technically speaking.","233":"I've never seen... Maybe call it a verifiable visualization of it, right? We know it's true, you know, you can get skin cancer by going outside and having too many high energy particles hit you, but we've never seen it. And we know it can happen to a computer chip, but I've never seen both.","234":"It's a good one. The melody on its own just goes. (hums Amazing Grace) That melody on its own is kind of lonely, right? And no one really knows how it feels. (plays and hums Amazing Grace) So which one did you prefer?","235":"Yeah, ah, that's great. I can decide how I want this melody to feel and the more notes there are, the more exciting it is. That's what musical harmony is. Does that make sense?","236":"One of the weird things and wonderful things about wormholes is that they are tunnels, if you will, shortcuts from one point in space to another point in space. But once you have a shortcut from here to there, the beautiful thing is, if you move the openings, time will elapse differently at the different openings. So there's a possibility of wormholes as time machines. Go one direction, you're going into the future, go the other direction, you'd be going into the past. But that, of course, raises philosophical and logical--","237":"Yeah, so you go into the past, and maybe you can prevent your parents from meeting, but you're preventing them from meeting in the parallel reality, which means that you will never be born in that reality, but the origin of your birth is still completely understood, it was in the universe from which you originated. Another one that's more subtle is, the laws of physics may prevent you from interceding.","238":"Yeah, so that one, there's actually some people like Joe Polchinski who did some wonderful studies of billiard ball tables, where you imagine a billiard ball goes into a wormhole, comes out and hits the very ball that was going into the hole. And in that way, if it could knock it off course, we seem to be in some logical paradox.","239":"But the finding was, the ball can come out and just sort of graze the other one, but it can't affect it enough to prevent the sequence of events from happening. And the way I like to think about it frankly is if there's one universe, not parallel universes like in the other solution, moments in time just are. They don't change, the whole point of time is the variable along which change can happen. So if you have the atoms of time, the individual events, there's no conception of them changing. So whatever collection of influences were in play that allowed your parents to meet, they will always be in play because you were always part of that moment.","240":"And imagine I turn on two laser beams, sending a beam of light going to my right and to my left. And these beams will go around the entirety of space, and they'll both come back, and at some point, they will hit me. Imagine they hit me at the same moment from my perspective. Now imagine someone's moving relative to my frame of reference, say, to my left, they do the same experiment. They fire the beam of light left and right. Notice that the beam that they fire to their left will have to travel farther to reach them because they're moving away from it. Whereas the beam that they fired to their right will not have to travel as far because in some sense, they're moving toward it. The two beams of light will not hit that moving observer at the same moment.","241":"No, everybody else is moving relative to me, and it's real motion. So everybody else will be like the moving twin. They will be younger and I will be older. And when you think about past and future on a cosmological scale, there was a long period when there were no human beings in the universe. The fact of the matter is there will be these two long stretches with our presence being sort of a flicker in between, does that thought inform anything about how you live in your brief flicker within that brief flicker?","242":"It can be debilitating to imagine an eternal future of sort of nothing, where none of what we do sort of persist. On the other hand, if you flip your perspective around and say, How remarkable is it that we have this brief moment that allows us to think and feel and love and explore and illuminate, wow, how wonderful is that?","243":"I'm Levy Rozman. You might know me as Gotham Chess. Today I've been challenged with the task of explaining chess in five levels of increasing difficulty. Chess is an absolutely fascinating game. Think of it as a language. It's completely timeless. It's been around for thousands of years. It's also completExpert explaining chess to a novice","244":"For me, I would describe chess as a lot of what you said, and also, it's a mix of really quick plans like tactics and then things that can take four, five, six, seven moves like a plan, like a strategy. So let's practice. In this position, I had the white pieces. You're playing on my side. My opponent was playing with the black pieces. So we switched a little bit. So if I said, Hey, you get three moves in a row, can you come up with a plan?","245":"I'm very happy that's the first plan that you came up with, right? You can bring your queen out this way or the rook. You can start with both, and then you come here and then you checkmate. But I did say white gets three moves in a row, right?","246":"But that's how we have to think about plans, right? We have to think about, Okay, well if I get a couple of moves in a row, what would I like to accomplish? What does my opponent want to do? So I'm not just gonna sit here and get checkmated hopefully. Right? So what do you think I want to do in this position?","247":"Oh, you're saying like if I take this pawn, maybe in the future I'll try to open up this diagonal. See, that's very good vision. There's some pieces in the way, but yes. In chess, you have to always keep an eye on what can possibly open. Do you know how you can tell whether a position is closed or open?","248":"The easiest way by far to figure out if a position is closed is how many pawns do we each have? Right now, it's eight. So think of it like a fence, right? So if you and your neighbor have a full fence, you can't really see each other, but if there's only four pawns, that means somebody probably knocked down half of the fence, right? So if we start picking up all these pawns, then the position is more open. So this would be a closed position. This type of strategy would be called an attacking strategy 'cause you found a way to get your queen and rook down this line against my king. Before we even talk about what tactic is here, who does it look like is winning this game?","249":"Yes, you're 100% right 'cause in chess, the two most important things we have to think about are who has more material, but then, like you said, who has the weaker king? And I would say my king has gone way too far, right? So there's a tactic here for what?","250":"So that's like immediately you get a reward, but I'll give you a hint. The best way to start looking for a tactic, always look for a check first. Do you have a way to attack my king?","251":"And then you would take the rook. Now the funny thing is you are now totally winning, right? But as we know in chess, maybe one day white will make a mistake in the future. So there's no point for black to surrender here, but this is definitely a really good start.","252":"Because the materials are so small, they're at the nanoscale, their properties are dominated by quantum mechanics, which means that even slight changes in their size, in their orientation give profound changes in their properties. And while that's very scientifically interesting, and it allows you to tune their properties by making subtle changes, from a technology point of view, it's a bit of a headache in the sense that in technology want to optimize for a property and then repeat that over and over again. So what are some of the challenges that you face in the lab related to working with these materials and then trying to incorporate them into the batteries?","253":"That's actually, I think a very common problem. We can build a device in the lab it could be a transistor, can be a battery. And then you ask the question, okay, so what's the next step? How do we take it from that lab demonstration into a technology? The kind of work that I'm very interested in is developing tools to make the exact type of materials that you want. The tools that we've used in the past for conventional fabrication just don't work with these materials because they're all grown from the bottom up. They're intrinsically small, and you have to find ways to either use chemistry or some other means to get them to assemble into the structures that you want to actually either grow specifically what you want or after you grow them, to pull out the ones that you want. You need to be able to build that same thing over and over again, with the exact same properties. No one institution, no one research lab, no one national lab is gonna solve all of these problems on their own because they are difficult problems. And there is a real important payoff at the end. And it's gonna take all of us, making our contributions to push this field forward.","254":"Its basically a delay and it happens in all parts of the system: monitors can be a big one. Like consumer televisions can often have 15 milliseconds or more of latency just in the TV part. And then you've got the processing and the computer and all of these add up to the total latency.","255":"30 years ago, you had desktop PCs which were, you spent whatever on that, but there was always this idea well you could spend a million dollars and buy a super-computer and its gonna be a lot faster. And that's not really true today. For scalar processing, when you just do one thing after another, a high-end, overclocked, cool gaming PC is about the fastest thing in the world. It is within a very small delta, yeah for some things you'll get some IBM power system that might be a little bit faster, but not a whole lot. So if I'm looking at this and saying we need to be five times faster. What do you do? You can't just say make each thing faster. As a developer you're making a trade-off, I can put my effort into making this more efficient or making it more fun. And more fun usually wins out for very good reasons. So there's some good judgment and trickery that goes into the design of things. But you can always just design a game that will just not work well. (laughing) I mean in the old days, games had to be so precisely designed. Nowadays you've got a ton more freedom. You really can--","256":"But VR makes, you have to give up a little bit of that freedom, you have to not do so many crazy things, so you can wind up having it be as responsive and high quality as it needs to be.","257":"When you give up most of what you want? Well, sometimes that definitely happens for sure. What if I told you that this is the kind of technology that I work on that means you could trade with any kid all over the world?","258":"That's probably a good idea, maybe somebody else likes it more than you do. So normally, when people trade, they have to go to the store, or they have to know the person so they can get what they asked for. With blockchain, you can make that exact same trade, but you don't need the store, and you don't even necessarily need to know the other person.","259":"That's right. When we teach machines to learn from data, to build a model from that data or a representation of that, and then to make a prediction. One of the places we often find machine learning in the real world is in things like recommendation systems. So do you have an artist that you really like?","260":"So I'm gonna look up Melanie Martinez. And it says here, If you like Melanie Martinez, one of the other songs you might like is by Au\/Ra. Do you know who that is?","261":"And that's actually a really interesting thing to think about because that creepy vibe is something that you can perceive and I can perceive, but it's actually really hard to describe to a machine. What do you think might go into that?","262":"It's a great question. The machine can understand whatever we tell it to understand. So there might be a person thinking about things, like the pitch or the pacing or the tone, or sometimes machines can figure out things about music or images or videos that we don't tell it to discover, but that it can learn from looking at a lot of different examples. Why do you think companies might use machine learning?","263":"Sometimes, the ads you see are really uncanny. And I think that's because they're based on so much data. They know where you live. They know where your device is. It's also important to realize that people in aggregate are actually pretty predictable. Like when we talk to each other, we like to talk about the novel things, like here, we're having this conversation. We don't do this every day. But we probably still eat breakfast. We're gonna eat lunch. We're gonna eat dinner. You probably are going to the same home you go to most of the time. And so, they're able to take that data that we already give them and make predictions based on that as to what ads they should show us.","264":"So yeah it's a light bulb and there's a couple of mirrors. Now the light bulb has to be a little bit special. It has to be a type of material that can store the energy in an excited state right? It has to stay up there really energetic and sit there for a while so that when the light comes along, it takes that energy and becomes stronger light and then the mirror sends it back and it does it again and again and again and between these two mirrors, it makes the light come out in a nice beam. In a laser, it comes out as a single color. They all come out with their waves at the same time. Every wave peaks at the same time which then makes it a giant wave and it's this giant wave that has a tremendous amount of power. So it can do something like cutting steel. But when you cut steel, or if you were cutting this floor, it's gray, it actually will absorb the light. That's why the light, you don't see it because the light isn't bouncing back or through it. So I like to use demos to explain how my laser works. So I've brought basically a hammer and a nail. I'm sure you've probably hammered a nail before into a piece of wood but the question is, if you asked yourself why it is we hit the big end and it's the tiny end that we put on the piece of wood. We could never pick up a hammer and hit the sharp end and hope this would go in to the piece of wood.","265":"That's right. All the force that we apply here, goes all the way through but then it can only basically come out when it contacts the wood in that one tiny spot. And so sometimes it's the force that you push something with but sometimes it is that force per unit area. But sometimes it's not even the force per unit area 'cos, you know, push down as hard as you can on that and see if we can get it pushed in. See it doesn't really work does it?","266":"Well it depends. So if you're cutting steel, you need to have the nail. You need to have it concentrated all of the light, not going in all directions but you need it into as small a point as possible. And for that we use a lens. For a lens, the light's coming down as a column, you put in a lens, it all focuses it down in the same way as the nail and then it starts cutting that steel. Okay so that force per unit area--","267":"Exactly. You know sometimes you want to have all of your energy not just in a small area but in the small volume and so one of the other dimensions is time or length. But with light, time and length are the same thing because light always travels at the speed of light.","268":"But if you send a one second long light pulse out into the skies there, the beginning of the pulse is actually two thirds of the way to the moon. It's 300,000 kilometers long. So now, if you talk about light being concentrated, that doesn't seem very concentrated. The type of lasers I play with in my lab will be no thicker than this piece of paper. So we take that energy that might be in three hundred thousand kilometers and we squeeze it all the way down into just this piece of paper and actually the beams are more the size of this piece of paper and so, in my lab, pieces of paper like this would be flying through the sky but we can't see them. 'Cos they don't come in our eyes, they fly by us and they're infra red.","269":"Exactly. And so now, if we have light like that that we wanna machine with. I bring this funnel and so, if we had a lens here and the light was coming down--","270":"Into a spot. So here would be my light coming from my laser and it would just be coming down, down, down, down, down. Hit a lens and it would have to focus down. But now, all the light started out with this big of a spread so concentrated this much. Eventually it would be here, more concentrated. But by the end, right at the focal spot, that's when I get all of my light, all of the energy has been squeezed down into fitting inside this piece of paper and that's why I say that I built a laser hammer. Because when this hits a piece of glass, it just smacks hose electrons right off the atoms and there's nothing else for them to do, they have to fly away. So can you tell me what you learned and maybe about the focusing of the light?","271":"Okay, so we'll do some, but I want to tell you a little bit about origami. Most origami follows two, I'll call them customs, almost like rules. It's usually from a square and the other is it's usually folded with no cuts. So these guys are folded from an uncut square.","272":"Okay. We're going to start with a model that every Japanese person learns in kindergarten, it's called a crane, traditional origami design, it's over 400 years old. So, people have been doing what we're about to do for 400 years.","273":"Let's fold it in half from corner to corner, unfold it and then we'll fold it in half the other direction, also corner to corner but we're going to lift it up and we're going to hold the fold with both hands. We're going to bring these corners together, making a little pocket and then, this is the trickiest part of this whole design, so you're going to put your finger underneath the top layer and we're going to try to make that layer fold right along the edge. Now you see how the sides kind of want to come in as you're doing that?","274":"It's called a petal fold, it's a part of a lot of origami designs and it's key to the crane. Now we're ready for the magic. We're going to hold it in between thumb and forefinger, reach inside, grab the skinny point that's between the two layers, which are the wings, and I'm going to slide it out so it pokes out at an angle. We'll take the two wings, we spread them out to the side and you have made your first origami crane.","275":"Now, this is a traditional Japanese design but there are origami designs that have been around so long we're not entirely sure where they originated. We're going to learn how to fold a cootie catcher.","276":"So we'll start with the white side up and we're going to fold it in half from corner to corner, in one fold and now we're going to fold all four corners to the crossing point in the center. We'll fold it in half like a book. On the folded side we'll take one of the folded corners and I'm going to fold it up through all layers. There's a pocket in the middle. We're going to spread the pocket and bring all four corners together. Where you have original corners of the square, we're gonna just pop those out. This is one of the most satisfying moments, I think-","277":"Yeah, but there's something else we can do with this model. If we set it down and push on the middle then pop it inside out so that three flaps come up and one stays down and then it's called talking crow because here's a little crow's beak and mouth.","278":"There's thousands of other origami designs but these are some of the first people learn and this was, in fact, one of the first origami designs I learned some 50 years ago.","279":"What is I think very true about what you're hinting at is that bubble sort really focuses on local, small problems rather than taking a step back trying to fix the whole thing, let's just fix the obvious problems in front of us. So, for instance, when we're trying to get from smallest to largest, and the first two things we see are eight followed by one, this looks like a problem 'cause it's out of order. So, what would be the simplest fix, the least amount of work we can do to at least fix one problem?","280":"All right, we'll switch this. And now to your point, we don't need to bother with the ones that already bubbled their way up. Now we are a hundred percent sure it's sorted.","281":"And certainly the search engines of the world, Google and Bing and so forth, they probably don't keep webpages in sorted order 'cause that would be a crazy long list when you're just trying to search the data. But there's probably some algorithm underlying what they do and they probably similarly, just like we, do a bit of work upfront to get things organized even if it's not strictly sorted in the same way so that people like you and me and others can find that same information. So, how about social media? Can you envision where the algorithms are in that world?","282":"Absolutely. Just trying to keep you presumably more engaged. So, the better the algorithm is, the better your engagement is, maybe the more money the company then makes on the platform and so forth. So, it all sort of feeds together. But what you're describing really is more artificially intelligent, if I may, because presumably there's not someone at TikTok or any of these social media companies saying, If Patricia likes this post, then show her this post. If she likes this post, then show her this other post. Because the code would sort of grow infinitely long and there's just way too much content for a programmer to be having those kinds of conditionals, those decisions being made behind the scenes. So, it's probably a little more artificially intelligent. And in that sense you have topics like neural networks, and machine learning which really describe taking as input things like what you watch, what you click on, what your friends watch, what they click on, and sort of trying to infer from that instead, what should we show Patricia or her friends next?","283":"Well, that's true, we do use slingshot technology once things are out in the solar system. So, for instance, we use Jupiter and other planets so that when some of the spacecraft gets close, it'll slingshot around and it'll cause it to speed up. But mostly, around the Earth, gravity pulls things down, so when we want to send a rocket into space, when we wanna go to the Moon, when we wanna send supplies to the International Space Station, the trick is to get something moving fast enough that it escapes the gravitational pull of the Earth. Have you heard the expression what goes up must come down? It's actually not true. If you throw it fast enough, you can actually get something that doesn't come back down again, and that's basically how rocket launches work. You have to get the rocket for the Earth to go more than 11 kilometers a second. Think of how fast it is. Just one breath and it's gone 11 kilometers. If you get it to go that fast, it's not gonna come back down again. So you know the International Space Station which is orbiting the Earth? That's going around the Earth at 17,000 miles an hour. It has no engines anymore, the engines are turned off. So it's just there falling forever. So once it's out there, it's not coming back down as long as it's cruising like that.","284":"In a weird way, that is gravity pulling it. So have you ever had a yo-yo where you swing it around like this? The string is pulling it in at all times, but you've also given it this angular momentum. And as long as you give it the angular momentum, pulling it in actually keeps it in orbit. And so the Earth is pulling it in at all times, so that's why it doesn't just travel off in a straight line. It keeps coming back around. So it's funny, people think that the International Space Station is so far away that they're not feeling gravity, and that's not the case at all. They're absolutely feeling gravity. They're just cruising so fast that, even though they're being pulled in, they never get pulled to the surface.","285":"Yeah, you feel pinned to that. It's exactly like that. There's something called the equivalence principle where people realized, especially Einstein, that if you were in outer space in a rocket ship and it was dark and painted and it was accelerating at exactly the right rate, you actually wouldn't know if you were sitting on the floor of a building around the Earth or if you were on a rocket ship that was accelerating.","286":"That's because in some sense, you're really not. Imagine you're in this train and it's going near the speed of light relative to the platform, but it's so smooth, then you should be in a situation in which there's no meaning to your absolute motion, there's no absolute motion. So that if you throw a ball up, you might think from the outside of the platform, be confused that when gravity pulls that back down, it's gonna hit you or something, but it'll land in your palm as surely as if you were in your living room.","287":"So imagine you were an astronaut and you were floating in empty space. You can't see anything. There's no stars, there's no Earth. You can ask yourself, am I moving? There's really no way for you to tell. So you would probably conclude, well, I'm not moving. So then your friend Marina comes cruising past you, and maybe she's going thousands of kilometers a second, and you say, Marina, you're cruising at thousands of kilometers a second, you're going so fast. But she had just done the same experiment. She was just floating in space thinking, Am I moving? There's no way to know which one of you is moving and there's no meaning to the absolute motion. The only thing that's true is that you're in relative motion, that's true. You both agree you're in relative motion, and that's clear. But neither of you can say it's actually you who's moving and I'm stationary.","288":"So, let's say you and Marina are floating in space and you can't tell who's moving. Let's say you both see a flash of light. A flash of light comes from somewhere, you don't know where. So you measure the speed of light to be 300,000 kilometers per second. But here comes Marina and she's racing at the light pulse, as far as you can tell. Two cars driving towards each other seem like they're going faster towards each other than somebody who's standing still relative to one of the cars, right?","289":"So you would say, oh Marina is gonna measure a different speed of light. But she comes back and she says, No. 300,000 kilometers per second. Because from her perspective, she's standing still, and the laws of physics have better be the same for her. The speed of light is a fact of nature that's as true as the strength of gravity. And the two of you are in this quandary because if one of you is the preferred person who correctly measures the speed of light, that ruins everything about the idea of the relativity of motion. Which one of you should it be? So Einstein decides they must both measure the same speed of life. How could that possibly, possibly be the case? And he thinks, well, if speed is how far you travel, your spatial distance, in a certain amount of time, then there must be something wrong with space and time. And he goes from the constancy of the speed of light and a respect for this idea of relativity to the idea that space and time must not be the same for you and for Marina. And that's how he gets the idea of the relativity of space and time. [laughs] You have the best expression on your face. [laughs] It's pretty wild, but that is a starting point, actually, of the whole theory of relativity. That starting point leads to this complete revolution in physics where we suddenly have a Big Bang and black holes and space-time. Just from that one simple starting point. So, is your impression of gravity different than when we started the conversation?","290":"You know, a lot of people, a lot of string theorists, they care a lot about all the different ways in which we could hide the extra dimensions. As someone who cares about cosmology, I wanna start asking why are the extra dimensions small at all? How did that happen? Is this something you think about yourself?","291":"The thing I want to talk about is this paper I wrote with Matt Johnson and Lisa Randall where we realize there's another way to compactify extra dimensions spontaneously, dynamically. If you imagine starting with this big piece of paper you couldn't wrap up everything, but within some region of space you could make a tube.","292":"Right? And down there in the tube it looks like your long thing that is compactified in one direction and infinitely extending in the other direction, so there's one less macroscopic dimension of space.","293":"Yeah. So we certainly assume that they're all large as a starting point, and it's worse than that. So in our paper we imagine you start in de Sitter space. You start in a universe with no matter, no anything like that, just empty space but with an energy that is positive and all the dimensions are large.","294":"Yeah, I've been trying to explain this to lower levels, and they always look at me like, are you pulling my leg here a little bit? Or is this the real thing that they use? Yes, it is the real thing they use. We study these branes in de Sitter space, and so what we found is that there are black brane solutions which instead of having a singularity inside are non-singular, and stable, and compactified. Is this a familiar thing? I know things like this have been discussed, right?","295":"Right. Imagine that rather than going down to a point, it just asymptotes to some fixed radius that continues infinitely far down there. But then you can ask, okay what about the rest of the universe? You have some sphere, some two dimensions compactified, and the balance between the cosmological constant and the electromagnetic field keeps it at a fixed distance.","296":"But then the other dimensions, the transverse dimensions, don't need to be anti-de Sitter. They can have either positive, zero, or negative cosmological constant. So you can basically get any sort of cosmological solution times a compactified sphere.","297":"I guess. I mean, maybe you'd think otherwise. Again or maybe you could change my mind, I think that as long as it can happen it will happen some of the time, right?","298":"Someone probably wrote it for him. So it's possible that if you do have this starting point of an empty de Sitter space with positive cosmological constants and fields lying around you inevitably get a multiverse. It just happens, you know, it's just part of quantum nucleation to different things, and then maybe you need to explain why we live in this universe rather than some other one via the anthropic principle or something like that. So how does our kind of, you know, low-tech old fashioned way of making new universes intersect with the kinds of things you'd think about.","299":"And if we put aside for the second the concerns of our colleagues in other parts of physics, and it's just amongst us chickens, what do you think about the future of cosmology and string theory, and the dynamics of these extra dimensions?","300":"And I just wrote a book called Something Deeply Hidden about many worlds, quantum mechanics, and how spacetime can emerge from it. Plenty of reading material for the audience out there.","301":"So we've been, we've had, now, effectively two different ways of getting more direct measurements, one is the LIGO, which is the Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory, which is where, getting the ripples in space time, coming off of the merging of black holes. The other one that you're mentioning is actually called the Event Horizon Telescope, where they're using radio waves to actually image the event horizon, that region where light cannot escape from the black hole at the center of our galaxy, which I know they're working on it right now. It's an amazing thing, but that'll be the most direct imaging of a black hole. LIGO is a direct detection of the consequence of the merging of black holes. The critical part has been, like, for the super massive black hole at the center of our galaxy, we've seen the stars orbiting it, and we've measured the mass, so that way, so if you look at a spinning black hole, it actually fundamentally alters the emission that's coming off the stuff that's falling into it. These are discovered as what are called X-ray binaries, that is, you know, there's an X-ray member of the binary that is emitting in the X-rays, and it's really not very bright in the optical (mumbles) at all, so there's always, people are looking at these X-ray binaries.","302":"Awesome, good. (laughs) It's a map of all the connections between every neuron in your brain. It literally, in a human brain, something like a map of the one quadrillion connections that a hundred billion neurons make with each other.","303":"We have to use electron microscopes and then what we have been developing a way to slice the brain into really thin slices, use an electron microscope to take a picture of each slice, and then use computers to put it all back. Imagine that we could get a map of every connection, right? And we knew how neurons fire. Do you think we could put that in a computer, that map, and then therefore, that computer should be able to think just like the brain that we extracted it from?","304":"So chess is separated into three games, obviously. You have your opening, which is the early stage of the game. Then we have the middle game, right? The most confusing, mysterious side of the game, and the end game where there's no pieces remaining on the board. You gotta have to know how to convert positions, defend positions, understand how to play the game with only five pieces remaining or something like that. So for you, what do you struggle with the most?","305":"In all middle games where we have this mix of tactics, which are immediate gain or immediate loss, depending on if we're getting hit with a tactic or playing one, and strategic chess. I just want you to tell me, who do you think has a better position here and by how much?","306":"Everything you just said is 100% accurate. So that's one of those baseline pieces of information that we need for the middle game. I have the two bishops. How can I activate one of my bishops? You have a little plan you could actually implement right now that would make one of your bishops extremely strong. You think you can find it?","307":"This is how we unlock the intermediate level, which is this move. That move looks like it's disconnecting from the whole board, right? It's a move totally on the edge, but nobody is gonna stop your bishop from going to that diagonal, and then you're threatening a tactic. You're threatening a skewer. You would hit my queen and my rook. Stronger piece in front, weaker peace in back, and then you would be guaranteed to win some material. Just like little pattern recognition in the middle game. So for the future, you're gonna have a game where your opponent makes the same trade early, right? They trade their dark-squared bishop, and you can activate it like that, but in this game, you focused on the center, which was totally fine also.","308":"One thing to always monitor in every chess middle game is does my opponent have a pawn break? Can my opponent strike somewhere with a pawn that would open up the board? If you have a low risk position, your position's just nice and comfortably better, you don't want chaos.","309":"Yes. Yes. And this move is actually very annoying for white because not only am I now targeting things in your center, what else have I changed just by moving this pawn?","310":"Yes. Another thing for middle game. So we just keep adding to that bucket of knowledge. Pawn breaks for the opponent, and then, every time something moves, like a pawn, we have to look around. What else is now opening up? And we wanna get to a situation where you knew this move was gonna happen, and the next I'm gonna come here, and then now what can I do? I can bring both my rooks, and now I have no problems, right? Now I have both knights, queen, rooks. So we need to get to a point where we see that coming, and we're not just focusing on our own plans, but that's not always easy. So with a pawn here, that disrupts my plan, right? Because now this move fails to-","311":"Yes. As you're trying to improve your middle game, one question you always have to ask yourself is, Is that trade good for me? Is it good for my opponent? It's not checkers. You don't have to take me, and I don't have to take you. So we can do something called keeping the tension. We're just having a staring contest here among the pawns. So I'm gonna ask you, do you think it's better for black to capture this pawn or keep the tension? Just slide the rook over and threaten to push the pawn here, which would be a tactic and a fork.","312":"Yes, exactly. So now in the snap of your fingers, you can get your bishop out and the rook, two things that a move ago were just totally blocked in by a pawn, exactly. So in the middle game, trades are either good or bad for you and for your opponent.","313":"So a nice place to start is with the idea of a triad. A triad is a three-part harmony, basically. (keyboard harmonic tone) So that's a triad. So this triad's called C major.","314":"So in Amazing Grace, you start with F. You know, if I go (melodic humming) \u266a How sweet the sound \u266a (scat singing) (laughs) Where am I right now? I don't know where I am. (scat singing) And my job is to get back home, but to make this chord make sense.","315":"That's pretty good. So gravity wants to attract us to the Earth, and the Earth to us. But the Earth is so much bigger that even though we're actually pulling the Earth a little bit to us, you don't notice it so much. You know, the Moon pulls on the Earth a little bit.","316":"[Janna] Exactly, the Moon is such a big body compared to anything else very nearby that it has the larger effect, pulling the water of the Earth. But more than the Moon, think about the Sun pulling on the Earth. We orbit the whole Sun, just the way the Earth pulls on the Moon and causes the Moon to orbit us. All of those things are acting on you and me right now.","317":"That's such a good question. No, we actually couldn't. In the Moon, gravity is weaker, you can almost float between footsteps if you look at the astronauts on the Moon. On the Earth, it's harder, 'cause it's bigger. If you go to a bigger, heavier planet, it gets harder and harder. But there are stars that have died that are so dense that there's no way we could lift our arms, no way we could step or walk. The gravity is just way too strong. Do you know how tall you are?","318":"Maybe four three. People think that while you're sleeping, your body has a chance to stretch out and gravity isn't crunching you together, but when you're standing or walking or sitting, the gravity contracts your spine ever so slightly, so that in the morning you might be a little bit taller than in the evening. See if it works for you. [Woman] Wow.","319":"They say that astronauts in space, definitely their spine elongates. There were two twin astronauts, one who stayed here on Earth and the other who went to the International Space Station. He was there for a long time, and when he came back, he was actually taller than his twin brother.","320":"Yeah, and that was because gravity wasn't compressing him all the time and he was floating freely in the International Space Station and his spine just kind of elongated. After a while here on Earth though he'll readjust, he'll go back to the same size. Have you ever heard of how gravity was discovered?","321":"Isaac Newton would ponder, how does the Earth cause things to fall? There's a famous story that Isaac Newton was sitting under a tree and the apple fell from the tree and hit him on the head and he had an epiphany and understood this law, this mathematical law for how that works. I don't actually think that's a true story, though.","322":"But it's a good story. So Isaac Newton realized that even if you're heavier, you will fall at the same rate as something much lighter, that that's the same. Once you hit the ground, if you're heavier, you'll hit the ground with much greater force, but you will hit the ground at the same time.","323":"They look the same, but this is much heavier, right? Okay, so try it, just try holding your arms up front, a little higher maybe, give them a chance to drop, and then drop them. [balls thud] [Janna laughs] Did they fall at the same time? Did they hit at the same time? So, Isaac Newton, he was also the one who realized that that's the same force that keeps the Moon in orbit around the Earth and the Earth in orbit around the Sun, and that's a huge leap. Here he is, looking at just things around him, and then looks at the stars and has this really big realization, that that's actually the same force. So, what have you learned today talking about gravity?","324":"I think that it actually has a lot of mystery around it, because the fuel for fusion is a plasma, and we don't experience plasmas on earth in our everyday life.","325":"They exist in space, at the event horizon of a black hole, in the solar wind, in our sun, or very rapid events, like lightning is also sort of a very weakly ionized plasma. Even among plasmas there are so many different kinds of plasmas. There are low temperature, higher density plasmas. There are of course the astrophysical plasmas, and space plasmas, and then there are fusion plasmas. They are predominantly fully ionized plasmas. They are also plasmas where we have a certain ability to basically kick up micro-instabilities.","326":"So they're plasmas which are held in a stable enough state by strong external magnetic fields confining the plasma into a donut shape. And this has a lot of advantages for us, because charged particles want to follow the magnetic field lines. But things start to get really interesting when we're no longer thinking about individual particle motions in the plasma. And instead we start to think about collective effects.","327":"Plus magnetic fields. When we start thinking about turbulence in the plasma, we can no longer even think about the plasma as a single fluid. Instead we have to consider electron fluid and ion fluid separately. We have to use a full blown kinetic equation to explain how this state of matter is behaving. Because we have collisions. So we have to add collisions back in to understand and track how all the particles are moving, and how these collective motions, this turbulence can get kicked up. So that's pretty intractable, right?","328":"So one really big advance in plasma theory over the last I'd say three or four decades has been the development of a gyrokinetic theory that we use to model the micro-turbulence in the plasma and get that under control. And the reason it's so important to get the turbulence under control and understand it is because turbulence is the primary heat loss mechanism. the primary way that heat is transported from hot to cold across confining field lines in a magnetic confinement system. Being able to study it, measure it and predict how it's going to behave is really one of the big hurdles to overcome.","329":"And we talked about how challenging it would be to follow every particle in space and know its position, and know its velocity at all times. So what gyrokinetics actually does as a theory is it takes advantage of the fact that when we drop a charged particle into a strong external magnetic field, the Lorentz force bends that particle's trajectory into a helix. And so now if we know that wherever the field line is going that particle is following it in this helical, in this corkscrew trajectory, we can say aha, I no longer have to worry about following that particle's velocity around in a circle, 'cause at every point in time I know it's going in a circle.","330":"And it has a particular radius of that helix called the gyro radius, because it's just gyrating. So what we know from studying the plasma and making direct measurements of the turbulence and also what comes from the simulations is the scale size of the turbulence is about 5 to 10 gyro radii.","331":"So that's good, because that's why you're here, and so we're talking about sleep today, and really about kind of what is the brain machinery through which we go through consciousness to unconsciousness and that transition.","332":"Okay. The best way to think about this transition is really called, it's a flip flop switch, okay? So this term comes from engineering, and the idea is that in sleep, you basically have kind of this all of nothing experience. Certainly people kind of drift off to sleep, but then all of a sudden you're unconscious, right? So it seems like it's this flip flop between the arousal system and the sleep promoting system, and it's certainly regulated, and we'll get a little bit into that, but they're certainly kind of made up of two reciprocally inhibitory processes. Okay, so we have the ascending reticular activating system. It originates in the brain stem, and there's a dorsal and a ventral arm to this, and so the dorsal arm has neurons, cholinergic neurons, that go up to the thalamus and then it projections into the fore brain, and then there's the ventral arm, and this is comprised of a whole bunch of different types of neurons, so there are monominergic, so there's kind of dopaminergic neurons that come from the periaqueductal gray, serotonergic ones from the dorsal raphae nuclei, histaminergic neurons that come from the tuberomammillary nucleus of the hippothalamus, and then noradrenergic neurons from the locus coeruleus, and so all of those are kind of working in tandem to kind of drive wake within the brain. So if we just think about drugs that are available inducing wakefulness, we can certainly, kind of the dopaminergic ones jump out, right? So we have amphetamines that kind of drive those signaling, and then modafinil, which is a wake promoting drug for people that have kind of excessive day-time sleepiness that maintains alertness throughout the day.","333":"Well one of the fun things people do with lasers, the cat will try to grab that dot. I'm sure what you have at home is a flashlight. I brought a cute little one. So the question is, do you see any difference between what a flashlight does and what a laser does?","334":"That's true, that laser's just a dot. And so the other thing to notice though is that, like if I shine it in your eyes and I'm sorry if I do! But it seems awfully bright doesn't it? And yet when, you know, you shine this down and you put the laser, which one do you see easier?","335":"One of the things that lasers are great for is that because it's a directed beam, we can actually put that light where we want the light to go and sometimes you maybe just want to see something around the corner and you can't see it. But with a laser, you can actually and this is a smoky one so you can actually watch it go. You see it actually bending the corner?","336":"And that's because the light will go through this glass and, when it hits that corner, it has to bend. And we actually send laser beams down glass fibers, the size of your hair.","337":"So this is just a demonstration. If you have a laser like this, it actually bends and comes out, I'm gonna point it to you and you'll see it coming out the other end. It hits these walls, it has to go around and come out the other side. You wanna play? So is this the first time you've seen a laser or have you gotten to play with lasers somewhere else?","338":"That's a laser. We cut steel with them now. We actually do surgery with lasers. You know when some people have either scars or birth marks that they don't want to see? We can actually remove those with lasers now. Never seen a laser light show? When they light up the sky with lasers, it's almost like fireworks.","339":"A lot of origami is animals, birds and things. There's also a branch of origami that is, it's more abstract or geometric, called tessellations. Tessellations, like most origami, are folded from a single sheet of paper but they make patterns, whether it's woven patterns like that, or woven patterns like this. If you hold them up to the light you can see patterns.","340":"The thing that makes them cool is they're sort of like tilings, it looks like you could put this together by cutting little pieces of paper and sliding them together, but they're still one sheet.","341":"There's no cuts in these just folding. We can build these up from smaller building blocks of folds, learn how to fold little pieces and put them together in the same way that a tiling like this looks like it's built up of little pieces. Can you make a fold that starts at the dot that doesn't run all the way across the paper?","342":"Mm-hmm. Each of these folds is peaked like a mountain and we call these mountain folds but if I made it the other way, then it's shaped this way and we call it a valley fold. In all of origami there's just mountains and valleys.","343":"So they're all reversible and it turns out that in every origami shape that folds flat, it's going to be either three mountains and a valley or, if we're looking at the backside, three valleys and a mountain, they always differ by two.","344":"That's a rule of all flat origami no matter how many folds come together at a point and I'm going to show you a building block of tessellations, it's called a twist because that center square, as I unfold it, it twists, it rotates.","345":"If I had another twist in the same sheet of paper I could make these folds connect with that, and these folds connect with that. And if I had another one up here, I could make all three. And if I had a square array and all the folds lined up I could make bigger and bigger arrays, like these, because these are just very large twists. In this case it's an octagon rather than a square, but they're arranged in rows and columns. And let's just try going along. All right, there is our tessellation with squares and hexagons. So you have now designed and folded your first origami tessellation and perhaps you can see how just using this idea of building up tiles and small building blocks you could make tessellations as big and complex as you want.","346":"So machine learning is a way that we teach computers to learn things about the world by looking at patterns and looking at examples of things. So can I show you an example of how a machine might learn something?","347":"That's true. Do you think, if we look at these pictures, do you think maybe we could say, Well, they both have pointy ears, but the dogs have a different kind of body and the cats like to stand up a little different.? Do you think that makes sense?","348":"This one's a jackal. And it's actually a kind of dog. But you made a good guess. That's what machines do too. They make guesses. Is this a cat or a dog?","349":"And so, you did something pretty amazing there. Because we asked the question, Is it a cat or a dog? And you said, I disagree with your question. It's a human. So machine learning is when we teach machines to make guesses about what things are based on looking at a lot of different examples. And I build products that use machine learning to learn about the world and make guesses about things in the world. When we try to teach machines to recognize things like cats and dogs, it takes a lot of examples. We have to show them tens of thousands or even millions of examples before they can get even close to as good at it as you are. Do you have tests in school?","350":"So machines work the same way. If you show them a lot of examples and give them practice, they'll learn how to guess. And then when you give them the test, they should be able to do that. So we looked at eight pictures and you were able to answer really quickly. But what would you do if I gave you 10 million examples? Would you be able to do that so quickly?","351":"So one of the differences between people and machines is that people might be a little better at this, but can't look at 10 million different things. So now that we've been talking about machine learning, is this something you want to learn how to do?","352":"So what if I told you that blockchain technology is basically a tool where you can do the exact same thing, but it goes to you and I directly? You wouldn't need an eBay or a brand in between.","353":"We have a lot of companies that sort of help us make sure that our trades happen, but if we could guarantee the same trade using technology as sort of a technological trust, then we wouldn't really need all those middlemen in between.","354":"It's basically a network of computers that all have the same history of transactions. And so instead of sort of there being one company with one database that holds all the information, the same sort of list is held by all these different people. Like, you could have it on your computer. And then it gets validated by everyone, and basically, that turns into the next part of the list. So it's sort of constantly updating itself.","355":"So it's kinda this like really big ledger or accounting system for all sorts of things that get traded, but instead of being owned by one company, it's owned by everybody.","356":"That's actually a really good description. The idea is that if you've got a system here that can make you see whatever we want you to see, then we can make you believe that you're anywhere else, like on top of a mountain, or in a dungeon or under the ocean.","357":"Yeah, or in Minecraft. When you look at a TV on the wall there showing like a picture of a mountain or something, how can you tell that its not just a window and there's something else behind it. Because it always doesn't look quite right if you have a static picture of a person on a screen and you move around like this, its not really changing. And its interesting, those are things we have to figure out We need to figure out when you look at something in reality how can you tell whether its real or not. Have you been to a 3-D movie where you put on the little glasses?","358":"So what they do, the trick for that is, if you ever at a theater and you take up the glasses and you look at it, you'll see its blurry where there's actually two pictures that they're showing at the same time. And what those little glasses do, is they let one eye see one picture, and the other eye see a different picture. So then your eyes can say, oh it looks like I'm seeing through the screen or something is floating out in front of it. In the VR headsets, what we do is, there's actually either two screens or one screen split in half, so that it draws a different picture, completely different picture, for each eye. And we make sure that each eye can only see the picture it intended to. And that's what can make things feel like they got this real depth to them, that its something that you could reach out and touch and it doesn't feel like a flat TV screen.","359":"When we were much smaller societies, you and I could trade in our community pretty easily. As the distance in our trade grew, we ended up inventing institutions, right? If you Uber or you use Airbnb or you use Amazon even, these are just digital marketplaces and platforms that help us facilitate an exchange of value. But today, we actually have a technology that allows us to trade one to one but at scale, and it's called blockchain technology. There is some kind of interface for it. You could have an app, or you could use a computer to do it, but instead of there being a company in the middle that's helping you make that transaction, it's a bunch of software code.","360":"In some cases, yeah, it is. And a lot of people in the financial industry, in particular, are looking at it from the banking side of how do we use this technology to trade things like Bitcoin or other tokens that are easier to use instead of today's currency. A lot of people think about blockchain as Bitcoin because it's sort of in the news a lot, and it's this new cryptocurrency. And it's kind of exciting. But we're actually seeing a lot more use cases for blockchain that aren't around the currency side. They're more around, how do you take any asset and be able to trade that using this same technology.","361":"To figure out how to do that we need to learn a little bit about what makes a point. So, let's come back to the crane. You can probably tell that the corners of the square ended up as points, right?","362":"Yeah, exactly. Actually you've discovered something pretty neat because you made your point not from a corner so you've already discovered one of the key insights. Any flap, any point, leg of the ant, takes up a circular region of paper. Here's our boundary. To make your point from an edge you use that much paper and the shape, it's almost a circle. If we take the crane we'll see if the circles are visible in the crane pattern. Here's the crane pattern, and here's a boundary of the wing, and here's the other wing.","363":"The crane has four circles but, actually, there's a little bit of a surprise because what about this? There's a fifth circle, which is like that, but does the crane have a fifth flap in it? Let's refold it and put the wings up. Well, yes, there is, there's another point and that point is the fifth circle of our crane.","364":"And to do that we use a new technique called circle packing in which all of the long features of the design are represented by circles. So, each leg becomes a circle, each wing becomes a circle and things that can be big and thick, like the head or the abdomen, can be points in the middle. Now we have the basic idea of how to design the pattern, we just count the number of legs we want. We want a spider, if it's got let's say eight legs, it's also got an abdomen, that's another point, and it's got a head, so maybe that's 10 points. If we find an arrangement of 10 circles we should be able to fold that into the spider. So in this book, Origami Insects II, it's one of my books and has some patterns, and this is one of them for a flying ladybug and, in fact, it is exactly this flying ladybug. We've got the crease pattern here in the circles and you might now be able to see which circles end up as which parts, knowing that the largest features like the wings are going to be the largest circles, smaller points will be smaller circles. So any thoughts which might be?","365":"Origami artists all around the world now use ideas like this to design, not just insects, but animals, and birds, and all sorts of things that are, I think, unbelievably complex and realistic but most importantly, beautiful.","366":"So, inside of every computer is some kind of brain and the technical term for that is CPU, or central processing unit. And those are the pieces of hardware that know how to respond to those instructions. Like moving up or down, or left or right, knows how to do math like addition and subtraction. And then there's at least one other type of hardware inside of a computer called memory or RAM, if you've heard of this?","367":"Yeah, exactly. And computers have even different types of memory. They have what's called RAM, random access memory, which is where your games, where your programs are stored while they're being used. But then it also has a hard drive, or a solid state drive, which is where your data, your high scores, your documents, once you start writing essays and stories in the future.","368":"Why don't we do it this way? Why don't we pretend like I'm a computer or maybe I'm a robot, so I only understand your instructions and so I want you to feed me, no pun intended, an algorithm. So, step-by-step instructions for solving this problem. But remember, algorithms, you have to be precise, you have to give...","369":"[laughing] Clean all this mess up, right. We made an algorithm, step by step instructions for solving some problem. And if you think about now, how we made peanut butter and jelly sandwiches, sometimes we were imprecise and you didn't give me quite enough information to do the algorithm correctly, and that's why I took out so much bread. Precision, being very, very correct with your instructions is so important in the real world because for instance, when you're using the worldwide web and you're searching for something on Google or Bing...","370":"Pretty much everything we do in life is an algorithm, even if we don't use that fancy word to describe it. Because you and I are sort of following instructions either that we came up with ourselves or maybe our parents told us how to do these things. And so, those are just algorithms. But when you start using algorithms in computers, that's when you start writing code.","371":"Really glad that you could join us. So we've been talking about sleep today, various levels of complexity. But now with you, I really want to talk about what do we know about sleep and the aging brain. Can you tell me a little bit about some of the work that you've been doing in that area?","372":"So it's interesting, so I also saw that there was also a recent meta-analysis around sleep disturbances and dementia risk, and in that study, they looked about 250,000 people in this meta-analysis, and they followed them around for 10 years, and you know, when they pulled all the samples together, they found there was a 1.2 fold increased risk for developing all caused dementia, so it sounds like both sleep apnea and then maybe sleep disturbances more generally are associated with increased risk for dementia. When I think about that, I think about how sleep lives in the brain, these neurodegenerative diseases live in the brain, and so what do we know about the causality of this? Could it be that individuals who have early onset of say, Alzheimer's, have then poor sleep kind of as a consequence of that?","373":"So within dementia risk in particular, Alzheimer's for instance, there are kind of two clear features that seem to be part of the pathology, right? So there's beta-amyloid which accumulates in the brain, and then there's kind of these tangles, this tauopathies, right? And so it sounds like sleep seems to be related to the tauopathies. What about kind of beta-amyloid?","374":"I'm excited about the future of sleep medicine. I think there are incredible innovations that are happening in the basic sciences, kind of really starting to understand what are the clear biological processes that underly some of these things as they relate to disease risk, and what is the true function of sleep, kind of the why we sleep phenomenon, right?","375":"Where we're going with a lot of the experiments right now is trying to produce some maybe outside-the-box datasets that we haven't seen before, and then of course ultimately compare them to the simulations and do a bit of this validation maybe where we're not just looking under the lamppost, where we're going a little bit outside the comfort zone. That means going from measurements really sort of more in the middle of the plasma, at about mid-radius, pushing all the way out to the edge, where the turbulence starts to become very different in its nature, it becomes a lot more electromagnetic, it becomes sometimes larger in scale, just physical scale size. And some of the things we're starting to find was that turbulence features and turbulence characteristics in the edge of some of these high performance plasmas don't always behave the way we think they do. So as we think about pushing our measurements and our study of the turbulence from the core to the edge, how does that influence what you're working on now?","376":"I agree, yeah, I think having multiple stakeholders who are all driven by different missions and different purposes working synergistically is exciting. When I'm asked like, okay, what's the timeline for fusion and why is now any different than five years ago or 10 years ago, why is now that we want for fusion? My answer is it's finally, for the first time, all the pieces of the puzzle are here. We've advanced really the basic physics understanding so far that we have got the predictive capabilities, but we also have alignment with policy and science drivers that we didn't really have before. That's I think what can get us there. Maybe a demonstration of net electricity in a decade. Is that the thing folks are pushing for?","377":"Essentially what harmony is, is like a language, right? And so as with any language, the more words you're capable of speaking in a language, the more you can say. All right, so in harmony, this might be how many notes you can think to add to a chord to make it feel a different way. Have you ever heard of the circle of fifths?","378":"Okay, that's great. On one side, we have a lot of the notes which make us feel brighter, you know, like these kinds of, (keyboard music) these really bright sounds. And the other side is a lot more to do with the darkness of a key center. So we're home in F, but imagine we're taking a quick visit to B-flat, but then the sun comes out.","379":"You got it. Ooh! Yeah? Yeah, yeah. So this is really, this is like a gleaming glade or something, you know? Let's play this tune, Amazing Grace. Let's play it in its simplest form.","380":"Just to see how things feel. Yeah. All right, lets do it. (both playing Amazing Grace) So it's F major seven, but its over A. Which is F seven over A. (both playing) B flat major seven with an A and a G in it. F major seven with an E and a D and a G, yeah. (laughter) D minor seven with a G in it. C softs, or minor, nice. B flat major. G seven, F sharp major seven. Home, yeah! I like that. So what harmony does is just gives us even more tools to tell those stories. Cool, yeah. Nice, man.","381":"When you find a target and you have a way to create threats, attacks against that target, against that goal, but you do it without sacrificing your resources, right? So you can imagine two boxers, right? One is being pushed into a corner. He could still win, he could totally still win, but for now, one side is definitely the aggressor.","382":"The tough thing about chess is you can have a good position, but you actually have to move pieces. You know, like a piece of art, you just say, Oh, it's done.","383":"Black has an initiative. But can black capitalize on this initiative? I don't know. The problem with having a position like this is you feel a lot of pressure to do something.","384":"Yeah, that's the chess player's sign of focus, just- Yeah, when you roll up the sleeves. I guess I have to defend my pawn. I mean, don't really want to, but fine.","385":"That's good, that's a great place to start. There are cells in your brain. Those brain cells are connected by wires to each other. Electricity travels down those wires and communicates from one part of the brain to the other part of the brain, and each of those brain cells makes, you know, a thousand connections, it's something like a hundred trillion connections.","386":"I would say that that map also has your feelings in it because, here's why, your feelings, most neuroscientists think, come from your brain anyway, and amazingly, whether when you feel happy or sad or angry or scared, that's just brain cells communicating with each other.","387":"You got, pretty much, you got a very good idea about it. Basically you have a star, at the core its generating energy, which is countering the pressure of all that mass trying, being pulled in by gravity. Once it can't generate that energy anymore, the core collapses, once the core is collapsing, it keeps collapsing, and collapsing, and collapsing, and that's the critical thing that makes a black hole. You have enough mass in the volume, such that the escaped velocity becomes the speed of light, once light can't escape, hence the black part. (laughs) But that's the thing, is that just because there's an intense amount of gravity very close to a black hole, things don't start behaving differently. And my favorite analogy is a vacuum, everybody thinks, like, if you point a vacuum cleaner at something, it's just gonna suck everything in--","388":"Right, you will feel the gravitational pull, and it'll redirect you in some way, and if you're far enough way, it's just like you're very far away from the sun, or something else. If you're close enough, it will divert your path more, if you're close enough still, then you will get what are called tidal forces, where the difference between, for example, if you're standing next to a black hole, the difference in gravity between your feet and your head actually becomes significant. Next time you see a science fiction movie, if somebody says, Oh, my god, we've been caught in the gravitation field of a black hole, and we're gonna fall in, it's like, no, no, just, if you're far enough away, just thrust a little bit this way, and then you'll slingshot around the black hole.","389":"Well I'm thinking about the idea that there might be more than three dimensions of space. What is your impression of theoretical physicists who think about things like extra dimensions of space that they haven't ever seen?","390":"It does. In fact, one way that different universes might be created and be different from each other is that different universes could have effectively different numbers of dimensions. Like we have three dimensions around us, but there's people out there, aliens, who could live in five dimensional universes.","391":"We think that it would be, no all of this is incredibly speculative, and we don't know for sure. But the idea is that there is some deep down underlying laws that are universal and the same, but they show up differently, so they appear different. So the specific particles and forces and masses would be completely different in different parts of the multiverse.","392":"Mm-hmm. So we have quantum mechanics, right? The theory of atoms and so forth and how those work, and then we have gravity, and gravity doesn't seem to fit in. It's the one force of nature that we can't really easily fit into this quantum mechanical framework, so string theory is one of the best ideas.","393":"That's the good news. The bad news is that it only seems to work if spacetime is ten dimensional. [chuckles] So you would say well then it's wrong. It can't be right. Spacetime is not ten-dimensional. Spacetime is four dimensional. We've observed that. But instead, we say if spacetime looks four dimensional to us, but string theory, which might be the best theory we have of quantum gravity says it must be ten dimensional, maybe we can hide those extra six dimensions somehow. So here's how we could get lucky. We could imagine that there are extra dimensions of space that are curled up somehow that are so small that we can't see them. This is actually an old idea. It goes back to Kaluza and Klein right after general relativity was invented in 1915. But there's a more recent idea that says there could actually be relatively large extra dimensions. There could be extra dimensions that are actually that big, like a millimeter across that you would not have noticed. But here's the new, exciting idea. So let's imagine, okay. This is a piece of paper. But let's imagine this is our entire world. So, in other words, our real world is three dimensional, but let's imagine that we're just idealizing it down to two dimensions, so we all live here. You and I live here. But let's imagine that we're embedded in this bigger space. So there are extra dimensions that are actually big, okay? And let's imagine that. When I say we live on this three dimensional world what I mean is imagine that the particles that you and I are made of, right, the quarks, the leptons, the electrons and everything, all the forces we know about, electromagnetism, the weak nuclear force, the strong nuclear force, imagine they can't leave this surface. This is what we call a brane. B-R-A-N-E. Have you heard this word before?","394":"From membranes, you know. We have lines, one dimension. We have two dimensional surfaces. So if you have a line that is a vibrating physical thing, you call it a string, right?","395":"If you have a two dimensional surface that vibrates and is a physical thing, we call that a membrane. Membrane theory goes back, it never was as popular as string theory, but it's been around for a while. But if you had extra dimensions of space, then you can three dimensional vibrating things, and four dimensional vibrating things.","396":"Well basically the strings are the particles that we see. It's exactly the same thing as we said for the straw, if you look at it far away it looks one dimensional. A little loop of string, so a little one dimensional circle that is vibrating. If you look at it from very, very far away, it just looks like a particle. So in string theory, an electron is a little string. A photon is a little string.","397":"It's even better. It's the theory of everything. What would you tell a friend of yours if they asked you what dimensions are, what extra dimensions are, what a brane is?","398":"That's right. And we could live there. The world we see around us, the three dimensions of space around us could reflect the fact that we are somehow stuck on a three dimensional brane trying to escape.","399":"Absolutely. I don't think we still have a completely satisfactory answer to that question. What was so, such a beautiful insight, as I'm sure you know, is that the idea of zero-knowledge","400":"If you can already predict the answer, then you must not be gaining any knowledge by that interaction. This insight of being able to predict the future accurately, and that being an evidence of a lack of new knowledge,","401":"Right. Sometimes. I mean, for example, in medical research, how amazing would it be, right, to be able to have a drug, and be able to prove that my drug works in this model.","402":"in a zero-knowledge way, without any interaction, right. I can just take the program, convert it to a zero-knowledge program, or an obfuscated program, and then just send it to you.","403":"We're definitely at this moment now, where zero-knowledge is gonna be used more and more. There are so many conferences and meetings that occur in the zero-knowledge space, where you and I are not invited. Because it's for the people who are developing. You know, the people who are programming, not us mathematicians.","404":"So that's a great definition and I wanna pick that apart a little bit. So what you described is just right. Stars, when they run out of thermonuclear fuel are gonna collapse under their own weight. It'll explode in a supernova, it'll leave a core, and if the core itself is heavy enough, it will keep collapsing. It does, as you say, reach this point where not even light can escape. But the amazing thing is it leaves that point, you called it rightly the event horizon, it leaves it behind kind of like an archeological record because the start itself can no more sit at the event horizon than it can race outward at the speed of light. So the core of the star keeps collapsing and where it goes nobody knows. So in a weird way, the black hole isn't anymore a crush of matter. It left it behind in its wake, but the stuff of the star is gone.","405":"Right? Yeah. So that's already a really good idea of what a fractal is. It has some really, really interesting detail at all, scales that makes it hard to talk about standard quantities like lengths and areas and volumes.","406":"Yeah, so if you look at kind of the wrinkly surface of an asteroid, each one of those little wrinkles adds a little bit to the surface area. And so it's really hard to say, what is the area of an asteroid? Let's take a look at a little example of where fractals actually show up in nature. What we're gonna try to do is we're gonna try to say what the length of the coastline of great Britain is. So we're gonna start out with the blue ones, which are spaced further apart. We're gonna ask you to connect the blue pins with a piece of string so we can get a measurement of the coastline. So we have our first measurement of the length of the coastline, and we're gonna do it over again. But this time we're gonna use the white pins, which are spaced closer together. So we measured the coastline again. And what do you think happens?","407":"I think I agree with you, but I think to really validate our scientific experiment, we should probably compare the length of the string. A lot of extra slack in that pig of string. So what we noticed with great Britain is we were never able to measure it's length. It just kept getting longer and longer. This is called the coastline paradox where there's not really one definite number you can assign to the length of the coastline, but it depends on how you measure it. Like if we kept going to really get this to be accurate, we might have to like actually go down the beach and start measuring these tiny little details along the coastline. But really there's so much detail. We would probably never get a definite answer for how long the coastline is. Fractals also give us a really nice language. We're talking about how smooth or rough some kind of shape is. And actually a lot of people, engineers and scientists use this idea of fractals and this language of fractals to compare different shapes, not in terms of their size, but in terms of their roughness. So based on everything we talked about today, how would you describe a fractal to somebody in your own words?","408":"yeah this whole infrastructure is all about creating levels that get progressively colder as you go from top to bottom down to the quantum chip which is how we actually control the state of the cupids","409":"okay so it's this idea that you have two objects and when you entangle them together they become connected and then they're sort of permanently connected to each other and they behave in ways that are sort of a system now so superposition is one quantum property that we use entanglement is another quantum property and a third is interference how much you know about interference","410":"so you can have constructive interference and you can have destructive interference we have constructive interference you have amplitudes wave amplitudes that add until the signal gets larger and if you have destructive interference the amplitudes cancel by using a property like interference we can control quantum states and amplify the kinds of signals that are towards the right answer and then cancel the types of signals that are leading to the wrong answer so given that you know that we're trying to use superposition entanglement and interference for computation how do you think we build these computers","411":"so step one is you need to be able to have an object or physical device we call it a qubit or quantum bit that can actually handle those things can actually be put into superpositions of states you know two cubit states that you can physically entangle with each other that's not really trivial right and things in our classical world you can't really entangle things in our classical world so easily we need to use devices where they can they can support a quantum state and we can manipulate that quantum state atoms ions and in our case superconducting qubits we make qubits out of superconducting materials","412":"It's pretty amazing, right? Because it happened like a year or two ago. Our memory is basically a record in our brain of something that happened in the past, but that record it created isn't perfect. So that day, do you remember was the pool at your hotel?","413":"When you were telling me about the sandbox, it felt like you didn't have to make that guess, that you could just see the sandbox in your eyes. I asked you about the towel. It doesn't come to mind immediately, but you can stop and think about it and kind of make a good guess because there are things you know about the world. And for those of us who study memory that's a really strong hint as to how memory works. And so for you your memory kept all the fun stuff and all the stuff that was important to you, but the details like did you have to have a ticket to get in or how you got there, all these other less interesting, less exciting aspects, your brain kind of decided letting go of all that information.","414":"Yeah, that's a great insight. Basically we can't remember everything. So when you tell us this memory of that vacation and your brain is able to kind of play almost this movie of a memory, a moment, a day that you had in your life a while ago, where do those memories come from?","415":"The hippocampus is a part of your brain that if you kind of took it out and looked at it, it looks a lot like a seahorse and it plays a really important role in creating those kinds of memories that help you two years after your vacation share with me what happened that day, all these details of that day. There's another part of the brain. It's actually also important for memory and it's called the amygdala and it is important for keeping all the kind of emotional processing going for memory. So memory for things that are really scary, it's gonna talk to the hippocampus now and get that memory to be really strong. Why do you think it might be important to remember scary things?","416":"You got it. And so we don't just remember everything and we don't remember random things. We remember the things that matter to us the most. So Abigail based on our conversation today, can you tell me what is a memory?","417":"That's a great way to think about it. Infinity is something that never ends, where finite, the opposite of infinity, refers to a process or a quantity that we could actually count all the way through, at least in theory if given enough time. So if you had to guess, how many Skittles are in this jar?","418":"217. And if we wanted to figure out the exact number, how would we find out? We could put them all out and divide them into pieces of five and then we could use that. Yeah, absolutely. In fact, I did that before you got here, and it's 649 Skittles. Here's a much harder question. How many pieces of glitter do you think are in that jar?","419":"Yeah, you can see them all. And in fact, if we were really, really, really patient, we could do the same thing as with the Skittles. But here's another question. You said that there's a finite amount of glitter in that jar, and I agree. So how many jars would we need to hold an infinite amount of glitter?","420":"Yeah, absolutely not. Because this room holds only a finite amount of space. And in fact, infinitely many jars would not even fit in something called the observable universe, which is the portion of the universe that astronomers can see. Really how does that make you feel?","421":"You have very good intuition. So there are ways that mathematicians can build infinite collections of things. And if you repeat those processes, it's in fact possible to build even bigger and bigger sizes of infinity. So what have you learned today about infinity?","422":"so did you know that there's certain kinds of problems that computers sort of run out of space almost like you're trying to solve the problem and just like how you run out of space on your iphone when you're trying to take a picture if you're trying to solve the problem you just run out of space and even if you have the world's biggest supercomputer did you know that can still happen","423":"okay so quantum mechanics is a branch of science just like any other branch of science it's a branch of physics it's the study of things that are either really really small really really well isolated and really really cold and this particular branch of science is something we're using to totally reimagine how computing works so we're building totally new kinds of computers based on the laws of quantum mechanics that's what a quantum computer is","424":"i don't know what it's worth but uh i can put it face up right in that heads i can put it face down right so at any given time point in time if i ask you is my penny heads or tails probably you could answer it right","425":"it's sort of it's sort of a combination of heads and tails right would you say so superposition is this idea that my penny is not just either heads or tails it's in this state which is a combination of heads and tails this quantum property is something that we can have in real real physical objects in the world so that's super position and the second thing that we'll talk about is called entanglement so now i'm going to give you a penny","426":"but in the quantum world when we entangle things they're really now connected it's much much harder to separate them again so using the same analogy we spin our pennies and eventually eventually they both stop right and when they stop it's either heads or tails right so in my case i got tails and you got heads you see how they're totally disconnected from each other right our pennies in the real world now if our pennies were entangled and we both spun them together right when we stopped them if you measured your penny to be ahead i would measure my penny to be ahead and if you measured your penny to be a tails i would measure my opinion to be a tails if we measured it at exactly the same time we would still find that they were both exactly correlated","427":"the way that we are able to actually see these quantum properties is by making our quantum chips really really cold so that's what this is all about actually this is called a dilution refrigerator and it's a refrigerator it doesn't look like a normal refrigerator right but it's something that we use actually there's usually a case around it to cool our quantum chips down cold enough that we can create superpositions and we can entangle qubits and the information isn't lost to the environment","428":"So black holes, you describe them as huge. The interesting thing about black holes is they're hugely heavy, but they're actually physically really small. What really matters is the density. Do you know what density is?","429":"I can also ask how big it is, which is a question about its volume. If I make it smaller, then what's happening is it's becoming more dense. So imagine I crushed this really, really small. It would weigh the same, it would have the same mass, but it would be much more dense.","430":"If a star is heavy enough to explode into supernova what's left begins to collapse under its own weight. And if that's heavy enough, the core will not be able to stop collapsing, 'cause it no longer has the thermonuclear fuel, it's run outta fuel. And if it's run outta fuel, it's no longer shining and pushing outward. And without that it itself begins to go dark and there's nothing fighting the collapse anymore. And that's when you form a black hole.","431":"Well, that's a really good question. So interestingly, the sun itself isn't heavy enough. So it has to be heavy enough that when it begins to collapse, it just overcomes all attempts to fight it. If you made something really dense, you would have to travel faster than the speed of light to actually escape. That's 300,000 kilometers per second.","432":"So it goes so fast that it goes completely dark. Any light that veers too close will fall in, will not be able to make it back out again. If a light is shining from the sun near a black hole, the black hole's not touching it. Why does the light get pulled in? Why does that happen?","433":"It is taking other stuff, but the funny question was like, if I wanted to move your chair, you'd think it was really strange if I didn't have to come near you and actually grab the chair and move it. One of the things Einstein thought about is he imagined that what the black hole is doing is it's changing the shape of space around it. What do you think of that idea?","434":"Isn't it crazy? And then Einstein goes a step further and thinks, well, what black holes must be doing is curving the space so strongly that even light gets caught. Sometimes you can get light caught into a whole orbit, literally the light going round and round in an orbit.","435":"Is there any particular memory for you that you feel has been either kind of influential in your, in deciding which areas to pursue or that you feel is sort of emblematic of what it is to have a memory?","436":"I've got one too. I was nine and we were at the science expo in San Francisco. Two scientists were dissecting an eye, a cow's eye. And I was like that is the coolest thing I've ever seen. And something about that that carried me forward. Something happened so long ago, it left some long lasting trace through neural circuits and it continues to shape the decisions we make about what to study and what to do.","437":"this really specific combination of zeros and ones everything that your computer does showing you pink panther videos on youtube calculating things searching the internet it does all of that with a really specific combination of zeros and ones which is crazy right that would be like saying your computer only understands these quarters for each quarter you need to tell it that you're going to use heads tails and you assign it heads or tails so i can switch between heads and tails and i can switch the zeros and ones in my computer so that it represents what i wanted to represent like an a and with quantum computers we have new rules we get to use too we can actually spin one of our quarters so it doesn't have to choose just one or the other","438":"yeah they can especially if doing your homework involves calculating something or finding information but what if your homework was to discover something totally new a lot of those discovery questions are much harder to solve using the computers we have today so the reason we're building these kinds of computers is because we think that maybe one day they're going to do a lot of really important things like help us understand nature better maybe help us create new medicines to help people","439":"And at some level, there's different set of rules that seem to come into play 'cause you can have particles at very microscopic scales seem to do really strange things. But one of the quests of quantum sensing is to harvest some of these unique properties at the micro scale. We are really interested in quantum sensors because we think they can give us the ultimate limit of sensitivity. So they're really, really sensitive to small changes, but they're also gonna be really reliable. Every time I make that measurement, I'll always get the same results.","440":"And what the MRI scanner is doing is, it's measuring the signal from all the water molecules that are present and specifically the hydrogen atom. In our bodies, we have these hydrogen atoms that are essentially spinning around magnetic fields all the time and we just don't know them. So in some sense, you've already used a quantum sensor.","441":"And then the different chemicals in the cells. If you look at the MRI images, you can see that they give you the broad features of what the tissue looks like. But if you wanna zoom in a little bit more and see what's actually happening inside a tissue or inside a cell and you need a different type of sensor that's gonna be more sensitive and for something like that, you're gonna need a quantum sensor.","442":"We can do it on tissues right now or on the surface, but we can't actually do it inside the body. So right now, we're struggling to figure out which scenarios can we use this to get better information and when can we not do it.","443":"It's still pretty easy, right? It turns out that stacking these two cups, it's actually really hard for robots to do that. So, let's think about how we might have a robot stack these two cups. You could program the robot to move its hand right here and then program the robot to close its hand around the cup.","444":"Exactly, right? That seemed pretty simple for the robot to do. Say we even just move the cup over here. Do you think the robot would still be able to stack the cups?","445":"Exactly. So, Moravec's paradox is something that means that these really simple things, like stacking cups, is really, really hard for robots, even though it's really easy for us. While robots are actually really good at really complicated and really difficult things. Think about the task of multiplying two really big numbers together.","446":"In a way, it's part of the same continuum. What you're doing is changing the technological platform and you're actually able to probe it more sensitively. The resolution you're able to get is much higher, so you can see smaller signals in a much smaller volume.","447":"You have to be close to it. You can detect it optically because if we tried to detect the magnetic moment of the electron, we wouldn't be able to do that because there, the energy is too low compared to thermal energies. But what the diamond system gives you is a natural up conversion in energy. So you can couple into an optical photon, which is then much easier to detect a single optical photon than it is to detect a micro wave.","448":"One of the key challenges, I think for all, any quantum technology is really understanding what limits your coherence times. And then the next question that comes up often is how do we make this better? So if I take a single qubit or a single spin, there's a certain limit up to its sensitivity. But if I can take entangled spins, in principle, I could make the system much more sensitive, but it usually comes at a cost 'cause when I entangle something, it's much more sensitive to de-coherence as well.","449":"I think as you said, you know, anything that interferes with my signal is noise, but it can come from different sources. In some ways, the operation of the quantum system itself, as it's sensitive to different physical phenomena, the ones that I don't like, I call noise. The ones I do like, I call signal and that's an artificial definition that I'm making when I choose to build a sensor. One of the challenges we have is, we're trying to figure out if I wanna control it, where is it coming from? I remember we had experiments running in our lab one day and we were running these experiments about 100 megahertz. All of a sudden, we saw these big spikes coming in and we realized we're picking up the local FM stations.","450":"And that was a source of noise, like, it's completely random, but it is still there. And then the other form is very much what is intrinsically within your experiment itself because some of the materials that you have have defects that are coupling into your sensor, into your quantum system and are also producing noise.","451":"Right, it could give you information if you read it out, about what's happening or you have to find smart ways to suppress it so that you can focus on what you really do care about.","452":"So one of the things that we're interested in is looking at, suppose, I want to build an entangled quantum sensor, when I put a number of spins together, in addition to being sensitive to an external field, they're sensitive to each other and they start talking to each other. You don't just see the external spins, you see the fluctuations of all the other spins in your system. So what you wanna do is make sure that they don't interact with each other, but they still stay sensitive to everything else. And there, you could think about the local interactions, the magnetic interactions between the spins as a form of noise. In some ways, it's interfering with what you wanna measure, which is the magnetic field outside the sample.","453":"Okay, back into the 1960s, there was a research agency in the United States called DARPA, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency. Actually, it was called ARPA at the time. They wanted to build this notion of a packet-switching network. Not a circuit switch network like a phone network where you get a dedicated path and a dedicated set of bandwidth and links from source to destination.","454":"There's a lot big, right? And so remember, this was a Department of Defense, was they wanted to have forms of of communication that were very robust, that were survivable. Packets could all find their own ways, be routed differently through the network. So if parts of the network failed, you could route around failures.","455":"So you can sort of see how the network architecture that wasn't designed to be 100% reliable inside the core of the network, and had that complexity built into the edges of the network. And to me, the really cool thing is you put this infrastructure in place, and then all these super creative people think about amazing things to build on top of it. And you see this proliferation of amazing applications.","456":"Ah ha! Spoken like a real computer scientist, right? You're a computer scientist. I'm a computer scientist. We talk about APIs, application programming interfaces. The API for the internet is something called a socket. And a socket simply says, I can communicate if I know your internet address, you know, 128.119.40.186, that number is the IP address of my server, the University of Massachusetts. If you know that, you can write a program anywhere in the world and send a message, and it'll pop out at my end.","457":"That's 98% true. And if you own a network, like you're att.com, or your verizon.com, you can do, within that network, you can do what you want, right? So in that sense, the internet is very decentralized, that the control of the network is up to whoever owns the network. The 2% where you said there's nobody in control, there's a little bit of centralized control. There's an organization called the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers. Its responsibility is to handle, as the name ICANN suggests, names and numbers. It's that little bit of centralization, central authority that you need.","458":"Exactly, right. And maybe they're dropped in your apartment, but much more likely, they're dropped because of congestion somewhere between the Hulu or the Netflix or the Disney server, if you're watching a video, and your home. So even though you've got 200 megabits per second on that last hop, you don't have 200 megabits per second from the server into your apartment.","459":"The Mandelbrot set or the Julia set, you know, the idea is always, oh, I'm gonna apply some polynomial over and over again. Z squared plus C or something like that. When I think about fractals, I try to get away from these very specific examples and ask, what is it fundamentally that makes a fractal, a fractal. And one thing that I think you can be precise about, even if you can't really say exactly what a fractal is, is you can talk about this idea of fractal dimension. Have you ever heard of that?","460":"Yeah, great. So, so the real physical paper has some amount of thickness, but when we model this mathematically, we might ignore the thickness and say, yeah, this is really just kind of a two dimensional sheet of paper. And then you have your apple, how many dimensions is the apple?","461":"Totally, now, as a little experiment, take your piece of paper and just crumple it into a ball. So what is it? Is the paper three dimensional or is it two dimensional?","462":"So it's not quite as solid as the apple, but it's also not quite as two dimensional as the original sheet of paper. And so for this reason, people associate this crumpled ball with a fractal dimension, maybe something like 2.5 dimensions instead of two or three, there are a lot of different definitions, precise definitions of fractal dimension. But I think the one that's easiest to understand is this thing called box counting dimension. You have, let's say an image and you want to decide what's the fractal dimension of this image. So what you're gonna do is you're gonna count the number of boxes, or you can imagine big pixels of this image that cover the boundary of this shape. And you're gonna see how does that counting compare with how the counts work for just an ordinary shape? So, so if I have a straight line and I start out with one big box that covers the whole line, and now I shrink my boxes by a factor of two, I just make boxes half as big. How many boxes will I need to cover that line?","463":"But if you take a more interesting shape, some kind of fractal shape, like let's say the coastline of great Britain and you start doing this box, counting experiment, something really interesting happens as you make these boxes smaller, the number of boxes you need to cover the coastline grows faster than it would for just a straight line.","464":"And so what this box counting is getting at is saying, well, I still can never decide what the length of the coastline is, but what I can do is I can see how quick does the number of boxes grow relative to how it would grow just for an ordinary one dimensional curve, like a line or a circle.","465":"So procedural computer graphics, which kind of came out of thinking about fractals is one answer to this question about how do you add more detail without for instance, consuming tons of memory or requiring artists to paint ultra detail the textures. So if, if you can instead describe at least some aspect of what you're looking at in a procedural or recursive way, then you can add as much detail as you need when you get close to objects.","466":"Yeah like perlin noise is a great example, right? Perlin noise was one of the early ways of synthesizing additional texture at any level of detail that you needed to make things look natural and realistic.","467":"Yeah like perlin noise is a great example, right? Perlin noise was one of the early ways of synthesizing additional texture at any level of detail that you needed to make things look natural and realistic. I have a, a random question. Do you know how the research into fractals began? You can look pretty far back in history to see kind of glimmers of this idea of fractals in science in the 19th century, people were trying to look for examples of things in mathematics that were very unnatural. So there was, for instance, this guy named Georg Cantor, who was showing that you can have these sets with really strange properties, or you can have functions with really strange properties. This thing called the devil staircase and so on. And it wasn't until about a century later where someone named Mendel Brock said, Oh, actually this strange mathematics that was meant to show how unnatural things can happen is actually a perfect description of things that really do happen in nature. And from there, people really ran with it and said, Oh, okay, well, if these fractal descriptions are good for nature, we can also use that for creating really realistic and believable pictures in computer graphics.","468":"I'll grant you that Hilbert's Hotel does not exist. For me, infinite objects absolutely exist. And I can't read the thoughts in your head, but I have a high degree of confidence that we have a lot of the same ideas about infinity.","469":"I mean I think that's another common misconception about mathematics is that it's so far removed from the humanities, for instance. I mean it's hard to ignore some of these philosophical questions, particularly when we're talking about certain things like infinity. And I think one of the most difficult things to really be precise about and to explain to students is the continuum hypothesis. What do you say to students about the continuum hypothesis?","470":"What I love about what you were describing is like you didn't use the word memory, were how you were talking about kind of perceptions and social judgments but I think probably we'd both agree that memory is a big part of that.","471":"Right, like it reminds me so much of, you know, what we in the field would refer to as statistical learning. On one hand we might have like a one-shot memory, a memory of something that we saw yesterday, like what we did or what we ate or where we were. But a lot of our memories and our knowledge instead are based on many, many, many experiences.","472":"I think what we're still kind of trying to understand as a field is the more kind of detailed and bigger picture of where does this model live? How does it get updated based on experiences? Why does that sometimes happen and sometimes not? There are actually people who are born without a hippocampus. They have disruptions to episodic memories. They have trouble after this conversation remembering what the conversation was about, but they do have pretty good semantic information. They have a good sense of knowledge about the world. And that's interesting for two reasons. One, it shows this association between the role of the hippocampus and these two forms of memory, episodic memories and semantic memory. The other reason it's interesting is that people often assume that we get to semantic memory through episodic memory, that we encounter one dog and then another dog, and then another dog and then we learned the concept, the semantic notion of a dog. And these people, their profile suggests that you can learn semantic information. You can learn general knowledge about the world, even without ever having the capacity to build those individual memories.","473":"You know when I look back at, some of the work for my own lab and in the field in general, I really feel like some of the most exciting discoveries were not an answer to a question that was around before, but they were discoveries that made us realize we weren't asking the right question. I think one example of that even has to do with the connection between memory and decision-making. There was a discovery about how the striatum responds to rewards and to learning that just all of a sudden flipped the way we thought about the role of reward and learning and memory, and may force us to realize there was something fundamentally connected between these processes. And that discovery just raised a whole new set of questions that didn't exist before.","474":"Yeah it looks really blocky. And it's the same thing not only with shapes and games, but also colors and textures. And this is an especially a big problem in virtual reality because you have no control over where people are gonna go. What they're gonna look at, how close they're gonna get to various objects. So fractals on the other hand are these things that have infinitely, you know, nice details you get closer and closer and closer. And so this is something that can help us solve this problem in computer graphics of generating more detail. One of the reasons why fractals are really nice for computer graphics is because the algorithms that we use to draw images also have this kind of recursive flavor. What's recursion?","475":"So subdivision surface is a way of describing a smooth shape on a computer rather than some complicated fractal shape. So meshes and computer graphics are usually made of these flat polygons with kind of sharp edges. And so the question is how can I get something nice and round and smooth out of these sharp looking polygons? What I can do is I can start cutting one at a time, the corners of this paper off, it still looks very angular. I still have these really sharp points.","476":"Because I want to draw a smooth curve on the screen, but all my computer can do is draw straight lines. And that's actually too true of GPUs. It's kind of interesting. GPUs are basically really fast machines that can only draw one thing and that's a flat triangle. And so if we keep doing this with our paper, you kind of get pretty quickly the idea of what's gonna happen. So when you go to see a Pixar movie, for instance, every surface has been subdivided down. So you have tiny little triangles called micro polygons that are even smaller than the size of a pixel.","477":"Well, because people who really need to use these subdivision services for everything, people who worked hard over the years to make this super, super fast. In fact, subdivision services were invented basically at Pixar. There's this guy, Ed Capel, and he was harshly responsible for one of the most famous kinds of subdivision surfaces called Capel Clark subdivision surfaces. And in fact recently won the touring award for these subdivision services.","478":"Well, we're gonna be talking about computers here today, and we're gonna be talking about the internet. I always like to think of the internet by analogy to say road systems for example, where you have roads in your neighborhood. You have state roads, you have the Interstate Highway System. And so the internet is a lot like that. It's an interconnection of local roads, local networks like the network in your house for example.","479":"Wow. Great question. Often, it's a little blue wire called an ethernet cable. So that cable is able to bring bits of information up into your apartment at say, a billion bits per second. That's pretty fast, right? Literally a wire that goes between a box in your apartment, sometimes called a router or a modem in your apartment that comes from an internet service provider come into this first network and then that network connects to another network connects to another network connects to another network.","480":"We could talk about that by analogy to a road system. It's not just one big, super highway. It's a lot of smaller super highways that are all interconnected. And those interchanges are what are called routers. That's where the links come together. You're talking about talking to a friend in Australia. So oh, it's coming in from the East Coast of the United States to this router, and it's going out say, that routers in San Francisco, it's going out on an underseas cable over to Australia rather than in this direction up to Japan.","481":"The underseas cables are so cool! They're these big cables that are laid down by switches. They cross both the Atlantic, the Pacific, the Indian Ocean. So the undersea cables are how the networks in Europe, United States, Asia are all connected together.","482":"That's really what we call the first hop. It's like from your phone, from your tablet, from the computer that you're on, there's no cables coming in. You go over a wireless connection. Wi-Fi is the protocol that allows your computer to talk to that first hop router over a wireless communication link.","483":"One thing I find really fascinating about robotics is that the things that are so simple for us, like feeding yourself broccoli, so second nature to us, are really hard for robotics. When you try to take a robot and train it to do a task and simulation, and the simulation isn't perfectly accurate, it's really hard to actually model the physics of how tofu crumbles.","484":"I think I have a somewhat similar perspective to you in that, if we provide more structure and support, and sort of forms of prior knowledge or experience in the algorithm, that should make it more efficient. And so if we can acquire those kinds of priors about the world and about interaction from previous data, maybe offline data, then I think we should be able to make learning of new tasks more efficient.","485":"It's a really, really hard problem. A lot of simulators, they don't simulate the world as a fine enough time granularity to really accurately capture things like skewing an object, for example. One thing that I think is promising is to try to not build simulators entirely from first principles, from our knowledge of physics. But instead to look at real data and see how real data might inform our simulations and try to build, allow robots to build models of the world, build simulators of the world, based on data and based on experiences. There's a little bit of a chicken and egg problem, because if we wanna use simulators to get lots of data, and we also need data to get good simulators, then there's no way to get around this.","486":"So over the past four levels, we've been talking about Moravec's paradox. I'm curious to get your perspective. There are still a lot of open questions for how to leverage previous experience and learn cumulatively over time.","487":"That notion of hierarchy is really interesting, because it is these higher level things, like playing chess, for example, that are easier for AI systems. And the reason why they're easier is that we're providing the abstraction for the system already, then when we give the game of chess to an AI system, we abstract away all the challenges of like picking up pieces and moving them, and we say, 'Okay, there's this board of however many boxes on it.' And you just need to figure out within that very narrow, small world, what to do. But handling and learning what those abstractions should be and handling everything from low level sensory inputs to that higher level processing is really, really hard.","488":"Yeah. It is exactly using quantum phenomena to sense and measure things and the idea is that, if I can harness quantum phenomena and I can push the limits that are possible, I can get something that's ultimately more precise and potentially more accurate over time too.","489":"So I study spins. And so, spins are one of the platforms that people have suggested is a useful platform for building quantum technologies and I study spins on the solid state. And one of the platforms I work on is nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond.","490":"So in some sense, the phenomena we're studying essentially is nuclear magnetic resonance or electron spin resonance which is a very similar phenomena, but uses the spin of the electron rather than the spin of the nuclei.","491":"So that's in some ways the key to both quantum sensing, as well as quantum computing. It's the idea that you can take a system and put it in a superposition of two states. Normally we think of classically a bit can be a zero or a one. So switch is either on or off. Whereas in a quantum system, it can be in what's called a superposition. So it can be partially on and partially off. But one of the challenges with quantum systems is that these superpositions are really hard to maintain because we don't see superpositions in the world around us. In quantum computing, you try really hard to isolate everything so that you can maintain this quantum property and the fact that it's actually going to lose its quantum properties as it interacts with the world also makes it a great sensor because now you're actually, you're using that fact that it's interacting with the world to say, wait, it's sensing something.","492":"So rather than trying to build a lot of complex algorithms and gates with it, what you do is, you take these quantum bits and you take them out into the world and say, what do you see? What are you sensitive to? So you can use an idea called entanglement to make an even more sensitive quantum sensor, but it's even more fragile. So there's always this trade-off between being super fragile and being super sensitive at the same time.","493":"In some ways, it is and you know, atomic clocks are remarkable devices and being able to measure time that precisely has really important consequences. In fact, our old GPS system is based on the accuracy of atomic clocks. They're a set of satellites, each of which has an atomic clock on board and they send out a timestamp and so, once it gets a signal from three different satellites, it can triangulate and figure out exactly where you are. Now, if you could make those clocks even more precise, you could actually accurately position where you are even more accurately.","494":"Our topic today is quantum sensing. So quantum is about the study of stuff that's really, really, really small and sensing is about measuring. So the word sensing comes from kind of like our senses. So do you know what your five senses are?","495":"Touch, exactly. So it's kind of really important for us to be able to have these senses, so we know what's happening in the world around us, right? In doing quantum sensing is we're trying to measure things that can be hard to see. Let me show you. Can you see inside it with your eyes?","496":"You wouldn't be able to see into the middle. If you had the right tools, you could start to think about ways to look inside the ball without cutting it open. That would then, you'd still have your ball. We could still play with it.","497":"For example, we want to go inside, let's say the human body and see what's happening. Sometimes we can look under the surface of the Earth and see what's underneath it. We can make really, really precise clocks that will tell us, that can measure time really, really accurately. And we can make very, very fine measurements that'll tell us about the rules of science and how the world works around us. But we need to build better tools that allow us to do that.","498":"Like how can that possibly be? What I wanna do is prove to you that I know this combination without revealing the combination to you. And what you could do is you could write a little note, a secret that I definitely wouldn't know. Fold it up, stick it in here. And then, if I know the combination, I should be able to open it and tell you what you wrote. All right. There we go. All right. So,My dog is named Doug. Did you figure out what the combination was?","499":"So you're asking like, why shouldn't I just share my secrets with somebody? People don't trust each other. And if I was able to prove that I've done something correctly to someone without having to reveal my secrets, then that person would trust me more.","500":"What would you guys do? You'd probably first get together and like, figure out some secret code, right? And then like, write messages to each other in that code. But what if you've never met the person before? What if you wanna exchange secret messages with me and we've never met each other before? How could we possibly do that?","501":"But it's not. You wouldn't use like, a physical lock, or a physical box. We would instead use mathematics to do these kinds of things. You could take a message and encrypt it using mathematics. And then, I could prove to you that I know the key, I could open it up, and send it back to you. That way I would be proving to you that I know the mathematical key to the mathematical lockbox. So based on what we've discussed today, in your own words, what is a zero-knowledge proof.","502":"Yeah, and probably nobody is. Have you heard a lot in your studies about these super massive black holes that we think lurk in the centers of very nearly every galaxy?","503":"Yeah, I think it's a really good question. The only mechanism that we know for sure can form black holes is to collapse of very massive stars. So it's sensible to think, well maybe some very massive stars in a young universe collapsed under their own weight and then they merged and after some time they got big enough, but the black holes from stars can be tens of times the mass of the sun, maybe hundreds of times to the mass of the sun if they merge. To get to millions and billions, and if you just do the simple arithmetic of how many years that would take, there aren't enough years in the 14 billion years of the universe's lifetime. So they must have come from somewhere else.","504":"There might be many alternate routes. It might be in the very early universe that bubbles in unusual phase transitions from very high energy universe to a low energy universe can make black holes. Like, we haven't really thought of the range of possibilities.And so there could also be primordial black holes that are still around that also skipped the star stage altogether that were formed really in the very earliest phases. And I think the interesting thing is, with your looking at like the Large Magellanic Cloud, is to wonder if we're gonna merge.","505":"But when we do merge with Andromeda, presumably our black holes will merge and Andromeda indeed has a very big black hole as well at its center. And then we'll have this just gigantic-","506":"Yeah, and it's very possible that as you said, the collision won't be so severe that it'll be very disruptive. So our entire solar system could stay intact and here we would go with the sun and all the other planets in orbit around a new black hole.","507":"We work a lot right now on thinking of black holes as batteries. So a black hole that can take, like a giant magnet, astronomical magnet in the form of another collapsed star, like a neutron star, and flip it around so fast, near the speed of light, that it actually creates an electronic circuit out of this moving magnet. And so that the power that can come out of these electronic circuits created by these batteries can be tremendous.","508":"It's a great question. I once did a calculation of using a black hole made out of the moon and the strongest magnet we could find on Earth to see if I could make an electronic battery. And honestly, you only get about enough energy to power New York City. But we have to find one in our neighborhood first.","509":"Right, and it allows you to prove that you've been behaving honestly, without revealing any of the secrets involved that you use to actually behave honestly. So we of course know that zero-knowledge proofs for NP-complete languages plays such a huge role in cryptography. I'm curious. What was your first experience with Np-completeness like?","510":"Exactly. Right. Because random is unpredictable and that's what we want. Right. We want that unpredictability around us to be utilized, to actually hide the information that we wanna hide. How have you used your knowledge in the projects that you've worked on? What are the challenges that you find?","511":"And also in the blockchain space, for example, if you wanna speed up the generation of proofs, if that could be done in a distributed way, then that would be great. One of the hopes that I have is that the power of multi-party computation is about bringing people together who are mutually distrustful.","512":"It's a great analogy. You know I remember when I first learned of your work, for me as somebody who studies learning and memory, which are processes that are all about rapid updating that to me was really mind blowing that we can now start asking questions about dynamics of circuits on a timescale that's much closer to the timescale of human thought than anything we had before.","513":"It's really interesting. And I think it also really speaks to the kind of pervasive and circular role of memory, right? Because the maps are dependent on memories, they're built from memories and experiences. So there's this kind of dialogue with memory creating maps, maps creating experiences, experiences creating memories, affecting the maps, and really makes me think even of a question a friend asked me recently about moods and mental health and this feeling of like how do some people get kind of trapped in a state of mind where all they can see is a particular way forward. But then something happens in the world that shifts them to another model.","514":"Getting way out there, but, but it is a way in which if you have the right model, it should be an efficient one. I'm wondering what you, what you think about what all this means for kind of a redefinition of what memory is, in many ways a revision or expansion of that notion. Would you be willing to try to help me think about how to define it?","515":"So actually, in the blockchain space is one of the spaces where we are seeing zero-knowledge proofs being implemented. And I think it's just the beginning. Let's talk about zero-knowledge proofs. At its core, a zero-knowledge proof is an interaction between two people. Then I should be able to convince you that some statement is true, but you won't have any idea why it's true.","516":"And the way we're gonna approach this is through something called NP-completeness. What an NP-complete problem is, it's a problem that's really hard to solve. But if you can solve it, you can solve any problem that's in the class NP. And that includes a vast number of problems. And what we're gonna do is we're gonna use an NP-complete problem to actually prove an incredible variety of statements through a zero-knowledge proof. And the specific Np-complete problem that we're gonna be looking at is called map three-coloring. Okay, so here we have a map. Okay. And these are a bunch of countries. And we've arranged them so that no countries that have the same color share a border. That's what makes a map like this validly colored. And now you might think, well, why should we care? It turns out that whether or not a map can be three-colored in this way is an example of an NP-complete problem. And it turns out that, you know, maybe what you really wanna do, is you wanna give a zero-knowledge proof that you have at least 0.3 Bitcoins, right? That would be cool.","517":"Right? So you have a little bit of confidence, right, that I have managed to color this correctly. but not that much confidence. 'Cause I've only shown you two of the countries.","518":"Right? So now, of course, one way to get more confidence is to open up more of them for you, but that would be revealing information to you. I don't wanna do that. So instead, I'm gonna ask you to please turn around. And now, let's change up these colors. Can you pick two countries at random and we'll reveal two of the colors again.","519":"But as you'll see, now it's not green, it's blue. And this one on the other hand, is green. Okay. The colors I showed you last time, don't work with these new colors, right? This wouldn't have worked before.","520":"Exactly. Right. But it works for this coloring that I'm showing you right now. So what we've done is we've made it impossible for you to put the pieces together. And if you do this, let's say, a thousand times. And if I correctly showed you different colors, each thousand times, you'd be really convinced. And that's it. That's the entire zero-knowledge proof.","521":"One great example is like in elections. If you could prove that an election was correctly conducted. That every vote was counted, and it all added up to one person winning with a particular total, in zero-knowledge, then you don't have to give up the actual votes of any person. And yet everyone could see that, hey, yeah, it was done correctly.","522":"So one of my main research areas is something called category theory, it's been described as the mathematics of mathematics. It's a language that can be used to prove very general theorems. And an interesting aspect of being a researcher in category theory that doesn't come up as much in other areas is that we have to really pay attention to the axioms of set theory in our work. When you're proving theorems, have you ever used the axiom of choice?","523":"So the way I think about it is if you have an infinite or an arbitrary family of sets and you know for sure that none of these sets are empty, then a choice function would allow you to select an element from each set sort of all at once. When you've used the axiom of choice in proofs, do you know which incarnation of this you've used?","524":"So there are three well-known famous equivalent forms of the axiom of choice. The well ordering principle is the assumption, the axiom that any set can be well ordered, but there are lots of subsets of real numbers that do not have a minimal element. So that ordering is not a well ordering. So here's the key question. Do you believe the axiom of choice?","525":"You do believe the axiom of choice, though it leads us to some strange conclusions. So if the axiom choice is true, then it's necessarily the case that there exists a well ordering of the reals. And what that means is that we can perform induction over real numbers like we perform induction over the natural numbers. This is trans-finite induction. It would work for any ordinal. So there must be some uncountably infinite ordinal that represents the order type of the real numbers. And this allows us to prove some crazy things. Imagine three-dimensional Euclidean space. So the space that we live in, extending infinitely in all directions. So it is possible to completely cover three-dimensional Euclidean space by disjoint circles, so infinitesimal circles, disjoint circles of radius one. So what that means is you can put a circle somewhere in space and then put a second circle somewhere in space that can't intersect with the first one because these are solid circles and then another circle can somehow cover every single point in space with no gaps in between.","526":"So Cantor's diagonal argument can be abstracted and then generalized to prove that for an arbitrary set A, its power set has a strictly larger cardinality. And since that's true for any set, we can just iterate this process. When set theory was being discovered or invented or created in the late 19th century, one of the natural question to ask is can there be a universe of all sets? This comes up in my research in category theory because even though there is no set of all sets, we would really like for there to be a category of sets. So what category theorists need to do to make their work rigorous is to add additional axioms to set theory. One of my favorites was introduced by an algebraic geometer Alexander Grothendieck. This is something that we sometimes call a Grothendieck universe, or also an inaccessible cardinal. It's an infinite number that is so big that it cannot be accessed by any of the other constructions within set theory. It's so big that we'll never get to it and this allows us to contemplate the collection of all sets whose cardinality is bounded by this size that will never reach.","527":"So what you're describing is the famous Hawking radiation where a black hole cleverly kind of steals energy from the quantum vacuum and radiates and in the process of evaporates. And of course this caused a big kerfuffle because when the black hole evaporates, eventually that event horizons is yanked up. And the question is, where did everything go that had once fallen in?","528":"There's this domain of black holes in astrophysics where we see stars collapse, and we know that they exist and there's whole observational astronomy around them. And then there's this domain that we're talking about, where, as you said, black holes are so special because they're kind of guiding us in the right direction to understand the very nature of reality. And that makes them really unusually special. And one of the things I wanted to draw out is that we talk about the fundamental forces of nature. So there's the matter forces, and then the outlier is gravity. We've quantized all the matter forces in a way that we're rather comfortable with. Gravity keeps resisting quantization of gravity itself. And now we're thinking in a way that you're describing that, well, maybe it's only the quantum forces altogether.","529":"It is amazing in the numerical simulations of two black holes merging, you really see the event horizons bobble around. And we were talking earlier about how really black holes are flawless, they don't tolerate those kinds of imperfections. And so you can so quickly watch the system wring away that misshapen merger. And it comes out in the gravitational waves, which is literally the ripples in the shape of spacetime until it settles down, and then it's utterly flawless again. It really happens fast. It's quite amazing.","530":"So a fractal is something that we see every day, but it's a little bit hard to describe. It's it's a shape that if you look at it really far away, or you look at it really up close, it has kind of a similar appearance. And actually that word fractal sounds a little bit like fraction.","531":"And that's kind of what we're gonna try out today. In fact, we're gonna have you build a fractal. A tree is a really good example of a fractal because if you look at the whole tree and then you break off a big branch of the tree.","532":"So your tree is totally beautiful, but it took a long time to make, right. How would you feel if I said, now you have to make a thousand of those trees.","533":"Yeah, it's a ton of work. If you think about Moana's island, it has these tens and hundreds of thousands of trees on it. And that's why we need computers to help us out because computers are really good at taking these really simple rules, like put two branches on every other branch and doing it really, really fast.","534":"Like coding, exactly. That's what actually a lot of the artists for the movies are working with code rather than with a paintbrush. So in your own words, how would you describe a fractal to somebody?","535":"We're used to ethernet cables that can handle many hundreds of gigabits per second over a wired device. What are the typical data rates for IoT devices? I mean, not hundreds of gigabits.","536":"My sense is you're spot on, that they'll produce over time, a lot of data. And that a lot of IoT is about computing on that data. That computation happened mostly at the edge, or somehow a combination between the edge and something happening in a far away data center.","537":"it's something that we've already figured out for classical computing like something that amazes me is all the parallels between what we're going through now for quantum computing and what we went through for classical computing","538":"exactly so i think something that frustrates a lot of people about quantum computing is the concept of decoherence right you can only keep your information quantum for so long right and that limits how many operations you can do in a row before you lose your information","539":"it let's talk about some of the things we think need to happen between now and fully fault tolerant quantum computers to get us to that reality i mean there's so many things that need to happen in my mind one of the things we need to do is build all these different layers of abstraction that make it easier for programmers to come in and just enter at the ground level you know","540":"And things that are hard for humans should also be hard for robots and humans to do. But it turns out that it's actually the opposite. I wanna try a little demo.","541":"So I have a penny in my hand and I'd like you to pick it up with your right hand and put it into your left hand. So that was pretty easy, right?","542":"We're gonna make this a little bit harder now. So, can you put these on? And we'll try to do the same thing again with your eyes closed. There you go. Let's try that one more time, and see if you can do any better. So close your eyes.","543":"Yeah. So that you're able, with a bit more practice, you're able to figure it out. When it fell on the ground, how did you know to pick it up off the ground?","544":"So when a robot tries to do something, like pick up an object, not only do you need to program exactly like what the motors should do, the robot also needs to be able to see where the object is. Then this is what's called a perception action loop in robotics. So if the object moves, the robot can then adapt what it's doing and change what it's doing to successfully pick up the object. It's really important for robots to be able to leverage, not just like the past hour of experience, but also ideally many years of experience, in order to do the kinds of things that you did.","545":"That's a great question. So in reinforcement learning, the robot tries the task, and then it gets some sort of reinforcement, some sort of feedback. It's similar to how you might train a dog.","546":"So you could give it feedback like that. So it won't necessarily know itself, especially on the first few tries, but it's trying to figure out what the task is even.","547":"We give robots a camera and the camera produces this array of numbers. Basically, each pixel has three different numbers, one for R, for G and for B. And so the robot sees this really massive set of numbers. And it has to be able to figure out, from that massive set of numbers, what is in the world. There is a number of different ways to have the robot see, but we use a technique called neural networks, that tries to take out in those big numbers and form representations of the objects in the world, and where those objects are.","548":"It depends on how you program the robot. If you program the robot to follow exact motions and follow a very specific program, then it won't go off that program. It will always do those actions. But if something unexpected happens, that the program wasn't designed to handle, then the robot might go off court.","549":"Or you don't even need computers. Like I remember when I was a kid, I played electric guitar and I had all these guitar pedals with different effects and oh, what happens if you put the output back in the input and just run it through itself, you're gonna start hearing this kind of fractal sound, right? So today we've been telling people, fractals are things that are somehow self-similar, they have detail at all scales. Are there other ways you might introduce fractals to somebody or are there other things you might say, this is what a fractal is?","550":"I think about like the scale and variance of different physical equations, like navier-stokes is, you know, kind of scale and variant, you know, this Reynolds number that tells you how viscous things are, but you can have the same kind of fluid behavior at all different scales. And that's why you get turbulence at all different scales.","551":"Yeah and I think it's really cool that this kind of fractal description of geometry or physics is also kind of baked into the nature of computation. Computation is recursive kind of biased nature. And so it's kind of a match made in heaven that we happen to build these machines that also-","552":"I think that's also, what's so beautiful about fractals is that, you know, if you think about sort of the history of geometry as well, Felix Klein was looking at geometry by saying, well, geometry is all about in variance. I have some group of transformations and I look at objects that are sort of in variant with respect to these transformations. So if you just look at translations, okay, what kinds of shapes remain the same under translations? Will you get tiling? You get wallpaper. And if you start asking that same question, what if I allow scaling in my transformations then boom, you have fractal.","553":"Now you work on kind of the future of virtual reality and augmented reality and extended reality. But it's kind of interesting because I think if I think about exploring these infinite fractal landscapes in some way, they still feel a little bit lonely or they feel a little bit poor of the kind of richness that we have in the real world.","554":"People outside of computer graphics and engineering and science and so forth have also thought a lot about and used fractals as a language for talking about nature, for characterizing shapes and behaviors and so forth tissue or friction, or all sorts of really important phenomena. Do you think that computer graphics has kind of dropped the ball in terms of saying, you know, this is not something that's exciting anymore to work on procedural descriptions and we're, we're moving on from that?","555":"So one of the things I guess that touches on is this question about controllability or the ease of, with which everybody can create these worlds. Not just people, not just mathematicians, not just, you know, trained computer scientists. One thing when I think about Ken Musgraves working about this program, Bryce, this one I felt like I could really use, what do you think we still need to do in terms of putting these kinds of tools in, in people's hands, making it easier for people to use procedural machine learning, to build these kind of worlds?","556":"Yeah. And I think this is what what's so beautiful also about Mandelbrot's work is him saying, you know, it's not really about these exotic examples. Like even the Mandelbrot set or Julia sets or whatever. Yeah they're like really interesting mathematical curiosities, but they get at this idea that fractals are kind of inevitable. And Bob Ross probably never, as far as I know, never sat down and you know, thought about recursive descriptions of trees or anything like that. But it's just something that naturally comes to you as an artist.","557":"And on one hand memory is like a record of something that happened in the past that we can carry with us and we can like bring it back to mind. And on the other hand we need to be a little bit suspicious sometimes because we might get it wrong. In what world would that memory of the orange juice maybe be useful?","558":"Sometimes, you know, memory is doing something much simpler but no less important for us, which is it's helping us figure out what's good and what's bad. And if we can remember what's good and what's bad from what we did in the past, that can help us make decisions about what to do next time. So Dylan, you may be surprised to learn this, but we asked your mom what some of your favorite candies are. So you have to make a decision between these two candies and whichever one you pick, you actually get to take with you.","559":"There you go, there is your decision. Okay, you can take those. It took you some time there. You looked like you were really working hard at that problem. And that's interesting because actually we know that from research that when people have to make a decision between two things they like equally, some people like economists think oh those are the easiest decisions because they're both good options. But as psychologists and neuroscientists we know it's the opposite. One of the reasons is because there's no simple answer of like I know that one's better I'm just gonna go with it. And so we think that that's the kind of decision where memory is especially important because you have to kind of come up with more information.","560":"I love math for the same reason. Today, I'm gonna tell you about a thing called zero-knowledge proof. So in a zero-knowledge proof, there are two people. There's a prover and a verifier. And I wanna prove that something is true to you. But the weird thing is, I wanna prove to you that it's true without telling you any reasons why. I remember when I first heard about it, I was like, wait, what? How can that possibly be? Right?","561":"But what if I could prove to you that I know where the puffin is without revealing to you where it is? Let me show you. I took that photo that we showed you. And I put it behind this poster here. Why don't you go take a look through that hole?","562":"So when you look at this board, we don't know where the photo was, right? Was the photo like with the corner here? In which case the puffin would be all the way at this side. Or was the photo with the corner here? In which case the puffin would be on the other side. So this is a really simple example of a zero-knowledge proof. I convinced you that I knew where the puffin was, but you didn't learn anything else.","563":"When I first learned about them, I just thought they were so cool. But it turns out they're also really useful, not just for finding like, puffins. If you just type in your password and the hacker hacks into the computer, they can just get your password. Right?","564":"What if instead, we could somehow use a zero-knowledge proof to log in. You would just be able to prove that, hey, I'm Chelsea, without revealing anything to them. If you could do that, then it would be amazing, right?","565":"Because then even if the hacker hacked into the computer, he wouldn't learn anything. Because even the computer doesn't learn anything. So Chelsea, in your own words, what is a zero-knowledge proof?","566":"It describes something in AI, which is that things that are really intuitive and easy for humans, are actually really difficult to build into AI systems. And on the flip side, picking up an object, really simple for people, but it's actually really difficult to build that into robotic systems. So do you have any experience working with robots or other AI systems?","567":"Yeah, exactly. One thing that my research has been looking into is, if we can have robots learn from data, we'll collect data from the robot sensors. And if the robot has sensors in its arm, to figure out the angle of one of its wrist, for example, then we'll record that angle. And all of the robots experience will go into a data set, that if we wanted a robot to solve a task, like, I don't know, picking up a cup, and then maybe you want to pick up a different cup, if it only had the data of picking up the first cup, do you think it would be able to perform well on the second cup?","568":"I would tend to agree that I think, in some sense, anything that uses superposition could be a quantum sensor, but then spectroscopy uses superpositions and has been around for 60, 70 years. I think what excites me most now is the idea that can we push the boundaries of how sensitive one can make this technique? How improving sensitivity, specificity, what other limits and we define it better, are there fundamental physical limits?","569":"So do you think you can integrate multiple NV centers or multiple optical sensors? So are there ways in which you can overcome this question of there's a spot size and that limits how many NVs I can pack into a certain region?","570":"Right. People bring in very different perspectives into what used to be a very niche field. I remember in physics, you'd only talk to people in your subfield and now we're picking up the phone and talking to people in the different departments, completely different areas and we're forced to learn different languages.","571":"Yeah, that's absolutely right. So infinity gets used a lot of different ways in mathematics. There's a way that mathematicians think of infinity as a number, just like the number 13, just like the number 10 million. So the reason that mathematicians consider infinity to be a number is that it is a size of a set. So the first example of an infinite set in mathematics is the set of all counting numbers. So one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, et cetera. That list goes on forever. That is an infinite set. And to be a little bit more precise, it's a countably infinite set. But as a number, infinity is pretty strange.","572":"Room number one. Exactly. I'm gonna use this symbol for infinity, but what we've just shown is that one, the one new guest plus infinity is equal to the same infinity. What happens if we had a second guest?","573":"Absolutely. So now I'm gonna make this story a little more complex. That there's another Hilbert's Hotel down the street and they're having plumbing issues and we need to find room for them.","574":"They can't live together. That would be a great solution. I don't know. I think these people don't really get along. So I need to somehow create infinitely many new rooms, but I can only ask each person in the hotel to move a finite distance away. So let's take the guest who is originally in room one and move them into room two. So that's creating one new space for us. And I'm gonna take the guest who was originally in room two and move them into room four. Are you starting to see a pattern here?","575":"Yeah, I'm increasing by one more each time. So I'm doubling the room number in fact. So this is some of the strange arithmetic of infinity. So we have two Hilbert Hotels, each of which have infinitely many guests, then this is equal to?","576":"Infinity, great. Hilbert's Hotel is a story that mathematicians have been telling themselves for almost 100 years because it's a really visceral way to think about some of the counterintuitive properties of the arithmetic of infinity.","577":"So when I'm teaching calculus and talking about concepts like limits and derivatives, those are only defined precisely with infinity. Teaching algebra, which is meant in a different sense about number systems, we deal with infinite families of numbers in their operations. Infinite sets are somehow very exotic. They're not found so commonly in their real world, but they're all over mathematics.","578":"The internet is, physically, these computers that all talk to each other. Billions of computers, in the case of the internet. The internet allows us to do a lot of really, really interesting, what we call applications. You ever think about how that video gets to you over the internet?","579":"Matilda. All right. We're gonna actually build an internet. I've got a couple of things here that I wanna show you, or a couple of toys, actually. Okay, let's pretend that these round balls are computers. And the internet is something that connects them. And right now, the internet is just one communication link. And Matilda is sent over the internet from this computer to your computer. So the internet is a network for carrying information from one computer to another. Now this network here looks pretty simple, doesn't it? Right? It's just one thing. Should we add some more friends in?","580":"That's right. So that's pretty cool. There are actually lots of different ways to actually go through the internet to get from what we call a source, the place that's sending the information, to the receiver, the place that's actually gathering the information together. And that's something we actually call routing.","581":"Yeah. So that's a really good observation. In most pieces of the internet, that's exactly what would happen. We want to take what's called a shortest path. But still, there are multiple paths. And why do you think that might be valuable?","582":"Exactly. So, Skylar, that was a great discussion about what we just built. And I wanted to talk to you about, or ask you about maybe one other really important part about networks. And it's not so much the thing itself, the physical thing, but more about the rules about communication. That's governed by something that are called protocols. Are you up for one?","583":"Lettuce go on. [Skylar and Jim laughing] A knock, knock joke is an example of a protocol, right? The computer that you are using say, makes a request, you ask for something, you get something in return. In the internet, there are protocols everywhere. So that two computers that have never talked to each other before know the rules for talking to each other. This global internet with billions of people using it are just lots of smaller networks that are all hooked together to each other. But also, what the internet allows are all of these what we call applications, Zoom, video playing services, can all run on top of the same internet.","584":"We're in level five now. So you're the expert-expert. I'm a huge fan of the work that you did in RCP, the Routing Control Platform being a precursor to software-defined networking and the notion that rather than having protocols actually always compute things, that we could compute things in data centers. I'd be interested if you could sort of just reflect back on that time and sort of the beginnings of SDN and where it's come since then.","585":"Right, so some people have called that the flattening of the internet, right? I think it used to be on average, you would go through 10 different networks to get from a source to a destination.","586":"And certainly, we've heard about some countries that impose firewalls that don't let certain kinds of traffic out, or certain kinds of traffic in. So there's no global body that is regulating that?","587":"I mean, even you could just tell that two people are communicating even though the traffic itself is encrypted. So you don't know what they're saying, just even knowing two devices are communicating.","588":"You're one of the most awesome networking researchers that I know. I'm curious, just to pick your brain, what do you think are some of the hot topics in networking research? Where do you think the field is heading?","589":"You know, we've had cellular networks now for 20, 30 years. So when we hear about 5G, what's trumpeted the most is the fact that oh, super high bandwidth, right? But I sense that the exciting things are more than just the network being faster.","590":"Coming back again to the softwarization. SDN and softwarization is a maybe a little bit behind the covers, that you wouldn't normally see it as a user going from 3G to 4G to 5G. You just see an increase in speed. But yet, the way the network is now being managed again, I think is bringing the cellular networking world sort of into the internet world in terms of the softwarization-","591":"So a lot of times stars are born together in two star systems and when they die, if they're heavy enough, they will collapse under their own weight and form a black hole. So here you have a black hole and a big fluffy star. And what will happen is it'll start to tear apart its neighboring star. Literally parts of the star will begin to spill onto the black hole and splatter on the black hole. But let's say both those stars formed black holes. And what these black holes do is they are like mallets on a drum. They create literally waves in the shape of spacetime as they're moving. So imagine mallets on a drum, how the drum ripples. Depending on how the mallets are moving you hear different sounds. So effectively these black holes, as they get very close together in the final stages of their life together, they're orbiting each other at hundreds of times a second. It's this really crazy event, but it's happening in complete darkness. Eventually they bobble together and they merge and then they wring out, the spacetime's going crazy around them, it's this storm in spacetime, and they settle down to a quiet black hole. Then those waves that they created travel through the universe, basically undisturbed. For a long time people thought, well, even if black holes are out there, they're impossible to observe. And then they got very clever. You might wonder how we could possibly hear black holes, that sounds crazy. So I'm gonna show you, but I'm gonna need your help. This demo involves an electric guitar. Do you play at all?","592":"Okay, you wanna do the demo for me? So the LIGO instrument electronically records the ringing of the shape of space with its very complicated instrument. It stands for Laser Interferometric Gravitational-Waves Observatory and the design was incredibly difficult and they didn't know if they would succeed. I think of the instrument as like the body of the electric guitar. And then they take the readout of the motions of the waves that they're recording, just like that guitar is recording the motions of the waves on the string. Now just play it like a little bit. And you can't hear anything, right? You're not meant to hear an electric guitar when it's not plugged in. What's happening is the guitar strings are ringing, but so quietly that we can't actually hear the sound. And this is like the gravitational waves, which are ringing the drum of spacetime, but so quietly that they're not move the air and we're not hearing them. So now play and I'm gonna turn the volume up a little bit. While I can't actually hear the ringing of the strings themselves, I can hear the data of the shape of the string recorded and played through this amplifier. And that's kind of the idea behind the LIGO instrument.","593":"That's the computer science brain thinking right there. So we wanna think of a function as procedure or mapping between sets. So a function defines a one-to-one correspondence if it defines a perfect matching between the elements of its domain set and the elements of its output set. We call such functions bijections or isomorphisms. So the reason I'm so interested in this idea of a bijective function or a one-to-one correspondence that guarantees that every element of one set gets matched with an element of the other set, no matter how many elements there are, these bijections or these one-to-one correspondences as they help mathematicians reason about infinity.","594":"Maybe two. Why not? Because now we're starting to make progress on matching all the negatives. We can match the natural number three with the integer two, the natural number four with the integer minus two. And do you see a pattern?","595":"Great. So now I have a much harder question. So we have the same challenge, again, evidently there are way, way, way more rational numbers than there are integers. Does that mean this is a larger infinite set than the integers? What do you think?","596":"So I'm going to use this picture to count the rational numbers by actually counting the elements of this larger set because it'll be clearer geometrically. What I've drawn in this picture is the integer lattice. So Z cross Z refers to the set of all of these dots. So I'll start by counting the number at the origin, and you can see I'm just labeling the dots around the origin, moving in a counterclockwise fashion and getting progressively further away. And this process could continue, but maybe by now you see the pattern, though it'd be a little bit difficult to describe as a function.","597":"Yeah, that's exactly right. And now for each pair of integers, I'm gonna represent it by a corresponding natural number. That's what's going on with this counting. And when I compose those operations, what I've done is I've encoded rational numbers as natural numbers in a way that reveals that they can be no larger, there are no more rational numbers than natural numbers.","598":"Exactly. That's exactly right. So we were hoping to compare the size of infinity of the rational numbers with the size of infinity of the natural numbers. What we've done is introduced an intermediate set, these pair of integer points, and this proves that this size of infinity is smaller than this size of infinity. Since we also have an injective function the other way, this size of infinity is smaller than this size of infinity so therefore they must be the same size.","599":"Now there's one final collection of numbers that we haven't yet discussed, which are the real numbers, all of the points on the number line. Do you think that's the same size infinity?","600":"Georg Cantor proved that it is impossible to count all real numbers like we've just counted the rational numbers or just counted the integers. This is called the cardinality of the continuum, it is uncountable. What I'm going to do now is form a new real number that I guarantee is not on this list. Okay, so here's how we do this. What I'm gonna do is I'm gonna look at the diagonal elements. So I'll highlight them. This continues forever, and now I'm going to form a new real number by changing all of these.","601":"Great. That's exactly right. So what we've proven is that this number is missing, and therefore it is impossible to define a bijection between the natural numbers and the real numbers.","602":"So we've started to explore some of the counterintuitive properties of infinity. On the one hand there are infinite sets that feel very different like the natural numbers, the integers, the rational numbers that nevertheless have the same size or the same infinite cardinality. While there are other infinities that are larger. So there's more than one size of infinity, not all infinities are created equal.","603":"and actually machine learning is one research direction where we're really hoping that we're going to find um key parts of the machine learning computation that can be sped up using quantum computing","604":"if you think about even just classical information like bits right at the end of the day when you store a bit in your hard drive there's a magnetic domain and you have a magnetic polarization right","605":"you can change the magnetization to be pointing up or pointing down right quantum systems we're still manipulating a device and changing the quantum state of that of that device you can imagine if it's a spin that you could have spin up and spin down but you can also if you isolate it enough you can have a superposition of up and down","606":"so what we do when we try to solve problems with a quantum computer is we encode parts of the problem we're trying to solve into a complex quantum state and then we manipulate that state to drive it towards what will eventually represent the solution","607":"so you need a chip with qubits each qubit is a carrier of quantum information and the way we control the state of that qubit is using microwave pulses you send them all the way down these cables and we've calibrated these microwave pulses so that we know exactly this kind of pulse what this frequency and this duration will put the cupid into superposition or we'll flip the state of the qubit from zero to one or if we apply a microwave pulse between two qubits we can entangle them","608":"there's sort of two main classes of quantum algorithms there's algorithms which were developed for decades right things like shore's algorithm which is for factoring grover's algorithm for unstructured search and these algorithms were designed assuming that you had a perfect fault tolerant quantum computer which is many decades away so we're currently in a phase where we're exploring what can we do with these near-term quantum computers and the answer is going to be well we need different kinds of algorithms to really even explore that question","609":"yeah they also unfortunately require fault tolerance right now the algorithms that we know of today to do those things um on a quantum computer require you to have millions of error-corrected qubits today we're at like 50. it's actually amazing that we're at 50. there's things that we know or we have strong reason to believe um are going to be faster to do on a quantum computer and then there's things that we'll discover just by virtue of having one","610":"i'm glad you're interested i think the place where lots of people can get involved right now is by going and trying it out and thinking about what they could do with it there's a lot of opportunity to find these near-term applications that are only going to be found by trying things out"},"dialogue":{"0":"Explainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Only until I started listening to singing, like barbershop quartet, and, and as I was a violinist as well--\nExplainer: Right.\n","1":"Explainer: Right.\nExplainee: Then I finally understood the idea where the overtone series came from that if a bunch of singers were to nail a chord or have it perfectly tuned, the overtones, you would hear a tone that necessarily wasn't being produced by one the singers.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Yeah.\nExplainer: I think that people forget that you can work with the notes you already have by just rearranging them, just the simple idea of inversion, inversion of the simple triad, of F major. \u266aI once was lost and now I'm found \u266a \u266a Was blind \u266a \u266a But now I see \u266a Now how home do I want to go here, you know?

You have the ups on the fifth and the fourth and then the, (hums) That seemed a little bit sharp, but that's fine. And then tones get increasingly small. Beneath that note, you have the undertone series, which essentially is like a reflection of something. In the same way that when a tree grows in nature, you have the branches which grow upwards and the roots which go downwards. So it's quite a nice thing to thing about, this being the key center, the floor, the ground, and then these two different directions of ways in which it can express itself, and the differences in the sensations with that. Lots of the time I think when it comes to reharmonization or harmonization, people think that the solution to the problems come when we add more notes.\nExplainee: Yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Right.\nExplainer: Because I can delay the gratification of going home. First of all, just by using inversions, even before we add the notes to the chord.

Obviously, with material odds, it's gonna be one part of the training, and other part of the training that I find interesting is like, you know, to find positions from, let's say, real life tournaments. And I've been doing that actually from this recent tournament that's going on in Isle of Man, playing out some of those fascinating positions and just seeing what the computer does, and he's like coming up with resources that you would never think of, you know?\nExplainer: Today, we've been talking a lot about how chess is kind of a mix of tactics versus strategy.

So what is chess to you?\nExplainee: Well, the way my coach explained chess to me that really seems intuitive is that chess is a game of time, space, and harmony. You have one turn to get things done, right? Obviously you try to make it as efficient as possible. We have the saying in chess that, you know, you lost by one tempo, by one move. Space. You know, we have a game of 64 squares, right? So control over these 64 squares is what the game is about. You can get control in moving up your pawns. You can get control by winning opponent's material, right? So obviously, that's another big element that we're fighting over, and harmony is basically like you got this army of pieces, right? Your job is to make them work well with each other, coordinate them, and build that beautiful picture of harmony that, you know, all chess players aim for and are so pleased when they can finally achieve.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Harmony trumps everything. Like you could be winning when it's not your turn, and you're like totally behind on material. So it shows you that harmony is the end goal. Chess is a miniature life.\nExplainer: I always like to say that chess exposes all of your flaws on the board.\n","10":"Explainer: in your training habits, in the way you approach certain positions. So you say you can see yourself on the chess board. Who is Irina on the chess board?\nExplainee: Yeah, well, I think Irina is a fighter. You know, Irina is not someone who likes to give up. Irina is someone who wants to leave everything on the board, right? Like every last drop. That's the idea. How do you see yourself as a player?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: So, you know, we have opposite styles, Levy. I think our blitz game is gonna be a lot of fun. All right.

Probably.\nExplainee: E5 looks a little dangerous, but I guess we can analyze that later. All right, so what are you threatening? At the moment, not much, yeah? If I take an E5, it gets very boring.

It can take some people longer. I actually did it very late in my life. I don't know, Levy, if you know this, but I made grandmaster when I was 29. Most people, if they don't do it by the time they're like 20, they'll probably never do it. In terms of becoming a grandmaster, really, that's the time and the commitment. I think if you're an international master like you are, like everything is within reach. Like you've already played chess long enough in your life. You're close enough to that level that, really, it's gonna be little things like putting in the time, going to the best tournaments, and getting the best competition, and just maybe getting a good coach to help you as well. So it's not too late, Levy.\nExplainer: Okay.\n","15":"Explainer: Nine times. So there's a relationship between motion through space, the earth is going through space, and the passage of time.

But once the X-rays, once the photons hit the corona, and are re-scattered, and up, energized, and then they start illuminating the accretion disk, it heats it up, and so just by the light travel time, when the optical, if it gets, you know, brighter and fainter, and then the infrared gets brighter and fainter, two weeks later, then the dust is two light weeks away from that. So it's a one dimensional one, so we're averaging, so we don't get the two dimensional, or even three dimensional one. And then we've done it now, of course, we have better telescopes, there was a project where you could do it with the Hubble Space Telescope and the ultraviolet, you used the Swift Observatory, which had optical and ultraviolet, and then from ground base, we did optical, and then from space we did it with Spitzer and the infrared. So you could actually see this bright flash go off in a nearby AGN called NGC5548, and then you see it propagate as it warms up the disk, as all that light is falling onto it, and then eventually you hit the, the, further away, where the dust is, and the dust tends to radiate in an infrared. So we got basically a structure, and you just, you see this flashbulb go off, and then it illuminates, effectively, the structure.\n","23":"Explainer: Yeah, again, we don't know exactly where X, Y, Z, zero is, we're assuming that it's something, you know, the X-rays that are coming out are very close to the event horizon of the black hole, but this is still, you know, your realm of X-rays, to really figure out those kinds of things.

But they're also in black holes, when it's this really interesting sort of both, it's great, but ugh, it's also a source of noise for those of us who are trying to do X-ray observations of nearby galaxies.\nExplainee: We have the same problem, we can't see the actual black hole underneath all these very bright X-ray binaries.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: The X-ray binaries, yeah, so they're, no, they're typically like 10 solar masses, so from three, you know, that's the smallest one you can have is from three solar masses, and then all the way up. So that's where we have LIGO, and LIGO has now directly, I mean, this was all theory before, that we knew that this was gonna happen, and never seen it before, so LIGO is now the first time that we have been able to completely verify this theory, that you can have black holes and neutron stars merging together. And so what happens in the case of two neutron stars, when they merge together, now suddenly they become heavier, they become heavy enough to turn into a black hole. And so the first of these events happened in August, and what happened here is you had these two neutron stars that spun around each other, and then they merged, and then for a very short time, we are talking about 100 milliseconds, or tens of 100 milliseconds, it actually remained a neutron star, probably, it was a hyper massive neutron star because it was spinning so fast, it didn't collapse under its own weight. But then, you know, the angular momentum gets dissipated away from the object, and then, at that point, it can't maintain its own weight, and then it collapses, and turn into a black hole. All this theory that we knew about is now finally being, being validated.\nExplainer: Which is great, although it still doesn't help us in the AGN community, because we don't know how the millions to billions solar mass black holes came to be. But it's, at least we're building up, or hopefully that at some point, and by understanding these lower mass, how these lower mass black holes came to be, then we can see where there are a large scale number of mergers can potentially give us this, or you really need something, other, another corridor to fundamentally get us something that's a million solar masses, you know, on the minimum side, but definitely, you know, we've gotten those which are billion. So we know we can merge the million solar mass black holes to get the bigger ones, but how do you get to those in the beginning, particularly so early in the universe, when you get quasars at really high red shifts, so they're really early on.\n","25":"Explainer: And this goes to the idea that you don't have a core balance, that a supernova with a black hole as its final result, actually never has any kind of expulsion, that it all just goes.

It's not just three dimensions of space and one dimension of time.\n","27":"Explainer: Now, in some sense that's kind of trivial to you and me, because of course you have space, which is three dimensional, you have time which is one dimensional, so spacetime is four dimensional. But it didn't turn out, it didn't occur to anyone that that was a sensible way to talk until really relativity. This is the crucial thing, right? Is that what Einstein realized is that sure there's both time and space, but how we divide spacetime into time and space can be different for different people, and really there's a real sense in which four dimensional spacetime is kind of a generalization of three dimensional space. And I think to really explain this we're gonna need a blackboard.\nExplainee: Okay.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Why though?\nExplainer: Why? This is a very good question. So, let's just start with space, right? We know a little bit about space. So here's my simple minded way of drawing space two dimensions, because that's how many I can draw on the blackboard. Let's say X and Y. And what is special about space, there's many things, but one is that if I have a curve or a path between two points, there's a distance that you can calculate, right? And the distance between those two points doesn't depend on your coordinates. It doesn't depend on whether you're in radial coordinates or Cartesian coordinates, or whatever. I'm allowed to imagine a curve that does something like this between those two points, and if I were a person walking on that curve, I would have an odometer with me maybe, and I would know, you would know, even without having done that, this path is always gonna be longer than that path. There's a formula, Pythagoras' Theorem that tells you what the shortest distance path is. That's the point. The physical-ness of what is real is the distance along a certain curve.

Like they think that they're not accelerating, but if they start walking through the train cars, then they are accelerating in their frame, but then from my outside frame where I'm completely removed, I see they are accelerating.

What's the smallest object you can think of?\nExplainee: A baby ant?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Tiny, tiny, tiny, tiny.\nExplainer: If I took this stick and I was to draw 1 billion lines, the distance between those two lines would be one nanometer. So that's really all it is. It's just a measure of size. But it's really, really, really tiny, smaller than anything that we can see with our eyes. The reason why, in nanotechnology, scientists, we care about things that are that small, is because there are objects called atoms. Have you ever heard of atoms before?\n","37":"Explainer: A baby ant? Very good. So I have over here a meter stick, let me show it to you. And so that's a meter and if I divide it by 1000, I get a millimeter. So milli just means 1000. There's all these little lines on the ruler. And each of those little lines is one millimeter. So a baby ant is probably a couple of millimeters. So even the thing, that's the smallest thing you can think of, it's a million times bigger than a nanometer. Tiny, tiny, tiny.\nExplainee: Tiny, tiny, tiny, tiny.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Yes. I first heard of them on a show I watched called StoryBots. They're just little things that make up everything on Earth, even earth.\nExplainer: That was a perfect explanation. But what if I told you that scientists invented a special type of microscope that not only lets you see atoms, but also lets you move them around and build things with them. Would you think that would be pretty cool?\n","38":"Explainer: If I took this stick and I was to draw 1 billion lines, the distance between those two lines would be one nanometer.

[laughing] My daughter would probably answer the exact same way. A unicorn would be awesome.\n","40":"Explainer: Same with, who are the actors? It's not just people anymore. It's machines.\nExplainee: [Valentinas] Absolutely.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: So at least when we talk about Bitcoin, there are some trust issues and some hacks. So there's obviously a need to work on trust and feeling that it's a safe technology.\nExplainer: Yeah. One of the problems that Bitcoin has faced is Bitcoins getting stolen or lost. But a lot of that actually comes from people trying to recentralize Bitcoin in different ways making themselves actually a pretty easy target.\n","41":"Explainer: We're gonna have to create entire new concepts of how they do trade and how they work with us, too. What kind of barriers or road blocks would you imagine are gonna happen in the blockchain space?\nExplainee: So at least when we talk about Bitcoin, there are some trust issues and some hacks.

Right?\nExplainer: Yeah. To actually transition into the mainstream and make it useful for average people to use, we're going to need to make sure we have a lot more education, a lot more standards and probably work with a lot of enterprises to create sort of a user experience around this being a technology that is safe and usable and understandable. What is the current state of blockchain in your understanding? What's gonna have to happen next?\n","42":"Explainer: Yeah.

Right?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: The current state is in the research state, and it's being developed to be applied in many, many areas. It must be used almost everywhere to where we won't even imagine how we lived without it. But I'm not sure where it's going to go. I mean, no one really knows, right.\nExplainer: Well, we have a lot of public blockchains. Like we have Bitcoin. We have the Ethereum network and XT, but a lot of companies and consortiums are getting together to build private blockchains, so ones that are more closed off at first and then may evolve into a public network where people feel comfortable using it. And some are also proof of concept out in the real world, projects in energy and in pharmaceuticals and in retail and lots of different fields are starting experiments. And we'll see in the next few years how all of those interact and what we learn about the best use cases for blockchain and what it means for trade.\n","43":"Explainer: Telescopes, solar arrays, they need to be packed into a rocket, go up, but then expand in a very controlled, deterministic way when they get up into space.\nExplainee: Okay.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: [Grad Student] Okay.\nExplainer: So this is what's called a single degree of freedom mechanism. You have one degree of freedom, I can choose this fold, and then if these are perfectly rigid every other fold angle is fully determined. One of the key behaviors here is that with the smaller angles up here, the two folds that are the same parity and the folds that are of opposite parity move at about the same rate but with this, as we're getting closer to 90 degrees, we find they move at very different rates and then at the end of the motion, the opposite happens. This one is almost folded but this one goes through a much larger motion so the relative speeds differ.\n","44":"Explainer: These are the building blocks of many, many origami deployable shapes, it's called a degree-4 vertex. It's the number of lines. So in this case, we use solid lines for mountain, we use dash lines for valley. We're going to fold it and use these two to illustrate some important properties of origami mechanisms. It's important in the study of mechanisms to take into account the rigidity. So what we're going to do to help simulate rigidity is to take these rectangles and we're going to fold them over and over so that they just become stiff and rigid.\nExplainee: [Grad Student] Okay.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Right.\nExplainer: So when we start sticking together vertices like this, if they're individually single degree of freedom then we can make very large mechanisms that open and close but with just one degree of freedom. So, these are examples of a pattern called the Miura-Ori. When you stretch them out they're pretty big.\n","45":"Explainer: So this is what's called a single degree of freedom mechanism.

What sort of angle would you want so that they open up the same rate?\nExplainer: Infinitesimally small.\n","47":"Explainer: So, sadly, the only way to get them at exactly the same rate is when these are microscopic slivers and then that's not useful.\nExplainee: For sure, right, right.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: So, it's kind of a trade-off?\nExplainer: There's an engineering trade-off to get them both to work. And there's another place that shows up in deployable structures in a very cool structure. This is a folded tube, it sort of pops out like this but it has this neat property that if you twist it quickly, it changes color. There's a Mars Rover application where they need a sleeve that protects a drill and as the drill goes down, the sleeve is going to collapse and they're using a pattern very much like this.\n","48":"Explainer: And it's exactly the difference between the motions of these two vertices. So these angles are closer to right angles and the closer you get to a right angle the more asymmetry there is between the two directions of motion. And then the other difference is how efficiently they pack, so these started at about the same size but when they're flat notice that yours is much more compact. So if I were you making a solar array, I'd say, oh, I want that one. But if I say, well, I want them to open at the same rate, then I want this one.\nExplainee: So, it's kind of a trade-off?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Interesting.\nExplainer: There are many open mathematical questions and so room for mathematicians, like yourself, to have a big impact on the world of origami and mechanisms. And even though those studies are mathematically interesting, they're going to also have real-world applications in space, solar arrays, drills, telescopes, and more. Any questions or thoughts about this?\n","49":"Explainer: There's an engineering trade-off to get them both to work.

Do you sleep?\nExplainee: I do, I try. [laughs]\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Resting, relaxing, really shutting down your brain, taking some time off of a busy schedule and work day.\nExplainer: But being off is not just being off. There's lots of things that are happening. We're gonna kind of talk about those different pieces of sleep.\n","51":"Explainer: But being off is not just being off. There's lots of things that are happening. We're gonna kind of talk about those different pieces of sleep.\nExplainee: Okay.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Okay. Are you like able to tell how much sleep someone's getting or what their sleep schedule is by REM?\nExplainer: When we measure all of that, we're able to see how much time someone's asleep, and how many times they wake up and stuff during the night. You know, we're also really interested in kind of, the amount of non-REM sleep someone gets and the amount of REM sleep that someone gets, because each part of those types of sleep do different things for the body. And so it's important to get both of those. And so within non-REM sleep, there are three stages ranging from N-1 to N-2 to N-3. So not particularly clever in our naming, but that's how we know what stages they are. And what they do is it moves from lightest to deepest sleep, okay? N-1, it's more kind of light, wakefulness sleep, kind of in and out of sleeping. Then you go into N-2, which is where we spend 45 to 55 percent of our sleep. And it's more this kind of light sleep, but then we get into kind of the really restorative sleep, and that's N-3. And in N-3, when we look at someone's EEG wave, we see these big slow waves, and it's called slow wave sleep. And so we spend about 20% of our sleep in slow wave sleep, though it can vary on a day to day.\n","52":"Explainer: So our sleep is made up of different types, okay? The first one is called non-rapid eye movement sleep, or non-REM, okay? Or NREM. And then the other one, which might not be a surprise, is called REM. Rapid eye movement sleep. And those are the two main types of sleep that happen. The way that we measure that as a sleep scientist is that we'll actually bring people into the lab where they can do this at home, where we put electrodes on their scalp while they're sleeping, and that allows us to measure the brain activity that's going on during the night.\nExplainee: Okay. Are you like able to tell how much sleep someone's getting or what their sleep schedule is by REM?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Oh wow.\nExplainer: Okay? When do you think you experience the most REM?\n","53":"Explainer: Okay? When do you think you experience the most REM?\nExplainee: Well I've heard that you don't really go into like a deeper sleep, so I'm guessing like N-3, or really any of the N's at all, really, if you are on technology right before you sleep. And also if there's too much light, or if you're listening to music while you're asleep or anything like that, you're not experiencing deep sleep, right?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Oh.\nExplainer: Okay? So we wake up a lot during the night, and we just don't remember it. And you'll go back down into deep sleep, and then up again into REM, you know, in kinda these cycles.\n","54":"Explainer: You know, some of that is totally accurate, that like when your brain's more engaged by being on your phone or doing things that you really enjoy or things that stress you out or any of those types of things, it's harder to get to sleep and to kind of fall into that deeper levels of sleep. Most of the REM sleep, this dreaming sleep, happens in the second half of the night.\nExplainee: Oh.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Oh wow.\nExplainer: Do you ever take naps?\n","55":"Explainer: One to six hours? That's a long nap.\nExplainee: It is a long nap.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: So N-1 being like light sleep, still a lot of brain activity going on. I can imagine that happens right after you fall asleep. Asleep. And then N-2 being light, moderate activity in your brain, still sleep, but still kind of consciously aware, and N-3 being the deepest form of sleep.\nExplainer: I want to know if you agree, sleep is the coolest thing you've ever heard of.\n","56":"Explainee: What is fusion energy?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: I love the lightning show, I think it's so cool.\nExplainer: You probably have learned in school about three states of matter.\n","57":"Explainer: You probably have learned in school about three states of matter.\nExplainee: Solid, liquid and gas.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: That's so cool.\nExplainer: Yeah. So the way this is happening is this glass ball here is a container for our plasma. And we've taken most of the air out of the container, so there's not a lot of particles inside the glass ball, and very, very low temperature plasma. So it's continuously ionizing and then recombining, and becoming neutral again. And we see those energy transitions as the visible light. So if we're gonna put this plasma to use and do something helpful with it, like maybe make some clean electricity, we would have to control it. And another word for controlling it is confining it. So let me turn this off and set it back down. You're probably wondering what is this thing on this table? It's a model of a tokamak, and that's the name of a device that I work on with the goal of creating clean energy. Have you played with magnets in school?\n","58":"Explainer: Absolutely, we take the gas, and we add heat, and we get a plasma. And a plasma is a state of matter where you have an ionized gas. If we break down that gas, and we add enough energy to ionize it, where you can take the electrons and the ions and the atom and separate them, and now there's this soup of charged particles that are moving around, that's the plasma. And it is what creates the beautiful light in lightning. So you've already seen a plasma in fact. So I'm gonna show you this fun demonstration. You've probably seen one of these before, right?\nExplainee: That's so cool.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: [Nods.]\nExplainer: Okay.\n","59":"Explainer: Okay.\nExplainee: We've learned about how it has to be a positive and negative charge. And we've done those things where you can like put 'em with something in between 'em, and just move one and the other will always follow.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: [Points vertically.]\nExplainer: Yeah, exactly, perpendicular. And if I drive the current in this green wire, which direction will it go?\n","60":"Explainer: Yeah, exactly, perpendicular. And if I drive the current in this green wire, which direction will it go?\nExplainee: [Points counter-clockwise.]\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: That way.\nExplainer: Exactly, back this way, the short way around the tokamak. We can now put together the pieces and understand the three magnetic fields that we need to confine a plasma in our tokamak. So our plasma will be inside this vessel in the shape of a donut.\n","61":"Explainer: Exactly, yeah, the long way, perpendicular. Now this is a bit of a trickier one. The blue wire is gonna act like a transformer action. And so by changing the current in the blue coil, we are going to be able to run a current in this direction around the tokamak. And now think back to how the wires worked. If I have a current going like this, where's the magnetic field?\nExplainee: That way.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: What could the tokamak be used for in like real life?\nExplainer: I'm so glad you asked. So what we want to use the tokamak for in real life is to confine a super hot plasma, and we're talking a hundred million, 150 million degrees. Because the plasma is so very hot, the particles have enough energy to interact with one another and fuse. When those fusion reactions occur, we are releasing energy that's inside the nucleus, and we can harness that energy to make clean electricity.\n","62":"Explainer: Exactly, back this way, the short way around the tokamak. We can now put together the pieces and understand the three magnetic fields that we need to confine a plasma in our tokamak.

Like why has it taken us so long to get to fusion?\nExplainee: Making a star on earth is not easy.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: They repel each other and they don't like being close together, so they push back by that force.\nExplainer: Or we're gonna call the pushback a Coulomb interaction, or a Coulomb collision. So you can sort of imagine if I were to take a deuteron and a triton, and so those are the positively charged ions of deuterium and tritium, and I try and combine them together, those two positively charged particles just sort of bounce off of each other. So we have to give them enormous amounts of energy, and it has to do with getting up to very high temperatures. So we're talking about over 100 million degrees Celsius. And we typically put that into an energy unit that we use a lot in plasma physics called an electron vault. And so we describe being up at 100 million degrees that we're at sort of 15 kiloelectron volts.\n","64":"Explainer: So we are trying to bring a star to earth. We are not going to be using hydrogen the way our star in our solar system, our sun, uses hydrogen to make helium and generates fusion energy that way. Instead on earth we're gonna be using isotopes of hydrogen, deuterium and tritium. What do you know about charged particles? If I want to try and push two positively charged particles together, two protons together, what do you think is gonna happen?\nExplainee: They repel each other and they don't like being close together, so they push back by that force.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Uh huh.\nExplainer: So that's very, very hot temperature. But the other thing we need is a lot of particles. That's the density. We are able to combine a deuteron and a triton in a fusion reaction at lower temperatures, at lower energies than other fuel. And this has to do with some very nice properties of the deuteron and the triton that when we get them close enough to one another to fuse, there's actually a resonance which is predicted by quantum mechanics, and that really helps have a little bump up in the cross section for the deuterium-tritium fusion reaction.\n","65":"Explainer: Or we're gonna call the pushback a Coulomb interaction, or a Coulomb collision.

That little bump up is good for us. Because it means that we have a higher probability of getting the deuterium and the tritium to fuse than otherwise at those manageable temperatures. And when we say manageable, for fusion scientists, yeah, 50 million, a hundred million, 150 million Celsius.\n","66":"Explainer: So that's very, very hot temperature.

So it comes right out. And it's the kinetic energy of the neutron. And we want it to interact with our overall energy system. And as it interacts with that material, it heats the material up. It transfers its kinetic energy to this material. Take that thermal energy and run a turbine, run a generator, and convert it into electricity. So once you get to that stage, it starts to look a lot like any other thermal power plant. Whether it's fission or natural gas. So a fusion plant could basically be the plasma core coming in, setting it in place, and driving your thermal system to make electricity. We often call it an alpha particle. And that is a charged particle, right. So it's actually going to stay in the plasma. It's an energetic particle compared to the fuel. So it actually is going to give its kinetic energy back to the fuel via Coulomb collisions. So now they're good, now we like them.\n","68":"Explainer: We've come so far in the study of magnetically confined plasmas, which is what I work on, that we sort of tamed all the other types of major instabilities that would cause loss of the plasma. So you might be asking yourself what is the energy that's coming out of the fusion reaction? So we've got the deuteron and we've got the triton, and so they combine in a fusion reaction, and that produces a neutron and a helium nucleus. But the neutron doesn't have any charge.\nExplainee: Yeah, it comes out.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: So you get this kind of self-sustaining cycle.\nExplainer: Yes, you you said exactly the right word, self-sustaining.\n","69":"Explainer: And so, how much do you think you need?\nExplainee: I mean, I've read that six is ideal for people in my age range.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: I mean, I know sleep is kind of regulated by the thalamus and the suprachiasmatic nucleus sending signals to the pineal gland to which kind of secretes melatonin, which tells us when it's time to go to sleep.\nExplainer: Right. You can do part of this level, and you can do the other part, clearly. Got some expertise under your belt, and that's awesome, because I think that everyone should know more about sleep. And so the way that we think about what drives sleep are two independent but related processes and so they have kind of lame names. Process S and process C, and what you've kind of described is process C, and that's the master clock, right? And it helps regulate kind of the rhythms like all over your body, all your cells, and all those kind of things. It drives the release of melatonin from the pineal gland, and melatonin comes online under darkness, so when the sun goes down, your brain knows okay it's time to start getting ready for sleep, and so you start releasing melatonin, which really kind of sets the table for sleeping.\n","70":"Explainee: I'm Tom Hull, I'm a math professor, a mathematician. I've been doing origami since I was eight years old and studying the mathematics of origami ever since grad school, at least.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Why does origami lend itself to, say, this type of application?\nExplainer: Origami applications have in common, is that at some stage the thing is flat and so whenever you need to either start from a flat state and then take it to a 3D state, or conversely, for deployables like space, you want to have it in a fully folded flat state but then take it to a 3D state, or possibly an unfolded flat state. Whenever a flat state is involved, origami is a really effective way of making the transition between those states.\n","71":"Explainer: This is another real-world application but this particular implementation is used to make a wheel for a Rover.\nExplainee: Cool, so this is something that can actually get really, really tiny but then get big and fat and roll.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Yeah!\nExplainer: Another origami challenge that comes up with these patterns is if we're going to make an aircraft out of this thing we're going to need hundreds of yards of folded origami. We're not going to do it by hand and this might be the new frontier in origami engineering, which is the design of machines that can fold patterns that have applications.\n","72":"Explainer: New problems arise when we try to make origami out of things other than paper, but also new opportunities. An example here which is a kind of a variant of the Miura-Ori. It's got a three-dimensional structure. If I stretch it one way, it expands the other but because it has these S-bends in the pattern, if you squeeze it, it doesn't go all the way flat. This is a epoxy impregnated aramid fiber and so if I put this fold pattern into it and then compress it and then put a skin on the top and bottom, this becomes incredibly lightweight but incredibly strong.\nExplainee: Yeah!\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: So you're talking about a machine that is actually folding it into this, not just making the creases but actually folding it.\nExplainer: Yeah, so what goes in as sheet and what comes out is this, or something this wide.\n","73":"Explainer: Yeah, so what goes in as sheet and what comes out is this, or something this wide.\nExplainee: That's cool, yeah. What do you see as kind of like the next big breakthrough? Is there anything out there on the horizon that you're just like, oh wow, this is really exciting?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: So like a cone?\nExplainer: Bi-stable properties and you can combine them together with copies of themselves to make cellular structures. They're astonishingly stiff and rigid, useful for mechanics.\n","74":"Explainer: And it's because we've had a lot of PR, a lot of proof of concept, but truthfully, this is more like a science, right?\nExplainee: Yes.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Yes, and one of the most interesting ideas to me that came out of the currency side of the blockchain project was the notion around like coloring coins, right, assign properties to a particular coin, and in particular to assign those properties in ways that would allow you to do things like bring in the graph of previous transactions.\nExplainer: [Bettina] Right.\n","75":"Explainer: The system we have today is also broken.

I think we're in a similar place. We're going to see problems with this technology, and we are going to need to develop multiple kinds of standards that also have some flexibility. But it's going to also be a version, a system, that allows us to fix some of the things that are broken today.\n","76":"Explainer: In that it's hard to compare it to some perfect future. Just like you compare autonomous vehicles to this very high standard because machines are doing it. It should be perfect. There should be zero car deaths.\nExplainee: (laughs) Yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","77":"Explainer: [Sean] What kind of science?\nExplainee: I like biology and computer science.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: I guess, I don't know how to exactly define it, but I know, like the first four.\nExplainer: Right, you know the difference between like one dimension two dimensions, three dimensions, et cetera. So let's do a little experiment here. So there's one dimension. I'll give that to you. Now, here's your task. I'm going to give you another dimension, and I'm gonna ask hold those two things at right angles to each other. It's easy to do. Yeah, so there's no trick here.\n","78":"Explainer: All right, you're in the wrong place. [laughs] We're not gonna be talking about biology or computer science. So we wanna talk about the idea of dimensions. Do you know what dimension is? How we would define dimensions?\nExplainee: I guess, I don't know how to exactly define it, but I know, like the first four.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: [laughing] Yeah.\nExplainer: I'm not trying to fool you here. Okay. Now this is going to be slightly trickier. I'm going to give you this. I want you to hold all three of them at right angles to all the others at the same time.\n","79":"Explainer: Right, you know the difference between like one dimension two dimensions, three dimensions, et cetera.

So what that's doing is when you had just two that was describing a two dimensional plane, right? Like the two things pick out a plane, the three things pick out all three dimensional space. I'm gonna give you one more, and I'm gonna ask you to hold that fourth one so that it's at a right angle to all the other three at the same time.\n","80":"Explainer: I'm not trying to fool you here.

It can't be done. Yeah. Right? You can't do it. So we just experimentally proved that space is three dimensional. That's sort of what it means to be three dimensional, that there are three different directions you can move in and there's not four or five or six directions you can move in.\n","81":"Explainer: There you go.

Three dimensional space, right?\n","82":"Explainer: That's right. So that's exactly what these would be. Have you heard that there are other coordinate systems other than XYX?\nExplainee: No.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Yeah.\nExplainer: So that's a different way of giving you two numbers and locating yourself, and we call those polar coordinates. It's a different coordinate system. What we want to do as physicists is look for extra dimensions. Can you imagine, can you think of any way that there could be extra dimensions?\n","83":"Explainer: Well, we could also say how far we are away from the center, just the distance. And then the angle that our little line makes with let's say the X axis.\nExplainee: Yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Time?\nExplainer: Time. Yes, Einstein said that we can think of time as a fourth dimension, and that's a very fascinating thing that we could talk about all by itself. But what about space? What about the solar system? Like, if you wanted to tell me where a certain star was in the sky, do you know how we do that?\n","84":"Explainer: So that's a different way of giving you two numbers and locating yourself, and we call those polar coordinates.

You know, the optimistic view is that there are six, but the thing is, some of them might be really, really, really, really, really small, like way too small for us to ever see.\n","86":"Explainer: So you can define something as, well you know, how high above a certain location on earth it is, but the earth is rotating and revolving around the sun so we have to define separate celestial coordinates.\nExplainee: So, there's like how many dimension would there be?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Yeah.\nExplainer: And some of them might be medium sized that hopefully we can see.\n","87":"Explainer: Absolutely right. And this is sort of the state of uncertainty that physicists are stuck living in.\nExplainee: Oh. [laughs]\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Oh. [laughs]\nExplainer: [Sean] We really don't know.\n","88":"Explainer: Which is, by the way, what, when I was just starting out in graduate school, that was the hot new thing, so.\nExplainee: Exactly.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: It isn't.\nExplainer: You know, everybody's been just coming at it from different wavelengths at the optical infrared, and, but definitely the X-rays has been one of those things where it's like, oh, finally.\n","89":"Explainer: That was, it was like, oh, wow, this might be it, and then, but very early on, it was, as I just started my, it was basically my second year of graduate school, it was like, uh, this is not that simple.\nExplainee: It isn't.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: And we've come a long way by seeing a wider range of the spectrum, we can elucidate more about the circumnuclear geometry, and there's just been so much progress made with all these new spectral models that we use to fit AGN spectra, and the different types of classes of AGN, like type one and type two are believed to be just a viewing angle effect of seeing this torus at different angles.\nExplainer: It does seem to be that it may not even, in parts, it may not be even connected to this tiny, little torus at all because part of the work that I did, and others have done, is that type twos preferentially live in different kinds of galaxies than type ones, which should not in any way have to do with something such a small scale. They tend to be in smaller bulged, SB and SC type spiral galaxies. So there's something also having to do with environment that gets you to be a type two, and you can still maybe, timing wise, but there's something else that's going on on a larger scale because the type of the AGN should not really correspond to the host galaxy, but it seems to. And that was one of the things that we were finding out, and that was one of the early little ideas that the, individually, just as the torus model, the unified model, can't explain everything that we were observing at the time. But it is one of those things that it's, they're super luminous, they're all over the place, and we don't have a really good picture of it, which makes it exciting to study.\n","90":"Explainer: You know, everybody's been just coming at it from different wavelengths at the optical infrared, and, but definitely the X-rays has been one of those things where it's like, oh, finally.\nExplainee: And we've come a long way by seeing a wider range of the spectrum, we can elucidate more about the circumnuclear geometry, and there's just been so much progress made with all these new spectral models that we use to fit AGN spectra, and the different types of classes of AGN, like type one and type two are believed to be just a viewing angle effect of seeing this torus at different angles.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Yeah, and I think, you know, pushing towards the future, that, like, this whole multi-messenger era, and like, you know, utilizing all the different wavelength telescopes that we can is really the way to go. We cannot just build up a picture purely from X-rays alone, or purely from infrared, and, you know, I think there should be increased effort to try and have more coordinated observations with the different telescopes, like NuSTAR--\nExplainer: Oh, that makes sense, but it's always so difficult to get that.\n","91":"Explainer: Huh.\nExplainee: Understanding the anatomy of the brain is definitely important but, it doesn't necessarily tell us everything about the function, there's some sort of temporal order from neuron to neuron and region to region that we may not be able to pick up.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: I mean that's not the person, I mean, having a representation of someone's neural network is just that, it's just a representation of the neural network.\nExplainer: Huh.\n","92":"Explainer: Because there's more to you in here than just information passing between neurons.\nExplainee: I'd like to think so.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Every single person is different and so it should be okay to map every single person's brain. I mean I understand that there are, that it's very sensitive, you know?\nExplainer: Wait, what do you think is sensitive?\n","93":"Explainer: And less and less confident, which is an emotion which the computer doesn't feel.\nExplainee: One thing that we noticed when I was talking with a colleague of mine, his name is Ashton Anderson. He's a professor at University of Toronto. He was in my lab, and we both had this passion for chess, but we realized no one had really used AI to play like a human would play.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: We used state-of-the-art neural networks like Alpha-Zero and Leela, but we instead try to predict what move a human would make given a board position. These deep neural nets are kind of like black boxes. So we've come up with interesting ways to probe at them to get an idea of, okay, what is actually is going on that is different about this person or different about that person? We had like a style vector for each person. We can compare those, see where you defer, and try to map those back to human understandable chess concepts because that's the key, right? If I just tell you, Oh, they defer in the third number and the fifth number, you'll be like, What does that even mean, right? But if I can tell you, Oh I think this person worries more about their king's safety or sacrifices their center at the cost of protecting their king, or something like that, some kind of trade-off, then you might be able to understand what's going on there. So that's what we're trying to do now with these style vectors, and the fun thing about having numbers representing people is that you can add them together. You can mix them.\nExplainer: With something like Maia, do you think it's possible to develop some sort of accurate measure? Let's say I'm a 1,200, I have an opening course. I just wanna practice my opening. Can I do it some way against Maia or-\n","94":"Explainer: Yeah, you'd have to move your king.\nExplainee: Get to my king, and so I remember hitting all these variations that just scared me.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Is that like human empirically, though, based on the games that people are playing?\nExplainer: Yeah, like I would say-\n","95":"Explainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: It comes from just your life experience. And that moves you in a certain direction. How it gets expressed, many times, is sudden. Complete surprise. (laughs)\nExplainer: Yeah, yeah, yeah. I find it fascinating in music to think about, you know, say I arrive in a place, if I'm going, say I'm going to D flat major. And there's something you once taught me. You taught me this song Don't Follow the Crowd.\n","96":"Explainer: A lot of people will see you as somebody who's drank in harmony their whole life. They've seen so much harmony, heard so much harmony. How do you make the choices, there's so much that's possible when you know stuff. How do you have the courage to make a choice?\nExplainee: It comes from just your life experience. And that moves you in a certain direction. How it gets expressed, many times, is sudden. Complete surprise. (laughs)\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Oh, yeah.\nExplainer: And there's that chord. It's not a Dennerman chord, but it functions as a dominant chord. But it doesn't matter, because you're still going to the place you're going to.\n","97":"Explainer: That haunted me for days.\nExplainee: (Herbie laughs)\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Yeah, and this is what I learned from the great Chris Anderson.\nExplainer: Chris Anderson, yeah, yeah.\n","98":"Explainer: Right, right, right.\nExplainee: Right.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: And it makes like a pull.\nExplainer: Yeah, yeah. It's like one thing is moving in one direction and one thing has arrived, so it's this tension and it's glorious. I love thinking about these things emotionally, just because that's a feeling, I know that feeling in my life.\n","99":"Explainer: Something like that. And that's not 'cause like emotionally, it's almost like I'm here, I'm arriving here.

So it's an upgraded, better version. Sometimes that's new features, but sometimes that's bug fixes and ways to protect you as well.\n","103":"Explainer: Yeah, exactly. They're looking for ways that they can create protection. It's kind of like the lock on your front door. That lock is to essentially prevent bad people from coming in or people accidentally coming in when they shouldn't. A hacker is essentially looking at a way, how can I get into this lock? But then there are the good ones who are trying to unlock it so that they can tell the company that made the lock, hey, we can actually protect people by making the lock a little harder.\nExplainee: What would they do about the people and the broken lock?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: But like, they may get arrested because they might get mistaken.\nExplainer: That's a very good point. You should definitely make sure that you're obeying the law. They might work with the lock company and say, I'm trying to improve your product. And they're trying to find these holes or problems, and then share that with the company. Even though the good hacker is doing exactly the same thing as the bad hacker, it's the same exact skillset, and you're using the same exact techniques and information to try to break that lock, but your goal as a good hacker is really to help everyone like you and me to make sure that our stuff is protected. So hopefully they don't get in trouble because they're the good guys.\n","104":"Explainer: In many cases, they'll send them a new lock. So it's an upgraded, better version.

They may have done it for a reason, but you may have come up with a really good idea that, do you think there are other people who might like the idea that you came up with?\n","106":"Explainer: I started going on the computer and playing video games, but I had some ideas of my own, and that's where I started to learn how to hack.

And Realism was meant to capture the mundane, everyday lives of individuals and not idealize any of their activities in any way. And I think that that's really important for virtual reality. I think its kind of rite-of-passage for any kind of our technology to go through.\nExplainer: Mostly in VR we talk about the display and optics, the visual side of things, but we should at least tick off the other senses. And haptics is an interesting thing about virtual reality really doesn't have that aspect of touching things. You can move your hands around, you can do everything but its a disconnected experience because you know you don't have an actual solidity there. And I am pessimistic about progress in haptics technology. Almost all other areas I'm an optimist and I'm excited about what's coming up, but I don't have any brilliant vision about how we're going to revolutionize haptics and make it feel like we're touching the things in the virtual world.\n","109":"Explainer: And part of the challenge of it is not the mathematics of building models, but the challenge is making sure that the data is sufficiently representative, potentially high quality.\nExplainee: And how transparent do I need to build it for it to be adopted at some point? What types of biases in the data collection, and then also in the usage? We now call it the bias, but we're still struggling with the society not really living up to its expectations and then machine learning, bringing it to the forefront.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Feeling increasingly challenged that my skillset of being very good at programming has become somewhat secondary. And it's feeling... [both laugh] It's really the bigger picture understanding of Who would be using that? How transparent do I need to build it for it to be adopted at some point? What types of biases in the data collection and then also in the usage? I think, in certain areas, we have societal expectations as to what is fair and what isn't.\nExplainer: And so, it's not just the provenance of that data, but it's, sort of, deeply understanding, Why does it look the way it looks? Why was it collected this way? What are the limitations of it? We need to think about that in entire process, how we document that process. This is an issue in companies where somebody might create something that even their peers can't recreate.\n","110":"Explainer: Right. And so, to say that another way, when you're collecting data from the real world and then building machine learning systems that automate decisions based on that data, all of the biases and problems that are already in the real world then can be magnified through that machine learning system. And so, it can make many of these problems much worse.\nExplainee: Feeling increasingly challenged that my skillset of being very good at programming has become somewhat secondary. And it's feeling... [both laugh] It's really the bigger picture understanding of Who would be using that? How transparent do I need to build it for it to be adopted at some point?

Who is ready to utilize it? Where would you maybe wish that didn't even try? [Hilary laughs]\nExplainer: These are great questions. So things like actuarial science, operations research, where they actually are not using machine learning as much as you might think. And then you have other sorts of companies or on the FinTech side, or even the ad tech side of things where they perhaps are using machine learning to the point of even absurdity.\n","111":"Explainee: Hello Donna, good to see you.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: I remember very much and how hard it was to convince you to travel across the country and work at the lab.\nExplainer: And stay there.\n","112":"Explainer: You could not convince me to stay, no.\nExplainee: But you were there long enough to make a big impression and get some good work done.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Yes.\nExplainer: At Rochester. But we're still not gonna get to the Schwinger limit, isn't that right?\n","113":"Explainer: And that's, like you said, we're stuck a little bit, we're not up to that kind of acceleration, so that would be a Nobel Prize winning possible idea.\nExplainee: Absolutely.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: So actually there's a potential ways of doing it with optical or near optical radiation. And there's been a lot of work done in the defense department and so on, how do I combine laser beams together?\nExplainer: Okay.\n","114":"Explainer: And right across the beam. Don't you think that's gonna be the challenge? 'Cos it's not like our beams are as perfect as we like to think they are.\nExplainee: So that's right so you have to have the aperture size, you have to have them phase locked across the entire aperture. Which will be a great challenge and people have done it, again, with small lasers. The lasers we'll be trying to do is about a 40cm aperture. So we'll begin to start looking at this. And actually wavelength control and then be able to adaptive optics other ways which you can control the uniformity of the phase is something that's been developed in lots of ways now. For defense applications, for science applications. So we will do our best to make use of all these technologies. Lasers I think have progressed so much. Just like the semi conductor did, 'cos there's such a market for it, there were so many different applications for that.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: I remember when laser was first demonstrated 1960, what could we do with this? We already got light. Now we can't live without lasers. My cell phone, that is in my pocket, has billions of transistors. How is that made? With lasers. All of the greatest circuitry is done with lasers. Actually now it's using x-rays, made from laser heated matter. That came out of the laser fusion program.\nExplainer: So it is amazing, the parallels. And optics is used everywhere. We're gonna possibly take over from CERN, we'll just do high energy physics with lasers, we're looking at gravity waves with lasers, we wanna do black holes with lasers, we wanna machine with lasers, we wanna do medicine with lasers. It's everywhere. And now, with the Nobel prize, people are hearing more about it so they know lasers are everywhere.\n","115":"Explainer: Sounds like you've dabbled with quite a few algorithms. So, how does one actually research algorithms or invent algorithms?\nExplainee: The most important way is just trying to think about inefficiencies, and also think about connecting threads. The way I think about it is that algorithm for me is not just about the way of doing something, but it's about doing something efficiently. Learning algorithms are practically everywhere now. Google, I would say for example, is learning every day about like, Oh what articles, what links might be better than others? And re-ranking them. There are recommender systems all around us, right? Like content feeds and social media, or you know, like YouTube or Netflix. What we see is in a large part determined by this kind of learning algorithms.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Right.\nExplainer: But how does it even know what I sound like and what I look like, and how to replicate that?\n","116":"Explainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Well, one thing is quantum mechanics. Quantum mechanics is the most successful theory in the history of science, it explains the most different phenomena the most precisely. Yet many people would still say we don't understand even the basics of it.\nExplainer: So when we think about quantum mechanics, we think about particles and their quantum charges in the Feynman way, the way that Feynman taught us. They come in and they exchange a force carrier and then they come out again, so that's how we think of an electron and light scattering, for instance, or something like that. And the language that Einstein gave us is so different. It's completely geometric, it's all this space-time. And it's also unnecessary.\n","117":"Explainer: So we've been talking about gravity from Newton and celestial bodies, the Earth, the Moon, pulling on each other in the conventional sense of gravity being an attractive force, to the Earth creating curves in space-time, then we moved on to just diffused seas of energy and space-time as the real universe and gravitation is really just talking about space-time in general, and here we are, and you're really hardcore in theoretical physics. Where would you take the exposition of gravity from that point?\nExplainee: Well, one thing is quantum mechanics. Quantum mechanics is the most successful theory in the history of science, it explains the most different phenomena the most precisely. Yet many people would still say we don't understand even the basics of it.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Yeah, for me, the beauty of the theory of gravity is the way Einstein formulated it, as a theory of geometry, of curved space and time. I think, like you, that's one of the things that really pulled me into it.\nExplainer: Is there really space-time or are we just using unnecessary language because it's elegant and we like it and it's beautiful?\n","118":"Explainer: Right.\nExplainee: You know, you try to pin something down near a black hole, well, it's a surface, it's got a particular radius for a round black hole, and wanna say something is inside or outside, well, you can't absolutely say that in quantum mechanics. And this kind of uncertainty produces a radiation, which you can think of as pulling some of the energy out of the black hole. The black hole is formed out of some mass and there's an energy in that. If you think of pulling some energy out of that and sending it off to infinity in the form of particles being admitted. And what Hawking found is that it's a thermal spectrum, it looks like a hot, or not so hot for a large black hole, but like an oven, the kind of radiation that comes out of a cast iron.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: It's a crisis because of some of the details of it, but I would say the way you just described, I mean, if I build a big bonfire or an incinerator and I throw an encyclopedia into it, good luck reconstructing what was in that encyclopedia. The information is lost for all practical purpose.\nExplainer: Practical purposes.\n","119":"Explainer: Practical purposes.\nExplainee: Yes.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: One thing about quantum mechanics is that any time you have a state of the world and another state of the world, you can literally add them together and get a third possible state, as crazy as that sounds. And so if you're gonna have a quantum theory of gravity, then we can't really talk about there being a black hole or not a black hole, or an event horizon or not an event horizon, because we could always a state that had an event horizon and a state that doesn't, or has the event horizon in a slightly different position, maybe, and add them together. So the existence or position of an event horizon can't possibly be determined as a fact any more than the position of an electron is determined. So I think that's the loophole.\nExplainer: That's a nice way of looking at it. So that you're not actually violating classical relativity once you're in a regime where the wave function has really peaked around a very well-defined stage.\n","120":"Explainer: So this is a huge crisis 'cause either quantum mechanics is wrong, and as you described it, it's the most accurately-tested paradigm in the history of physics, how could it be wrong, right? Or the event horizon is letting information out and violating one of the most sacred principles of relativity.\nExplainee: One thing about quantum mechanics is that any time you have a state of the world and another state of the world, you can literally add them together and get a third possible state, as crazy as that sounds. And so if you're gonna have a quantum theory of gravity, then we can't really talk about there being a black hole or not a black hole, or an event horizon or not an event horizon, because we could always a state that had an event horizon and a state that doesn't, or has the event horizon in a slightly different position, maybe, and add them together.

So I think that's the loophole.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: That's right, and one of the most exciting developments in the last 10 or 20 years is called holography, and it's called holography because a hologram is a two-dimensional surface that creates a three-dimensional image. It's got sort of 3D information built into it. And this, in a fundamental way, really has that 3D or higher dimensional information built into it. It's exactly the same as this theory of gravity and more dimensions.\nExplainer: Yes, so one of the things I like to think of with holography is that I can pack a certain amount of information in a black hole. I mean, you can literally think of it as throwing things into it. So let's say I have information in some volume and I'm under the illusion that I can just keep packing information in that volume, as much as the volume will contain. Eventually I'll make a black hole and I'll find out that the maximum amount of information I can pack into anything in the entire universe is what I can pack on the area. And since area is projecting the illusion, maybe, of volume, maybe the whole world is just a hologram. It's not a principle that only applies to black holes. It's saying that, if this theory of quantum gravity is correct, then this while three-dimensionality is an utter illusion and really the universe is two-dimensional. That's crazy.\n","121":"Explainer: Right, exactly. And the most knowledge you could ever have would only be on a two-dimensional surface.\nExplainee: Right, and as big as the universe, and then you're done. So, you know, not likely that we're ever gonna hit that limit any time soon.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: If we buy the idea of holography, then absolutely, that's for sure, that's what it's telling us. Although which side is the illusion and which side is the reality? They're the same.\nExplainer: I mean, temperature is still great to talk about. It doesn't mean we shouldn't talk about temperature. I mean, we should absolutely adjust our thermostats and talk about temperature. But if we look at it closer and closer and closer, we realize there's not a thing in the world that has as a quantum value temperature, isolated. And so maybe there is no such thing as gravity isolated from quantum mechanics.\n","122":"Explainer: I mean, temperature is still great to talk about.

And so maybe there is no such thing as gravity isolated from quantum mechanics.\nExplainee: Right, so I guess with the holographic description we've got two sides, which are actually secretly the same. On one side there's definitely no gravity. On the other side, well, it's a quantum theory of gravity, whatever that means. But the point is you can get it out, it's equivalent to this theory.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Yeah, an example I like to give is if you take some extra dimensions and you compactify them, let's say just one, all that is, it's exactly prevalent to whatever particles you had, whatever fields you had in your original theory before you added it, you just added an infinite tower of new particles with certain properties that are all easy to calculate. For me, it's a question of which description is most useful. I mean, if you wanna say gravity is an illusion and it's all quantum, that's great, but then you fall down the stairs and bang your head.\nExplainer: [Janna laughs]\n","123":"Explainer: Oh, that's pretty cool. What do you know about computer hacking?\nExplainee: I don't really know much about computer hacking actually.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Yeah.\nExplainer: Okay. With computer hacking, it's actually the same thing. Really, you have some sort of system and you have a bunch of inputs and you have some sort of output, and actually you, as the designer, you're essentially designing games and software. You're saying, well, I will only allow a user to really control these inputs. Can you think of any inputs the computer might have?\n","124":"Explainer: So on code.org, one of the things you've been doing is actually building a game or that they have a game and then you can actually rewire some of the inputs and outputs of that. Is that right?\nExplainee: Yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: [Linda] Space bar.\nExplainer: Yep, there's also things like your mouse and there's even things like the microphone itself is actually an input device.

I'm just going to be typing keystrokes to be talking to some piece of software or hardware, but other times it can be other things like even the temperature of a computer can actually affect how the computer operates, and it might be advantageous to me to cool down the computer and actually slow down the movement of electrons in something like memory, so that if a computer shuts off, it stores something that wasn't memory like a password and stores it for a long enough time that I might be able to actually extract it through some other methods.\n","127":"Explainer: That's absolutely another input that exists on your computer.

In some cases, it could literally be seconds because you already know how the system works, and other times, it could be years. So what have you learned about hacking?\n","128":"Explainer: What are you studying right now?\nExplainee: I'm doing physics and computer science.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Yeah, and the one thing that really confuses me there, I'm thinking about one of the most basic things we learn, I guess, from Interstellar is that the universe is expanding, or space is expanding.\nExplainer: Yeah.\n","129":"Explainer: The fact that space expands is perfectly compatible with our understanding of all the forces of nature because all of them continue to operate in a somewhat more subtle way, but we have a beautiful prescription for taking any law that we understand in the simpler context of flat space time and juicing it up so that it works in a curved space time. The more philosophical question is in any of those formulations. If you replace T by -T, and you do it properly in the equations, the equations still work. But if past and future are kind of treated on equal footing in the fundamental equations, why are they so different from the perspective of experience?\nExplainee: And when you're talking about the perspective experience, is that just human subjective experience or actual observation for physics?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: When you said that, you know, it's more likely for an egg to smash or for glass to smash, and that's probably because there's so many atoms, so much stuff going on.\nExplainer: Yes.\n","130":"Explainer: Yes.\nExplainee: But I'm thinking if we zoom in on, like a single thing, I guess, do we have variations that are extremely unintuitive because, you know, things can happen in a way that isn't the statistical average?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Chicken.\nExplainer: A chicken. But then I say to you, where'd the chicken come from? And you'd say from an egg. But there's actually some real insight we can draw from this, because if we keep going back with the chicken and egg story, we'll go back through the evolutionary lineage of life, we'll go back to early moments of the sun and the galaxy, and ultimately, the universe, each step taking us to greater and greater order. So we believe that the ultimate source of order is the Big Bang itself. Highly ordered beginning called the Bang, and we have been living through the degradation of that order ever since. We still don't really have a solid explanation for why the Big Bang had to be or was, highly ordered. At the moment, it's really a deep assumption.\n","131":"Explainer: Yeah, not only did we find that time changes with speed in special relativity, but we also found that time changes with gravity. Einstein showed that the rate at which a clock ticks slows down based upon the stronger gravitational field, or gravitational potential actually, that it is experiencing. I think you mentioned the Interstellar before.\nExplainee: Yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: I've always heard people say, Oh, general relativity, you know, it might not seem applicable. But GPS, due to satellites, we could synchronize those clocks by accounting for relativity.\nExplainer: Well, but that's even a really, really good point. The GPS would become completely inaccurate in a very short period of time if the satellites weren't taken account of, or the software wasn't taking account of the fact that time elapses differently for the clocks on the satellite compared to the clocks down here on earth. So we walk around with general relativity in our pockets even though most of us perhaps don't really know that.\n","132":"Explainer: Do you remember the scene in Interstellar? They're going to a planet that's near a black hole. They go down to the planet, and they spend just a couple hours there, but when they go back to the ship, it's 23 years later on the ship because time is elapsing slowly near the strong gravitational field, comparatively quickly far away. And that's not science fiction, that's actually how time behaves.\nExplainee: I've always heard people say, Oh, general relativity, you know, it might not seem applicable. But GPS, due to satellites, we could synchronize those clocks by accounting for relativity.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","133":"Explainer: What's your idea what physics is?\nExplainee: Um, I'm not so sure.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: At the camp I made a 3D printing one.\nExplainer: 3D printing, good.\n","134":"Explainer: And how would you find yourself, like if someone said where are you, could you use some words or ideas to say where you are on that line?\nExplainee: I think I would be maybe there, since I'm facing it.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Yeah.\nExplainer: So every point, every location on our little line--\n","135":"Explainer: Has its own unit, has one number.\nExplainee: Yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Unlike three dimensional, you have to tell a lot 'cause if it's like a sphere, you kind of have to start using points.\nExplainer: There you go.

What's interesting about these materials?\n","140":"Explainer: I think to really get deep into nanomaterials and nanoscale devices, you really have to understand to some level, quantum mechanics. What it teaches us as we make these devices smaller and smaller, their properties begin to now depend on the size and the orientation of these devices. There are materials, and you're taking a 2D materials class, you know about this, that are intrinsically thin. As they're grown, as they're fabricated, they're already at the nanoscale and they possess these quantum confinement properties that as a nanotechnologist, you try to exploit. And so the first ones I wanted to talk to you about are quantum dots, have you heard of quantum dots before?\nExplainee: Yes.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Well, the other day we were talking about the different dimensions you can have of nanotechnology. So all the way from like 0D to 3D. If I remember correctly, my professor labeled it as 0D?\nExplainer: That's correct. Yeah. Because of quantum confinement, once you get below this 15 nanometer range, the band gap of the material depends completely on the size of the material. So in bulk materials, if you want to change the band gap, you have to change the material, right? But in these quantum dots specifically, just by changing the size, you can change their band gap. And because their band gap is changing, their optical properties are different. And you can precisely tune the wavelength of light that they emit just by changing their size.\n","141":"Explainer: So these are typically semiconductors.

And there're even people thinking about if I take these quantum dots, and I change the chemistry on the outside so they stick to specific types of cells or tissue, that I could really do some interesting imaging and therapeutic work to track disease, even maybe to treat disease, if you can very precisely control the chemistry.\n","142":"Explainer: Do you know what this is?\nExplainee: Carbon nanotube?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: So you've been talking about the different ways you can say, roll these nanotubes. So how do you go about building and controlling these nanotubes in terms of their diameter?\nExplainer: You're speaking my language. This is what I spent many years of my life working on. You don't physically roll up graphene. You grow nanotubes by basically taking nanocrystals and you deposit them on a surface. And then you do a CVD process, chemical vapor deposition. So you basically flow in a carbon source, the carbon dissolves in a nanocrystal and then once nanocrystal is saturated, the nanotubes precipitate out of them in tubes. Then you have to develop ways to go into this pile of nanotubes and pull out exactly the ones that you want. So I have to find ways to program them to go exactly in the places that I want. I modify the surface of the nanotube with specific molecules that recognize one type of surface over another. And then I just pattern the surface and the tubes just land exactly where we want them to. And it's still very much in the research stage.

Can you guess what you would have to do to this transistor?\n","147":"Explainer: So this is a silicon wafer, and they're embedded in basically almost every object that you use, from a laptop, to a phone, to cars, television sets, appliances. We ended up cutting these into little squares and those repeating patterns, each of those is a processor. And those chips are what goes into all of these objects. What I want to talk to you about is how we got from where we started, and how we're able to actually fit 18 billion of these little devices in a little one inch by one inch area. They're called transistors. It's a switch. Very simply, think of it as a light switch that turns on and turns off using an electric field by applying a voltage.\nExplainee: OK.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: You make it smaller?\nExplainer: You have to make it smaller. Exactly. But here's the problem. So about 10 to 15 years ago, the devices got so small that if you shrunk them this gate, that actually turns it on and off loses its ability to control the channel. And so what they did, was they took devices like this into these things, we call them, FinFETs, kind of like a fin on a fish. So they're very thin transistors. The width of these fins is only six nanometers. Okay? So 6 nanometers is 25 to 30 atoms across. And they repeat this over the entire wafer just about perfectly. It's just a huge feat in engineering. But these types of devices are exactly the kind of devices that your phones and computers either have, or will have in the near future. And it's a way that nanotechnology is directly impacting you right now.\n","148":"Explainer: I went through my kid's Lego bins to build a very simple model of a transistor.

Then you put a mask on it and then you shine light through it. And the features of the mask, the size of those holes determine the feature size in the chip. It's not just the size of the mask that matters. It's the wavelength of the light that's used. We talked about nanotechnology being science fiction before, but this is real stuff that's being produced, that's being made, that's being used every day by people.\n","149":"Explainer: And how would you talk about that change without invoking this concept of time?\nExplainee: It's difficult to talk about something without adding time into it.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Yeah, my freshman year physics class.\nExplainer: Yeah, if you're clever, you can use that with high school algebra, maybe even a little high school trigonometry to make it even easier, to derive that clocks take off time at different rate. Do you want me to show you how that goes?\n","150":"Explainer: Even if it is a human-made concept that the universe evolved, developed, changed through time, ultimately giving rise to galaxy, stars, planets, and on this particular planet, life. That conception of time gives a feel that it's like universal, that it's out there, it's the same for everybody. It's independent of our actions or activities. Do you know that Albert Einstein shattered that view of time? He found that if you and I, say, have identical wrist watches, I'm sitting still and I'm watching you move, I will find that your clock is taking off time more slowly than my clock. But you know what's really remarkable? You can figure out this quality of time if you know one fact, that the speed of light is constant. Have you ever heard that phrase?\nExplainee: Yeah, my freshman year physics class.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Yes, please.\nExplainer: All right, so to figure out the effect of motion on time, I'm gonna use a really simple clock, it's called a light clock. It's two mirrors that are facing each other.\n","151":"Explainer: Yeah, if you're clever, you can use that with high school algebra, maybe even a little high school trigonometry to make it even easier, to derive that clocks take off time at different rate. Do you want me to show you how that goes?\nExplainee: Yes, please.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: It's much longer.\nExplainer: It's much longer, right? This one's going tick-tock, tick. This is gonna go tick, tock. In fact, we can figure out the ratio. Let's consider time on the stationary clock compared to time on this moving clock. Well, that ratio is gonna be the ratio of the lengths. Then this would be given by D over L. More time on the stationary because it's longer distance on the moving clock. Well, this length over here, that's the same as this L over here, right? So we want D over L. Now, you may have recall that in trigonometry, there's a name for L over D. Sine of theta, opposite is L, hypotenuse is D, right? And so this ratio is just 1 over sine of theta. So if we can figure out 1 over sine theta, we'll have our beautiful formula for the ratio of time and the stationary clock to time on the moving clock, we just need one other fact. The speed of light along this diagonal is equal to what we call C. C equals speed of light. But in order for this ball of light to hit that point on the mirror, the component of the speed of light in the horizontal direction better be keeping perfect pace with the speed of the clock itself. So let's assume that this clock is moving in this direction with the speed equal to V. So C times cosine theta must be equal to the speed of the clock in motion. And from this, we learn that cosine theta is equal to V over C. There's another beautiful identity you may recall from your study of trigonometry, that sine-squared theta plus cosine-squared theta is equal to 1. This is really just a Pythagorean theorem in disguise. And from that, we can now solve for a sine-squared theta equals 1 minus V over C squared. And therefore sine theta is the square root of this. And now, we're basically done because we already had over here that this ratio is 1 over sine theta, which now is 1 over the square root of 1 minus V over C squared. So you see, as V gets very close to C, this gets very close to 1. 1 minus something very close to 1 is very close to 0. 1 over something close to 0 is huge, which means the ratio of time on the stationary to time on the moving, that can be a huge number as the speed of the moving clock approaches the speed of light. Now I did this for a light clock, but it's true for any clock, and this is what Einstein discovered in 1905 with his special theory of relativity.\n","152":"Explainer: Have you heard of the breach of Target where they were breached many years ago and their point of sale systems were hacked?\nExplainee: Yes, I heard about that.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: I've heard about similar attacks in hospitals using hospital equipment, but I'm surprised that something as simple as a meat scale would have been used in such an attack.

And when this team came in, they found they actually were able to get pretty much to the same point of sale system, and the way they did that was by exploiting an internet-connected deli meat scale. Once the company was able to essentially get into the deli scale, because the deli scale was on the internal network, then they were able to really escalate privilege and find a vulnerability within another system. Essentially, that just got them into the network. and once you're in the network, it's often really easy to then escalate from there.\nExplainee: I've heard about similar attacks in hospitals using hospital equipment, but I'm surprised that something as simple as a meat scale would have been used in such an attack.

More and more, we're actually using smaller and smaller computers with smaller amounts of compute power. If you take a car, you have hundreds of microcontrollers that are all running there. So they don't really have a sophisticated operating system that can try to prevent attacks like buffer overflows. So how do we keep these low cost computers in here while adding layers of protection to prevent malice and these types of attacks? Sometimes it actually is, how can we write software or how can we build a system that prevents these types of attacks from entering? But oftentimes, it's really looking for how can we find new attacks that we haven't even necessarily thought of? What got you interested in computer science and information security?\n","156":"Explainer: So what's the connection between neutron stars and black holes?\nExplainee: So, as I understand it, a black hole is sort of like a neutron star's big brother. It's more intense, though. If you have so much matter when a star is collapsing that it can't hold itself up, it collapses to a black hole, and those are so dense that space-time breaks down in some way or another.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: So is there a sensible way to talk about what's inside a black hole, or is that, should you think of it as there is no space-time inside?\nExplainer: There isn't a sensible way to talk about it yet, and that probably means that's where Einstein's theory of gravity as a curved space-time is beginning to break down, and we need to take the extra step of going to some kind of quantum theory of gravity. And we don't have that yet. So even though the black hole isn't completely understood, we do know that they form astronomically, that in the universe things like neutron stars form and things like black holes form. The consequences are very much speaking to this curved space-time. So, for instance, if two black holes orbit each other, they're like mallets on a drum, and they actually cause space-time to ring, and it's very much part of gravitation. The ringing of space-time itself, we call gravitational waves. And this was something Einstein thought about right away in 1950-1960, he was thinking about that.\n","157":"Explainer: There isn't a sensible way to talk about it yet, and that probably means that's where Einstein's theory of gravity as a curved space-time is beginning to break down, and we need to take the extra step of going to some kind of quantum theory of gravity.

I've heard statistics like many Earth masses worth of gold were created, forged in the neutron star collision that caused that. We used to think that most elements in the universe were created in supernova, which is when stars explode, because there's so much violent activity at the center that you need that kind of energy to create new elements.\nExplainer: [Janna] The way you do in a bomb. It's basically nuclear fusion.\n","159":"Explainer: What's your name, tell me a little bit about yourself.\nExplainee: I'm Amelia, I'm nine years old. I'm in third grade, and my favorite subject at school is definitely science.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: No. [laughs]\nExplainer: That's a good answer. Because it sounds a little ridiculous, right? How can we put a star in a jar? Well, we're not actually gonna put the sun, which is a star, inside a jar, but instead we're gonna take the same kind of material that the sun is made out of, and we're going to hold it for a really long time in some kind of container. So fusion is about bringing things together. That's what fusing means. When those fusion reactions occur, a new particle is created, and energy is also released. Do you know what an atom is?\n","160":"Explainer: So my son is five years old. And he asked me what kind of science I do. And I said fusion. And I said I put a star in a jar. Does that make sense?\nExplainee: No. [laughs]\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: No.\nExplainer: All right, so an atom is what everything in our world is made of. And at the very center of the atom is what we call a nucleus. And inside that nucleus is a proton. We want to take those protons and push them together to make them combine and release energy, fusion energy, that we can use to make electricity. And there's a lot of different energies and forces that we have to think about. Have you heard of gravity?\n","161":"Explainer: That's a good answer. Because it sounds a little ridiculous, right?

So another fun force to talk about that's important for fusion, you're familiar with electricity?\n","162":"Explainer: Right, and so there's also electric forces, electrostatic forces, and you've heard of static electricity. So now let's see about static electricity lifting my hair up.\nExplainee: We can move this white strand, it's like hanging down. The balloon took on the force from like your hair and put in here, and I'll just like move it.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: We just learned about that. Our teacher showed us putting one magnet on, and then flipping the other one around, and it made it the top one kind of bounce.\nExplainer: Yeah.\n","163":"Explainer: Yeah.\nExplainee: And I was also thinking on how can it do that.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Yes.\nExplainer: With the iron filing. So if you take this and you take the magnetic end, maybe you can show us what's gonna happen with it. While you move around those iron filings with the magnet, you're totally in control of that material. You're pushing, you're pulling it, you're moving it around. And so you're using this magnetic force to also do something useful for you. Have you learned about the states of matter?\n","164":"Explainer: You know, scientists are still studying exactly how magnetism works, right?

Do you keep 'em in one spot so you always know where they are.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","166":"Explainer: Mine too, because I get to spend all day studying it. Because you know what sleep does for you?\nExplainee: It rests your body, like an electric car.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Whoa.\nExplainer: So today, we're going to talk about some animals and how they sleep. So here's the first one. What's that?\n","167":"Explainer: They're pretty cool, right?\nExplainee: Mhm.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: And how does it like recharge, like humans?\nExplainer: So we think it works the same way, but maybe just like more efficiently. And so we're still really learning about how this works. Sleep science itself is kind of a new field.\n","168":"Explainer: And so what's really cool about this is that giraffes need to sleep like everybody else, and so the way that it does is it kind of slumps over and it gets down on its legs and it kind of becomes this ball, but what's crazy about the whole thing is they only sleep for like 30 minutes a day. 30 minutes! Because it can't waste any more time, because it can't be vulnerable for any longer. It can get eaten by lions and that kind of thing. It has kind of evolved in a way that it can still survive and still get all the restoration it needs under such a short period of time.\nExplainee: And how does it like recharge, like humans?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: I had a sleepover on Saturday, and I didn't sleep at all.\nExplainer: And how did you feel?\n","169":"Explainer: And how did you feel?\nExplainee: Really tired.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: It affects what you can do in your daily life.\nExplainer: Excellent. So now I want to tell you about another animal and how they sleep, okay? So we have this one. What's that?\n","170":"Explainer: A hippopotamus. They have a different challenge. They sleep underwater.\nExplainee: I could never do that, I would pass out.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: That's cool.\nExplainer: Would it be cool to have that power?\n","171":"Explainer: So now I want to talk about our last animal, and I think this one is probably the most amazing of all. Okay, so what's this?\nExplainee: Aww a dolphin.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: How?\nExplainer: One half of their brain at a time. So half of their brain goes to sleep, and the other half stays awake, so that they can continue to breathe and swim, and they do it in this four hours a time, so like their right part of their brain sleeps, they're able to go up to the surface and breathe. Then their left part of their brain sleeps for four hours, and it goes back and forth, back and forth, so they can kind of maintain alertness, still breathe, and survive. Is that amazing or what?\n","172":"Explainer: A dolphin! Yes. So dolphins, kind of like hippos, have to sleep in the water, okay? But because they're mammals, right, they need to breathe. Dolphins breathe air. They have to go up to the surface and breathe, right? And for an animal like that, it needs to figure out a way that it can sleep but also still survive, right? You know how dolphins sleep?\nExplainee: How?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: That's cool.\nExplainer: So what'd you learn today?\n","173":"Explainer: And that itself is part of the scientific process I would think too.\nExplainee: Yeah, very much. Well, science and engineering, because often you're building a thing and the thing does something amazing. To a large extent we are still looking for basic theoretical results around why deep neural networks generally work. Why are they able to learn so well? They're huge, billions of parameter models and it's difficult for us to interpret how they're able to do what they do.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Absolutely.\nExplainer: So, is this a good thing, a bad thing, that we're sort of losing control perhaps in some sense of the algorithm?\n","174":"Explainer: So, is this a good thing, a bad thing, that we're sort of losing control perhaps in some sense of the algorithm?\nExplainee: It has risks. I don't know that I would say that it's good or bad, but I would say there's lots of scientific precedent. There are times when an algorithm works really well and we have finite understanding of why it works or a model works really well and sometimes we have very little understanding of why it works the way it does.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Now you're talking about the ways in which code and computation is a special case of technology, right? So, for driving a car, you may not necessarily need to know much about organic chemistry, even though the organic chemistry is how the car works. So, you can drive the car and use it in different ways without understanding much about the fundamentals. So, similarly with computation, we're at a point where the computation is so high level, right? You can import scikit-learn and you can go from zero to machine learning in 30 seconds. It's depending on what level you want to understand the technology, where in the stack, so to speak, it's possible to understand it and make wonderful things and advance the world without understanding it at the particular level of somebody who actually might have originally designed the actual optimization algorithm. I should say though, for many of the optimization algorithms, there are cases where an algorithm works really well and we publish a paper, and there's a proof in the paper, and then years later people realize actually that proof was wrong and we're really still not sure why that optimization works, but it works really well or it inspires people to make new optimization algorithms. So, I do think that the goal of understanding algorithms is loosely coupled to our progress and advancing grade algorithms, but they don't always necessarily have to require each other.\nExplainer: And for those students especially, or even adults who are thinking of now steering into computer science, into programming, who were really jazzed about heading in that direction up until, for instance, November of 2022, when all of a sudden for many people it looked like the world was now changing and now maybe this isn't such a promising path, this isn't such a lucrative path anymore. Are LLMs, are tools like ChatGPT reason not to perhaps steer into the field?\n","175":"Explainer: Do you know a lot about lasers? Or just about the laser that you use.\nExplainee: Not a lot, just a little bit.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: I feel like the continuous laser delivers power at a continuous rate, whereas you want all that power to be delivered in a really, really short time with your amplification.\nExplainer: And so we get the power with a lot less energy 'cause its power is energy per unit time. So we aren't depositing much energy in comparison. Can I just ask, 'cause you are using the thermal process of it heating up, but have you ever had the opportunity to use laser tweezers?\n","176":"Explainer: Okay. So this is about high intensity lasers. Not only how do you make them, but what was really stopping them being made in both cases is non linear optics. We wanna do something that requires a huge photon density application, and so that's how come we came up with chirped pulse amplification, so that we could stretch the pulse, safely amplify it, then compress it at the end, and then we're ready to do whatever we want at the end. So what do you think the main difference is between the continuous wave laser that you have that runs at 10 watts and a chirped pulse amplifier?\nExplainee: I feel like the continuous laser delivers power at a continuous rate, whereas you want all that power to be delivered in a really, really short time with your amplification.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: I have, yeah. We use optical tweezers to trap particles in solution.\nExplainer: And twirl the motors or not twirl the motors?\n","177":"Explainer: You haven't? Okay.\nExplainee: So I was always curious, how much further, like what higher power can we go now?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: We could probably use this to drive chemical reactions at a very, very specific spot. Like if we want to target just a single cell in the body.\nExplainer: Yes. And maybe what, do pump-probe spectroscopy and watch the cell? Or to ionize it?\n","178":"Explainer: Yes. And maybe what, do pump-probe spectroscopy and watch the cell? Or to ionize it?\nExplainee: I mean I was thinking more on the lines of if we want to, let's say destroy one cell, like a tumor cell or something like that. So that the neighboring areas are not affected but just the cell burns.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: I think short pulses might help in my experiment in the sense that if I drive my swimmers with a continuous wave as opposed to a pulsed wave, maybe a continuous wave would heat up the sample too much and a pulse laser would deliver power exactly where I need it so that I could run my experiment longer.\nExplainer: That's true. Thank you very much.\n","179":"Explainer: So what are some of the techniques you're applying to look at that debate data?\nExplainee: Something I'm interested in exploring is how well it works to use deep learning and sort of automatically extracted features from this text versus using some of the more traditional techniques that we have, things like lexicons or some sort of template matching techniques for extracting features from texts. That's a question I'm just interested in, in general. When do we really need deep learning versus when can we use something that's a little bit more interpretable, something that's been around for a while?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: I definitely think there is, but I also, sort of, see it varying a lot based on the use case, something that, kind of, works out of the box and maybe works a little bit more automatically might be better. And in other cases, you do, sort of, kind of, you want a lot of fine grain control.\nExplainer: So is that where some of that frustration around the lack of controllability and interpretability comes from?\n","180":"Explainer: So is that where some of that frustration around the lack of controllability and interpretability comes from?\nExplainee: Yeah, if you're building a model that just predicts the next thing based off of everything it's seen from texts online, then yeah, you're really gonna be replicating whatever that distribution online is.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Yeah, it's a really tricky question. As you said, these models are trained to, sort of, predict the next sequence of words, given a certain sequence of words. So we could start with just, sort of, prompts like the woman was versus the man was, and, kind of, pull out common words that are, sort of, more used with one phrase versus the other. So that's, sort of, a qualitative way of looking at it. It's not ever kind of a guarantee of how the model is gonna behave in one particular instance. And I think that's what's really tricky and that's why I, sort of, think it's really good for creators of systems to just be honest about, This is, sort of, what we have seen. And so then, someone can make their own judgment about, Is this gonna be too high risk for, sort of, my particular use case?\nExplainer: I imagine in the last few years, we've seen a lot of changes and improvements in the capabilities of NLP systems. So is there anything in that that you're particularly excited about exploring further?\n","181":"Explainer: As an engineer of course, I love quantifiable things. I like saying here's my 18 millisecond motion to photon, here's my angular resolution that I'm improving. I'm doing the color-space right. But you can look not too far back where you say we have blu-ray DVDs at this amazing resolution, but more people want to watch Youtube videos at really bad early internet video speeds. Where there are things that if you deliver a value to people then these objective quantities may not be the most important thing. And while we're certainly pushing as hard as we can on lots of these things that make the experience better in potentially every way or maybe just for videos or for different things. I don't think that its necessary. I've commented that I think usually my favorite titles on mobile that are fully synthetic are ones that don't even try, they just go and do light-mapped, black-shaded. And I think its a lovely aesthetic. I think that you don't wind up fighting all of the aliasing. While you get some other titles that, oh we're gonna be high-tech with our specular bump maps with roughness. And you've got aliasing everywhere, and you can't hold frame rate and its all problematic. While some of these that are clearly very synthetic worlds where its nothing but these cartoony flat-shaded things with lighting, but they look and they feel good. And you can buy that you're in that place. And you want to know what's around that monolith over there.\nExplainee: We did a project called Life of Us, which was exactly that mindset. We were let's embrace low-poly aesthetic and just simple vertex shading. And we ended up realizing, you can embody these various creatures and transform yourself. And when you do that with co-presence of another creature, another human, it makes for a totally magical journey. You don't even think for a second, you actually dismiss the whole idea of photo-realism and embrace that reality for what it is. I think it actually helps put you at ease a little bit.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Or bandwidth, or streaming.\nExplainer: But if we just wind up following the path that we're on, we're gonna get double and quadruple, but we're not gonna get 50 times more powerful than we are right now. We will run into atomic limits on our fabrication. So given that, I'm trying to tell people that, start buying back into optimization, start buying back into thinking a bit more creatively. Because you can't just wait, its not going to get to that point where it really is fixed to those highest degrees just by waiting for computing to be advanced. If we want this to be something used by a billion people then we need it to be lighter, cheaper, more comfortable.\n","182":"Explainer: The end goal of reality, of course in computer graphics people chase photo-realistic form for a long time. And basically, we've achieved it. Photo-realism, if you're willing to throw enough discreet path traced rays at things, you can generate photo-realistic views. And we understand the light really well. Of course it still takes a half hour per frame like it always has, or more, to render the different things. So its an understood problem and given infinite computing power we could be doing that in virtual reality. However, a point that I've made to people in recent years is that, we are running out of More's Law. Maybe we'll see some wonderful breakthrough in quantum structures or whatever--\nExplainee: Or bandwidth, or streaming.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: And there's constantly novel UX innovations. Like Google Earth, where the kind of elimination of your periphery as you zoom in and move. And also, giving you the user action to decide where you're going and looking. I'm constantly seeing people coming up with ways to break from the paradigms of actual reality and then introduce mechanisms that work very well.\nExplainer: You know there's tons of opportunities for the synthetic case where you want to be able to have your synthetic fantasy world where everybody is a creature that's created by the computer and simulated reasonably. But of course we've got, you know we still don't do people well simulated. That's a hard problem, we've been beating our heads against it for a long time. I do think we're making progress and I wouldn't bet on that being solved in 10 years, but maybe 20 years. Because it is going to take a lot of AI. Its going to take a lot of machine-learning, where its not going to be a matter of us dissecting all the micro-expressions that people do. Its gonna be lets take every youtube video ever made and run it through some enormous learner that's going to figure out how to make people realistic.\n","183":"Explainer: But if we just wind up following the path that we're on, we're gonna get double and quadruple, but we're not gonna get 50 times more powerful than we are right now.

But I think, to your point very much, we need to solve the actual human and social challenges and turn those into opportunities to figure out how this technology fits into our lives.\nExplainer: I'm still a believer that the magic's out there. We haven't found it yet, so somebody's going to happen upon the formula. I feel like I've felt little pockets of magic.\n","184":"Explainer: So, from your perspective, how would you describe gravity?\nExplainee: I'm taught that it's a force. It's described by inverse law. But I also know that it's a field. And there's a recent discovery with gravitational waves, although I don't know the specific details about that.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Yeah.\nExplainer: So you can also think of a gravitational field, something that permeates all of space. Even though the earth is three stories below us, it's not as though it's pulling at us from a distance. We're actually interacting with the field at this point and there's a real interaction right here at this point. And that's nice, because people were worried that if things acted at a distance, that the way that old-fashioned inverse-square force law describes it, that it was as spooky as mind-bending a spoon, that it was like telekinesis. If you don't touch something, how do you affect it? And so the first step was to start to think of gravity as a field that permeates all of a space. And it's weaker very far from the Earth and it's closer very close to the Earth. So one way to think of this field as a field that's really describing a curved space-time that is everywhere. Forget the difficulty of the math, just the intuition comes from two kind of simple observations. One was what Einstein described as the happiest thought of his life. So, right now, you might feel heavy in your chair, and we might feel heavy on the floor and our feet, or standing in an elevator cab. And Einstein said, what does the chair have to do with it, or the floor, or the elevator? Those aren't gravitational objects. So he wanted to eliminate them, and one way to do the thought experiment is to imagine standing in an elevator that you can see out of, a black box. And imagine the cable is cut and you and the elevator begin to fall.\n","185":"Explainer: So, when you say it's an inverse-square law, that means that the closer you are, the more strongly you feel the gravitational pull. And that makes sense. There's very few things that are stronger when you're further apart.\nExplainee: Yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: So, in free fall?\nExplainer: You're in total free fall. Now, because things fall at the same rate, including the elevator and you, you can actually float in the elevator. If you just floated in the elevator, the two of you would drop, and you might not even know you're falling. You could take an apple and drop it in front of you, and it would float in front of you. You would actually experience weightlessness. It's called the equivalence principle. It was Einstein's happiest thought that what you're really doing when you're experiencing gravity isn't being heavy in your chair, it's falling weightlessly in the gravitational field. And that was the first step, to think of gravity as weightlessness and falling.\n","186":"Explainer: So you can also think of a gravitational field, something that permeates all of space.

So, let me propose that we start that way. I could just start at the beginning and step by step I could just look at each page, looking for John, looking for John. Now even if you've never seen this here technology before, it turns out this is exactly what your phone could be doing in software, like someone from Google or Apple or the like, they could write software that uses a technique in programming known as a loop, and a loop, as the word implies, is just sort of do something again and again. What if instead of starting from the beginning and going one page at a time, what if I, or what if your phone goes like two pages or two names at a time? Would this be correct do you think?\n","194":"Explainer: That, in of itself, is kind of a problem or it's an inefficient solution to the problem. So, it turns out that back in my day, before there were cell phones, everyone's numbers from my schools were literally printed in a book, and everyone in my town and my city, my state was printed in an actual phone book. Even if you've never seen this technology before, how would you propose verbally to find John in this phone book?\nExplainee: Or I would just flip through and just look for the J's I guess.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Well you could skip over John, I think.\nExplainer: In what sense?\n","195":"Explainer: In what sense?\nExplainee: If he's in one of the middle pages that you skipped over.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Maybe you could use that strategy until you get close to the section and then switch to going one by one.\nExplainer: Okay, that's nice. So, you could kind of like go twice as fast but then kind of pump the brakes as you near your exit on the highway, or in this case near the J section of the book.\n","196":"Explainer: Yeah, so sort of accidentally and frankly with like 50\/50 probability, John could get sandwiched in between two pages. But does that mean I have to throw that algorithm out altogether?\nExplainee: Maybe you could use that strategy until you get close to the section and then switch to going one by one.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Exactly.\nExplainer: And maybe alternatively, if I get to like A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, if I get to the K section, then I could just double back like one page just to make sure John didn't get sandwiched between those pages. So, the nice thing about that second algorithm is that I'm flying through the phone book like two pages at a time. So, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12. It's not perfect, it's not necessarily correct but it is if I just take one extra step. So, I think it's fixable, but what your phone is probably doing and frankly what I and like my parents and grandparents used to do back in the day was we'd probably go roughly to the middle of the phone book here, and just intuitively, if this is an alphabetized phone book in English, what section am I probably going to find myself in roughly?\n","197":"Explainer: Okay, that's nice. So, you could kind of like go twice as fast but then kind of pump the brakes as you near your exit on the highway, or in this case near the J section of the book.\nExplainee: Exactly.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: K?\nExplainer: Okay. So, I'm in the K section. Is John going to be to the left or to the right?\n","198":"Explainer: Okay. So, I'm in the K section. Is John going to be to the left or to the right?\nExplainee: To the left.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: And you can do it again.\nExplainer: Yeah, exactly. So, now maybe I'm in the E section, which is a little to the left. So, John is clearly going to be to the right, so I can again tear the problem poorly in half, throw this half of the problem away, and I claim now that if we started with a thousand pages, now we've gone to 500, 250, now we're really moving quickly.\n","199":"Explainer: Yeah. So, John is going to be to the left or the right and what we can do here, though your phone does something smarter, is tear the problem in half, throw half of the problem away, being left with just 500 pages now. But what might I next do? I could sort of naively just start at the beginning again, but we've learned to do better. I can go roughly to the middle here.\nExplainee: And you can do it again.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Yeah.\nExplainer: And so, eventually I'm hopefully dramatically left with just one single page at which point John is either on that page or not on that page, and I can call him. Roughly how many steps might this third algorithm take if I started with a thousand pages then went to 500, 250, 125, how many times can you divide 1,000 in half? Maybe?\n","200":"Explainer: Yeah, exactly. So, now maybe I'm in the E section, which is a little to the left.

Because in the first algorithm, looking again for someone like Zoe in the worst case might have to go all the way through a thousand pages. But the second algorithm you said was 500, maybe 501, essentially the same thing. So, twice as fast. But this third and final algorithm is sort of fundamentally faster because you're sort of dividing and conquering it in half, in half, in half, not just taking one or two bites out of it out of a time. So, this of course is not how we used to use phone books back in the day since otherwise they'd be single use only. But it is how your phone is actually searching for Zoe, for John, for anyone else, but it's doing it in software.\n","201":"Explainer: And so, eventually I'm hopefully dramatically left with just one single page at which point John is either on that page or not on that page, and I can call him.

But the technique we just used can indeed be called divide and conquer, where you take a big problem and you divide and conquer it, that is you try to chop it up into smaller, smaller, smaller pieces. A more sophisticated type of algorithm, at least depending on how you implement it, something known as a recursive algorithm. Recursive algorithm is essentially an algorithm that uses itself to solve the exact same problem again and again, but chops it smaller, and smaller, and smaller ultimately.\n","202":"Explainer: That's roughly roughly 10.

I'm in the three, two program for biomedical engineering.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Not yet. I'm really hoping that we will.

As opposed to the experimental side and seeing things? Okay so I'm much more, I like to see the things happening. So then the question is, what's so special about making a light that's intense enough to actually possibly blow things up? Certainly we can blow atoms up with the laser hammer and when the laser light comes in and just smacks the electrons right off the atom. And so the question really is how do you make that? Back in the 70s and into the 80s, I know that was a long time ago for you, we had big energy lasers and we had short pulse lasers, we couldn't have big energy, short pulse lasers and actually it was my supervisor and I that figured the way around that and we got something called chirped pulse amplification. Have you heard of chirped pulse amplification by any chance?\n","204":"Explainer: Excellent. I got an engineering physics degree. There you go, something in common. We're here today talking about lasers. So have you have had much exposure to lasers yet at school?\nExplainee: Not yet. I'm really hoping that we will. I think it's super interesting just the field in general because I really do enjoy examining all the calculations and being able to do a little bit more of the math side of physics.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Vaguely.\nExplainer: Well I brought a little bit of a prop to explain how chirped pulse amplification works. Our short pulses are made of different colors. So I've got a colored slinky here. We probably could've called it stretched pulse amplification but that's kind of boring so we used the word chirped. The word chirped comes around because birds chirp. When the birds are singing, the notes are actually changing audio frequency with time and that's a chirp. The point is is that when all the light is squeezed together like this, it's a short pulse. And that's when it's a hammer because all of the light is now concentrated and you can imagine if this was coming along and also using a lens to focus it small, then all of that light at the focal spot, concentrate. And so that was the laser hammer. So we can't have that in the laser. So the question is what could we do? The fact that it's different colors and different colors because of dispersion, travel different speeds inside material. So we used a long fiber, 1.4 kilometers of fiber but, in fiber, the red colors really haven't got that much in common with the glass atoms and so they spend very little time interacting and they travel fast. The red is going to start traveling faster than the green, faster than the blue and, as you travel down the fiber, next thing you know, you have a long pulse and it's chirped from red at the beginning to blue at the back. And so the frequencies go hoo! Like this okay? So this is a chirped pulse and now it's a long pulse. And so, first this is what we did, we chirped it, we stretched it, then we can safely amplify it because it's not all concentrated and, after we amplify it, then we use something called a compressor and we put all of the colors back together and it was back being a short pulse but a high energy pulse. And then we really had what I like to call a laser hammer. When this laser pulse goes inside, it smacks those electrons right off the atom.\n","205":"Explainer: Okay.

Your cat toy, would only be a single color, probably a red one and so that's just one color. And one color means that it has to really be there for the whole time. One color is one wave length of light and so it's just one wave that goes on and on and on. If you want a short pulse, you actually have to have all the colors. And if you can imagine that one point in time, and I like to say it's like a conductor of an orchestra. When you're listening to an orchestra warm up, they sound terrible, they're all playing their own notes. But when the conductor conducts them, they all play different notes but, together, it's beautiful music. So we have something in the laser called a mode locker and it's like the conductor and it says go now. And all the colors will start together but some colors are long wave length and others are shorter. So next thing you know, you have peaks meeting valleys and they cancel each other.

It really threw me off just how fast. It's hard to imagine things happening that fast. And I also learned how many of the things that I know are lasers. Like how many of the things that I've been looking for, like, the answers to, it is in lasers.\n","208":"Explainer: So in your studies, have you learned about machine learning?\nExplainee: Yeah, I have. So to me, machine learning is essentially exactly what it sounds like. It's trying to teach a machine specifics about something by inputting a lot of data points and slowly, the machine will build up knowledge about it over time. For example, my Gmail program, I assume that there would be a lot of, like, machine learning models happening at once, right?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: I'd probably look at certain keywords. Maybe if the recipient and the sender had exchanged emails before and generally, those fell into in the past.\nExplainer: So these are things we would call features. And we go through a process where we do feature engineering, where somebody looks at the example and says, Okay, these are the things that I think might allow us to statistically tell the difference from something in one category versus another. So for example, perhaps you don't speak Russian, you start getting a lot of email in Russian.\n","209":"Explainer: Absolutely. And that's a great example because you have models that are operating to do things like figure out if a new email is spam or not. So what would you think about if you were looking at an email and trying to decide if it went in one category or another?\nExplainee: I'd probably look at certain keywords. Maybe if the recipient and the sender had exchanged emails before and generally, those fell into in the past.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Obviously, like the features that you just described are features which a person would have had to think about. Are there features which, like, the machine itself could learn?\nExplainer: This is a great question because it really gets to the difference between some of our different tools in our machine learning tool belt in addressing problems like this. So if we were to use a supervised learning classic classification approach, a person would need to think about those features and creatively come up with them in approach we call the kitchen sink approach, which is just try everything you can possibly think of and see what works. Unsupervised learning, where we don't have labeled data and we're trying to infer some structure out of the data is you're projecting that data into a space and looking for things like clusters. And there's a bunch of really fun math about how you do that, how you think about distance and by distance, I mean that if we have two data points in space, how do we decide if they're similar or not?\n","210":"Explainer: So these are things we would call features.

Unsupervised learning, we don't necessarily have those labels. That's the thing we're trying to discover. So reinforcement learning is another technique that we use sometimes. You can think about it like a turn in a game and you can play, you know, millions and millions of trials so that you're able to develop a system that by experimenting with reinforcement learning can eventually learn to play these games pretty successfully. Deep learning, which is essentially using neural networks and very large amounts of data to eventually iterate on a network structure that can make predictions.\n","211":"Explainer: Alright, so, at some point, you can probably see it right now? So without moving your eyes, this is kind of hard, tell me how many fingers I'm holding up?\nExplainee: Uh, three?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","212":"Explainer: I remember reading your papers when I was a student and we're all trying to create these materials and finding ways to exploit their properties. What I love, and I'm delighted that you're here to talk to us about is how you took inspiration from nature and sort of recognize that nature's figured out a way to both synthesize incredibly complex nanostructures with high functionality and how you sort of were inspired by that to do the research that you're doing now.\nExplainee: Life gave us this toolkit that is already on the nanoscale. So we think that that's a great place to think about making materials on the nano scale and manipulating materials on the nano scale, and wiring them together as well. This abalone shell, you can see the exquisite beautiful colors and structures of it. This is a nano composite material. If you take this and fracture it, and you look at it in a scanning electron microscope, what you'll see is that it's made out of these beautiful tablets. And I studied that as a graduate student. I looked at that and I said, that is completely amazing. You have an organism in the ocean, that takes what's in its environment, which is calcium and carbonate. That's dissolved in the water and templates it into this really exquisite structure. And so you think that's great. Calcium carbonate is great, but what if we wanted to make a solar cell or a another electronic device or a battery, how would you get an organism to do that? And you say, okay, that's a really crazy idea. But is it really that crazy if this abalone, already figured out how to do it, 500 million years ago? So we're saying, okay, abalones build shells. Can viruses build solar cells, can viruses build catalysts? Can they build batteries using the same kind of idea?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: We work on something called bacteriophages, it's a virus with DNA. This particular bacteriophage called M13 bacteriophage is made up of single stranded DNA and proteins. It's long and thin. So it's 880 nanometers in length, and it's about 9 nanometers in diameter. And so one of the reasons I love it is it spans the nanoscale and almost the micron scale at the same time. Take the single strand DNAs, obviously a model, and you can cut it with molecular scissors. And you can put a new piece of DNA in between. And so you put a small piece of DNA in there that doesn't belong there. And that piece of DNA is going to randomly code for a protein. Now, the next time that that virus is replicated within a bacterial host, it'll be able to put a new protein sequence on the coat, just a short protein sequence on the coat, maybe like 8 or 12 amino acids in length. And just like that abalone is going to grab calcium and build calcium carbonate. We're going to have our viruses build iron phosphate for a battery electrode material or Gallium arsenide or cad sulfide for a semiconductor material.\nExplainer: So you've evolved, and I suppose, trained these viruses to build the materials that you want them to build by exposing them to the raw materials and then evolving their function. We're talking about the electronics from nanomaterials. That critical issue that we're facing is how do you go from those single experiments with a single material, understanding its properties, how do you scale that to the billions of devices that you need in a technology? It is a chemistry driven approach. We're not going to grow them exactly where we want them, but to take that one step, and to tie into what you're doing, tt sounds like there could be an area of collaboration where instead of using conventional chemistry, that we can train some of these biological elements to do that work work for us.\n","213":"Explainer: It's really fascinating work, especially now we're all familiar with the viruses and how they act. And I'm not aware of any viruses that build nanostructures. So how did you come to that? And then how do you actually program a virus to do your bidding?\nExplainee: We work on something called bacteriophages, it's a virus with DNA.

Molecules, proteins, and DNA work with all the same kinds of bonding and things that the chemicals that you're gonna be looking for in these processes. It's put together in a way that when a protein or enzyme folds, it almost always folds correctly. That's kind of the beauty of it, the predictable aspect of it encoded in its DNA. If we need to make it the same over and over again, then as long as you have the right DNA sequence, DNA is a beautiful structure on the nanoscale. And there's really, really cool, incredible work on DNA origami, when DNA can fold into just the right structure. And so I can see that as an interface, that would be really cool and interesting in your work. And you can have the virus make the DNA for the DNA origami, and then you use DNA to assemble your beautiful structures.\nExplainer: It's really fascinating. You have all these little worker viruses building the materials for you. How are you then applying these materials that you're building?\n","214":"Explainer: Looking ahead, 5 years, 10 years, where do you see your own work, and maybe the field more broadly?\nExplainee: The future I'd like to see is environmentally friendly chemistry and materials synthesis. And I think that we're really going that way. If we think about batteries of the future, solar cells of the future, thinking about earth abundant materials and processes that are compatible with the earth and environment.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: I agree completely. We like to solve problems. Nano bio is the toolkit that we bring a lot. It happens to be a very strong and evolving toolkit. That's another thing that I love about biology is if you can come up with a solution that's not perfect at all to begin with when you're making a battery electrode material or any kind of material you're making, you have evolution on your side to try to make it better and better as a function of time. That can be quite rapid.\nExplainer: So Angela, thank you so much for joining us.

Actually, even the standard vanilla causal structure of special relativity may give some very unexpected behaviors when you combine it with other simple modifications of just the flat space time.\nExplainer: And the beauty of it is, it is not like there is some high-powered mathematical methodology, straightforward algebra that a high school kid would know is all that you need to extract these unusual results.\n","221":"Explainer: To note our recent paper, where we were thinking about Einstein's ideas of special relativity, but in a setting where the global shape of the space time, we imagine there might be a curled up dimension of space, a circular dimension and thought about how special relativity works in that setting, we came to a result in this very basic setting. You can send signals into the past, not in a way that will violate causality. Did that surprise you, that by going from the usual topology that doesn't have a closed part of space, but making that one change, you could have this radical impact?\nExplainee: I found quite surprising that you could have this exotic behavior of signal propagation in a system that was extremely simple, totally classical, there was nothing weird except one dimension that was compactified, was identified on a circle. Actually, even the standard vanilla causal structure of special relativity may give some very unexpected behaviors when you combine it with other simple modifications of just the flat space time.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: And they were unusual because even if you do not violate causality, we discovered that a fast-moving observer, that could be us on a rocket, could send signals very far and then back in a very small time.\nExplainer: And so the old idea that of course we always hear about, that if we ever make contact with extraterrestrial life, if they're far away, we can't really have a conversation because we'll say hello, and then like 10,000 years or 100,000 years later, they'll answer us 'cause they'll take that long for the signals. But at least in this setup, which we don't know is true about our universe, but if it were, then you could have a real-time conversation over arbitrarily large distances, which is--\n","222":"Explainer: And the beauty of it is, it is not like there is some high-powered mathematical methodology, straightforward algebra that a high school kid would know is all that you need to extract these unusual results.\nExplainee: And they were unusual because even if you do not violate causality, we discovered that a fast-moving observer, that could be us on a rocket, could send signals very far and then back in a very small time.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: That was unexpected. And so that shows how even ideas that seem to be well-settled and well-understood have surprises.\nExplainer: Like, why didn't Einstein realize this?\n","223":"Explainer: Like, why didn't Einstein realize this?\nExplainee: Yeah, maybe the idea of living on a subspace, of being confined in this extra dimension on a surface, may have been looked exotic but definitely did not look exotic after the 1990s.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: It seems not unthinkable. Saying that something is emergent will make full sense only when we have some concrete model in which space and time emergent, in which we make sense of this non-space, non-time description of a theory. I don't know if we are still at this stage in which I would say we begin to understand this scenario because, often, I tell my students, the greatest scientific revolution has been not in the 20th century, has not been quantum mechanics nor general relativity nor special relativity, that's been the passage from qualitative description of nature, the quantitative one. When you pass from asking how to how much, then you understand something.\nExplainer: And who do you credit with that? Is that Newton? Do you go Newton or a little bit below? Do you Galileo?\n","224":"Explainer: And who do you credit with that? Is that Newton? Do you go Newton or a little bit below? Do you Galileo?\nExplainee: I would say Galileo, Newton. Of course, the completion of this idea is Newton.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Actually, it resonates with me for various reasons. One is that, professionally, we use spacetime diagrams, Penrose diagrams, a lot of diagrams where space and times are just two axis on a board. And when we describe a particle, we have a line that goes up in time. By the way, this image also is the last image in Pros, the last page, there is this beautiful sentence, which is also true, saying that if he has the time, he would like to describe people as being monstrous beings that extending time much longer than in space. If C equal to 1, that's very true. So this idea that you have a continuum, and time should not be made to disappear as soon as it's gone, is very practical. It's also what is behind the idea of histories in quantum mechanics. When in the approach of various people including Hartle that collaborated a lot with Hawking. There is this idea that what you describe is a history, it's not a particular moment in time, but it's an evolution. This history treats space and time on a more equal basis.\nExplainer: But would you say there's more to it than the technical, more to it than the diagrams, more to it than sort of an interpretation of the mathematical equations? would you go so far as to take solace in the fact that, in a sense that you will always exist because you will always be at the moments of space and time that you have occupy throughout your life?\n","225":"Explainer: Have you done any work in side channel analysis?\nExplainee: Like, a little bit. I read the Rowhammer paper. I found it really interesting, but it's nothing that I've actually worked with.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: So all memory devices are just, it's just a bunch of gates and they're in rows. They basically all hold different pieces of memory. That's all the gates are. Either they're turned on or they're turned off. So what Rowhammer found was they tested a bunch of different memory devices and found that by doing a certain order of storing things, and then pulling that information back in a certain way in one place would actually flip gates in a different place. So you could actually do a bunch of things to a piece of memory that had nothing to do with something that may be critical in a different place and actually change its contents, and that obviously exposes all sorts of security issues, because that's very hard to predict.\nExplainer: Yeah, I suppose the physical adjacency of the underlying transistors and capacitors that are holding that storage. That's crazy. I think the first time I heard of an interesting attack like that was learning about the cold boot attack. Being able to, you know, someone enters their password on their computer and that decrypts their hard drive and then they walk away. Being able to extract that password is really difficult. If I can pull that memory chip out and extract that memory, put it in my own device, except the problem is memory is volatile, so it'll erase as soon as I pull it out. You can take something like canned air, turn it upside down, cool that computer, make it real nice and cool. Then you have a minute or two to pull out the memory, put into your own device, extract the memory, and then you're good. It's such a simple method to really extract something kind of critical. Like Rowhammer, it's such a low level of vulnerability and you could argue that it's not necessarily a vulnerability in the architecture itself, but rather exploitation of physics at that point.\n","226":"Explainer: So the side channel analysis is really looking not at a vulnerability within a system, but really unintended consequences of what the system is built on. A very simple example of a side channel is putting your ear to the ground to hear if there are horses coming towards you, and the same thing applies to technology. So you can have something like a CPU, it's executing instructions, certain instructions that use a little bit more power, and power is reserved in these capacitors, which are like tiny batteries next to your CPU. And as they're pulling power, there's something in physics called the electrostrictive effect where the capacitor will move in a very, very tiny amount. And then although we can't hear it, the microphone on a mobile device can actually listen to that. If you then listen to that and you say, oh, I see a pattern here, and you can go all the way down and then extract and reveal the full password, the full key, even though it could be argued that the algorithm itself, there's no problem with it.\nExplainee: So all memory devices are just, it's just a bunch of gates and they're in rows. They basically all hold different pieces of memory. That's all the gates are. Either they're turned on or they're turned off.

Over the last year while I was doing some other stuff, I actually designed some microcontroller boards for a company that was doing stuff with, like, a smart watering project. The problems with updating is just, like, that scares me the most. Like, people don't update their own stuff, let alone these, like, devices.\nExplainer: I keep forgetting to update my fridge.\n","227":"Explainer: That's pretty challenging if you want to use wireless, right? If you wanna use a wireless router.\nExplainee: Yeah, I mean, there's obviously essentials, but yeah, no matter what, you can't really avoid any of this.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Oh yeah, for sure. When people find vulnerabilities, I think it's their duty to release those to the public.\nExplainer: Especially now that we're seeing more and more companies who are trying to make it illegal for you to inspect the vehicle that you've purchased, right? Something that you actually own.\n","228":"Explainer: The risk right now, just during this quarantine, is actually massive now that we think about it, because you might have these legacy systems. You know, they were built 20, 30 years ago, and it's too costly to upgrade, but now you can't actually have a lot of people in a single location, so potentially, they actually do have to now add some sort of remote capabilities to these systems that were never meant to be on the internet. Have you ever had any ethical concerns with the stuff you're interested in or the work you do?\nExplainee: Oh yeah, for sure. When people find vulnerabilities, I think it's their duty to release those to the public.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Yeah, I think that's nuts. I'm firmly against that for sure.\nExplainer: What if it were illegal? Would you then do it? Fortunately it's not today, right? It hasn't been, you know, despite their attempts, none of that has been passed, but if you had a vehicle and you wanted to inspect it, but all of a sudden, it passed, I mean.\n","229":"Explainer: Especially now that we're seeing more and more companies who are trying to make it illegal for you to inspect the vehicle that you've purchased, right?

[laughing] I don't think that's hurting anyone,\nExplainer: But the laws don't always equate to hurting anyone. I ethically think similar to you in that, you know, what is moral to me is as long as I'm not intentionally hurting others, right?\n","230":"Explainer: What if it were illegal? Would you then do it?

[laughing] I don't think that's hurting anyone,\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Yeah.\nExplainer: I think we see every day that ethics and the laws aren't necessarily the same thing all the time.\n","231":"Explainer: What have you been up to? And yeah, what are you working on?\nExplainee: Lately I've been doing, you know, always a little bit of side channel analysis. So what I really do, you know, is all hardware layer. So I've been looking, you know, at some various devices lately, at how susceptible they are to fault attacks, what that sort of means in real life. You know, not just purely the research side, but also how much should you care about it.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: One of them was looking at, like, a little hardware Bitcoin wallet, and you could use fault injection to actually recover secrets from it, and a lot of devices. I mean, the whole idea is pretty cool, right? Because you tell the device, Hey, I want to authenticate, and it's supposed to run some really crazy math that authenticates it, but instead of doing that crazy math and attacking the math, you just attack the check at the end.\nExplainer: We're also scratching the surface of, like, what is possible? It's not necessarily just the system itself and not necessarily that algorithm itself. Like you said, you don't necessarily need to attack the math in some cases. You can just attack that check. And I think something that's been pretty cool is looking at higher energy particles. It's going to be maybe hard to entirely confirm, but I think it'd be really, really cool to actually see. Like, I want to see one of these faults because I haven't seen it myself. And also, how do you know that you've seen it? I've started playing with, like, setting up a cloud chamber. A cloud chamber lets you actually view high energy particles going through sort of like in a small jar with some evaporated alcohol. And I thought it'd be really cool if we put some memory chip in there, like a basic memory chip and we just fill it with some data, but then you put a camera on that area and you just watch. Assuming that there is a high energy particle that actually hits that memory, that should potentially flip the energy state of that bit. The outside microcontrollers should be able to read that and actually say, Oh wait, the data, even though I'm not changing data, I'm only reading data, and we should be able to visibly or optically see it. What I'm wondering is could that be a next area of research? Because I don't think anyone's actually looking at intentionally injecting high energy particles to take over a computer, when really, you know, that's another technique for fault injection, technically speaking.\n","232":"Explainer: Maybe a mutual acquaintance of ours, Jasper gave a example of fault injection, and I like to use that as, when I'm trying to explain fault injection, he shows a pinball machine and the pinball machine, obviously the two inputs are the two plungers when you're playing a pinball machine, but fault injection, you can tilt the entire pinball machine, right? You're just introducing some external variable that's outside of the traditional inputs that you're used to and you've now controlled the environment in a advantageous way to the user or the player. Can you give an example of some type of fault injection that you're doing or working on?\nExplainee: One of them was looking at, like, a little hardware Bitcoin wallet, and you could use fault injection to actually recover secrets from it, and a lot of devices. I mean, the whole idea is pretty cool, right? Because you tell the device, Hey, I want to authenticate, and it's supposed to run some really crazy math that authenticates it, but instead of doing that crazy math and attacking the math, you just attack the check at the end.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: This was actually tied into something recently I was looking at, which was, you know, flipping flash and EPROM memory.\nExplainer: You mean flipping bits within flash?\n","233":"Explainer: You mean flipping bits within flash?\nExplainee: Yeah, exactly, right. So flipping it in this sort of flash memory. And so someone's done it with x-rays. There's actually, I forget who now. There's a paper, at least one, and it's just like a little plate they make with like a hole in it to concentrate the x-ray source and it works, so yeah, it's super interesting. Like, one bit in memory means a lot, especially in the flash memory side. Yeah, visualizing it would be cool though.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Yeah, so actually, so it's funny you mentioned, like, making it more obvious. I mean, staying on fault injection right now, this is lately what I've been up to. A lot of making a little kind of, you know, like electronics kits of old, right? And you can assemble it all yourself and see how it works. So making something like that for fault injection. So all kind of older logic and stuff like that. So, I mean, it's sort of based on, like, you're presented the little MUX chip. You know, voltage switcher. That sort of idea, using just discreet logic to generate the actual glitch itself. So, but you know, it's part of, I think, this stuff, right? It's like people don't know about it sometimes. Like, even engineers designing systems. It's new to a lot of people.\nExplainer: The thing is, even if you know about that, then there's so many others that someone won't necessarily know about, because there's so many, I guess, potential areas for a fault to occur. Where do you think security is going or new research is going? Are there any new areas you think are coming out or are going to be more interesting, you know, pretty soon?\n","234":"Explainer: Yeah, that's 100% correct. Have you ever heard a song called Amazing Grace?\nExplainee: No.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: The second one.\nExplainer: [Jacob] Awesome. And why did you prefer that one?\n","235":"Explainer: [Jacob] Awesome. And why did you prefer that one?\nExplainee: Because it sounds better.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Mm-hmm.\nExplainer: You're the best.\n","236":"Explainer: But you learned about black holes?\nExplainee: Sure.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Paradoxes.\nExplainee: yeah, absolutely.\n","237":"Explainer: Yeah, if you are going to be able to change the past, that's the one that resonates most with me.\nExplainee: I think the same.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Right.\nExplainer: And that raises uncomfortable issues for many people having to do with like free will.\n","238":"Explainer: And that raises uncomfortable issues for many people having to do with like free will.\nExplainee: I'm immediately uncomfortable.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Absolutely.\nExplainer: But the finding was, the ball can come out and just sort of graze the other one, but it can't affect it enough to prevent the sequence of events from happening. And the way I like to think about it frankly is if there's one universe, not parallel universes like in the other solution, moments in time just are. They don't change, the whole point of time is the variable along which change can happen. So if you have the atoms of time, the individual events, there's no conception of them changing. So whatever collection of influences were in play that allowed your parents to meet, they will always be in play because you were always part of that moment.\n","239":"Explainer: Yeah, so that one, there's actually some people like Joe Polchinski who did some wonderful studies of billiard ball tables, where you imagine a billiard ball goes into a wormhole, comes out and hits the very ball that was going into the hole. And in that way, if it could knock it off course, we seem to be in some logical paradox.\nExplainee: Absolutely.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Do you think travel back to the past is impossible because of a deep physical, like mathematical reasoning, or just because of all of these problems that yet you've been talking about?\nExplainer: I suspect that when we've fully understand the mathematics of the final physical laws, if we ever come upon them, I think there's gonna be something built in that prevents this kind of free travel to the past. But sometimes I wonder if that's just coming from a more emotional place where I sort of want the world to be safe from this kind of paradoxes. So what's pretty clear based on any of the hypothetical proposals for traveling to the past that have come out of physics, you can't travel to a moment in the past before the first time travel machine is built.\n","240":"Explainee: Yeah, we do have an answer.

How would you explain chess to them?\nExplainee: I would start off with the basics by teaching them how to move the pieces, make the pawns, knights, queens, bishops, kings.\n","244":"Explainer: And also take all of their pieces.\nExplainee: Yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: I think I could. If I have three moves in a row, I'd probably checkmate them with rook H3, queen H4, and then queen takes H7, checkmate.\nExplainer: I'm very happy that's the first plan that you came up with, right? You can bring your queen out this way or the rook. You can start with both, and then you come here and then you checkmate. But I did say white gets three moves in a row, right?\n","245":"Explainer: For me, I would describe chess as a lot of what you said, and also, it's a mix of really quick plans like tactics and then things that can take four, five, six, seven moves like a plan, like a strategy. So let's practice. In this position, I had the white pieces. You're playing on my side. My opponent was playing with the black pieces. So we switched a little bit. So if I said, Hey, you get three moves in a row, can you come up with a plan?\nExplainee: I think I could. If I have three moves in a row, I'd probably checkmate them with rook H3, queen H4, and then queen takes H7, checkmate.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Yeah.\nExplainer: But that's how we have to think about plans, right? We have to think about, Okay, well if I get a couple of moves in a row, what would I like to accomplish? What does my opponent want to do? So I'm not just gonna sit here and get checkmated hopefully. Right? So what do you think I want to do in this position?\n","246":"Explainer: I'm very happy that's the first plan that you came up with, right? You can bring your queen out this way or the rook. You can start with both, and then you come here and then you checkmate. But I did say white gets three moves in a row, right?\nExplainee: Yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: I think my king is on a bad scale right now, so maybe you are trying to like trade and then somehow get an attack on my king.\nExplainer: Oh, you're saying like if I take this pawn, maybe in the future I'll try to open up this diagonal. See, that's very good vision. There's some pieces in the way, but yes. In chess, you have to always keep an eye on what can possibly open. Do you know how you can tell whether a position is closed or open?\n","247":"Explainer: But that's how we have to think about plans, right? We have to think about, Okay, well if I get a couple of moves in a row, what would I like to accomplish? What does my opponent want to do? So I'm not just gonna sit here and get checkmated hopefully.

So what do you think I want to do in this position?\nExplainee: I think my king is on a bad scale right now, so maybe you are trying to like trade and then somehow get an attack on my king.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Usually when a position is closed, pieces are more squished together.\nExplainer: The easiest way by far to figure out if a position is closed is how many pawns do we each have? Right now, it's eight. So think of it like a fence, right? So if you and your neighbor have a full fence, you can't really see each other, but if there's only four pawns, that means somebody probably knocked down half of the fence, right? So if we start picking up all these pawns, then the position is more open. So this would be a closed position. This type of strategy would be called an attacking strategy 'cause you found a way to get your queen and rook down this line against my king. Before we even talk about what tactic is here, who does it look like is winning this game?\n","248":"Explainer: Oh, you're saying like if I take this pawn, maybe in the future I'll try to open up this diagonal.

Is it bishop takes upon on E4?\nExplainer: So that's like immediately you get a reward, but I'll give you a hint. The best way to start looking for a tactic, always look for a check first. Do you have a way to attack my king?\n","250":"Explainer: Yes, you're 100% right 'cause in chess, the two most important things we have to think about are who has more material, but then, like you said, who has the weaker king?

Rook, H1.\nExplainer: So exactly. You would give me that check. Now where can my king go? Let's just try to think.\n","251":"Explainer: Yes. Well done. And then I would take the pawn.\nExplainee: And then I would take the rook.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","252":"Explainer: What is it exactly that you're trying to tease out of these materials to improve the battery's performance?\nExplainee: At first, one of the main things that we did was use nanomaterials to add conductivity. And so carbon anodes and graphene are really good at adding conductivity to batteries. And then in the subsequent years, nanomaterials have been really interesting from things like incorporating sensors into batteries, to increasing the functionality of batteries, having some responsive materials that use things like graphene sheets that are incorporated into a matrix, and then you add a safety functionality to a battery. We're trying to squeeze out almost all the functionality that we can. And as new nano materials are being discovered and there're new properties being discovered, a lot of the time that someone tries to think of a way to translate that into a battery.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: I think every step of a process in a battery is something where you have to think about how would this translate to making a battery in terms of the production? One thing that I think is very interesting about the field of nanoscale materials in general, is that how you make the material changes the properties a lot. And so we claim that this 2D material has this property, then tying that to the battery performance is something that's pretty difficult to do. It takes a few steps in between. So we have to think kind of creatively with how we can do that.\nExplainer: That's actually, I think a very common problem. We can build a device in the lab it could be a transistor, can be a battery. And then you ask the question, okay, so what's the next step? How do we take it from that lab demonstration into a technology? The kind of work that I'm very interested in is developing tools to make the exact type of materials that you want. The tools that we've used in the past for conventional fabrication just don't work with these materials because they're all grown from the bottom up. They're intrinsically small, and you have to find ways to either use chemistry or some other means to get them to assemble into the structures that you want to actually either grow specifically what you want or after you grow them, to pull out the ones that you want. You need to be able to build that same thing over and over again, with the exact same properties. No one institution, no one research lab, no one national lab is gonna solve all of these problems on their own because they are difficult problems. And there is a real important payoff at the end. And it's gonna take all of us, making our contributions to push this field forward.\n","253":"Explainer: Because the materials are so small, they're at the nanoscale, their properties are dominated by quantum mechanics, which means that even slight changes in their size, in their orientation give profound changes in their properties. And while that's very scientifically interesting, and it allows you to tune their properties by making subtle changes, from a technology point of view, it's a bit of a headache in the sense that in technology want to optimize for a property and then repeat that over and over again. So what are some of the challenges that you face in the lab related to working with these materials and then trying to incorporate them into the batteries?\nExplainee: I think every step of a process in a battery is something where you have to think about how would this translate to making a battery in terms of the production?

It's when you give up most of what you want, right?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Really?\nExplainer: Yeah.\n","258":"Explainer: Yeah.\nExplainee: If I could trade with any kid, I would trade, well, I would trade something I don't like so much.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Really?\nExplainer: Really.\n","259":"Explainer: Have you ever heard of machine learning before?\nExplainee: I'm going to assume that it means humans being able to teach machines or robots how to learn themselves?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Yeah, Melanie Martinez.\nExplainer: So I'm gonna look up Melanie Martinez. And it says here, If you like Melanie Martinez, one of the other songs you might like is by Au\/Ra. Do you know who that is?\n","260":"Explainer: That's right. When we teach machines to learn from data, to build a model from that data or a representation of that, and then to make a prediction. One of the places we often find machine learning in the real world is in things like recommendation systems. So do you have an artist that you really like?\nExplainee: Yeah, Melanie Martinez.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: I do not.\nExplainer: So let's listen to a hint of this song.\n","261":"Explainer: All right. So why do you think Spotify might've recommended that song?\nExplainee: Well, I know that in Melanie Martinez's music, she used a lot of the filtered voice to make it sound very deep and low and that song had that.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Pitch of the music. If it's really low or if it's super high, it could know that. What can the machine understand?\nExplainer: It's a great question. The machine can understand whatever we tell it to understand. So there might be a person thinking about things, like the pitch or the pacing or the tone, or sometimes machines can figure out things about music or images or videos that we don't tell it to discover, but that it can learn from looking at a lot of different examples. Why do you think companies might use machine learning?\n","262":"Explainer: And that's actually a really interesting thing to think about because that creepy vibe is something that you can perceive and I can perceive, but it's actually really hard to describe to a machine. What do you think might go into that?\nExplainee: Pitch of the music. If it's really low or if it's super high, it could know that. What can the machine understand?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Well, I think things like Facebook or Instagram, they probably use it to target ads.\nExplainer: Sometimes, the ads you see are really uncanny. And I think that's because they're based on so much data. They know where you live. They know where your device is. It's also important to realize that people in aggregate are actually pretty predictable. Like when we talk to each other, we like to talk about the novel things, like here, we're having this conversation. We don't do this every day. But we probably still eat breakfast. We're gonna eat lunch. We're gonna eat dinner. You probably are going to the same home you go to most of the time. And so, they're able to take that data that we already give them and make predictions based on that as to what ads they should show us.\n","263":"Explainer: It's a great question.

Well really it's sort of the same thing as a light bulb. Right?\nExplainee: So it's a beam?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Because it needs to be centered so it can more easily just go in.\nExplainer: That's right. All the force that we apply here, goes all the way through but then it can only basically come out when it contacts the wood in that one tiny spot. And so sometimes it's the force that you push something with but sometimes it is that force per unit area. But sometimes it's not even the force per unit area 'cos, you know, push down as hard as you can on that and see if we can get it pushed in. See it doesn't really work does it?\n","265":"Explainer: So yeah it's a light bulb and there's a couple of mirrors. Now the light bulb has to be a little bit special. It has to be a type of material that can store the energy in an excited state right? It has to stay up there really energetic and sit there for a while so that when the light comes along, it takes that energy and becomes stronger light and then the mirror sends it back and it does it again and again and again and between these two mirrors, it makes the light come out in a nice beam. In a laser, it comes out as a single color. They all come out with their waves at the same time. Every wave peaks at the same time which then makes it a giant wave and it's this giant wave that has a tremendous amount of power. So it can do something like cutting steel. But when you cut steel, or if you were cutting this floor, it's gray, it actually will absorb the light. That's why the light, you don't see it because the light isn't bouncing back or through it. So I like to use demos to explain how my laser works. So I've brought basically a hammer and a nail. I'm sure you've probably hammered a nail before into a piece of wood but the question is, if you asked yourself why it is we hit the big end and it's the tiny end that we put on the piece of wood. We could never pick up a hammer and hit the sharp end and hope this would go in to the piece of wood.\nExplainee: Because it needs to be centered so it can more easily just go in.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: So the laser needs ultimately many things. It needs to be centered, it needs time to actually penetrate and then it needs--\nExplainer: Well it depends. So if you're cutting steel, you need to have the nail. You need to have it concentrated all of the light, not going in all directions but you need it into as small a point as possible. And for that we use a lens. For a lens, the light's coming down as a column, you put in a lens, it all focuses it down in the same way as the nail and then it starts cutting that steel. Okay so that force per unit area--\n","266":"Explainer: That's right.

It needs to be centered, it needs time to actually penetrate and then it needs--\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: So it's kind of like a magnifying glass? Like it magnifies the light down to a point?\nExplainer: Exactly. You know sometimes you want to have all of your energy not just in a small area but in the small volume and so one of the other dimensions is time or length. But with light, time and length are the same thing because light always travels at the speed of light.\n","267":"Explainer: Well it depends. So if you're cutting steel, you need to have the nail.

It's 300,000 kilometers long. So now, if you talk about light being concentrated, that doesn't seem very concentrated. The type of lasers I play with in my lab will be no thicker than this piece of paper. So we take that energy that might be in three hundred thousand kilometers and we squeeze it all the way down into just this piece of paper and actually the beams are more the size of this piece of paper and so, in my lab, pieces of paper like this would be flying through the sky but we can't see them. 'Cos they don't come in our eyes, they fly by us and they're infra red.\n","268":"Explainer: Exactly.

So here would be my light coming from my laser and it would just be coming down, down, down, down, down. Hit a lens and it would have to focus down. But now, all the light started out with this big of a spread so concentrated this much. Eventually it would be here, more concentrated. But by the end, right at the focal spot, that's when I get all of my light, all of the energy has been squeezed down into fitting inside this piece of paper and that's why I say that I built a laser hammer. Because when this hits a piece of glass, it just smacks hose electrons right off the atoms and there's nothing else for them to do, they have to fly away. So can you tell me what you learned and maybe about the focusing of the light?\n","270":"Explainer: Exactly. And so now, if we have light like that that we wanna machine with.

They're more like a super concentrated beam of light that can be any color. They get really concentrated and that's what makes them lasers and that's why they cut things and break things because they just move the electrons out of the way.\nExplainer: So do you think that lasers are fun enough to talk with your friends about or?\n","271":"Explainer: [Robert] Would you like to give it a try?\nExplainee: Sure.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: That's awesome.\nExplainer: So you ready?\n","272":"Explainer: So you ready?\nExplainee: Yep.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Wow.\nExplainer: Let's fold it in half from corner to corner, unfold it and then we'll fold it in half the other direction, also corner to corner but we're going to lift it up and we're going to hold the fold with both hands. We're going to bring these corners together, making a little pocket and then, this is the trickiest part of this whole design, so you're going to put your finger underneath the top layer and we're going to try to make that layer fold right along the edge. Now you see how the sides kind of want to come in as you're doing that?\n","273":"Explainer: Okay. We're going to start with a model that every Japanese person learns in kindergarten, it's called a crane, traditional origami design, it's over 400 years old.

We'll fold it in half like a book. On the folded side we'll take one of the folded corners and I'm going to fold it up through all layers. There's a pocket in the middle. We're going to spread the pocket and bring all four corners together. Where you have original corners of the square, we're gonna just pop those out. This is one of the most satisfying moments, I think-\n","276":"Explainer: Now, this is a traditional Japanese design but there are origami designs that have been around so long we're not entirely sure where they originated.

If we set it down and push on the middle then pop it inside out so that three flaps come up and one stays down and then it's called talking crow because here's a little crow's beak and mouth.\nExplainee: Wow.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Wow.\nExplainer: So, what do you think of that? What do you think of origami?\n","279":"Explainer: So, I've come here complete with a actual chalkboard with some magnetic numbers on it here. How would you tell a friend to sort these?\nExplainee: I think one of the first things we learned was something called bubble sort. It was kind of like focusing on smaller bubbles I guess I would say of the problem, like looking at smaller segments rather than the whole thing at once.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Just switch those two numbers 'cause one is obviously smaller than eight.\nExplainer: Perfect. So, we just swap those two then.\n","280":"Explainer: Six five?\nExplainee: And then switch it.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Yeah.\nExplainer: And certainly the search engines of the world, Google and Bing and so forth, they probably don't keep webpages in sorted order 'cause that would be a crazy long list when you're just trying to search the data. But there's probably some algorithm underlying what they do and they probably similarly, just like we, do a bit of work upfront to get things organized even if it's not strictly sorted in the same way so that people like you and me and others can find that same information. So, how about social media? Can you envision where the algorithms are in that world?\n","281":"Explainer: All right, we'll switch this. And now to your point, we don't need to bother with the ones that already bubbled their way up. Now we are a hundred percent sure it's sorted.\nExplainee: Yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Maybe for example like TikTok, like the For You page, 'cause those are like recommendations, right? It's sort of like Netflix recommendations except more constant because it's just every video you scroll, it's like that's a new recommendation basically. And it's based on what you've liked previously, what you've saved previously, what you search up. So, I would assume there's some kind of algorithm there kind of figuring out like what to put on your For You page.\nExplainer: Absolutely. Just trying to keep you presumably more engaged. So, the better the algorithm is, the better your engagement is, maybe the more money the company then makes on the platform and so forth. So, it all sort of feeds together. But what you're describing really is more artificially intelligent, if I may, because presumably there's not someone at TikTok or any of these social media companies saying, If Patricia likes this post, then show her this post. If she likes this post, then show her this other post. Because the code would sort of grow infinitely long and there's just way too much content for a programmer to be having those kinds of conditionals, those decisions being made behind the scenes. So, it's probably a little more artificially intelligent. And in that sense you have topics like neural networks, and machine learning which really describe taking as input things like what you watch, what you click on, what your friends watch, what they click on, and sort of trying to infer from that instead, what should we show Patricia or her friends next?\n","282":"Explainer: And certainly the search engines of the world, Google and Bing and so forth, they probably don't keep webpages in sorted order 'cause that would be a crazy long list when you're just trying to search the data.

That makes like the distinction more... Makes more sense now.\nExplainer: Nice. Yeah.\n","283":"Explainer: So you're saying gravity pulls things down, yet we've launched things into space. Do you ever wonder how we do that?\nExplainee: Isn't it like a slingshot, like if you pull something back enough it'll go in the opposite direction?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: And does the gravity pull it or is it just floating?\nExplainer: In a weird way, that is gravity pulling it. So have you ever had a yo-yo where you swing it around like this? The string is pulling it in at all times, but you've also given it this angular momentum. And as long as you give it the angular momentum, pulling it in actually keeps it in orbit. And so the Earth is pulling it in at all times, so that's why it doesn't just travel off in a straight line. It keeps coming back around. So it's funny, people think that the International Space Station is so far away that they're not feeling gravity, and that's not the case at all. They're absolutely feeling gravity. They're just cruising so fast that, even though they're being pulled in, they never get pulled to the surface.\n","284":"Explainer: Well, that's true, we do use slingshot technology once things are out in the solar system. So, for instance, we use Jupiter and other planets so that when some of the spacecraft gets close, it'll slingshot around and it'll cause it to speed up. But mostly, around the Earth, gravity pulls things down, so when we want to send a rocket into space, when we wanna go to the Moon, when we wanna send supplies to the International Space Station, the trick is to get something moving fast enough that it escapes the gravitational pull of the Earth. Have you heard the expression what goes up must come down? It's actually not true. If you throw it fast enough, you can actually get something that doesn't come back down again, and that's basically how rocket launches work. You have to get the rocket for the Earth to go more than 11 kilometers a second. Think of how fast it is. Just one breath and it's gone 11 kilometers. If you get it to go that fast, it's not gonna come back down again. So you know the International Space Station which is orbiting the Earth? That's going around the Earth at 17,000 miles an hour. It has no engines anymore, the engines are turned off. So it's just there falling forever. So once it's out there, it's not coming back down as long as it's cruising like that.\nExplainee: And does the gravity pull it or is it just floating?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: It's like that ride at the rollercoasters where you go in and it's spins super fast and you can't feel it spinning fast but--\nExplainer: Yeah, you feel pinned to that. It's exactly like that. There's something called the equivalence principle where people realized, especially Einstein, that if you were in outer space in a rocket ship and it was dark and painted and it was accelerating at exactly the right rate, you actually wouldn't know if you were sitting on the floor of a building around the Earth or if you were on a rocket ship that was accelerating.\n","285":"Explainer: In a weird way, that is gravity pulling it.

You ever had that experience where you're sitting in a train and the other one moves and for a second you're not sure if you're the one moving?\n","286":"Explainer: Yeah. You ever had that experience where you're sitting in a train and the other one moves and for a second you're not sure if you're the one moving?\nExplainee: Yeah, 'cause I go on the train every day to go to school, but I never feel like I'm moving when I'm in the train, and then I'm like, wait, what?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Isn't that kinda crazy? Amazing.\nExplainer: So imagine you were an astronaut and you were floating in empty space. You can't see anything. There's no stars, there's no Earth. You can ask yourself, am I moving? There's really no way for you to tell. So you would probably conclude, well, I'm not moving. So then your friend Marina comes cruising past you, and maybe she's going thousands of kilometers a second, and you say, Marina, you're cruising at thousands of kilometers a second, you're going so fast. But she had just done the same experiment. She was just floating in space thinking, Am I moving? There's no way to know which one of you is moving and there's no meaning to the absolute motion. The only thing that's true is that you're in relative motion, that's true. You both agree you're in relative motion, and that's clear. But neither of you can say it's actually you who's moving and I'm stationary.\n","287":"Explainer: That's because in some sense, you're really not. Imagine you're in this train and it's going near the speed of light relative to the platform, but it's so smooth, then you should be in a situation in which there's no meaning to your absolute motion, there's no absolute motion. So that if you throw a ball up, you might think from the outside of the platform, be confused that when gravity pulls that back down, it's gonna hit you or something, but it'll land in your palm as surely as if you were in your living room.\nExplainee: Isn't that kinda crazy? Amazing.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: [laughs] I don't even know what to say to that.\nExplainer: So let me tell you where it gets really crazy.\n","288":"Explainer: So let me tell you where it gets really crazy.\nExplainee: [Maria laughs]\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Yeah.\nExplainer: So you would say, oh Marina is gonna measure a different speed of light. But she comes back and she says, No. 300,000 kilometers per second. Because from her perspective, she's standing still, and the laws of physics have better be the same for her. The speed of light is a fact of nature that's as true as the strength of gravity. And the two of you are in this quandary because if one of you is the preferred person who correctly measures the speed of light, that ruins everything about the idea of the relativity of motion. Which one of you should it be? So Einstein decides they must both measure the same speed of life. How could that possibly, possibly be the case? And he thinks, well, if speed is how far you travel, your spatial distance, in a certain amount of time, then there must be something wrong with space and time. And he goes from the constancy of the speed of light and a respect for this idea of relativity to the idea that space and time must not be the same for you and for Marina. And that's how he gets the idea of the relativity of space and time. [laughs] You have the best expression on your face. [laughs] It's pretty wild, but that is a starting point, actually, of the whole theory of relativity. That starting point leads to this complete revolution in physics where we suddenly have a Big Bang and black holes and space-time. Just from that one simple starting point. So, is your impression of gravity different than when we started the conversation?\n","289":"Explainer: So, let's say you and Marina are floating in space and you can't tell who's moving. Let's say you both see a flash of light. A flash of light comes from somewhere, you don't know where. So you measure the speed of light to be 300,000 kilometers per second. But here comes Marina and she's racing at the light pulse, as far as you can tell. Two cars driving towards each other seem like they're going faster towards each other than somebody who's standing still relative to one of the cars, right?\nExplainee: Yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Yeah, 'cause I knew that when I was on the train it didn't feel like I was moving, but I didn't know why or that it was a thing and I wasn't crazy.

If string theory turns out to be the thing that the universe cares about, we'd like to know, with all of these possibilities that are in string theory, how do we get the one that looks like the world we live in?\nExplainer: The thing I want to talk about is this paper I wrote with Matt Johnson and Lisa Randall where we realize there's another way to compactify extra dimensions spontaneously, dynamically.

And down there in the tube it looks like your long thing that is compactified in one direction and infinitely extending in the other direction, so there's one less macroscopic dimension of space.\n","292":"Explainer: The thing I want to talk about is this paper I wrote with Matt Johnson and Lisa Randall where we realize there's another way to compactify extra dimensions spontaneously, dynamically. If you imagine starting with this big piece of paper you couldn't wrap up everything, but within some region of space you could make a tube.\nExplainee: Okay.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Hmm. Okay, that's nice.\nExplainer: [Sean] You think that sounds plausible to you?\n","293":"Explainer: [Sean] You think that sounds plausible to you?\nExplainee: It sounds like fun. What I would immediately ask is where do the large dimensions come from in the first place? Is that something you address, or you just assume that all the dimension are large as a starting point?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: But where do they come from?\nExplainer: It was always there.\n","294":"Explainer: Why don't you explain to us what a black brane is?\nExplainee: Well in some ways, it's very much like a black hole in that you have far away from it you have these large just flat dimensions. As you move in, there's something in the interior. It has, itself, higher dimensions, and so because physicists love to joke they thought, well it's like a membrane but it can have many different dimensions. Let's use P to stand in for those number of dimensions, and so they called them P-branes.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Yeah. Yeah. So, a lot of the branes that are relevant for studying things to do with anti-de Sitter spacetimes in various dimensions actually start out as these non-singular type brains, and then you find in the core, there's actually an anti-de Sitter spacetime.\nExplainer: Right. Imagine that rather than going down to a point, it just asymptotes to some fixed radius that continues infinitely far down there. But then you can ask, okay what about the rest of the universe? You have some sphere, some two dimensions compactified, and the balance between the cosmological constant and the electromagnetic field keeps it at a fixed distance.\n","295":"Explainer: Yeah, I've been trying to explain this to lower levels, and they always look at me like, are you pulling my leg here a little bit? Or is this the real thing that they use? Yes, it is the real thing they use. We study these branes in de Sitter space, and so what we found is that there are black brane solutions which instead of having a singularity inside are non-singular, and stable, and compactified. Is this a familiar thing? I know things like this have been discussed, right?\nExplainee: Yeah. Yeah. So, a lot of the branes that are relevant for studying things to do with anti-de Sitter spacetimes in various dimensions actually start out as these non-singular type brains, and then you find in the core, there's actually an anti-de Sitter spacetime.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Right. Good, good.\nExplainer: But then the other dimensions, the transverse dimensions, don't need to be anti-de Sitter. They can have either positive, zero, or negative cosmological constant. So you can basically get any sort of cosmological solution times a compactified sphere.\n","296":"Explainer: Right.

Good, good.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Is it that these have the lowest action of all the things that could possibly, all the possible solutions?\nExplainer: I guess. I mean, maybe you'd think otherwise. Again or maybe you could change my mind, I think that as long as it can happen it will happen some of the time, right?\n","297":"Explainer: But then the other dimensions, the transverse dimensions, don't need to be anti-de Sitter.

[laughing] It's a loud, it's of a loud it's gonna happen.\nExplainee: I still laugh from Keanu Reeves I'm afraid. [laughing]\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Well, it's interesting because there's a lot of activity going on inspired by things we learned from working in anti-de Sitter space where the cosmological constant has the wrong sign. So you will find that there are a number of papers as many of which you've probably read, probably you've read more of them than I have, which try then to take the different kinds of brains, these extended solutions, and they're many different kinds doing different things, we understand well enough now that we can put them together in various ways. They intersect, they dissolve inside each other, they wrap each other.\nExplainer: They overlap, they wrap around.\n","299":"Explainer: I know not everyone buys that, right?\nExplainee: Not everyone buys it. There's a big discussion in the literature right now.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: I think it's gonna get way more interesting than we're currently able to grapple with right now, and I think there are hints of it. There could be a description of the physics that might be our early universe that is like that molecular description. And then from that emerges flat spacetimes maybe four, maybe some mechanism tells you it's four and not something else. I think that's where we're going.\nExplainer: If the viewers wanted to know more about how spacetime can emerge from quantum mechanics, they could read the graphic novel you just wrote.\n","300":"Explainer: If the viewers wanted to know more about how spacetime can emerge from quantum mechanics, they could read the graphic novel you just wrote.\nExplainee: Right, yes. I wrote and drew a graphic novel called The Dialogues: Conversations About the Nature of Universe.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Excellent.\n","301":"Explainer: So far, what do you know about black holes?\nExplainee: I never knew beforehand how hard it was to get actual data of the black holes itself, first of all, they're dark, and, like, they're so far away, it's almost impossible just to get a good image of them. They were discussing a project in which multiple radio telescopes of some sort, like, are, like, pinpointed all across, from Greenland to South America, and, like, and they're trying to get an image of the black hole in the center of our galaxy because, as opposed to just recording its impact on the surrounding stars and planets.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: What sort of technology and, like, I guess tools have you been using in your studies, or, like, just in general, in the study of black holes?\nExplainer: For my studies, I actually, when I started at UCLA in graduate school, I worked with a professor named Matt Malkin who was, gotten a lot of data observations from the Hubble Space Telescope, so that was one of my very first projects to work on, so any, space-based observatories have been a really big advantage, and then I've moved on now to the Spitzer Space Telescope. In addition to that, then there's other people who've used a lot of X-ray telescopes, NuSTAR, Chandra have used data from that. It's been a combination of both ground-based observatories, as well as space-based ones, and going everywhere from X-ray observations, not done by me, but certainly ultraviolet, and then optical, and infrared, particularly, those are the ones that I've been most involved with.\n","302":"Explainer: Yeah.\nExplainee: No, I don't think so.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Is this like a map where, that's like an actual visual representation, like using microscopy?\nExplainer: Yes.\n","303":"Explainer: Yeah.\nExplainee: I'm understanding more so that it's these, a mapping of the circuitry, the pathways between neurons that can lead to evidence of patterns in your brain that are common between different people.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Well, the computer only communicates with itself in binary so it only has two options, it can only ask itself yes or no questions, but a human brain has an infinity of directions that it can go.\nExplainer: Neurons are also digital. Meaning a Neuron either fires or it doesn't fire, so that's either one or zero. And it's the combination of those ones or zeros that actually produce the 10 thousand different answers that you say.\n","304":"Explainer: How long have you been playing chess?\nExplainee: I played a little bit of chess growing up against my brothers, but ever since the Queen's Gambit show came out, that's I think when I downloaded the app and started playing against friends for fun.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Yeah, I would say I really struggle in the mid game. I feel like I've developed most of my pieces, try to control the center, but at a certain point, I'm a little bit stuck on like, okay, now what? What do I do?\nExplainer: So I'm going to look up your account. We're gonna pick a game and we're gonna analyze it.\n","305":"Explainer: So I'm going to look up your account. We're gonna pick a game and we're gonna analyze it.\nExplainee: Sounds good.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: To me right now, it feels pretty even. Like there's no major vulnerabilities from both sides, but I guess the white pieces, the pieces are a little bit more developed, I would say.\nExplainer: Everything you just said is 100% accurate. So that's one of those baseline pieces of information that we need for the middle game. I have the two bishops. How can I activate one of my bishops? You have a little plan you could actually implement right now that would make one of your bishops extremely strong. You think you can find it?\n","306":"Explainer: In all middle games where we have this mix of tactics, which are immediate gain or immediate loss, depending on if we're getting hit with a tactic or playing one, and strategic chess. I just want you to tell me, who do you think has a better position here and by how much?\nExplainee: To me right now, it feels pretty even. Like there's no major vulnerabilities from both sides, but I guess the white pieces, the pieces are a little bit more developed, I would say.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: If I had to guess, I think it'd probably moving this bishop here.\nExplainer: Yes, you definitely want to get the the bishop out, but you don't wanna move it just yet. So how do you do that?\n","307":"Explainer: Yes, you definitely want to get the the bishop out, but you don't wanna move it just yet. So how do you do that?\nExplainee: I am not sure.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Maybe one question I have is like, as I'm also looking at this position, just trying to understand like, okay, what is my opponent trying to do here?\nExplainer: One thing to always monitor in every chess middle game is does my opponent have a pawn break? Can my opponent strike somewhere with a pawn that would open up the board? If you have a low risk position, your position's just nice and comfortably better, you don't want chaos.\n","308":"Explainer: This is how we unlock the intermediate level, which is this move. That move looks like it's disconnecting from the whole board, right? It's a move totally on the edge, but nobody is gonna stop your bishop from going to that diagonal, and then you're threatening a tactic. You're threatening a skewer. You would hit my queen and my rook. Stronger piece in front, weaker peace in back, and then you would be guaranteed to win some material. Just like little pattern recognition in the middle game. So for the future, you're gonna have a game where your opponent makes the same trade early, right? They trade their dark-squared bishop, and you can activate it like that, but in this game, you focused on the center, which was totally fine also.\nExplainee: Maybe one question I have is like, as I'm also looking at this position, just trying to understand like, okay, what is my opponent trying to do here?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: guess maybe they would try to advance their middle pawn.\nExplainer: Yes. Yes. And this move is actually very annoying for white because not only am I now targeting things in your center, what else have I changed just by moving this pawn?\n","309":"Explainer: One thing to always monitor in every chess middle game is does my opponent have a pawn break?

Another thing for middle game. So we just keep adding to that bucket of knowledge. Pawn breaks for the opponent, and then, every time something moves, like a pawn, we have to look around. What else is now opening up? And we wanna get to a situation where you knew this move was gonna happen, and the next I'm gonna come here, and then now what can I do? I can bring both my rooks, and now I have no problems, right? Now I have both knights, queen, rooks. So we need to get to a point where we see that coming, and we're not just focusing on our own plans, but that's not always easy. So with a pawn here, that disrupts my plan, right? Because now this move fails to-\n","310":"Explainer: Yes. Yes.

As you're trying to improve your middle game, one question you always have to ask yourself is, Is that trade good for me? Is it good for my opponent? It's not checkers. You don't have to take me, and I don't have to take you. So we can do something called keeping the tension. We're just having a staring contest here among the pawns. So I'm gonna ask you, do you think it's better for black to capture this pawn or keep the tension? Just slide the rook over and threaten to push the pawn here, which would be a tactic and a fork.\n","311":"Explainer: Yes. Another thing for middle game.

Because you push it now, these two would win that trade. So yeah, rookie 8 is a very good move. You used kind of like a heuristic, right? Well, black has two knights. So black prefers the position closed because decide what the bishops wants to be able to see the whole board. Yes, exactly, but your opponent disagreed with you and took this pawn because that's just what intermediate players do. They see they can take something. Pawn for pawn. What the heck? Like, sure, and you did this. Now what does this move change in the white position?\n","312":"Explainer: Yep, here, yeah, and what else? What else did that move open up?\nExplainee: It opened up the E file for us.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: You know, I'm in the mid game right now, but what do I need to do or learn in order to take it up another level to a more advanced player style?\nExplainer: It's a lot of practice and analysis. Really, an advanced chess player was not born an advanced chess player. They have probably hundreds, if not thousands of more games in their mind, in their past, in their history that they've analyzed, that they've studied. It's like any athlete, you know? I put my weight on this foot, and so I wasn't able to hit the shot back that well.

When we start thinking about turbulence in the plasma, we can no longer even think about the plasma as a single fluid. Instead we have to consider electron fluid and ion fluid separately. We have to use a full blown kinetic equation to explain how this state of matter is behaving. Because we have collisions.

And that's because people thought that Coulomb collisions between the particles, just interactions of charged particles, would dominate cross-field transport, right?

The best way to think about this transition is really called, it's a flip flop switch, okay? So this term comes from engineering, and the idea is that in sleep, you basically have kind of this all of nothing experience. Certainly people kind of drift off to sleep, but then all of a sudden you're unconscious, right? So it seems like it's this flip flop between the arousal system and the sleep promoting system, and it's certainly regulated, and we'll get a little bit into that, but they're certainly kind of made up of two reciprocally inhibitory processes. Okay, so we have the ascending reticular activating system. It originates in the brain stem, and there's a dorsal and a ventral arm to this, and so the dorsal arm has neurons, cholinergic neurons, that go up to the thalamus and then it projections into the fore brain, and then there's the ventral arm, and this is comprised of a whole bunch of different types of neurons, so there are monominergic, so there's kind of dopaminergic neurons that come from the periaqueductal gray, serotonergic ones from the dorsal raphae nuclei, histaminergic neurons that come from the tuberomammillary nucleus of the hippothalamus, and then noradrenergic neurons from the locus coeruleus, and so all of those are kind of working in tandem to kind of drive wake within the brain. So if we just think about drugs that are available inducing wakefulness, we can certainly, kind of the dopaminergic ones jump out, right? So we have amphetamines that kind of drive those signaling, and then modafinil, which is a wake promoting drug for people that have kind of excessive day-time sleepiness that maintains alertness throughout the day.\n","332":"Explainer: So that's good, because that's why you're here, and so we're talking about sleep today, and really about kind of what is the brain machinery through which we go through consciousness to unconsciousness and that transition.\nExplainee: Great.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: In terms of the dopamine, if you're taking amphetamines, that's usually to promote, as you said, wakefulness, but does that actually improve the quality of your sleep?

And so certainly that has like down stream consequences for the sleep system, because now the flip flop switch is kind of pushed in a much stronger direction, and we have to kind of rely on what regulates sleep to get it pushed back to sleep.\n","333":"Explainer: You haven't got to play with lasers. So I brought one. It's my friend's cat toy. Do you ever use a laser as a cat toy?\nExplainee: No.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Flashlight is a bigger shine and the laser is just a dot.\nExplainer: That's true, that laser's just a dot. And so the other thing to notice though is that, like if I shine it in your eyes and I'm sorry if I do! But it seems awfully bright doesn't it? And yet when, you know, you shine this down and you put the laser, which one do you see easier?\n","334":"Explainer: Well one of the fun things people do with lasers, the cat will try to grab that dot. I'm sure what you have at home is a flashlight. I brought a cute little one. So the question is, do you see any difference between what a flashlight does and what a laser does?\nExplainee: Flashlight is a bigger shine and the laser is just a dot.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: [Harmoni] The laser.\nExplainer: The laser. So which one do you think's more powerful?\n","335":"Explainer: [Donna] And yet it's not. Isn't that amazing?\nExplainee: Yes.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Yes.\nExplainer: And that's because the light will go through this glass and, when it hits that corner, it has to bend. And we actually send laser beams down glass fibers, the size of your hair.\n","336":"Explainer: One of the things that lasers are great for is that because it's a directed beam, we can actually put that light where we want the light to go and sometimes you maybe just want to see something around the corner and you can't see it. But with a laser, you can actually and this is a smoky one so you can actually watch it go. You see it actually bending the corner?\nExplainee: Yes.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Yeah.\nExplainer: So this obviously is much bigger than our hair. Right?\n","337":"Explainer: So this obviously is much bigger than our hair. Right?\nExplainee: Yes.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: I don't have a cat or--\nExplainer: You don't have a cat. So you don't need a cat toy no. Have you ever gone to a grocery store and just scanned your objects over?\n","338":"Explainer: Have you ever seen that maybe there's a little bit of a red light when you do that?\nExplainee: Yes.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Well I saw a shooting star before.\nExplainer: Oh you got to see a shooting star? Well that's cool, that's nature giving you the show there. So what do you think about lasers? You think they're fun?\n","339":"Explainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Wow.\nExplainer: The thing that makes them cool is they're sort of like tilings, it looks like you could put this together by cutting little pieces of paper and sliding them together, but they're still one sheet.\n","340":"Explainer: A lot of origami is animals, birds and things. There's also a branch of origami that is, it's more abstract or geometric, called tessellations. Tessellations, like most origami, are folded from a single sheet of paper but they make patterns, whether it's woven patterns like that, or woven patterns like this. If you hold them up to the light you can see patterns.\nExplainee: Wow.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: They weren't cut?\nExplainer: There's no cuts in these just folding. We can build these up from smaller building blocks of folds, learn how to fold little pieces and put them together in the same way that a tiling like this looks like it's built up of little pieces. Can you make a fold that starts at the dot that doesn't run all the way across the paper?\n","341":"Explainer: The thing that makes them cool is they're sort of like tilings, it looks like you could put this together by cutting little pieces of paper and sliding them together, but they're still one sheet.\nExplainee: They weren't cut?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: How about like that?\nExplainer: Mm-hmm. Each of these folds is peaked like a mountain and we call these mountain folds but if I made it the other way, then it's shaped this way and we call it a valley fold. In all of origami there's just mountains and valleys.\n","342":"Explainer: There's no cuts in these just folding. We can build these up from smaller building blocks of folds, learn how to fold little pieces and put them together in the same way that a tiling like this looks like it's built up of little pieces. Can you make a fold that starts at the dot that doesn't run all the way across the paper?\nExplainee: How about like that?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: So all the folds are reversible?\nExplainer: So they're all reversible and it turns out that in every origami shape that folds flat, it's going to be either three mountains and a valley or, if we're looking at the backside, three valleys and a mountain, they always differ by two.\n","343":"Explainer: Mm-hmm. Each of these folds is peaked like a mountain and we call these mountain folds but if I made it the other way, then it's shaped this way and we call it a valley fold. In all of origami there's just mountains and valleys.\nExplainee: So all the folds are reversible?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Oh.\nExplainer: That's a rule of all flat origami no matter how many folds come together at a point and I'm going to show you a building block of tessellations, it's called a twist because that center square, as I unfold it, it twists, it rotates.\n","344":"Explainer: So they're all reversible and it turns out that in every origami shape that folds flat, it's going to be either three mountains and a valley or, if we're looking at the backside, three valleys and a mountain, they always differ by two.\nExplainee: Oh.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Twists?\nExplainer: If I had another twist in the same sheet of paper I could make these folds connect with that, and these folds connect with that. And if I had another one up here, I could make all three. And if I had a square array and all the folds lined up I could make bigger and bigger arrays, like these, because these are just very large twists. In this case it's an octagon rather than a square, but they're arranged in rows and columns. And let's just try going along. All right, there is our tessellation with squares and hexagons. So you have now designed and folded your first origami tessellation and perhaps you can see how just using this idea of building up tiles and small building blocks you could make tessellations as big and complex as you want.\n","345":"Explainer: That's a rule of all flat origami no matter how many folds come together at a point and I'm going to show you a building block of tessellations, it's called a twist because that center square, as I unfold it, it twists, it rotates.\nExplainee: Twists?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: That was cool.\nExplainer: Yeah, so what do you think now of origami and tessellations?\n","346":"Explainer: Do you know what machine learning means? Have you heard that before?\nExplainee: No.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Sure.\nExplainer: [Hilary] So is this a dog or a cat?\n","347":"Explainer: And what makes a dog, a dog and a cat, a cat?\nExplainee: Well, dogs are very playful, I think, more than cats. Cats lick themselves more than dogs, I think.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Yeah. Yeah.\nExplainer: What about this one?\n","348":"Explainer: What about this one?\nExplainee: A dog. A cat. I think, a cat? Because it's more skinny. And also, its legs are like really tall and its ears are a little pointy.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: [Brynn] None.\nExplainer: [Hilary] None. What is it?\n","349":"Explainer: And how did you know that it's not a cat or a dog?\nExplainee: Because cats and dogs... Because they walk on their paws and their ears are like right here, not right here, and they don't wear watches.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Yeah, I have. After every unit, we have a review and then we have a test.\nExplainer: Are those like the practice problems you do before the test?\n","350":"Explainer: Which means that in the test, you're not seeing any problems that you don't know how to solve. As long as you did all your practice, right?\nExplainee: Yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: No.\nExplainer: So one of the differences between people and machines is that people might be a little better at this, but can't look at 10 million different things. So now that we've been talking about machine learning, is this something you want to learn how to do?\n","351":"Explainer: So machines work the same way. If you show them a lot of examples and give them practice, they'll learn how to guess. And then when you give them the test, they should be able to do that. So we looked at eight pictures and you were able to answer really quickly. But what would you do if I gave you 10 million examples? Would you be able to do that so quickly?\nExplainee: No.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Kind of. Because I kind of want to become a spy. And we used to do coding, so I may be kind of good at it.\nExplainer: And machine learning is a great way to use all those math skills, all those coding skills, and would be a super cool tool for a spy.\n","352":"Explainer: That's amazing. What made you decide to trade on eBay?\nExplainee: Well, I mean, I've heard of it, and I trust it a lot because they have all of their guarantees, so I know that I'm gonna get money and the person's gonna get what they want.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: That's cool.\nExplainer: And there's a lot of those kinds of middlemen in our society today, right? We have a lot of banks.\n","353":"Explainer: And there's a lot of those kinds of middlemen in our society today, right? We have a lot of banks.\nExplainee: Yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: So how does it work?\nExplainer: It's basically a network of computers that all have the same history of transactions. And so instead of sort of there being one company with one database that holds all the information, the same sort of list is held by all these different people. Like, you could have it on your computer. And then it gets validated by everyone, and basically, that turns into the next part of the list. So it's sort of constantly updating itself.\n","354":"Explainer: We have a lot of companies that sort of help us make sure that our trades happen, but if we could guarantee the same trade using technology as sort of a technological trust, then we wouldn't really need all those middlemen in between.\nExplainee: So how does it work?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: So like, how do you make sure that it's secure?\nExplainer: So it use cryptography, and that helps it basically encode all of the transactions. So you can't really see exactly what happened, but you can know it happened because it's like a marker.\n","355":"Explainer: [Bettina] Exactly.\nExplainee: That's cool.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: That's cool.\nExplainer: Yeah.\n","356":"Explainer: So do you know what virtual reality is?\nExplainee: Yes, its simple. Its like a video game except it feels like you're in the video game.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Or in Minecraft.\nExplainer: Yeah, or in Minecraft. When you look at a TV on the wall there showing like a picture of a mountain or something, how can you tell that its not just a window and there's something else behind it. Because it always doesn't look quite right if you have a static picture of a person on a screen and you move around like this, its not really changing. And its interesting, those are things we have to figure out We need to figure out when you look at something in reality how can you tell whether its real or not. Have you been to a 3-D movie where you put on the little glasses?\n","357":"Explainer: That's actually a really good description. The idea is that if you've got a system here that can make you see whatever we want you to see, then we can make you believe that you're anywhere else, like on top of a mountain, or in a dungeon or under the ocean.\nExplainee: Or in Minecraft.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Yeah.\nExplainer: So what they do, the trick for that is, if you ever at a theater and you take up the glasses and you look at it, you'll see its blurry where there's actually two pictures that they're showing at the same time. And what those little glasses do, is they let one eye see one picture, and the other eye see a different picture. So then your eyes can say, oh it looks like I'm seeing through the screen or something is floating out in front of it. In the VR headsets, what we do is, there's actually either two screens or one screen split in half, so that it draws a different picture, completely different picture, for each eye. And we make sure that each eye can only see the picture it intended to. And that's what can make things feel like they got this real depth to them, that its something that you could reach out and touch and it doesn't feel like a flat TV screen.\n","358":"Explainer: Yeah, or in Minecraft. When you look at a TV on the wall there showing like a picture of a mountain or something, how can you tell that its not just a window and there's something else behind it. Because it always doesn't look quite right if you have a static picture of a person on a screen and you move around like this, its not really changing.

Have you been to a 3-D movie where you put on the little glasses?\nExplainee: Yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","359":"Explainer: We're gonna talk about blockchain technology. Have you heard of blockchain?\nExplainee: I've heard of the words blockchain, but I'm not sure I know what it is.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Okay.\nExplainer: And so it's being run by all of these different computers that have like a node. So they're all running the same software and guaranteeing your transactions as they happen.\n","360":"Explainer: And so it's being run by all of these different computers that have like a node. So they're all running the same software and guaranteeing your transactions as they happen.\nExplainee: I mean, I would assume this technology is taking away business or activity from these middlemen.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Is there a mechanism for verifying that person A is a legitimate seller or producer of the item?\nExplainer: So today, a lot of people are working on how to create identity structures that leverage blockchains. And one of the tools for doing that is being able to cryptographically sign for a given attribute. So your government could sign that you have a US passport or a university could sign that you are a currently enrolled student. And you could then dole out that information and control it yourself and be able to show people those certifications on an as needed basis.\n","361":"Explainer: Here's a spider with eight legs, ants with legs and these, just like the crane, are folded from a single uncut square.\nExplainee: What?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Yes.\nExplainer: That's a corner, four corners of the square, four points. How would you make one point out of this sheet of paper?\n","362":"Explainer: That's a corner, four corners of the square, four points. How would you make one point out of this sheet of paper?\nExplainee: I'm thinking of, like, a paper airplane.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Okay.\nExplainer: The crane has four circles but, actually, there's a little bit of a surprise because what about this? There's a fifth circle, which is like that, but does the crane have a fifth flap in it? Let's refold it and put the wings up. Well, yes, there is, there's another point and that point is the fifth circle of our crane.\n","363":"Explainer: Yeah, exactly. Actually you've discovered something pretty neat because you made your point not from a corner so you've already discovered one of the key insights. Any flap, any point, leg of the ant, takes up a circular region of paper. Here's our boundary. To make your point from an edge you use that much paper and the shape, it's almost a circle. If we take the crane we'll see if the circles are visible in the crane pattern. Here's the crane pattern, and here's a boundary of the wing, and here's the other wing.\nExplainee: Okay.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Okay.\nExplainer: And to do that we use a new technique called circle packing in which all of the long features of the design are represented by circles. So, each leg becomes a circle, each wing becomes a circle and things that can be big and thick, like the head or the abdomen, can be points in the middle. Now we have the basic idea of how to design the pattern, we just count the number of legs we want. We want a spider, if it's got let's say eight legs, it's also got an abdomen, that's another point, and it's got a head, so maybe that's 10 points. If we find an arrangement of 10 circles we should be able to fold that into the spider. So in this book, Origami Insects II, it's one of my books and has some patterns, and this is one of them for a flying ladybug and, in fact, it is exactly this flying ladybug. We've got the crease pattern here in the circles and you might now be able to see which circles end up as which parts, knowing that the largest features like the wings are going to be the largest circles, smaller points will be smaller circles. So any thoughts which might be?\n","364":"Explainer: The crane has four circles but, actually, there's a little bit of a surprise because what about this? There's a fifth circle, which is like that, but does the crane have a fifth flap in it? Let's refold it and put the wings up. Well, yes, there is, there's another point and that point is the fifth circle of our crane.\nExplainee: Okay.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Well, the legs and the antenna would probably have to be these smaller ones, in the middle.\nExplainer: Yeah, that's right.\n","365":"Explainer: You've got it, so you are ready to design origami.\nExplainee: Awesome.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Wow, that's so impressive. I think I learned how to make one of these paper cranes when I was in third grade but I guess I never unfolded it to actually see where it was coming from. And so now that it's all broken up into circles it makes these super complicated insects and animals and everything seem so much simpler, so that's so cool. I'm pretty excited about it.\nExplainer: That's so cool.\n","366":"Explainer: Can I explain a couple of them to you?\nExplainee: Yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: I know of memory because you have to memorize stuff.\nExplainer: Yeah, exactly. And computers have even different types of memory. They have what's called RAM, random access memory, which is where your games, where your programs are stored while they're being used. But then it also has a hard drive, or a solid state drive, which is where your data, your high scores, your documents, once you start writing essays and stories in the future.\n","367":"Explainer: So, inside of every computer is some kind of brain and the technical term for that is CPU, or central processing unit. And those are the pieces of hardware that know how to respond to those instructions. Like moving up or down, or left or right, knows how to do math like addition and subtraction. And then there's at least one other type of hardware inside of a computer called memory or RAM, if you've heard of this?\nExplainee: I know of memory because you have to memorize stuff.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: It stays there.\nExplainer: Stays permanently. So, even if the power goes out, the computer can still remember that information.\n","368":"Explainer: Let me get some supplies from the cupboard here. So, should we make an algorithm together?\nExplainee: Yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: The right instructions.\nExplainer: The right instructions. Just do it for me. So, step one was what?\n","369":"Explainer: Okay, here we go. What would the next step be here?\nExplainee: Clean all this mess up.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: You want to do the right thing.\nExplainer: Exactly.\n","370":"Explainer: Exactly.\nExplainee: So, like if you type in just Google, then you won't find the answer to your question.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","371":"Explainer: Good to see you again, Yue.\nExplainee: Yes, good to see you.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: So I'm a epidemiologist, so we do a lot of work on the epidemiology of sleep and development of neurodegenerative diseases including both Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease, so ADMPD. We mainly work on population studies. We work on thousands and even millions of population, and we use statistical modeling to find out the association between different sleep disturbances and also genetics related to sleep disturbances and link that to their risk of developing ADMPD.\nExplainer: So how strong is the link?\n","372":"Explainer: So how strong is the link?\nExplainee: Our study has found really strong associations looking at these populations, for example, with sleep apnea. We've done one meta-analysis and it's showed that those with sleep apnea, they have a ratio of 1.26, which means that those who have sleep apnea have 26% elevated risk of developing Alzheimer's compared to those without sleep apnea.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Yeah, so I think what's really fascinating is all these bio-directional relationships that's being identified in animal studies especially, showing that sleep changes actually occur very early on in the disease process, so it could be a prodromal stage of Parkinson's, and also in transgenic model of AD, they're already showing a lot of circadian abnormalities in this mouse.\nExplainer: So within dementia risk in particular, Alzheimer's for instance, there are kind of two clear features that seem to be part of the pathology, right? So there's beta-amyloid which accumulates in the brain, and then there's kind of these tangles, this tauopathies, right? And so it sounds like sleep seems to be related to the tauopathies. What about kind of beta-amyloid?\n","373":"Explainer: So it's interesting, so I also saw that there was also a recent meta-analysis around sleep disturbances and dementia risk, and in that study, they looked about 250,000 people in this meta-analysis, and they followed them around for 10 years, and you know, when they pulled all the samples together, they found there was a 1.2 fold increased risk for developing all caused dementia, so it sounds like both sleep apnea and then maybe sleep disturbances more generally are associated with increased risk for dementia. When I think about that, I think about how sleep lives in the brain, these neurodegenerative diseases live in the brain, and so what do we know about the causality of this? Could it be that individuals who have early onset of say, Alzheimer's, have then poor sleep kind of as a consequence of that?\nExplainee: Yeah, so I think what's really fascinating is all these bio-directional relationships that's being identified in animal studies especially, showing that sleep changes actually occur very early on in the disease process, so it could be a prodromal stage of Parkinson's, and also in transgenic model of AD, they're already showing a lot of circadian abnormalities in this mouse.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Yes, in the transgenic mouse models of AD, including those expressing human mutant amyloid precursor protein, APP type or both, so that's kind of showing the sleep changes in both of these pathologies.\nExplainer: Okay, so there is this bio-directional piece, but I think perhaps the most exciting thing that happened in the sleep field, at least in my view, has been understanding the role of sleep and its clearance of beta-amyloid in the brain. This idea that sleep is kind of the dishwasher of the brain, it seems like, that you know A betta accumulates as we kind of use energy, and you know it's kind of a waste product, and the idea that if you don't clear it out, that it's going to build up and accumulate.\n","374":"Explainer: Okay, so there is this bio-directional piece, but I think perhaps the most exciting thing that happened in the sleep field, at least in my view, has been understanding the role of sleep and its clearance of beta-amyloid in the brain.

The developments in plasma theory and computation and simulation, that has been thoroughly validated over the years, in many experiments, and now we're using those simulations to inform how to best operate our future reactors. It's very exciting because so far we've been getting great results. It's very, very promising.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: So the edge of the plasma gives you the boundary condition really for the simulations that then we do in the core. You need to start somewhere determining what is the temperature very close to the wall, really, of the machine. And when when you get that temperature, then you can actually integrate inwards with the rest of core model. It's gonna be very exciting in the next years, when we can actually make some measurements in those devices and and compare them to simulations, so that we can have more trust in the predictions for the next step for the reactors, the power plants.\nExplainer: Maybe both of us in our own way answer the question that we always get asked, when is fusion gonna happen? When are we gonna have fusion electricity on the grids?\n","376":"Explainer: So you're saying lots of private companies have entered. And that's injected a lot of private funding, not just government funding. Yeah.\nExplainee: The nature of private ventures is, you know, you want to get commercial as soon as possible. So I think they're accelerating things. They're actually taking advantages of discoveries in other fields. Like in the case of High Field Fusion with Commonwealth Fusion Systems and Tokamak Energy, those companies, they're using a high temperature superconductor. It's an advancement that has come recently from material science, right. Or machine learning, artificial intelligence. Those breakthroughs in other fields I think can really accelerate fusion. So I think we're seeing, the next decades are gonna be very exciting. We have to the diversify the different research that we do so that at the end we come with the most optimum solution for our fusion power plant.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: We're pushing for it. Yeah, there are challenges still to overcome, as you know. And hopefully we find solutions to those when we have new experiments and when we actually push forward, yeah. The potential is huge.\n","377":"Explainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Mm-hmm.\nExplainer: Okay, that's great.

Not yet.\nExplainee: Not yet, but considering the way I said it, it's like you follow up with something. So you just attacked me with that, and I move back. So you kind of, you have the initiative.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: So chess is different from art.\nExplainer: Chess is different from art. Let's go here. I wanna go here. Okay, let's go here. Okay.\n","383":"Explainer: I really feel like this is a nice example of black has an initiative.\nExplainee: Yeah, black definitely has an initiative.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: If I was black, I want to end the game like right now.\nExplainer: You wanna end the game right now?\n","384":"Explainer: You wanna end the game right now?\nExplainee: Yeah.

Take as much pieces off, and I will take back-\nExplainer: Would've been nice if you didn't, but. Okay, now maybe we go up.\n","385":"Explainer: Connectome.\nExplainee: To be honest, I have no idea.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Whoa.\nExplainer: In one brain, in your brain. Could I take all of that information and put it inside a computer? Would that computer then be you?\n","386":"Explainer: In one brain, in your brain. Could I take all of that information and put it inside a computer? Would that computer then be you?\nExplainee: Computers they don't have feelings, they won't have feelings and I think that's one thing that makes the human race strong.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","387":"Explainer: So tell me, what do you know about black holes?\nExplainee: Well, I know they're created when stars, once they start growing, it doesn't, it can't expand anymore, so they collapse inward.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: But no, the wind, the pull isn't, if you're not close enough, it doesn't work.\nExplainer: Right, you will feel the gravitational pull, and it'll redirect you in some way, and if you're far enough way, it's just like you're very far away from the sun, or something else. If you're close enough, it will divert your path more, if you're close enough still, then you will get what are called tidal forces, where the difference between, for example, if you're standing next to a black hole, the difference in gravity between your feet and your head actually becomes significant. Next time you see a science fiction movie, if somebody says, Oh, my god, we've been caught in the gravitation field of a black hole, and we're gonna fall in, it's like, no, no, just, if you're far enough away, just thrust a little bit this way, and then you'll slingshot around the black hole.\n","388":"Explainer: You got, pretty much, you got a very good idea about it. Basically you have a star, at the core its generating energy, which is countering the pressure of all that mass trying, being pulled in by gravity. Once it can't generate that energy anymore, the core collapses, once the core is collapsing, it keeps collapsing, and collapsing, and collapsing, and that's the critical thing that makes a black hole. You have enough mass in the volume, such that the escaped velocity becomes the speed of light, once light can't escape, hence the black part. (laughs) But that's the thing, is that just because there's an intense amount of gravity very close to a black hole, things don't start behaving differently. And my favorite analogy is a vacuum, everybody thinks, like, if you point a vacuum cleaner at something, it's just gonna suck everything in--\nExplainee: But no, the wind, the pull isn't, if you're not close enough, it doesn't work.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: So are there any movies that actually do, like, get space right?\nExplainer: I wouldn't call them educational, but the movie Interstellar actually had, as one of the people involved in both writing it, and as a science advisor, Dr. Kip Thorne, who's a Professor at Caltech, who was part of the team that detected gravitational waves, and just won a Nobel Prize for it. So he made sure to try and get it as accurate as possible, so Interstellar, I think, is one of the best examples of getting black holes right.\n","389":"Explainer: I'm sure you've heard about extra dimensions a little bit.\nExplainee: I've heard it, yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: I get a little scared, [laughing] because I think how can you prove these theories?\nExplainer: Right.\n","390":"Explainer: Mm-hmm.\nExplainee: Is that an extra dimension? Does that fit into that, or is that something?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: And are each of those dimensions, are they governed by the same laws of physics, or is there like a separate Lagrangian for each universe--\nExplainer: It's a, yeah.\n","391":"Explainer: It's a, yeah.\nExplainee: [Bela] Or how does that work?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Okay.\nExplainer: Why in the world would you think that there are extra dimensions, right? So you've heard of string theory?\n","392":"Explainer: Why in the world would you think that there are extra dimensions, right? So you've heard of string theory?\nExplainee: I have. So string theory is basically a theory of quantum gravity.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Right.\nExplainer: That's the good news. The bad news is that it only seems to work if spacetime is ten dimensional. [chuckles] So you would say well then it's wrong. It can't be right. Spacetime is not ten-dimensional. Spacetime is four dimensional. We've observed that. But instead, we say if spacetime looks four dimensional to us, but string theory, which might be the best theory we have of quantum gravity says it must be ten dimensional, maybe we can hide those extra six dimensions somehow. So here's how we could get lucky. We could imagine that there are extra dimensions of space that are curled up somehow that are so small that we can't see them. This is actually an old idea. It goes back to Kaluza and Klein right after general relativity was invented in 1915. But there's a more recent idea that says there could actually be relatively large extra dimensions. There could be extra dimensions that are actually that big, like a millimeter across that you would not have noticed. But here's the new, exciting idea. So let's imagine, okay. This is a piece of paper. But let's imagine this is our entire world. So, in other words, our real world is three dimensional, but let's imagine that we're just idealizing it down to two dimensions, so we all live here. You and I live here. But let's imagine that we're embedded in this bigger space. So there are extra dimensions that are actually big, okay? And let's imagine that. When I say we live on this three dimensional world what I mean is imagine that the particles that you and I are made of, right, the quarks, the leptons, the electrons and everything, all the forces we know about, electromagnetism, the weak nuclear force, the strong nuclear force, imagine they can't leave this surface. This is what we call a brane. B-R-A-N-E. Have you heard this word before?\n","393":"Explainer: Mm-hmm. So we have quantum mechanics, right? The theory of atoms and so forth and how those work, and then we have gravity, and gravity doesn't seem to fit in. It's the one force of nature that we can't really easily fit into this quantum mechanical framework, so string theory is one of the best ideas.\nExplainee: Right.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: I've heard it, yeah.\nExplainer: [Sean] Do you know where it comes from?\n","394":"Explainer: [Sean] Do you know where it comes from?\nExplainee: No.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Right.\nExplainer: If you have a two dimensional surface that vibrates and is a physical thing, we call that a membrane. Membrane theory goes back, it never was as popular as string theory, but it's been around for a while. But if you had extra dimensions of space, then you can three dimensional vibrating things, and four dimensional vibrating things.\n","395":"Explainer: From membranes, you know. We have lines, one dimension. We have two dimensional surfaces. So if you have a line that is a vibrating physical thing, you call it a string, right?\nExplainee: Right.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: So how do these strings give rise to things like mass and charge, and basically give us the properties of the particles that we see?\nExplainer: Well basically the strings are the particles that we see. It's exactly the same thing as we said for the straw, if you look at it far away it looks one dimensional. A little loop of string, so a little one dimensional circle that is vibrating. If you look at it from very, very far away, it just looks like a particle. So in string theory, an electron is a little string. A photon is a little string.\n","396":"Explainer: If you have a two dimensional surface that vibrates and is a physical thing, we call that a membrane.

Is it supposed to be the last thing that sort of unifies all the forces together?\nExplainer: Yes, string theory's even better. So the phrase Grand Unified Theory was coined in the 1970s for theories that joined electricity and magnetism. So a good string theory is gravity plus the Grand Unified Theory.\n","397":"Explainer: Yes, string theory's even better. So the phrase Grand Unified Theory was coined in the 1970s for theories that joined electricity and magnetism. So a good string theory is gravity plus the Grand Unified Theory.\nExplainee: Okay.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: So we have three spatial dimensions. A brane is sort of the next level. So a brane is a higher dimensional object that vibrates through space.\nExplainer: That's right. And we could live there. The world we see around us, the three dimensions of space around us could reflect the fact that we are somehow stuck on a three dimensional brane trying to escape.\n","398":"Explainer: It's even better. It's the theory of everything. What would you tell a friend of yours if they asked you what dimensions are, what extra dimensions are, what a brane is?\nExplainee: So we have three spatial dimensions. A brane is sort of the next level. So a brane is a higher dimensional object that vibrates through space.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: It was really cool to learn about strings and branes and how looking at gravity on small scales is actually connected to what I do in looking at gravity on these cosmological scales, and it's definitely something I'm gonna think about in my research.\n","399":"Explainer: [Amit] Right.\nExplainee: So what's your take on why knowledge is, rather than information, or zero-data proof. Clearly, there's data there. So can't be zero-data.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Mm-hmm.\nExplainer: being something that you can already predict. Right.\n","400":"Explainer: being something that you can already predict.

This concept of zero-knowledge programs would allow you to carry out completely arbitrary computations\nExplainee: Mm-hmm.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Mm-hmm.\nExplainer: And then you can run it and gain the benefit of that computation without having to talk to me anymore.\n","403":"Explainer: Indeed.\nExplainee: general knowledge of proof in the ledger.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: [Shang-Hua] Yes, yes.\nExplainer: And I think that's a sign. That's a sign that our baby has grown up and, you know, it's time for it to be developed.\n","404":"Explainer: What is your impression of what a black hole is?\nExplainee: I'm a senior at NYU. I'm studying physics and environmental studies.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: So it's a star that has collapsed. It has so much concentrated mass and gravity that there's a point outside of the black hole called the event horizon. So once you get past the event horizon, nothing, not even light can escape from that.\nExplainer: It turns out that there are only three quantities that define a black hole, its electric charge, its mass, and its spin. So the most general black hole can also spin and it can also be electrically charged. Whether or not they are has to do with how they formed. If a star collapses, it will likely be spinning when it collapses and the remnant black hole that formsbwill likely be spinning. A black hole of a certain mass, charge, and spin is indistinguishable from any other black hole with those same properties. So in some sense, they're like fundamental particles, which makes them absolutely exceptional for any other astrophysical object. Have you heard the stories about what happens inside a black hole?\n","405":"Explainer: And so you can't actually measure the length.\nExplainee: Yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Would a planet or an asteroid be a fractal?\nExplainer: Yeah, so if you look at kind of the wrinkly surface of an asteroid, each one of those little wrinkles adds a little bit to the surface area. And so it's really hard to say, what is the area of an asteroid? Let's take a look at a little example of where fractals actually show up in nature. What we're gonna try to do is we're gonna try to say what the length of the coastline of great Britain is. So we're gonna start out with the blue ones, which are spaced further apart. We're gonna ask you to connect the blue pins with a piece of string so we can get a measurement of the coastline. So we have our first measurement of the length of the coastline, and we're gonna do it over again. But this time we're gonna use the white pins, which are spaced closer together. So we measured the coastline again. And what do you think happens?\n","406":"Explainer: Right? Yeah. So that's already a really good idea of what a fractal is. It has some really, really interesting detail at all, scales that makes it hard to talk about standard quantities like lengths and areas and volumes.\nExplainee: Would a planet or an asteroid be a fractal?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: There's more in and out. Therefore probably takes more string for this one.\nExplainer: I think I agree with you, but I think to really validate our scientific experiment, we should probably compare the length of the string. A lot of extra slack in that pig of string. So what we noticed with great Britain is we were never able to measure it's length. It just kept getting longer and longer. This is called the coastline paradox where there's not really one definite number you can assign to the length of the coastline, but it depends on how you measure it. Like if we kept going to really get this to be accurate, we might have to like actually go down the beach and start measuring these tiny little details along the coastline. But really there's so much detail. We would probably never get a definite answer for how long the coastline is. Fractals also give us a really nice language. We're talking about how smooth or rough some kind of shape is. And actually a lot of people, engineers and scientists use this idea of fractals and this language of fractals to compare different shapes, not in terms of their size, but in terms of their roughness. So based on everything we talked about today, how would you describe a fractal to somebody in your own words?\n","407":"Explainer: Yeah, so if you look at kind of the wrinkly surface of an asteroid, each one of those little wrinkles adds a little bit to the surface area.

Like it's a shape that you can't use sort of the ordinary language that we use to talk about shapes you really need some other ideas or concepts to talk about.\n","408":"Explainer: is it some sort of conjecture circuit that is a really good guess there's parts of that that are definitely about conducting this is the inside of a quantum computer\nExplainee: Oh wow.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Oh wow.

It would weigh the same, it would have the same mass, but it would be much more dense.\nExplainee: Yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: How does it go that small?\nExplainer: Well, that's a really good question. So interestingly, the sun itself isn't heavy enough. So it has to be heavy enough that when it begins to collapse, it just overcomes all attempts to fight it. If you made something really dense, you would have to travel faster than the speed of light to actually escape. That's 300,000 kilometers per second.\n","431":"Explainer: If a star is heavy enough to explode into supernova what's left begins to collapse under its own weight. And if that's heavy enough, the core will not be able to stop collapsing, 'cause it no longer has the thermonuclear fuel, it's run outta fuel. And if it's run outta fuel, it's no longer shining and pushing outward. And without that it itself begins to go dark and there's nothing fighting the collapse anymore. And that's when you form a black hole.\nExplainee: How does it go that small?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: So if like the sun all collapsed on itself, it would form a black hole?\nExplainer: So it goes so fast that it goes completely dark.

In some ways, the operation of the quantum system itself, as it's sensitive to different physical phenomena, the ones that I don't like, I call noise. The ones I do like, I call signal and that's an artificial definition that I'm making when I choose to build a sensor. One of the challenges we have is, we're trying to figure out if I wanna control it, where is it coming from? I remember we had experiments running in our lab one day and we were running these experiments about 100 megahertz.

You don't just see the external spins, you see the fluctuations of all the other spins in your system. So what you wanna do is make sure that they don't interact with each other, but they still stay sensitive to everything else. And there, you could think about the local interactions, the magnetic interactions between the spins as a form of noise. In some ways, it's interfering with what you wanna measure, which is the magnetic field outside the sample.\n","452":"Explainer: Right, it could give you information if you read it out, about what's happening or you have to find smart ways to suppress it so that you can focus on what you really do care about.\nExplainee: So what are the kind of noise and fluctuations that you're worried about?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","453":"Explainer: I wanted to ask you a little bit about what you know about the history of the internet.

So, so the real physical paper has some amount of thickness, but when we model this mathematically, we might ignore the thickness and say, yeah, this is really just kind of a two dimensional sheet of paper. And then you have your apple, how many dimensions is the apple?\n","460":"Explainer: The Mandelbrot set or the Julia set, you know, the idea is always, oh, I'm gonna apply some polynomial over and over again. Z squared plus C or something like that. When I think about fractals, I try to get away from these very specific examples and ask, what is it fundamentally that makes a fractal, a fractal. And one thing that I think you can be precise about, even if you can't really say exactly what a fractal is, is you can talk about this idea of fractal dimension. Have you ever heard of that?\nExplainee: No, I have not actually.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Well on the, on the paper itself, I would say it's two dimensional, but the actual paper would be three dimensions because it has a very small thickness.\nExplainer: And why three?\n","461":"Explainer: And why three?\nExplainee: I would also say three.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Because it has the pipes and the width. And there's a depth to it as well.\nExplainer: So it's not quite as solid as the apple, but it's also not quite as two dimensional as the original sheet of paper. And so for this reason, people associate this crumpled ball with a fractal dimension, maybe something like 2.5 dimensions instead of two or three, there are a lot of different definitions, precise definitions of fractal dimension. But I think the one that's easiest to understand is this thing called box counting dimension. You have, let's say an image and you want to decide what's the fractal dimension of this image. So what you're gonna do is you're gonna count the number of boxes, or you can imagine big pixels of this image that cover the boundary of this shape. And you're gonna see how does that counting compare with how the counts work for just an ordinary shape? So, so if I have a straight line and I start out with one big box that covers the whole line, and now I shrink my boxes by a factor of two, I just make boxes half as big. How many boxes will I need to cover that line?\n","462":"Explainer: Totally, now, as a little experiment, take your piece of paper and just crumple it into a ball. So what is it? Is the paper three dimensional or is it two dimensional?\nExplainee: Because it has the pipes and the width.

Where if you, if you change the amount of measurement for a coastline, you can actually change like how much of the coast that, that there is like if you measure in mile lengths, you're gonna get a much different estimate than if you measure in one inch increments.\nExplainer: So procedural computer graphics, which kind of came out of thinking about fractals is one answer to this question about how do you add more detail without for instance, consuming tons of memory or requiring artists to paint ultra detail the textures. So if, if you can instead describe at least some aspect of what you're looking at in a procedural or recursive way, then you can add as much detail as you need when you get close to objects.\n","465":"Explainer: And so what this box counting is getting at is saying, well, I still can never decide what the length of the coastline is, but what I can do is I can see how quick does the number of boxes grow relative to how it would grow just for an ordinary one dimensional curve, like a line or a circle.\nExplainee: Yeah, I've, I've heard about that.

Do you know how the research into fractals began? You can look pretty far back in history to see kind of glimmers of this idea of fractals in science in the 19th century, people were trying to look for examples of things in mathematics that were very unnatural. So there was, for instance, this guy named Georg Cantor, who was showing that you can have these sets with really strange properties, or you can have functions with really strange properties. This thing called the devil staircase and so on. And it wasn't until about a century later where someone named Mendel Brock said, Oh, actually this strange mathematics that was meant to show how unnatural things can happen is actually a perfect description of things that really do happen in nature. And from there, people really ran with it and said, Oh, okay, well, if these fractal descriptions are good for nature, we can also use that for creating really realistic and believable pictures in computer graphics.\n","467":"Explainer: Yeah like perlin noise is a great example, right?

You're getting into philosophy of math now. It's just exciting.\nExplainer: I mean I think that's another common misconception about mathematics is that it's so far removed from the humanities, for instance. I mean it's hard to ignore some of these philosophical questions, particularly when we're talking about certain things like infinity. And I think one of the most difficult things to really be precise about and to explain to students is the continuum hypothesis. What do you say to students about the continuum hypothesis?\n","469":"Explainer: I'll grant you that Hilbert's Hotel does not exist. For me, infinite objects absolutely exist. And I can't read the thoughts in your head, but I have a high degree of confidence that we have a lot of the same ideas about infinity.\nExplainee: It's this idea that are things that you can think of, do they exist? You're getting into philosophy of math now. It's just exciting.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: The most fun thing to teach when you teach about infinity, when students realize that you are talking about different sizes of infinity, but then a natural thing is for them to think about what is the next size of infinity that I can think about? And sort of the continuum hypothesis is sort of one of these really hard things to grasp.\nExplainer: So what's so fascinating about the continuum hypothesis, if you take a subset of the real line that's infinite, does it necessarily have either the cardinality of the naturals or the cardinality of continuum, or is there some sort of third possibility? What's very surprising is the continuum hypothesis has been completely resolved in the sense that we now know for absolute certain that we will never know whether it's true or false. So this is a little bit confusing. The standard foundational axioms of mathematics that we take for granted are completely insufficient to prove the continuum hypothesis one way or the other. Mathematicians among other things have been very clear about exactly what they're taking as an assumption and exactly what they're concluding from it. So mathematical practice is to be exact transparent about the hypotheses you need to prove your theorem. So now I think of a proof of a theorem more like constructing a function where the domain of that function is all of the hypotheses that I'm assuming and then the target of that function is maybe a particular element in some universe that is the modularized space of the statement that I'm trying to prove or something like this. If the foundations were to change, if set theory were replaced by something else, maybe dependent type theory, do you think the theorem you've proven would still be true?\n","470":"Explainer: So what are you studying these days?\nExplainee: Well, I'm preparing my dissertation.

On one hand we might have like a one-shot memory, a memory of something that we saw yesterday, like what we did or what we ate or where we were. But a lot of our memories and our knowledge instead are based on many, many, many experiences.\n","471":"Explainer: What I love about what you were describing is like you didn't use the word memory, were how you were talking about kind of perceptions and social judgments but I think probably we'd both agree that memory is a big part of that.\nExplainee: Oh of course.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Oh, absolutely. I think this sort of reminds me of another project that I'm doing. It's fairly easy to get different participants to experience consistent negative emotions to the same stimuli, but with positive emotions it's so much harder to study. I might not react the same to like this like cute cat video than someone else. And I definitely believe that people's memory that they're bringing up unconsciously when they're experiencing something to make an emotional judgment informs especially our experience with positive emotion possibly more than negative emotion.\nExplainer: Some of those examples really remind me also some of the questions about kind of abnormalities in, in memory or trauma or disruptions in memory and how they also play out in terms of not just what people remember but what they do with those memories right?\n","472":"Explainer: Some of those examples really remind me also some of the questions about kind of abnormalities in, in memory or trauma or disruptions in memory and how they also play out in terms of not just what people remember but what they do with those memories right?\nExplainee: As far as the way that my research plays into it is like the first step in making a judgment about what to do based on an experience we're calling from memory is deciding what your emotional response was.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: In people with intact brains, you might use a particular process, but if that brain region that subserves that process is damaged, that it's not that you can't do it anymore you just now do it a different way.\nExplainer: You know when I look back at, some of the work for my own lab and in the field in general, I really feel like some of the most exciting discoveries were not an answer to a question that was around before, but they were discoveries that made us realize we weren't asking the right question. I think one example of that even has to do with the connection between memory and decision-making. There was a discovery about how the striatum responds to rewards and to learning that just all of a sudden flipped the way we thought about the role of reward and learning and memory, and may force us to realize there was something fundamentally connected between these processes. And that discovery just raised a whole new set of questions that didn't exist before.\n","473":"Explainer: I think what we're still kind of trying to understand as a field is the more kind of detailed and bigger picture of where does this model live? How does it get updated based on experiences? Why does that sometimes happen and sometimes not? There are actually people who are born without a hippocampus. They have disruptions to episodic memories. They have trouble after this conversation remembering what the conversation was about, but they do have pretty good semantic information. They have a good sense of knowledge about the world. And that's interesting for two reasons. One, it shows this association between the role of the hippocampus and these two forms of memory, episodic memories and semantic memory. The other reason it's interesting is that people often assume that we get to semantic memory through episodic memory, that we encounter one dog and then another dog, and then another dog and then we learned the concept, the semantic notion of a dog. And these people, their profile suggests that you can learn semantic information. You can learn general knowledge about the world, even without ever having the capacity to build those individual memories.\nExplainee: In people with intact brains, you might use a particular process, but if that brain region that subserves that process is damaged, that it's not that you can't do it anymore you just now do it a different way.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: It's really hard to tell people like, just don't use your memory to do this. And we just sort of have to infer and guess at what strategies that they're doing. Is there's a particular research question that the answer you think is gonna inform the research in your lab and perhaps in the rest of your field?\nExplainer: Each project should be very focused and rigorous and know what a study is designed for. But at the same time we have to keep our minds open, our eyes open for what else is happening. Some of the most interesting discoveries didn't make sense at first.\n","474":"Explainer: What happens in Minecraft if you get really, really close to a shape?\nExplainee: Well, it just looks like a block.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Recursion is a function that uses itself or calls itself in it's definition. And basically with that, you can figure out minute details such as searching for a value in a binary tree. It's kind of like iterating through itself, but it's often more sophisticated in that it's easier to write.\nExplainer: They're easy for a computer to execute, right? It just has to run this recursive procedure over and over and over again. We can kind of get as much detail as we want or need.

And that's actually too true of GPUs. It's kind of interesting. GPUs are basically really fast machines that can only draw one thing and that's a flat triangle. And so if we keep doing this with our paper, you kind of get pretty quickly the idea of what's gonna happen. So when you go to see a Pixar movie, for instance, every surface has been subdivided down. So you have tiny little triangles called micro polygons that are even smaller than the size of a pixel.\n","476":"Explainer: So subdivision surface is a way of describing a smooth shape on a computer rather than some complicated fractal shape. So meshes and computer graphics are usually made of these flat polygons with kind of sharp edges. And so the question is how can I get something nice and round and smooth out of these sharp looking polygons? What I can do is I can start cutting one at a time, the corners of this paper off, it still looks very angular. I still have these really sharp points.\nExplainee: Right why are we doing this?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: How long does this process take?\nExplainer: Well, because people who really need to use these subdivision services for everything, people who worked hard over the years to make this super, super fast. In fact, subdivision services were invented basically at Pixar. There's this guy, Ed Capel, and he was harshly responsible for one of the most famous kinds of subdivision surfaces called Capel Clark subdivision surfaces. And in fact recently won the touring award for these subdivision services.\n","477":"Explainer: Because I want to draw a smooth curve on the screen, but all my computer can do is draw straight lines.

So that's really nice, right? It's saving you a lot of work, but the downside is you lose a lot of control. So because the only thing you're describing is this short little program, you don't have complete control over how this is gonna end up. And so adding more controllability to procedural graphics is something people have been thinking about for many years. So how has our conversation changed your understanding of what fractals are all about?\n","478":"Explainer: So you're a student in high school, is that right?\nExplainee: Yes, I'm a sophomore.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: How does like all of the networks in my house connect to all the city networks?\nExplainer: Wow. Great question. Often, it's a little blue wire called an ethernet cable. So that cable is able to bring bits of information up into your apartment at say, a billion bits per second.

I always like to think of the internet by analogy to say road systems for example, where you have roads in your neighborhood. You have state roads, you have the Interstate Highway System. And so the internet is a lot like that. It's an interconnection of local roads, local networks like the network in your house for example.\nExplainee: How does like all of the networks in my house connect to all the city networks?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: You could FaceTime somebody who's like in Australia.

And so most applications would like to connect you with a server that's close to you.

They're relatively homogenous, but when it came to more complex foods, like broccoli, or deformable foods, like tofu, that can crumble, that gets a lot more complex to simulate.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Right.\nExplainer: What algorithms do you think are most promising for handling non-rigid deformable objects and the other things you've been looking at?\n","484":"Explainer: How can we get robots to learn more efficiently or learn faster?\nExplainee: From my experience, it's a matter of how much support you give the, like, robot when it's learning. One could be like a narrower task range. Another is maybe like also biasing the types of samples that you're collecting can bias towards interactions that are gonna be useful where the hands actually interact with each other, rather than just off doing their own things. What have you found to be like your go-tos between the different styles?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: It's similar to like skill transfer style of things, because some skills are just repeatable. Like if I know how to pick up a cylinder, then maybe I know also how to pick up a mug.\nExplainer: Yeah. So you may not transfer the exact strategy or the exact policy that the robot takes, but you should be able to learn some general heuristics about performing manipulation.\n","485":"Explainer: Yeah. So you may not transfer the exact strategy or the exact policy that the robot takes, but you should be able to learn some general heuristics about performing manipulation.\nExplainee: There's this gap between the simulators that we have now and what we actually experience in reality. So what do you think are promising directions to try out for actually making our simulations match reality more closely?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: So when you say building simulators that don't rely on first principles, are you saying like, kind of like a learn simulator? We have all these videos of humans interacting with the world, and that can be your, like, physics data that you then use to inform when you're building a simulator, that's learning based on those videos.\nExplainer: Exactly. I think we can use machine learning to learn about physics and to build these kinds of physics simulators.\n","486":"Explainer: So great to see you, Michael. Thanks for coming.\nExplainee: It's my pleasure.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: It's funny because I'm kind of at the heart, a developmental psychologist. And so when we talk about babies, a lot of what we're talking about is how they become human. I started to try to build computer models of little tiny bits of babies cognition. And I would ask people, and they'd say, You have to assume that you can recognize objects, because actually recognizing objects is impossible. And I was like, 'Wait, it's impossible? What about AI?' And they're like, 'That's, that's really hard.'\nExplainer: Why do you think it's so hard to build these things into AI systems and robots?\n","487":"Explainer: I like that description, because it conveys how much complexity there is to these really basic tasks that we're doing. Is there a definition for the simple tasks that we do versus things that are more complex, like playing chess?\nExplainee: I guess I like to think about this hierarchical cascade, where, at first, vision starts with the sensory signal and parses it into gradually more complex units. I think it does make sense to talk about lower level, meaning closer to sensation and perception and action, and higher level meaning more deliberative, more mediated by memory and language and judgment.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Our impression that it's purely discrete and symbolic might be, just that might be an impression, because we talk about it in a language. And actually, the fact that it's connected up to all these perception and sensation and action systems means that it's probably grounded in a more continuous set of representations. I wonder, is there gonna be a point where what you really want to know is what are the experiences that a human has? [indistinct] human speech own project. His idea was, 'Well, I need the exact data that my son gets in order to train my robot to be like my son.' Or do you think that we're gonna end up in a world that's more like the large language models and that'll have to do?\nExplainer: I suspect that we'll start by doing whatever is most convenient, 'cause that's whatever we can get. But I think that for robots to be capable alongside humans, in a world with humans, I think that we may need to actually use human experience, human learning, to inform how robots learn, if we want them to follow the same kind of mistake pattern as humans, so that humans can interpret robots, and humans can understand what robots will and will not do.\n","488":"Explainer: Cool. What do you think of when you hear the words quantum sensing?\nExplainee: I think that using some sort of quantum computing to sense some quantum level molecules or particles, like interactions and stuff, maybe.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Okay.\nExplainer: We believe quantum mechanics tells us what the true laws of physics are, and so a quantum sensor, in that sense, would reach the limits of what's attainable.\n","489":"Explainer: It would be the top tier.\nExplainee: What are you doing? Like, what are you studying?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Okay.\nExplainer: Which is a really nice platform because the spins show their quantum properties, even at room temperature.\n","490":"Explainer: Which is a really nice platform because the spins show their quantum properties, even at room temperature.\nExplainee: So, are you studying the spins of the electrons?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: So you mentioned the diamonds that are used to create the sensors.\nExplainer: Right.\n","491":"Explainer: So you can implant nitrogen into a diamond and then you bombard it with electrons to create the vacancies and then you heat it up and anneal it, and then you get these nitrogen-vacancy centers in your system. So you mentioned quantum computing earlier. So have you heard of the idea of superposition?\nExplainee: Mm-hmm, yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Okay, so it's like using like, the quantum computer would be kind of like the base level and then like you take it out into the world and see how like it differs?\nExplainer: So rather than trying to build a lot of complex algorithms and gates with it, what you do is, you take these quantum bits and you take them out into the world and say, what do you see? What are you sensitive to? So you can use an idea called entanglement to make an even more sensitive quantum sensor, but it's even more fragile. So there's always this trade-off between being super fragile and being super sensitive at the same time.\n","492":"Explainer: So that's in some ways the key to both quantum sensing, as well as quantum computing. It's the idea that you can take a system and put it in a superposition of two states. Normally we think of classically a bit can be a zero or a one. So switch is either on or off. Whereas in a quantum system, it can be in what's called a superposition. So it can be partially on and partially off. But one of the challenges with quantum systems is that these superpositions are really hard to maintain because we don't see superpositions in the world around us. In quantum computing, you try really hard to isolate everything so that you can maintain this quantum property and the fact that it's actually going to lose its quantum properties as it interacts with the world also makes it a great sensor because now you're actually, you're using that fact that it's interacting with the world to say, wait, it's sensing something.\nExplainee: Okay, so it's like using like, the quantum computer would be kind of like the base level and then like you take it out into the world and see how like it differs?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: How does entanglement work into it?\nExplainer: So entanglement is the idea that two particles are correlated. They're essentially in the same quantum state, so that you can't disturb one particle without disturbing the second particle. And so, if I have a large number of quantum sensors that are entangled, then they're all going to interact much more strongly than if I just had one of them interact at a time.\n","493":"Explainer: It's more precise, Absolutely.\nExplainee: Okay. Is an atomic clock a quantum sensor?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Okay, that's really cool.\nExplainer: So some ways, you know, when atomic clocks were designed and built, we didn't necessarily think of GPS, but technology often works that way is that, there are new discoveries and then someone else comes along and says, hey, this is a great tool for some other application.\n","494":"Explainer: What's your name?\nExplainee: Namina.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Seeing, hearing, tasting and smelling.\nExplainer: Mm-hmm.\n","495":"Explainer: Mm-hmm.\nExplainee: Yeah, and touch.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: No, I don't think so.

The only mechanism that we know for sure can form black holes is to collapse of very massive stars. So it's sensible to think, well maybe some very massive stars in a young universe collapsed under their own weight and then they merged and after some time they got big enough, but the black holes from stars can be tens of times the mass of the sun, maybe hundreds of times to the mass of the sun if they merge. To get to millions and billions, and if you just do the simple arithmetic of how many years that would take, there aren't enough years in the 14 billion years of the universe's lifetime. So they must have come from somewhere else.\n","503":"Explainer: Yeah, and probably nobody is. Have you heard a lot in your studies about these super massive black holes that we think lurk in the centers of very nearly every galaxy?\nExplainee: So, I think the prevailing wisdom for a while was no, but my answer honestly is I'm not sure.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: So I don't study AGN a lot, but I do have a long term interest in black holes, it's one of the reasons I entered the field. I always was curious about how a black hole of that size was able to form. Was it the result of mergers between smaller black holes, ultimately creating gravitational well deep enough to contract a protogenic disc for a whole galaxy? Or, man, what happened?\nExplainer: Yeah, I think that's right. I think people are really perplexed about how you make something so big in such a short period of time. It's kind of funny, the bigger you make a black hole, it seems maybe counterintuitive, but the less dense the material has to be out of which you make it. So you can, out of something the density almost of air, you can make a supermassive black hole. You can't make a star out of that, but weirdly, if you skip the star phase altogether, it's conceivable that they directly collapse. And so there's suddenly a new way to make black holes that nature has figured out.\n","504":"Explainer: [Janna] Yeah.\nExplainee: We spend all of our time, when we learn about black holes in school, predominantly through star collapse.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: I didn't even realize that there was an alternate route to creating a black hole.\nExplainer: Can you tell us about Andromeda?\n","505":"Explainer: Yes, they're all friends.\nExplainee: Gravitationally, all friends.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: And Andromeda is one of the few galaxies that is traveling towards us and do for a merger event at some point.

But given a sufficiently high velocity, we will have some crazy black hole interactions and some crazy star interactions.\nExplainer: Yeah, and it's very possible that as you said, the collision won't be so severe that it'll be very disruptive. So our entire solar system could stay intact and here we would go with the sun and all the other planets in orbit around a new black hole.\n","506":"Explainer: But when we do merge with Andromeda, presumably our black holes will merge and Andromeda indeed has a very big black hole as well at its center.

And especially with cloud computing, exploiting the power of the cloud to enable zero-knowledge proofs, and to make use of zero-knowledge proofs, would be amazing.\nExplainee: Yeah. Absolutely.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Yeah.\nExplainer: So can we take that power that's there in the cryptography, and use it to somehow help with the tremendous level of mistrust\n","512":"Explainer: It'd be great to just start by talking about your work at the broadest level. To my mind your work has really revolutionized the field of cognitive neuroscience more broadly.\nExplainee: I've been really interested in how past understandings of the brain have really focused on, on pinpointing exactly what each piece of the brain does. But I think that there's also a broader conversation happening in the brain, which is between one region and another. So it's actually the pattern of connections between these regions that would allow for the flow of information. But I think the tools that have become widely available now from the physics community and mathematics and computer science are under the umbrella of, of network science. So that is a science of networks, a science of understanding how bits of a system are interconnected with one another. Not just comparing two groups of people or two kinds of two species, but we can ask even within a single person, how does the pattern of connectivity in my brain change as we talk with one another? How does the information flow change? I think a lot about traffic on roadway networks as a good example of this. Which is, you know, we can understand where the roads are and perhaps the roads are relatively fixed. They change over long timescales and it's similar to the brain. We really only create large scale connections over long timescales. But we can alter the traffic on the roadways really easily. And that's similar to what we do in the brain is that we change the way that information is flowing to allow us to respond to our environment.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: The field is definitely opening up in the kinds of questions that can be asked now with these approaches. And I think what you're pointing out is that conceptually it's where we wanted to go anyway. So if there's so much orchestration that happens and a symphony is not a single piece, it's not a single pattern of, of harmony between instruments and, and similar to the brain, symphony of your brain is not a single pattern. It's a very dynamically changing pattern.\nExplainer: In the field we often talk of have having a mental model that we use to make predictions about what's about to happen and really use that to mean kind of a general understanding of what's going on. What does that look like in terms that come from your world of like the configuration of, of a circuit?\n","513":"Explainer: We now think of the hippocampus so much in terms of memory but really some of the earliest work in neuroscience on the hippocampus talked about the role of the hippocampus in spatial navigation. And it really exposed I think one of the deepest questions in memory research, or at least from the neuroscience perspective is like, well what is the connection? What is the connection between spatial processing and memory? And why is it that neurons in the hippocampus when an animal is navigating a maze, why is it that there's spatial specialization there? I really do think that this notion of a mental model, a generative model is where those, where memory and space meet.\nExplainee: That makes a lot of sense. And I think that it makes me wonder how we think about places in the abstract, what is a cognitive place, right? And what is, how do we map out the cognitive spaces that we, that our mind moves within in the same way or in a similar way to the spaces that we physically walk in. But I think it opens a lot up, a lot of questions about how individuals make their own maps, right? And then how the way that they choose to make that map will then affect the way that they may respond in the future to a new context or environment.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Which is actually really interesting because you can make different maps in different physical spaces too, right? As you walk into a new room you make a new map of that room. So what are the doorways basically for mental models? And I think that often we sort of fall into this pattern of, of thinking about memory as, as always additive, that we always just keep gathering more information and update what we currently have. We don't as often speak about deleting pieces of information or, or perceptions or something that we thought was a, was a useful fact but actually it's not a fact.\nExplainer: Memories as models or models first and memory as part of what helps build the model starts generating new predictions. Exactly the kind you just brought up or other ways of thinking about things because an efficient model needs to let go of information, right? I just heard a colleague of mine joking about the fact that the principles of neuroscience textbook keeps growing and growing. And that if we had enough strength in theoretical neuroscience, if our models of neuroscience were good enough, that book should shrink back. We know that memory retrieval is essentially construction. And so you don't need to store all those separate memories. You need to construct them. But if you have a good model, let go of all those details and just construct them to feel as if it's a memory. But really all you're doing is using the model to fill the details. It's kind of like the matrix, you know.\n","514":"Explainer: Memories as models or models first and memory as part of what helps build the model starts generating new predictions.

I think getting your behavior in there somewhere seems, seems important. But also is it just a record of the past or is it, you know, our perceptions of, of what happened in the past, or how we've changed how we think about that past event or have we deleted that event completely and then gathered this higher level structure or mental model that then allows us to behave differently in the future? So it's more alive, it's more changing. It's more, I think it's bubbling out and gathering, gathering and growing and becoming more flexible, but it's also sort of bubbling in, in the sense of deleting and removing and forgetting. So yes, I think that what we need to add perhaps is that changeability and perhaps the behavioral relevance of that changeability. I don't know, what do you think?\nExplainer: I agree. I think, you know, as you were speaking I was thinking maybe the most important word to replace there is record. Record implies an etching of something as it was. And maybe what we need instead is that it's a model, it's an approximation, it's an abstraction that can help us create the illusion of constructing your record. But that it's the model that's the important thing that drives the whole thing.\n","515":"Explainer: Have you ever heard of zero-knowledge proofs?\nExplainee: Only in passing.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Will I, like, understand that it's true because like, you know, the operations performed in the proof are like, of a certain, like, you know, they have like, certain attributes that would make them true?\nExplainer: What you're basically asking is, wait, what? Right? Right. So this is what makes zero-knowledge proof so fascinating, and so counter-intuitive. And I think the best way I can explain it to you is by means of an example.

It turns out I can take that statement that I have at least 0.2 Bitcoins, and convert it into a map of countries. And that map of countries will be three-colorable like this only if you have at least 0.2 Bitcoins.\n","517":"Explainer: All right. Sounds good. Right? Here we have green, right? And over here, we have blue. Okay. And as you can see, they're two different colors.\nExplainee: Mm-hmm.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Yeah.\nExplainer: Right? So now, of course, one way to get more confidence is to open up more of them for you, but that would be revealing information to you. I don't wanna do that. So instead, I'm gonna ask you to please turn around. And now, let's change up these colors. Can you pick two countries at random and we'll reveal two of the colors again.\n","518":"Explainer: Right? So you have a little bit of confidence, right, that I have managed to color this correctly. but not that much confidence. 'Cause I've only shown you two of the countries.\nExplainee: Yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: I'll take this one and this one.\nExplainer: Nice.

So what we've done is we've made it impossible for you to put the pieces together. And if you do this, let's say, a thousand times. And if I correctly showed you different colors, each thousand times, you'd be really convinced. And that's it. That's the entire zero-knowledge proof.\n","520":"Explainer: But as you'll see, now it's not green, it's blue. And this one on the other hand, is green. Okay.

Normally we think okay, well if you have two lines like this, you'd keep drawing them, they intersect right here. But in projective space, two parallel lines will also intersect at the point at infinity. Infinity is like this perfect concept for what we can add to a space that allows lines to have this more uniform property. What's your research in?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Yeah, it's basically this idea that you can put a choice function on any set.\nExplainer: And a choice function does what exactly?\n","523":"Explainer: And a choice function does what exactly?\nExplainee: Yeah, that's a good question.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Yeah, I've used it like that. I've also used it in Zorn's lemma and in the well ordering principle.\nExplainer: So there are three well-known famous equivalent forms of the axiom of choice. The well ordering principle is the assumption, the axiom that any set can be well ordered, but there are lots of subsets of real numbers that do not have a minimal element. So that ordering is not a well ordering. So here's the key question. Do you believe the axiom of choice?\n","524":"Explainer: So the way I think about it is if you have an infinite or an arbitrary family of sets and you know for sure that none of these sets are empty, then a choice function would allow you to select an element from each set sort of all at once. When you've used the axiom of choice in proofs, do you know which incarnation of this you've used?\nExplainee: Yeah, I've used it like that. I've also used it in Zorn's lemma and in the well ordering principle.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: I do believe the axiom of choice.\nExplainer: You do believe the axiom of choice, though it leads us to some strange conclusions. So if the axiom choice is true, then it's necessarily the case that there exists a well ordering of the reals. And what that means is that we can perform induction over real numbers like we perform induction over the natural numbers. This is trans-finite induction. It would work for any ordinal. So there must be some uncountably infinite ordinal that represents the order type of the real numbers. And this allows us to prove some crazy things. Imagine three-dimensional Euclidean space. So the space that we live in, extending infinitely in all directions. So it is possible to completely cover three-dimensional Euclidean space by disjoint circles, so infinitesimal circles, disjoint circles of radius one. So what that means is you can put a circle somewhere in space and then put a second circle somewhere in space that can't intersect with the first one because these are solid circles and then another circle can somehow cover every single point in space with no gaps in between.\n","525":"Explainer: So there are three well-known famous equivalent forms of the axiom of choice.

Do you have a favorite consequence of the axiom of choice?\n","526":"Explainer: So there's certainly no stop to this procedure. But could you give a precise cardinality to that?\nExplainee: would be a set of all sets, right?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: So you're just making a cutoff point. You're saying we're never gonna get sets bigger than this anyway, so we might as well make our category only include things smaller than that.\nExplainer: That's right. So a rigorous way to work with a category of sets is to demand that it's a category of sets whose size is bounded by this cardinality, Alpha say. That is then an example of a category that fits into another even still larger Grothendieck universe Beta. So implicitly in a lot of my research, I have to add an additional assumption that there exists maybe countably many inaccessible cardinals.\n","527":"Explainer: Talk us through Hawking's initial revolution that led to a lot of these conversations about the information around black holes.\nExplainee: Hawking's big insight was that he had to apply both the rules of quantum mechanics and the rules of gravity to really understand how black holes behaved. But Hawking took a point of view where he brought quantum mechanics into the game. He really that if you took that into account, that it's actually not quite true that black holes are black, that actually things can escape from black holes.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: A way to think about Hawking radiation is to imagine that pairs of particles and antiparticles appear out of the quantum vacuum and the particle can escape the black hole, but the antiparticle falls in. But the particle and antiparticle are a pair and if the antiparticle really falls into the black hole and is destroyed at the singularity, that poor particle outside the black hole has lost his partner. It also violates the rules of quantum mechanics. If you have two particles that are entangled, that has to be preserved.\nExplainer: Now, to be clear, nobody disputes that black holes will quantum radiate, that Hawking radiation is a solid prediction. The black holes should in fact evaporate, that's not disputed, right?\n","528":"Explainer: Now, to be clear, nobody disputes that black holes will quantum radiate, that Hawking radiation is a solid prediction. The black holes should in fact evaporate, that's not disputed, right?\nExplainee: That's right. It would be wonderful if we could have some experimental of evidence for this, if we could really build a black hole in the lab and test to see whether it behaves this way. But I think there is hope that we'll be able to detect some of these effects either indirectly, by looking at black holes out in the universe, or also maybe indirectly in the laboratory by looking at systems which aren't black holes, but which radiate in kind of similar ways.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: The pursuit of quantum gravity has taken us to places we never expected to be. I think what's exciting about physics, about theoretical physics, that you start following a thread, you start developing a chain of logic, and you never know where it's gonna end up.\nExplainer: Do you think there's ever a hope that the kind of information that you think about, the quantum gravity aspects of the universe that you think about, whether it will pan out or not, will ever be viably observed in these astronomical pursuits of the event horizon?\n","529":"Explainer: Do you think there's ever a hope that the kind of information that you think about, the quantum gravity aspects of the universe that you think about, whether it will pan out or not, will ever be viably observed in these astronomical pursuits of the event horizon?\nExplainee: It's a real challenge, but astronomical observations have gotten so fantastically precise. And there is some hope that if you looked at things like two black holes merging, each black hole comes in with its own event horizon, but then when the black holes merge, there's a very complicated process where these two event horizons merge and oscillate and vibrate, and then settle down into a single event horizon for the final black hole. There is some hope that if we can make sufficiently detailed observations of this process, if we could really see the way the event horizon is behaving as it settles down to this final state, that maybe that could reveal some of these quantum effects that we've been talking about.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Yeah, it's a spectacular process.\n","530":"Explainer: Have you heard of fractals before?\nExplainee: No, absolutely not.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Yes.\nExplainer: Right?

And that's why you get turbulence at all different scales.\n","550":"Explainer: Or you don't even need computers. Like I remember when I was a kid, I played electric guitar and I had all these guitar pedals with different effects and oh, what happens if you put the output back in the input and just run it through itself, you're gonna start hearing this kind of fractal sound, right? So today we've been telling people, fractals are things that are somehow self-similar, they have detail at all scales. Are there other ways you might introduce fractals to somebody or are there other things you might say, this is what a fractal is?\nExplainee: And I think that's one of the things that's exciting about it.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: I think you could get to the reasons why does a coastline look like a coastline at all different scales? It's because the forces of nature tend to work similarly at all different scales. And it's those forces that are doing very, very simple things over and over and over again that are constantly creating the sense of detail.\nExplainer: Yeah.\n","551":"Explainer: Yeah.\nExplainee: Yeah I actually actually remember the moment when I finally figured out how to make turbulence in computer graphics, I was working for this company, Maggi and Disney was working on a movie. I think it was weird science where they wanted to have a marble vase. And then about three in the morning, I was at a diner nearby and I was pouring the cream into the coffee and I was watching it and I started watching it swirl around. And I realized that what was happening was really simple that you had this line of cream and then it hits the cup and it folds and then the folds get caught up. And then that folds again. And it's a really simple process of folding within folding. And I just went to the computer and did that.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: And things look like marble and looked like flame. And they looked like clouds and they look like you just keep using those simple techniques\nExplainer: You know, behave the way that nature does.\n","552":"Explainer: Yeah.\nExplainee: And then you get it all.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: But I think it's this point that that point with the coffee is important because the forces we're operating at one scale, they're operating at the scale of the coffee cup. But over time they kept making details that were smaller and smaller. Process at one scale, plus time you get fractals.\nExplainer: [Keenan] Come out of nowhere.\n","553":"Explainer: [Keenan] Right?\nExplainee: And when everybody understands scaling.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Scaling is a simple thing yeah.\nExplainer: People outside of computer graphics and engineering and science and so forth have also thought a lot about and used fractals as a language for talking about nature, for characterizing shapes and behaviors and so forth tissue or friction, or all sorts of really important phenomena. Do you think that computer graphics has kind of dropped the ball in terms of saying, you know, this is not something that's exciting anymore to work on procedural descriptions and we're, we're moving on from that?\n","554":"Explainer: Now you work on kind of the future of virtual reality and augmented reality and extended reality. But it's kind of interesting because I think if I think about exploring these infinite fractal landscapes in some way, they still feel a little bit lonely or they feel a little bit poor of the kind of richness that we have in the real world.\nExplainee: Scaling is a simple thing yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: This is where machine learning starts coming in, because you can start saying, okay, this is a very, very rich virtual world, but it's informed by, you know, my favorite mountains that I saw in Italy once. So you can start training these fractal worlds on things about the real world that have particular emotional resonance for us.\nExplainer: Right? Lazy evaluation, we love being lazy in computer graphics.\n","555":"Explainer: Absolutely.\nExplainee: Well, it's also, it's not even possible to explore, to store an entire world in your computer.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: You wanna be able to sort of generate it on the fly. I'm looking forward to things getting better. We're not there yet.\nExplainer: So- He made a lot of happy little trees.\n","556":"Explainer: So- He made a lot of happy little trees.\nExplainee: I think in that case, it came down to the fact that Ken in particular had a mission to make accessible tools for people without sacrificing the power and the richness of making beautiful things. I mean, in a sense he was kind of the computer graphic, Bob Ross. You know? So- \nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Which, I mean, when you, when you think about the techniques of somebody like a Bob Ross they're fractal.\nExplainer: Yeah it's really part of human nature or human's connection to nature. Yeah.\n","557":"Explainer: What do you know about memory?\nExplainee: I know when you see something you could like kind of like picture it, like in your head you can imagine it. I remember yesterday I got like orange juice, but let's say like a year or two, you might think like, oh, that day I got water.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Let's say you grew up in a place that the orange juice is just meh, and then you go on vacation going somewhere and then it might change how you feel about orange juice.\nExplainer: Sometimes, you know, memory is doing something much simpler but no less important for us, which is it's helping us figure out what's good and what's bad. And if we can remember what's good and what's bad from what we did in the past, that can help us make decisions about what to do next time. So Dylan, you may be surprised to learn this, but we asked your mom what some of your favorite candies are. So you have to make a decision between these two candies and whichever one you pick, you actually get to take with you.\n","558":"Explainer: And on one hand memory is like a record of something that happened in the past that we can carry with us and we can like bring it back to mind. And on the other hand we need to be a little bit suspicious sometimes because we might get it wrong. In what world would that memory of the orange juice maybe be useful?\nExplainee: Let's say you grew up in a place that the orange juice is just meh, and then you go on vacation going somewhere and then it might change how you feel about orange juice.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: I wish I could say both, but I guess I'll go with pixie sticks.\nExplainer: There you go, there is your decision. Okay, you can take those. It took you some time there. You looked like you were really working hard at that problem. And that's interesting because actually we know that from research that when people have to make a decision between two things they like equally, some people like economists think oh those are the easiest decisions because they're both good options. But as psychologists and neuroscientists we know it's the opposite. One of the reasons is because there's no simple answer of like I know that one's better I'm just gonna go with it. And so we think that that's the kind of decision where memory is especially important because you have to kind of come up with more information.\n","559":"Explainer: Sometimes, you know, memory is doing something much simpler but no less important for us, which is it's helping us figure out what's good and what's bad.

And you don't know.\nExplainer: Everything you just said is exactly what we know from research. All the thoughts running through your mind, were really at kind of about a prediction into the future, right? You're like, how, how will this taste if, when it's in my mouth or how will I feel about my decision down the road? You know we think of memory as something in the past, but it's an example of how you use your memories of these two candies to predict what's gonna happen in the future so that you can make a decision in the present. But you did it, you made your way through that torture. And now you've got to keep the candy.\n","560":"Explainer: What's your favorite subject?\nExplainee: I'd say math. Some of the small problems can actually be really big and complicated. It's like a puzzle.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Yeah.\nExplainer: So what do you see in this photo?\n","561":"Explainer: I know where it is, but I don't wanna tell you. Do you believe me? You're not sure to believe me. Right?\nExplainee: Yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: I see the puffin.\nExplainer: So when you look at this board, we don't know where the photo was, right? Was the photo like with the corner here? In which case the puffin would be all the way at this side. Or was the photo with the corner here? In which case the puffin would be on the other side. So this is a really simple example of a zero-knowledge proof. I convinced you that I knew where the puffin was, but you didn't learn anything else.\n","562":"Explainer: But what if I could prove to you that I know where the puffin is without revealing to you where it is? Let me show you. I took that photo that we showed you. And I put it behind this poster here. Why don't you go take a look through that hole?\nExplainee: I see the puffin.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Why do you study zero-knowledge proof?\nExplainer: When I first learned about them, I just thought they were so cool.

That's what it's called.\nExplainee: Yeah. yeah, I haven't heard of it before.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Yeah, I did work with robots, but they weren't doing like artificial intelligence type of stuff. We were just sending like instructions and the robot would do, like, perform like a simple task. I wasn't so used to the aspect of, like, teaching computer how to do stuff. So I'm always on that other end of like giving instructions, more focused on the data analysis and machine learning aspect of it.\nExplainer: And how would you just describe machine learning, like in one sentence?\n","567":"Explainer: Do you have any thoughts on like what the data might look like in a robotic setting, if you were to apply machine learning to robots?\nExplainee: I think of like coordinates.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: I don't think so.

So I don't have a strong view on it, but I do think it's an interesting question.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: That's where the excitement lies, is when we really start to leverage having, you know, access to individual quantum degrees of freedom, whether that's a single photon or a single spin and in principle then, you could also imagine entangling it and you know, doing some quantum computations on it in order to make it an even better sensor.\nExplainer: So do you think there's a maximum number of spins you can have if I think about a single NV as a register?\n","569":"Explainer: Right.\nExplainee: But I don't know that there's necessarily a limit. I mean, it keeps expanding. I mean, I think that there are some groups that are able to identify, you know, 30, 40 individual nuclear spins around a single electron and control 10 or 15 of them.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: That's another great question. A couple of groups actually that are working on trying to read out the spin state of NV centers electrically, instead of optically. If you could do that, then you could pack a whole lot more into a smaller space using tiny electrodes.\nExplainer: Right.\n","570":"Explainer: Yeah.\nExplainee: And that I think is gonna make real breakthroughs in the next 10 years, is the fact that we're just having this much larger group of scientists.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","571":"Explainer: What does infinity mean to you?\nExplainee: Really anything that has no end to it.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: What do you mean by that?\nExplainer: Adding infinities. Multiplying infinities. And there's a sense in which it's very similar to the arithmetic that you learned about already. But it's also totally different. It has some very weird properties. Welcome to Hilbert's Hotel. Unlike an ordinary hotel, has accountably infinitely many rooms.

The rooms each have a number, and even though there's infinitely many rooms, each room is only a finite distance away. So here's how we're gonna make room for the new guest.

So now I'm gonna make this story a little more complex. That there's another Hilbert's Hotel down the street and they're having plumbing issues and we need to find room for them.\n","573":"Explainer: Room number one. Exactly.

I mean, basically, software-defined networking exists, let's say within a single provider backbone, or a single cloud provider's network or a single campus. There's been some work on doing it at the juncture points between a pair of networks. But one other trend that's happening that makes it more possible is it used to be that to get from one end to the internet to the other, you have access networks getting much closer to, say Google or Microsoft or other large cloud providers, where even, you might only go through two networks\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Right, exactly. And if you take that even further, they're starting to be more edge computing where you might imagine you might have a cell tower connected to a small number of routers, connected directly to a server that's gonna be running the application.

It's often possible, still, to know a fair amount about what people are doing, even if you can't look inside the envelope at the letter that's written.\nExplainer: I mean, even you could just tell that two people are communicating even though the traffic itself is encrypted.

It's both the high bandwidth, it's the low delay so that you can have these applications that interact with the physical world and need answers in real-time.

SDN and softwarization is a maybe a little bit behind the covers, that you wouldn't normally see it as a user going from 3G to 4G to 5G. You just see an increase in speed. But yet, the way the network is now being managed again, I think is bringing the cellular networking world sort of into the internet world in terms of the softwarization-\n","590":"Explainer: You know, we've had cellular networks now for 20, 30 years.

It's both the high bandwidth, it's the low delay so that you can have these applications that interact with the physical world and need answers in real-time. It's about having the compute really close so that you can integrate computation and communication. It's about having more coverage.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Completely agree. I think the bringing in of compute and storage is important too. I think when you think just about networking, it really is often just one part of the IT, the information technology ecosystem. Is there's often compute and storage as well. And so, I think now there's an opportunity to have all of those parts of the infrastructure work together towards an even higher level goal.

It stands for Laser Interferometric Gravitational-Waves Observatory and the design was incredibly difficult and they didn't know if they would succeed. I think of the instrument as like the body of the electric guitar. And then they take the readout of the motions of the waves that they're recording, just like that guitar is recording the motions of the waves on the string. Now just play it like a little bit. And you can't hear anything, right? You're not meant to hear an electric guitar when it's not plugged in. What's happening is the guitar strings are ringing, but so quietly that we can't actually hear the sound. And this is like the gravitational waves, which are ringing the drum of spacetime, but so quietly that they're not move the air and we're not hearing them. So now play and I'm gonna turn the volume up a little bit. While I can't actually hear the ringing of the strings themselves, I can hear the data of the shape of the string recorded and played through this amplifier. And that's kind of the idea behind the LIGO instrument.\n","592":"Explainer: So a lot of times stars are born together in two star systems and when they die, if they're heavy enough, they will collapse under their own weight and form a black hole. So here you have a black hole and a big fluffy star. And what will happen is it'll start to tear apart its neighboring star. Literally parts of the star will begin to spill onto the black hole and splatter on the black hole. But let's say both those stars formed black holes. And what these black holes do is they are like mallets on a drum. They create literally waves in the shape of spacetime as they're moving. So imagine mallets on a drum, how the drum ripples. Depending on how the mallets are moving you hear different sounds. So effectively these black holes, as they get very close together in the final stages of their life together, they're orbiting each other at hundreds of times a second. It's this really crazy event, but it's happening in complete darkness. Eventually they bobble together and they merge and then they wring out, the spacetime's going crazy around them, it's this storm in spacetime, and they settle down to a quiet black hole. Then those waves that they created travel through the universe, basically undisturbed. For a long time people thought, well, even if black holes are out there, they're impossible to observe. And then they got very clever. You might wonder how we could possibly hear black holes, that sounds crazy. So I'm gonna show you, but I'm gonna need your help. This demo involves an electric guitar. Do you play at all?\nExplainee: A little bit?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: How do you know that it's like the black hole that's making this sound and nothing else?\nExplainer: It's a great question. If I didn't see you playing the guitar, I would recognize the sound of a guitar. And even if I had never heard of a guitar before I could figure out the frequencies that the string was playing, I could tell how strongly it had been plucked, and I could tell the length of it and where it was pinned down from the harmonics of the string. And I can tell the different lengths of the strings from the notes that they play. So I can actually reconstruct the instrument that's playing it. And it's very similar to LIGO, we can listen to the notes, the amplitude, the harmonics, and we can deduce the size and shape of the objects doing that. And they're very massive and they're very small and they have all the markings of a black hole.\n","593":"Explainer: Calculus involves the study of functions. Functions are one of the most fundamental concepts in mathematics, but they aren't always so clearly defined. What would you say a function is?\nExplainee: I would say a function is a procedure that takes an input and does some operation and returns an output.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: How can you compare something that is endless?\nExplainer: Today we're gonna think about infinity as a cardinality, which is a technical term for a number that could be a size of a set. And we're gonna use this idea of one-to-one correspondence to try and investigate the question of whether all infinite sets have the same size. So what I've drawn here are some pictures of some of the infinite sets that appear in mathematics. So the natural numbers are the prototypical example of an infinite set. So the natural numbers are clearly a subset of the integers. Both of these are infinite sets. Are they the same size infinity or different size infinities?\n","594":"Explainer: I'm gonna now try and convince you that they are in fact the same size infinity. And this is using this idea of a one-to-one correspondence which was applied in this context by Georg Cantor. What he says is if we can match up the elements of the integers with the elements of the natural numbers so that there's nothing left over, so that there's a bijective function between them, then that's a proof that there's exactly as many natural numbers as there are integers. Start by matching zero with zero and one with one. But then we wanna include the negatives in the list. So which natural number would we match with negative one?\nExplainee: Maybe two.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: All of the positive integers would be odd numbers and all of the negative integers would be even numbers?\nExplainer: Great. So now I have a much harder question. So we have the same challenge, again, evidently there are way, way, way more rational numbers than there are integers. Does that mean this is a larger infinite set than the integers? What do you think?\n","595":"Explainer: Maybe two. Why not? Because now we're starting to make progress on matching all the negatives. We can match the natural number three with the integer two, the natural number four with the integer minus two. And do you see a pattern?\nExplainee: All of the positive integers would be odd numbers and all of the negative integers would be even numbers?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: By intuition I would say yes, but that was the same case with the integers. I would imagine there might be some bijective function for mapping natural numbers to rational numbers.\nExplainer: So I'm going to use this picture to count the rational numbers by actually counting the elements of this larger set because it'll be clearer geometrically. What I've drawn in this picture is the integer lattice. So Z cross Z refers to the set of all of these dots. So I'll start by counting the number at the origin, and you can see I'm just labeling the dots around the origin, moving in a counterclockwise fashion and getting progressively further away. And this process could continue, but maybe by now you see the pattern, though it'd be a little bit difficult to describe as a function.\n","596":"Explainer: Great.

And now for each pair of integers, I'm gonna represent it by a corresponding natural number. That's what's going on with this counting. And when I compose those operations, what I've done is I've encoded rational numbers as natural numbers in a way that reveals that they can be no larger, there are no more rational numbers than natural numbers.\n","597":"Explainer: So I'm going to use this picture to count the rational numbers by actually counting the elements of this larger set because it'll be clearer geometrically.

That's exactly right. So we were hoping to compare the size of infinity of the rational numbers with the size of infinity of the natural numbers. What we've done is introduced an intermediate set, these pair of integer points, and this proves that this size of infinity is smaller than this size of infinity. Since we also have an injective function the other way, this size of infinity is smaller than this size of infinity so therefore they must be the same size.\n","598":"Explainer: Yeah, that's exactly right.

This is called the cardinality of the continuum, it is uncountable. What I'm going to do now is form a new real number that I guarantee is not on this list. Okay, so here's how we do this. What I'm gonna do is I'm gonna look at the diagonal elements. So I'll highlight them. This continues forever, and now I'm going to form a new real number by changing all of these.\n","600":"Explainer: Now there's one final collection of numbers that we haven't yet discussed, which are the real numbers, all of the points on the number line.

On the one hand there are infinite sets that feel very different like the natural numbers, the integers, the rational numbers that nevertheless have the same size or the same infinite cardinality. While there are other infinities that are larger. So there's more than one size of infinity, not all infinities are created equal.\n","602":"Explainer: Great. That's exactly right. So what we've proven is that this number is missing, and therefore it is impossible to define a bijection between the natural numbers and the real numbers.\nExplainee: Oh wow.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: I was wondering what the kind of practical implications are, what you can do with this sort of knowledge.\nExplainer: Really glad you asked me that. There's a practical implication for computer science. Alan Turing, he came up with a mathematical model of a computer, something called a Turing machine. So Turing was wondering is it possible to compute every real number, an arbitrary real number to within arbitrary precision in finite time? He defined a real number to be computable< if you could calculate its value, maybe not exactly, but as accurately as you'd like in a finite amount of time. And because there are uncountably infinitely many real numbers, but only a countably infinitely many Turing machines, what that means is that the vast majority of real numbers are uncomputable. So we'll never be able to access them with a computer program.\n","603":"Explainer: i have colleagues here that tell me it can take up to weeks to train certain neural networks right\nExplainee: Certainly, depending on the complexity of your model then computational speed is one thing.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Sure, yeah.\nExplainer: if you think about even just classical information like bits right at the end of the day when you store a bit in your hard drive there's a magnetic domain and you have a magnetic polarization right\n","604":"Explainer: and actually machine learning is one research direction where we're really hoping that we're going to find um key parts of the machine learning computation that can be sped up using quantum computing\nExplainee: Sure, yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: So in a classical computer, you know, you have all sorts of logical gates that perform operations and they change an input to some sort of output but I guess it's not immediately obvious how you do that with quantum computers.\nExplainer: you can change the magnetization to be pointing up or pointing down right quantum systems we're still manipulating a device and changing the quantum state of that of that device you can imagine if it's a spin that you could have spin up and spin down but you can also if you isolate it enough you can have a superposition of up and down\n","605":"Explainer: if you think about even just classical information like bits right at the end of the day when you store a bit in your hard drive there's a magnetic domain and you have a magnetic polarization right\nExplainee: So in a classical computer, you know, you have all sorts of logical gates that perform operations and they change an input to some sort of output but I guess it's not immediately obvious how you do that with quantum computers.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Sure.\nExplainer: so what we do when we try to solve problems with a quantum computer is we encode parts of the problem we're trying to solve into a complex quantum state and then we manipulate that state to drive it towards what will eventually represent the solution \n","606":"Explainer: you can change the magnetization to be pointing up or pointing down right quantum systems we're still manipulating a device and changing the quantum state of that of that device you can imagine if it's a spin that you could have spin up and spin down but you can also if you isolate it enough you can have a superposition of up and down\nExplainee: Sure.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Sure.\nExplainer: yeah that's a really good question this actually is a model of the inside of one of our quantum computers\n","607":"Explainer: yeah that's a really good question this actually is a model of the inside of one of our quantum computers\nExplainee: So how do we actually encode it to start with?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Okay.\nExplainer: yes exactly also through microwave signals\n","608":"Explainer: the key is to come up with algorithms where the result is deterministic\nExplainee: Okay.\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Interesting, so what do those algorithms look like?\nExplainer: yeah they also unfortunately require fault tolerance right now the algorithms that we know of today to do those things um on a quantum computer require you to have millions of error-corrected qubits today we're at like 50. it's actually amazing that we're at 50. there's things that we know or we have strong reason to believe um are going to be faster to do on a quantum computer and then there's things that we'll discover just by virtue of having one\n","609":"Explainer: there's sort of two main classes of quantum algorithms there's algorithms which were developed for decades right things like shore's algorithm which is for factoring grover's algorithm for unstructured search and these algorithms were designed assuming that you had a perfect fault tolerant quantum computer which is many decades away so we're currently in a phase where we're exploring what can we do with these near-term quantum computers and the answer is going to be well we need different kinds of algorithms to really even explore that question\nExplainee: Interesting, so what do those algorithms look like?\nExplainer: {missing part}\nExplainee: Yeah certainly having a search algorithm is very useful.

led you to become interested in music?","1":"That's a great observation. The overtone series is really fascinating, and it's a testament to the complexity and richness of sound. When you have a perfectly tuned chord, those extra tones that emerge are like an ethereal layer, almost like a hidden melody within the harmony. It's a beautiful phenomenon.","2":"But actually, the real magic happens when you start to play with the inversions of the chords. What I mean by that is, instead of just always playing the root of the chord on the bottom, you can actually put the third or the fifth in the bass, and that starts to create a whole different sensation and feeling.","3":"Okay, let me show you what I mean. Let's start with the F major triad - that's F, A, and C. Now, if I invert that, I can play A, C, and F. That changes the quality of the chord, but it's still based on the same notes. Let me play through that for you.","4":"So this is an A flat major seven chord. It's a pretty rich, full chord.","5":"Wow, that's quite a harmonic progression you've laid out there. Let me see if I can follow along - it sounds like you're exploring some fairly advanced chord changes and voicings. Could you walk me through how you're thinking about the function and movement of those chords?","6":"I understand your perspective. Often, the way a musical passage is expressed or the context it's placed in can significantly impact the overall feeling or emotional tone. The shift from a major to a minor key, for instance, can create a more somber or melancholic mood.","7":"It's a little bit like the light has dimmed. The brightness of the tonality has changed.","8":"Chess is a fascinating game that combines tactics and strategy in a unique way. It's not just about calculating the next few moves, but also about understanding the broader position and making long-term plans.","9":"That's a really insightful way to look at chess. I love how you've highlighted the key elements of time, space, and harmony. It really speaks to the depth and complexity of the game. When you talk about harmony trumping everything, that's a fascinating perspective. Can you expand on that a bit more?","10":"Well, I see myself as more of a pragmatic player. I'm not one to take a lot of risks or get too fancy. I try to play solid, fundamental chess and capitalize on my opponent's mistakes. But I also like to keep my opponent guessing and try to mix things up at times. I'm always looking to learn and improve my game.","11":"No, the Dutch defense is a different opening. The Leningrad is a variation of the King's Indian Defense.","12":"That's a good idea. The Fiancetto is a solid opening and can lead to some dynamic play.","13":"Exactly! I'm trying to make this as engaging and entertaining as possible, just like the top streamers. Commentating the game as we go along is a great way to keep the audience invested and learning.","14":"What was your personal journey like to becoming a grandmaster?","15":"So in that sense, we're always moving through time, even if we're not moving through space.","16":"And what about time? Can you move through time as easily as you can move through space?","17":"That's right, he's Albert Einstein. Einstein's theory of relativity showed that time is not absolute, but relative to the observer's motion.","18":"To travel to the future, you need to travel at nearly the speed of light. Einstein's theory of relativity shows that time slows down for an object moving at high speeds relative to a stationary object. So if you get in a rocket and travel close to the speed of light, you can jump forward in time while only aging a small amount.","19":"No, nobody has ever tried to travel forward and back in time. It's just a theoretical possibility based on our current understanding of physics and space-time. We don't have the technology yet to actually accomplish time travel, and there are a lot of unanswered questions about the feasibility and potential consequences of it.","20":"What do you mean by 'maybe'? Can you explain further?","21":"No, I'm not doing EM. I'm actually asking about the role of the brain versus the muscles in musical performance. Do you think there's a significant amount of learning that happens at the muscular level, or is it mostly in the brain?","22":"We use a variety of observational techniques in optical and infrared to study the properties of accretion disks around black holes. Primarily, we rely on spectroscopy, where we analyze the emission and absorption lines in the observed spectra to infer the physical conditions and composition of the disk material. We also use imaging techniques, such as high-resolution interferometry, to directly resolve the structure of the disk and measure its size and shape.","23":"We see the dust at the outer parts of the accretion disk, further away from the black hole. By tracking the delay in the infrared emission relative to the initial optical\/UV flash, we can map out the location of the dust and the structure of the accretion disk around the black hole.","24":"Yeah, that's a really tough problem. The X-ray binaries are like a wall blocking our view of the central black holes in those low-luminosity AGNs. It's a major challenge trying to separate out the contributions from the binaries versus the nuclear emission.","25":"So the idea is that the star just collapses in on itself, and there's no violent explosion or anything like that, but rather it just quietly disappears into the black hole, right?","26":"So if we think of the universe as a four dimensional spacetime, what does that really mean?","27":"Alright, let's go to the blackboard and I'll try to illustrate this better. The key thing to understand is that space and time are not separate entities, but rather parts of a unified four-dimensional spacetime.","28":"Well, the reason they want you to think of spacetime as one four-dimensional thing is that it helps us understand the fundamental nature of the universe and how space and time are interconnected. In Einstein's theory of relativity, space and time are not separate entities, but rather they are part of a unified spacetime continuum.","29":"So the key insight is that space and time are not separate things, but rather they are united into a single entity called spacetime. This means that we can think about our motion and position not just in terms of spatial coordinates, but in terms of a four-dimensional spacetime that combines the three spatial dimensions with the dimension of time.","30":"So the key idea is that you have a spacetime trajectory, and that trajectory has a length, just like a curve in space has a length. And that length is called the proper time.","31":"So you're saying that our experience of time is relative and depends on how we move through spacetime?","32":"Exactly! The proper time is the fundamental time. It's the time that is measured locally, by the observer or the clock that is actually experiencing that trajectory.","33":"That's the effect of time dilation. The person who went on the high-speed journey experienced time at a slower rate compared to the person who stayed behind. So from their perspective, less time has passed for them, even though the same amount of time has elapsed for the person who remained stationary.","34":"So in that case, the curved surface would act like the gravitational field, and the object dropped on it would follow that curved path, just like how objects follow the curved spacetime around a massive object.","35":"Yes, exactly! That's a great way to explain it. The idea that different frames of reference can lead to different perceptions of motion and acceleration is at the heart of relativity. The train paradox really illustrates that concept well.","36":"Exactly! A baby ant is about the smallest thing we can see with our naked eyes. But there are things even smaller than that.","37":"Ah, so you're familiar with atoms! That's great. Atoms are the building blocks of everything around us, including the air we breathe, the water we drink, and even the food we eat. They're the smallest particles of matter that still retain the properties of an element.","38":"Exactly! Atoms are the building blocks of everything we see around us. They're the smallest units of matter that make up all the objects and materials in the universe.","39":"Imagine if you could build anything, molecule by molecule. What kind of things do you think you might want to make?","40":"That's a really good point. The actors in the system aren't just human anymore, but machines as well. And that introduces a whole new set of challenges around trust, security, and reliability that we need to grapple with.","41":"I agree. Building trust is critical for wider adoption of blockchain technology. There are a lot of misconceptions and concerns around security, reliability, and user experience that need to be addressed.","42":"Exactly. Education is key, both for users and for the broader public. As the technology evolves and more real-world applications emerge, people need to understand how it works, the benefits it offers, and how to use it safely and responsibly. It's a crucial step before widespread adoption can happen.","43":"The key idea here is that these structures need to be very compact when they're packed into a rocket, but then they need to unfold and expand to their full size once they're in space. This folding and unfolding process has to be very precise and controlled.","44":"Let's go ahead and start folding these rectangles to demonstrate the rigidity.","45":"So the key insight here is that this single degree of freedom mechanism allows you to precisely control the motion and relative rates of the folds as you go through the folding process. This gives you a lot of flexibility in how you can design the deployment and compaction of structures like solar arrays.","46":"Exactly. Once it's up in space, the panels can unfurl and deploy to their full size with just a small amount of mechanical action. The key is designing the folding pattern to allow for a controlled, even expansion.","47":"Exactly, it's a trade-off. You can get them to match up perfectly, but then it's not useful for the application. So we have to find the right balance between the two requirements.","48":"Exactly, it's a trade-off. You have to weigh the different factors and decide which one is more important for your specific application. For some uses, the asymmetry in motion might be acceptable or even desirable, while in others, the compactness of the folded state could be the priority.","49":"So this kind of folding structure can be really useful for space applications. When you need to pack something compactly for launch, but then have it expand and deploy once it's in space, these types of folding mechanisms can be a great solution.","50":"What's the importance of sleep?","51":"So when we measure sleep, we're able to see the different stages and patterns of sleep that someone experiences throughout the night. This includes things like the amount of time spent in REM sleep versus non-REM sleep, and the different stages within non-REM sleep.","52":"Absolutely. The different stages of sleep, and the amount of time spent in each stage, can tell us a lot about someone's sleep quality and sleep patterns. By looking at the proportion of time spent in REM sleep compared to non-REM sleep, we can get a sense of how well-rested someone is and whether they're getting the right balance of different sleep stages.","53":"That's a really good point. You're actually right that things like technology use, light, and music can disrupt your sleep cycles and reduce the quality of your sleep, including the amount of REM sleep you get. But what's really interesting is that even in ideal sleep conditions, we still go through these cycles of deeper sleep and REM sleep multiple times throughout the night.","54":"So by getting to bed earlier, you actually give your brain a better chance to cycle through those deeper levels of sleep, which is really important for things like memory consolidation and emotional processing.","55":"What do you mean by N-1, N-2, and N-3? Can you explain those stages of sleep in more detail?","56":"Fusion energy is a process where two light atomic nuclei, like hydrogen, are fused together to form a heavier nucleus, like helium. This process releases a large amount of energy, which is the principle behind fusion reactors and stars like the sun. The challenge is to create the intense heat and pressure required to sustain the fusion reaction.","57":"That's right. The three main states of matter are solid, liquid, and gas. But there's also a fourth state called plasma, which is what we're seeing in this glass ball.","58":"Alright, let me show you a plasma ball in action. This is a great way to visualize the movement of charged particles in a plasma.","59":"That's right, the movement of the charges has to be perpendicular to the magnetic field. The direction of the current will determine the direction of the magnetic field lines around the wire.","60":"Great, you've got it! The current in the green wire will create a magnetic field that goes in the counterclockwise direction, just as you indicated. This is one of the key magnetic fields needed for a tokamak fusion reactor.","61":"Exactly, so the magnetic field is going to be perpendicular to the direction of the current. And that's crucial for how the tokamak works, because we need to have that magnetic field to confine the plasma.","62":"The tokamak is a type of fusion reactor, a device designed to harness the process of nuclear fusion to generate energy. The confined plasma inside the tokamak can reach temperatures of hundreds of millions of degrees, similar to the core of the Sun. By controlling and confining this super-hot plasma, we can potentially produce large amounts of clean, sustainable energy through fusion reactions.","63":"That's a great question. The main challenge with achieving fusion on Earth is overcoming the repulsive force between the positively charged nuclei that we're trying to fuse together.","64":"Exactly! The two positively charged particles will repel each other due to the electrostatic force, which is a very strong force at those small distances. To get them to overcome that repulsion and fuse, we need to provide a huge amount of energy to push them together forcefully. This high energy is typically achieved through very high temperatures, like in the core of our sun.","65":"So the reason we need those really high temperatures is that the deuterium and tritium have to overcome the Coulomb repulsion between their positively charged nuclei. At normal temperatures, the Coulomb barrier is too high for them to overcome and fuse together.","66":"Exactly, compared to just hydrogen fusion, the deuterium-tritium fusion has a higher probability or cross-section for the reaction to occur. This is a key advantage that allows us to achieve fusion at lower temperatures and energies compared to other fuel sources.","67":"Okay, that makes sense. So the plasma is not staying hot enough for the necessary duration. What are some of the key challenges in maintaining the high temperature and density of the plasma for the required amount of time?","68":"The neutron comes out with a lot of kinetic energy, so that energy has to go somewhere. And it actually ends up heating the plasma, which then can continue to drive the fusion reaction.","69":"Okay, that's a good rule of thumb. The recommended amount of sleep can vary a bit based on individual factors, but six to nine hours is generally considered the ideal range for most adults. Let's dive a bit deeper into how our sleep cycles work.","70":"Origami is a fascinating field with a wide range of applications beyond its artistic and recreational uses. As a mathematician, I imagine you've explored some of the interesting mathematical properties and principles that underlie the art of paper folding.","71":"Exactly! The origami techniques used to create this wheel for a Rover can be scaled up to make much larger structures. The ability to precisely fold and unfold intricate patterns opens up a whole new world of engineering possibilities.","72":"So this is taking a flat sheet and using a specific folding pattern to create this three-dimensional, strong, and lightweight structure.","73":"Well, one thing I'm really excited about is these new metamaterials that are being developed. They have these really interesting bi-stable properties that allow them to switch between different stable configurations.","74":"Exactly, it's a science. We've moved beyond the hype and speculation, and now it's all about rigorous research, experimentation, and building real-world applications.","75":"There's no doubt that the current system has its flaws and challenges. But I think the potential of this new technology is really exciting.","76":"But we don't hold human drivers to that same standard, do we? People make mistakes, they get distracted, they drive impaired. And yet we generally accept those flaws in human drivers, even though they lead to thousands of deaths every year. When it comes to autonomous vehicles, we seem to demand perfection, even though no technology is ever perfect.","77":"That's great. What do you think the difference is between those two fields? How do they relate to dimensions?","78":"Okay, that's a great start. The way we typically define dimensions is in terms of the number of directions or axes that we can measure something. So the first four dimensions would be the three spatial dimensions - length, width, and height - plus the fourth dimension, which is time.","79":"Okay, so I'm gonna give you another dimension, and I want you to take that and hold it at a right angle to the first two.","80":"I know it sounds impossible, but just try to hold them at right angles to each other.","81":"Okay, let me think through this. If we have three vectors that are all at right angles to each other, then adding a fourth vector that is also at right angles to all three of them would give us a way to describe four-dimensional space. Does that make sense?","82":"Well, there are actually other coordinate systems besides the standard Cartesian XYZ coordinates. One of the other commonly used coordinate systems is called polar coordinates.","83":"So in addition to the distance and the angle, we could also think of time as a fourth dimension that we need to specify to fully locate something in space.","84":"Yes, time is considered an extra dimension. But there are also hypothetical spatial dimensions beyond the three that we can directly experience.","85":"Well, the idea is that the universe we live in has three dimensions of space and one of time, but in addition to those four dimensions, there may be extra dimensions that are much smaller and harder for us to detect.","86":"Well, in celestial coordinates, we typically use three dimensions: right ascension, declination, and distance from the Earth.","87":"We have these super precise theories, like quantum mechanics and general relativity, that work incredibly well at describing the world around us. But when you try to reconcile them, they seem to fall apart. And that leaves us with a profound mystery - one that we're still trying to unravel.","88":"But you know, over the years, the field has really evolved and there have been some exciting new developments.","89":"Well, it's been a long journey, but we've made a lot of progress in understanding the complexities of active galactic nuclei (AGN). When I first started studying this, it seemed like the unified model of AGN, with the obscuring torus, would provide a simple and elegant explanation. But as I got deeper into the research, it became clear that the picture is much more complicated than that.","90":"Absolutely, the advances in X-ray observations have been incredibly insightful. Being able to probe the high-energy processes close to the supermassive black hole has really transformed our understanding of active galactic nuclei.","91":"I see what you mean. The anatomy provides a static view, but the dynamics of how information flows between neurons and regions is crucial for understanding brain function. It's not just about the structure, but the temporal patterns of neural activity as well.","92":"There's an ineffable quality to the human experience that can't be fully captured by brain scans or data. It's the spark of consciousness, the felt sense of being, the subjective experience that makes each of us unique.","93":"That's a really interesting point. The challenge with using traditional AI systems like AlphaZero or Leela for this kind of task is that they are optimized to just play the game as well as possible, not to mimic human decision-making. So we've had to take a different approach to try to capture the nuances of how humans play chess.","94":"That's a great question. The variations you're referring to are likely based on extensive analysis of games played by top chess players. Computers have been able to explore millions of possible positions and identify the most critical and challenging lines for each side. So the recommendations you're seeing are really grounded in empirical data, not just theory.","95":"I think creativity is really fascinating. Where does it come from? What sparks it?","96":"The choices you make often come from an accumulation of your life experiences, even if the expression of those choices seems sudden or surprising.","97":"I can imagine. That must have been quite the experience.","98":"So the key thing is, it creates this kind of tension, this push and pull.","99":"Exactly, it's like a gravitational pull. The base note is the foundation, but the way it connects and builds up creates this sense of inevitability, like it was meant to be there all along.","100":"It's a beautiful hymn that has been used in many different contexts.","101":"That's a common misconception. Hacking isn't always malicious. There are also ethical hackers who use their skills to identify security vulnerabilities and help organizations improve their defenses.","102":"Exactly, they'll put in place various security measures and controls to try to prevent bad actors from gaining unauthorized access in the first place. This could include things like firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and strong authentication requirements.","103":"The good hackers, or ethical hackers, would typically work closely with the company or organization that owns the lock or system they're trying to break into. They would notify the company and get permission to test the security measures, with the goal of identifying and addressing any vulnerabilities before malicious actors can exploit them. That way, they can help strengthen the security without getting into legal trouble.","104":"No, that's not the case. Upgrading your lock is a legitimate process and doesn't involve any illegal activities. The company is simply providing you with a newer, more secure version of the lock to protect your home or property.","105":"I just started playing around with computers and seeing what I could do. At first, it was just simple things, but then I started getting more advanced and trying to figure out how to improve or modify the software.","106":"I understand what you're saying, but the way I saw it, the creator had already given us the tools to play with the game, and I just wanted to explore those tools and see what else I could do. I didn't mean any harm, I just wanted to have some fun and see what I could create.","107":"Well, that's a great point. If you think there are others who might like the idea, it could be worth exploring further. Have you considered sharing it with a few people to get their feedback? That could help you gauge if it's something worth pursuing.","108":"So you're saying that virtual reality, like other new technologies, should go through a similar phase of Realism where it captures the mundane and everyday experiences, rather than trying to idealize or romanticize the experience?","109":"You raise a really important point. Transparency and understanding the biases in the data and the model development process is crucial for the adoption and responsible use of machine learning systems. It's not enough to just have the technical capabilities to build the models - we also need to be able to explain and document the entire process in a way that builds trust and accountability.","110":"Absolutely, those are all really important considerations. The ethical and social implications of machine learning systems are critical to understand. There's a real responsibility on the part of data scientists and developers to be thoughtful about the potential biases and societal impacts of the AI systems they create.","111":"Hello there! I'm glad you remember our earlier conversation. It's been a while since we last spoke.","112":"Yes, that's right. I was there for a few years and was able to contribute some meaningful work.","113":"Well, that's an interesting idea. One way to approach it could be to explore alternative propulsion methods that don't require such high acceleration. For example, we could look into ion propulsion or other electric propulsion systems that could provide more moderate but steady acceleration over long durations.","114":"Absolutely, and that's really the exciting part. The tremendous progress in laser technology over the past decades has opened up so many new applications and possibilities. It's remarkable how lasers have become ubiquitous, much like the way semiconductors transformed our world.","115":"So, how do these learning algorithms actually work in practice? What's the process behind developing and refining them?","116":"One of the deep mysteries of quantum mechanics is how it relates to our everyday experience. The world we see around us seems so different from the quantum world, where particles can be in superposition and exhibit wave-like behavior. How do these two realms connect?","117":"That's a great point. Quantum mechanics and how it relates to gravity is a really fascinating area of research. I'd love to hear more about your thoughts on that connection.","118":"Ah, I see. So the key point is that this Hawking radiation results in a loss of information about the matter that originally formed the black hole. This is seen as a 'crisis' in physics, as it seems to violate the principles of quantum mechanics which suggest information should be conserved.","119":"So in the context of quantum mechanics, how does that affect our understanding of black holes and event horizons?","120":"Exactly, that's the key insight. If quantum mechanics and general relativity are both correct, then the event horizon and the existence of black holes as we traditionally think of them can't really be well-defined. The quantum superposition of different states with and without event horizons is what resolves this apparent paradox.","121":"Well, that's a really interesting point. If we take the idea of the universe as a hologram seriously, it does suggest that there might be fundamental limits to the amount of information that can be contained within a given volume of space. The holographic principle suggests that all the information in a region of space can be encoded on its boundary surface.","122":"Exactly, that's a great point. The holographic description shows that gravity and quantum mechanics are two sides of the same coin, even though they may seem very different on the surface. It's a powerful insight that helps bridge the gap between these seemingly incompatible frameworks.","123":"Computer hacking can be a really complex and technical topic. There's a lot more to it than just breaking into systems illegally.","124":"Can you tell me what kind of inputs you've been working with on that game?","125":"Exactly, the space bar is a common input that a user can interact with on a computer. What are some other inputs that a computer might have?","126":"Yes, the camera is another input device. It can capture images or video and send that data to the computer.","127":"Well, I shouldn't get into the specifics of hacking, as that could be unethical or even illegal in some cases. The point is, there are often unexpected ways to interact with computer systems that the original designers didn't anticipate. But I generally don't recommend trying to hack or break into systems you don't own or have permission to access.","128":"That's an interesting combination! What made you decide to study both physics and computer science?","129":"The perspective of experience I'm referring to is the actual observation and experience of physics, not just human subjective experience. We observe the universe evolving and unfolding in a very particular way, with time having a clear directionality, even though the fundamental physical laws themselves don't seem to distinguish between past and future. This is a deep puzzle in our understanding of time and the nature of time's arrow.","130":"Well, that's a great question. When we zoom in on a single thing, we can sometimes see variations or behaviors that seem quite unintuitive or unexpected, even if the overall pattern or trend is what we might statistically expect. There's often a lot of interesting complexity and nuance hidden in the details.","131":"In Interstellar, we see a really dramatic example of that gravitational time dilation effect, where the characters on the planet with the stronger gravity experience time passing much more slowly compared to the people orbiting in the spacecraft. That's a great illustration of general relativity in action.","132":"Exactly! GPS satellites have to account for the effects of relativity in order to function properly. The clocks on the satellites are moving at high speeds relative to clocks on Earth, and they are also affected by the weaker gravitational field at their altitude. If these relativistic effects weren't taken into account, the GPS system would quickly become inaccurate. So general relativity has very real and practical applications, even in our everyday lives.","133":"Physics is the study of the fundamental laws of nature and the interactions between matter and energy. It's a broad field that covers everything from the smallest subatomic particles to the largest structures in the universe.","134":"Okay, so you're there, facing the line. What other words or ideas could you use to describe your position on the line?","135":"So a two dimensional space is like a plane, right?","136":"So, what do you think we should explain?","137":"The universe seems to have three spatial dimensions and one temporal dimension, at least as far as our observations can tell.","138":"That would really shake up our current understanding of the universe. Extra dimensions would completely change our model of physical reality.","139":"And how did you find it? Was it a challenging course?","140":"Quantum dots are a great example of this. They're essentially these tiny semiconductor nanocrystals, often just a few nanometers in size, that exhibit quantum confinement effects. This means that the properties of the material, like its optical and electronic properties, are strongly dependent on the size and shape of the quantum dot.","141":"Yes, that's correct. Quantum dots are considered 0-dimensional nanomaterials. They are nanoscale semiconductor particles that exhibit unique optical and electronic properties due to their small size and quantum confinement effects.","142":"Yes, that's right. Carbon nanotubes are a fascinating material that I've spent a lot of time researching and working with. What would you like to know more about them?","143":"Exactly, that's right. Silicon has reached its limit in terms of miniaturization, and researchers are actively exploring alternative materials like graphene and carbon nanotubes to push the boundaries of electronics and computing. The unique properties of these nanomaterials, such as their high conductivity and flexibility, make them promising candidates to replace silicon in the next generation of devices.","144":"Ah, the lights! No, those are not related to quantum dots. Those are just some decorative lights I have in my office. But you're right, quantum dots can produce very vivid and efficient lighting, so it's an interesting connection. I'm always happy to discuss the fascinating world of nanomaterials and emerging electronics technologies.","145":"That's a great observation. Nanotechnology is often thought of as something futuristic, but it's actually all around us already. Many of the technologies we use every day rely on nanoscale components and processes.","146":"This is a basic transistor. Transistors are the fundamental building blocks of modern electronics and computer chips. They act as switches or amplifiers that can control the flow of electricity.","147":"So the key to getting more and more capability into these devices is to make them smaller and smaller. That's how we've been able to pack more and more of them into a given area.","148":"Exactly, that's correct. To make the transistor smaller, you have to miniaturize the individual components. This is achieved through a process called scaling, where the size of the transistor is reduced with each new generation of chip manufacturing technology.","149":"Well, let me give you an example. Imagine you're trying to describe how you changed from your freshman year to your senior year in high school. You could talk about the differences without explicitly referring to time.","150":"Great, then you're familiar with the idea that the speed of light is constant. This has some really fascinating implications for our understanding of time. Let me walk you through a thought experiment using a simple light clock to illustrate how Einstein showed that time is relative.","151":"Okay, let me walk through the derivation step-by-step. We'll use some high school-level math to figure out how clocks running at different speeds measure time differently.","152":"That's a great example of how hackers can exploit vulnerabilities in unexpected places. It's not just about protecting the main computer systems, but also all the connected devices and peripherals that may have weaker security. One case I read about was where hackers accessed a corporate network through a seemingly innocuous device like a meat scale in the cafeteria. These kinds of attacks really highlight the importance of securing all entry points to a network.","153":"Absolutely, that's a great point. The reason a deli meat scale can be used as an entry point is that these types of seemingly innocuous Internet-connected devices are often overlooked when it comes to security. They're not the primary focus, but they can provide a way in if they're not properly secured. It's a good example of how attackers look for the weakest link to gain access to the larger network.","154":"Buffer overflows are a type of security vulnerability where an attacker can exploit a programming error to write past the boundaries of a memory buffer and overwrite adjacent memory locations. This can allow them to execute arbitrary code or gain elevated privileges on the system. It's a common attack vector that can be used to breach security and gain unauthorized access to systems or data.","155":"That's right, if you try to write past the end of a buffer in memory, you can overwrite other parts of the program's data or even the program's execution flow, potentially leading to a crash or other unintended behavior.","156":"Well, that's a great question. The key connection is that a black hole is essentially an extremely dense and compact form of matter, where the gravitational force is so strong that not even light can escape. Neutron stars, on the other hand, are the extremely dense remnants of a collapsed star that has run out of fuel, but hasn't quite crossed the threshold into becoming a black hole.","157":"Absolutely, the detection of gravitational waves from the merger of two neutron stars in 2017 was a landmark event. Not only did it prove the existence of gravitational waves predicted by Einstein's theory, but it also allowed astronomers to observe the collision across the entire electromagnetic spectrum. This multi-messenger observation provided unprecedented insights into the nature of neutron stars and the production of heavy elements in the universe.","158":"The detection of gravitational waves from that event was a huge milestone for science. It provided the first direct observation of two neutron stars colliding and merging, which had been theorized for decades.","159":"Do you like science projects or experiments?","160":"Okay, let me try to explain it in a different way.","161":"Okay, great. An atom is the smallest unit of a chemical element that still has all the properties of that element. It's made up of a central nucleus, which contains protons and neutrons, and then electrons that orbit around the nucleus.","162":"Oh, I see what you mean. So the static electricity in the balloon is creating a force that's lifting up your hair, just like how magnets can push and pull each other. That's a great example of how these forces work.","163":"Well, the magnet is able to do that because it creates a magnetic field around it. This magnetic field can interact with the iron filings, causing them to move and align with the field.","164":"What do you think is happening with the magnets in those games?","165":"Invisible plasmas can be quite tricky to handle! We generally use specialized containment systems to keep them in a defined area. These systems use electromagnetic fields or other techniques to maintain the plasma's position and prevent it from dispersing or becoming uncontrolled. It takes a lot of careful monitoring and precise adjustments, but it allows us to work with these fascinating materials effectively.","166":"Exactly! Sleep is like recharging your battery. When you sleep, your body and mind get a chance to rest and recharge, so you can wake up feeling refreshed and energized.","167":"Have you heard about the way they recharge? It's really fascinating.","168":"Well, giraffes don't really recharge the same way humans do. While we need about 8 hours of sleep per night to feel rested, giraffes only need about 30 minutes. That's because they have to be constantly alert and ready to run from predators. So instead of a long, deep sleep, giraffes take short power naps throughout the day to get the rest they need without being vulnerable for too long.","169":"Okay, that's understandable. When you feel really tired, how does that impact your daily activities?","170":"Hippos have a unique adaptation that allows them to sleep underwater without drowning. They have a reflex that slows their heart rate and reduces their oxygen consumption, enabling them to stay submerged for up to 5 minutes at a time.","171":"You're absolutely right, that is a dolphin! Dolphins are truly fascinating animals.","172":"Dolphins actually only sleep with one half of their brain at a time. The other half stays alert to make sure the dolphin can come up to the surface to breathe. It's called unihemispheric sleep. Isn't that amazing?","173":"That's a really great point. The inability to fully understand and interpret the inner workings of deep neural networks is a fascinating and challenging aspect of this technology. It speaks to the power and complexity of these models, but also raises important questions about transparency and explainability.","174":"So you're suggesting that even as the underlying mechanisms become more opaque, we can still leverage these powerful algorithms and models for practical applications and progress, without necessarily needing to understand every detail of how they work under the hood?","175":"Well, what do you know about lasers in general?","176":"Exactly, that's a great point. With the continuous wave laser, the power is delivered continuously, whereas the chirped pulse amplifier takes that power and compresses it into a very short, intense pulse. This allows us to achieve much higher peak power, which is critical for many applications that require very high photon density, like nonlinear optics or laser-matter interactions.","177":"Well, the latest advancements in laser technology have made it possible to achieve incredibly high intensities and ultrashort pulse durations. This opens up a whole new realm of possibilities when it comes to manipulating matter at the atomic and molecular scales.","178":"Ah, I see. In that case, you could use a femtosecond or picosecond laser pulse to selectively target and destroy the tumor cell. The ultrashort pulse duration would allow you to deliver a high amount of energy to the specific cell without affecting the surrounding tissue. This technique is often used in laser microsurgery and precise cell manipulation experiments.","179":"That's a great question. I can see both sides of that debate. On one hand, deep learning can be incredibly powerful and can extract very rich and nuanced features from text data. But on the other hand, it can also be quite opaque, making it harder to understand and interpret the model's decisions. What are your thoughts on that tradeoff?","180":"And so how do researchers and developers try to get a handle on some of those biases and limitations?","181":"I think that's a great point. Sometimes the most immersive experiences come from embracing the limitations of the technology and finding creative solutions, rather than always chasing the highest technical fidelity. The sense of presence and connection can often be more powerful when you're not constantly aware of the underlying technology.","182":"Absolutely, and I think that's a really important point. As we start to hit the limits of Moore's Law and traditional computing power, we'll need to find new ways to push the boundaries of what's possible in computer graphics and virtual reality. Exploring emerging technologies like quantum computing, improved bandwidth and streaming, and novel UX innovations could be key to unlocking the next level of realism and immersion.","183":"You're absolutely right. Those kinds of breakthroughs in user experience and interaction are crucial. They allow us to rethink how we engage with the digital world and open up new realms of possibility. It's not just about the raw computing power, but about how we design the interfaces and experiences that make this technology truly accessible and intuitive for people.","184":"That's really interesting. Can you tell me more about how gravity is described as a field that permeates all of space? I'd love to understand that concept a bit better.","185":"That's right, the inverse-square law means that the gravitational force decreases rapidly as the distance increases. So the closer you are to a massive object, the stronger the gravitational pull you feel.","186":"Yes, that's right. In free fall, you would feel weightless, as if there's no gravity at all. This is the essence of Einstein's 'happiest thought' - that the experience of free fall is indistinguishable from floating in outer space, far from any gravitational sources. The gravitational field is not something pulling on you, but rather the curvature of spacetime around massive objects like the Earth.","187":"So, if you threw an object straight up on Earth, what would happen?","188":"That's right! If you just went straight on the Earth, you'd start falling down because of the Earth's curvature and gravity.","189":"I saw the moment of realization on your face.","190":"It's just incredible how much technology has advanced over the years, isn't it?","191":"Algorithms are much more than just a way to store information in computers. Let me explain what they are and how they work.","192":"Why do you prefer to have your contacts organized in a list rather than randomly?","193":"Well, if your friend's name is towards the bottom of the list, it could take a while to find them by scrolling through the whole thing. That's not very efficient.","194":"Exactly! That's the key insight. You don't start at the beginning of the phone book and go through page by page. That would be incredibly inefficient. Instead, you use the structure of the phone book - the alphabetical organization - to quickly locate the section for names starting with J, and then scan that smaller subsection to find John.","195":"Ah, I see what you mean. If the name is in one of the pages I skipped over, then a more targeted approach might work better. Rather than just flipping through the whole book, I could try skimming through the sections I skipped more carefully to catch any missed entries.","196":"That's a really good point. Using a hybrid approach like that could be a great way to strike a balance between efficiency and reliability. Going two pages at a time until you get close to the target section, and then switching to single-page steps to avoid missing anything, is a clever idea.","197":"Okay, so now you're in the J section. What do you think you should do next?","198":"Great, so you've narrowed it down to the left side. That's really helpful. Now let's see how we can continue to narrow it down even further.","199":"Exactly, that's the key idea. I can keep dividing the problem in half, discarding half of the remaining pages each time. This way, I can quickly narrow down to the page that contains John, without having to search through all the pages one by one.","200":"Okay, so in this third algorithm, if I started with a thousand pages, and I'm dividing it in half each time, how many steps do you think it would take me to get down to a single page?","201":"Okay, so if we started with 1,000 pages and divided them in half 10 times, that would be 10 steps to get down to a single page. That's a pretty efficient way to search a large set of data.","202":"Exactly, that's the power of algorithms like binary search. They can search through large amounts of data much more efficiently than simpler linear search methods. This is why algorithms are so crucial in modern computing, as they allow us to find information and solve problems quickly and effectively.","203":"Have you had a chance to do any work in the biomedical engineering program yet or is that still something you're working towards?","204":"Well, the great thing about lasers is that they can be used for all sorts of applications, from cutting and welding to communication and scientific research. Have you heard much about the different ways lasers are used?","205":"Chirped pulse amplification is a technique that allows us to generate extremely short and intense laser pulses. It basically involves stretching the laser pulse in time, amplifying it, and then compressing it back down to a very short duration. This allows us to avoid damaging the amplifier components while still getting a very high peak power. The key idea is to spread out the energy of the pulse over a longer time period during the amplification stage.","206":"Yes, the laser hammer concept is the same, but the chirped pulse amplification technique allows us to create much more powerful laser pulses. The key difference is that by stretching out the pulse in time using the chirp, we can amplify it to much higher energies without damaging the laser components. Then, when the pulse is compressed back down, we get a powerful, short pulse that can be used for applications like laser surgery or material processing.","207":"The pendant is an example of how different wavelengths of light can create short pulses. The pendant likely uses a laser that has multiple wavelengths, or colors, that interfere with each other to produce a very short burst of light. This is similar to how the mode locker in a laser allows the different wavelengths to come together and create a short pulse of light.","208":"Yes, exactly. That's a great example. With your Gmail, the machine learning models are trying to learn patterns that can help classify emails as spam or not spam. They might look at things like the sender, the subject line, the content of the email, and other features to try and make that determination.","209":"That's a great point. A person would likely look at things like the sender's email address, the subject line, any attachments, and the overall content and tone of the message. But the real power of using machine learning for a problem like this is that the model can actually learn those important features automatically from the data, rather than having to rely on a human to manually define them.","210":"Absolutely, that's a great question. The machine itself can definitely learn features as well, through a process called unsupervised feature learning. This involves letting the algorithm analyze the data and automatically identify patterns, correlations, and underlying structures that could be useful as features, without any human intervention or prior labeling of the data. This is a powerful capability that allows machine learning models to discover features that a human might not have even thought of.","211":"Correct! Good job. That's because you're using your peripheral vision to see the fingers I'm holding up without moving your eyes. Our peripheral vision is not as sharp as our central vision, so we have a harder time making out fine details in our peripheral field of view.","212":"That's really fascinating. I'd love to hear more about how you're using these bacteriophages to build functional materials. Can you tell us a bit more about the specific process and how you're able to direct the virus to synthesize the materials you need?","213":"That's really fascinating. So you're essentially using these viruses as nano-scale factories to produce the materials you need. How did you first come up with this idea to program viruses to build materials for you? What led you to explore this approach?","214":"That's a really great point. I think the field of environmentally-friendly chemistry and materials synthesis is so important, especially as we look to tackle major challenges like climate change and sustainable energy. The ability to leverage biological principles and processes to iteratively improve materials and solutions is a really powerful approach.","215":"Gravity. Gravity is what keeps us on the earth.","216":"Let me show you an example. Imagine you have a ball in your hand.","217":"The connectome is a map of how all the connections in your brain are organized.","218":"Well, those cells are like the building blocks of your body. They work together in different ways to make all the parts of you, like your skin, muscles, and organs.","219":"Time is a fundamental concept that is central to our understanding of the world around us. It is what allows us to measure the duration of events and the rate of change in the universe.","220":"The key point here is that even in the simplest of systems, when you introduce certain topological features, you can get some very surprising and counterintuitive behavior.","221":"That's right, it was a very surprising result that even in this very simple setup, you could have this exotic behavior of signal propagation. The ability to send signals backwards in time, or at least to receive signals from the future, was quite unexpected and counterintuitive.","222":"Yes, exactly! Einstein's theory of special relativity predicted that, even without violating causality, you could get these seemingly paradoxical results where signals can be sent back in time from the perspective of a fast-moving observer. It's a counterintuitive consequence of the way space and time get distorted at high speeds.","223":"That's a really good question. I think it's partly because the idea of extra dimensions was still quite speculative and exotic back then. The concept of higher-dimensional spaces wasn't as well-developed or accepted in Einstein's time as it is today. It's only after later work in string theory and other fields that the idea of extra dimensions became more mainstream and plausible.","224":"Ah, I see. So you're drawn to this idea of blending space and time on a more equal footing. That's really fascinating. What is it about that concept that resonates with you on a deeper level, beyond just the technical applications?","225":"Can you explain a bit more about how the Rowhammer attack works and what sort of security implications it has?","226":"That's a really great example of a side channel vulnerability. The Rowhammer vulnerability you described is a perfect illustration of how these unintended consequences can lead to serious security issues, even in systems that are otherwise well-designed. It just goes to show how important it is to think about the entire system, not just the core functionality.","227":"I agree, and that's a really important point. Cybersecurity is crucial, especially with the increasing prevalence of connected devices. When vulnerabilities are discovered, it's important for researchers to ethically disclose them so they can be patched and the public can be made aware.","228":"I completely disagree. I think that's an extremely irresponsible and dangerous approach. Publicly releasing vulnerabilities without proper disclosure and remediation processes puts a lot of people at risk of real harm.","229":"And I think that's just a really dangerous precedent to set, where companies are trying to control what you can and can't do with something that you've purchased.","230":"Well, that's an interesting hypothetical. I suppose if it were actually illegal, I would have to think carefully about the potential consequences and whether it's worth the risk. But I'm glad it hasn't come to that.","231":"That's really fascinating! I'm always amazed by how much can be done through these kinds of hardware hacks and side-channel attacks. The fact that you can bypass the cryptographic protections just by injecting faults is a really clever approach. I'd love to hear more about the specifics of what you've been finding with the Bitcoin wallet and other devices.","232":"That's a really interesting example. Fault injection can be a powerful technique to bypass security measures that rely on complex cryptographic operations. By introducing external disturbances, you can sometimes force the device to reveal its secrets without having to solve the underlying mathematical problem. It's a great illustration of how physical access can undermine even strong software-based security.","233":"That's really interesting that you can use x-rays to flip bits in flash memory. It's a clever way to inject faults and understand the behavior of systems. Have you tried visualizing the effects of that on the memory contents or the overall system behavior? I imagine that could provide some valuable insights.","234":"It's a really famous Christian hymn. There are two main versions - the original version from the 1800s, and a more modern version that's been recorded by lots of different artists. Which one do you think you'd prefer to listen to?","235":"Can you elaborate on what you mean by 'it sounds better'?","236":"How do black holes relate to paradoxes?","237":"There are a lot of interesting philosophical and ethical questions that come up when you consider the possibility of time travel and changing the past.","238":"I understand. That can be a difficult and unsettling concept to grapple with, especially when it comes to questions of free will and determinism.","239":"That's a really fascinating thought experiment, isn't it? The idea of a billiard ball going through a wormhole and potentially interacting with its past self is really mind-bending. It really highlights the potential logical paradoxes that could arise from time travel.","240":"Okay, let's explore that donut analogy a bit more. How would the shape of a donut relate to the structure of the universe?","241":"Ah, I see. You're someone who likes to really understand the concepts, not just memorize the formulas. That's great, it shows you have a curious and inquisitive mind.","242":"I understand what you're saying. The concept of eternity can feel overwhelming and distant. But even if we can't fully grasp or experience it, it's still a profound idea to reflect on.","243":"Okay, that's a great starting point. Let's go through the basics of how to play chess step-by-step.","244":"So, with those three moves, how would you checkmate your opponent?","245":"Wow, that's impressive! You were able to come up with a checkmate in just three moves. That shows how important it is to think ahead and have a plan, even if it takes a few moves to execute. Identifying those multi-move plans is a key skill in chess.","246":"Okay, let me explain a bit more. When white gets three moves in a row, it means I can make three moves without you getting to respond. This gives me the opportunity to set up an attack on your king. Does that make sense?","247":"You're absolutely right. In a closed position like this, with a lot of pawns on the board, I'm likely looking to trade pieces and open up the position to create weaknesses that I can exploit against your king. The more open the position gets, the more active my pieces become and the more chances I have to generate an attack.","248":"Yes, exactly. When the position is closed, the pieces are more clustered and there are fewer open lines of attack. On the other hand, an open position has more space and opportunities for maneuvering.","249":"You make a good observation about the king position. That could be a factor in evaluating the position. What else do you notice that might suggest a potential tactic?","250":"Exactly, that's the idea. With your king so far advanced, I can give you a check on e4 with the bishop. That will force your king to move, and then we can look at the potential follow-up moves.","251":"Excellent move! Taking the rook was a wise decision. Now, let's see how I can respond to that.","252":"What are some of the key challenges that you're facing in trying to translate these new nanomaterials into improved battery performance?","253":"That's a really good point. The challenges of scaling up from the lab to production are significant when working with nanomaterials. How do you approach that in your research? What strategies have you found to be effective in bridging the gap between the interesting scientific properties and the practical requirements of battery manufacturing?","254":"Exactly, latency is the time delay between an action being performed and the corresponding response being perceived. In the context of virtual reality, latency is critical because it directly affects the user's sense of immersion and can lead to motion sickness if it's not kept low.","255":"That's a great point. The advancements in technology really open up the possibilities for game design and creativity. The processing power, graphics, and storage capabilities of modern hardware allow developers to bring their vision to life in ways that simply weren't possible before.","256":"Absolutely. With the accessibility of game development tools and engines these days, the barrier to entry has really been lowered. Anyone with a creative idea and the passion to bring it to life can potentially turn that into an actual game.","257":"That's right, it's when two or more people exchange goods or services with each other. So, in a trade, you might give up something you have in order to get something you want from someone else.","258":"That makes sense. Trading something you don't like for something you enjoy more sounds like a good idea.","259":"That's a great way to think about it! Machine learning is the process of teaching computers or machines to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. It involves developing algorithms that can analyze data, identify patterns, and make predictions or decisions based on that analysis.","260":"Great, let me see if I can find a song recommendation for you based on your interest in Melanie Martinez.","261":"That's a great observation. Spotify's recommendation algorithm likely picked up on the filtered, low-pitched vocals in Melanie Martinez's music and used that as a signal to suggest similar sounding songs.","262":"That's a great point. Machines can pick up on a lot of those lower-level, more objective features like pitch, volume, and tone. But capturing the more subjective, abstract qualities like a 'creepy vibe' is really challenging. It requires a much deeper understanding of human perception and emotion that current AI systems struggle with.","263":"Exactly, that's a great example. Companies use machine learning to analyze all the data we provide them, either explicitly through our interactions or implicitly through our online behavior. This allows them to make predictions about our interests and preferences, which they can then use to personalize the ads and content we see.","264":"Well, a laser is actually quite different from a light bulb. A light bulb produces light by heating up a filament, which then emits light in all directions. But a laser is a device that produces a very focused, intense beam of light that is all traveling in the same direction.","265":"Exactly! That's a great analogy. Just like the nail needs to be centered to be able to easily go into the wood, the laser beam needs to be focused and concentrated in order to have enough power to cut through the material.","266":"Exactly, that's a great analogy. The laser is like a magnifying glass, but instead of focusing sunlight, it focuses a very intense, coherent beam of light onto a small area. This concentrated energy is what allows the laser to have such a powerful effect on the material it's interacting with.","267":"Yes, that's exactly right. A lens works by bending the light and focusing it down to a much smaller area, just like a magnifying glass.","268":"So with light, the spatial dimension and the time dimension are actually the same thing. That means we can focus the light in both space and time to create these really intense, localized beams.","269":"Exactly! That's a great way to think about it. The laser beam is focused and concentrated down into a tiny spot, like a little beam of light just flying through the air.","270":"It funnels into a concentrated beam, yes. That's a great way to think about it. The lens helps focus the light and create that concentrated, coherent beam that we call a laser.","271":"Alright, let's start with the basics. I'll guide you through the process step-by-step, and you can let me know if you have any questions along the way.","272":"Okay, let's get started.","273":"So, let's get started. The first step is to create what's called a petal fold.","274":"That's the key part of this fold. If you can get that layer to fold just right, the rest of the design will come together nicely.","275":"Did you get that? Let me know if you need me to walk through it again.","276":"The cootie catcher is a really interesting origami design. It starts as a simple square, but","277":"Those are paper cranes, a classic origami design. They're so simple to make, but it's the way they transform from a flat sheet into a 3D shape that makes them so fascinating.","278":"Let me show you how to do it. Watch closely and I'll walk you through the steps.","279":"Okay, let's say I have the numbers 8, 5, 3, 1 on the board. How would you walk me through the bubble sort step-by-step?","280":"Okay, got it. So we switch the order from six five to five six.","281":"So, that's a great example of the kind of recommendation system that we're talking about. Can you elaborate a bit more on how these recommendation algorithms work on platforms like TikTok?","282":"You're exactly right. The social media platforms use recommendation algorithms to curate the content that gets shown to each user. It's not just a simple chronological feed, but an attempt to show the most relevant and engaging posts based on your individual interests and activity. So the For You page on TikTok is a great example of how these algorithms work behind the scenes to personalize the experience for each user.","283":"You're on the right track. When we launch things into space, we're using the same basic principle of gravity, but in a different way.","284":"The gravity is still pulling on it, but it's moving so fast that it's constantly falling around the Earth. So it's kind of like when you swing a rock on a string - the string is the gravity, and the rock is the spacecraft, and it's just constantly falling around the Earth without ever hitting the ground.","285":"Exactly! It's the same concept. The centrifugal force from the spinning motion counteracts the force of gravity, just like the International Space Station orbiting the Earth. As long as they maintain that angular momentum, the pull of gravity keeps them in orbit instead of falling back down.","286":"Exactly! That's a great example of how your perception of motion can be relative. It's all about your frame of reference.","287":"That's exactly the kind of reaction I was hoping for! The implications of special relativity can be mind-bending, but that's part of what makes it such a fascinating and revolutionary theory.","288":"So let's say you and your friend Marina are both standing still, right? And you both measure the speed of light and you both get the same answer - 300,000 kilometers per second. But then Marina takes off in a rocket ship at a significant fraction of the speed of light.","289":"So, in this case, Marina is racing towards the light pulse, and from your perspective, you would measure the speed of the light pulse to be even faster than 300,000 kilometers per second. This is the key insight of Einstein's theory of special relativity - the speed of light is always measured to be the same, even if you're moving relative to the source.","290":"And so by thinking about extra dimensions and how they might be compactified or curled up, we can start to get a handle on the underlying structure of the universe and how it might relate to the world we observe.","291":"That's a great question. The way that the extra dimensions get 'compactified', or made small, is actually a really interesting and important part of string theory. It turns out that the shape and size of those extra dimensions can have a big impact on the physics we observe in our four-dimensional world.","292":"The key insight is that if you have a little bit of matter or energy in that region, it can deform the space and spontaneously create a compact extra dimension. So instead of just having flat space, you can have a warped space that has a little tube or circle in it.","293":"Well, in this model, we assume that the large dimensions are a fundamental property of the universe. The specifics of how they came to be are not fully understood, but it's a key part of the theoretical framework we're working with.","294":"So how are black branes different from black holes?","295":"Exactly, that's a really important point. The key thing is that the non-singular branes can support different types of transverse geometries, not just anti-de Sitter. This gives us a lot more flexibility in the possible solutions we can construct.","296":"Well, the idea is that these configurations, where the universe just asymptotes to some fixed radius, could be particularly stable or favored solutions. They might have some property, like the lowest possible action or energy, that makes them the most likely states for the universe to end up in.","297":"Not necessarily the lowest action, but they are the most stable configurations. The ones with the lowest action may not actually be the most likely to occur in nature.","298":"Ah, yes! The quantum nature of it all. It's like a wild dance, where the particles are the dancers and the stage is the universe itself. [laughs] It's fascinating how these quantum phenomena can have such a profound impact on our understanding of the cosmos.","299":"That's a really interesting point. Can you tell me more about the current discussion in the literature? What are some of the key debates or perspectives that are being explored?","300":"The graphic novel explores deep ideas in physics and philosophy through a series of conversations between a variety of characters. It's an engaging and accessible way to learn about topics like the nature of space, time, and the quantum world.","301":"That's a really interesting point about the challenge of directly imaging black holes. The project you mentioned, using a network of radio telescopes to observe the black hole at the center of our galaxy, is known as the Event Horizon Telescope. It's been a major effort to try to get the first direct image of a black hole's event horizon.","302":"I think you might be misunderstanding what I'm trying to explain. Let me clarify a bit more.","303":"That's a really good observation. The human brain is incredibly complex, with billions of neurons and trillions of connections between them. Unlike a computer, which operates in binary, the brain utilizes a wide range of signals and patterns to process information and generate complex thoughts and behaviors.","304":"And how often do you play nowadays?","305":"Okay, let's take a look at your game history and find a game to analyze.","306":"I agree, it does seem pretty even right now. The slight edge for White might come from the fact that their pieces are a bit more developed. So the key idea for Black would be to find a way to get their bishop out, while making sure they don't create any weaknesses in the process. What ideas do you have for how Black could approach this?","307":"Well, one idea is to develop your bishop to a good square where it can control the center and put pressure on your opponent's position. Maybe something like Bc5 or Bb4 would be a good idea to consider.","308":"Your opponent is likely trying to control the center with their pawns. By pushing that pawn forward, they are trying to establish a strong pawn presence in the center. This is a common strategy for white players, as controlling the center is key to having a good position.","309":"Exactly right. If your opponent advances a central pawn, that opens up lines for their other pieces, like the bishop you mentioned. You have to be aware of how your opponent's pawn moves can activate their other forces and disrupt your plans.","310":"Exactly, by playing that pawn move, I've activated my bishop, giving me more control over the center. This creates a bit of a skewer, where your pieces are now under attack.","311":"Absolutely, that's a great point. When the opponent plays a pawn move that disrupts your plan, it's important to take a step back and assess the new position. Now that this pawn has moved, what new opportunities or weaknesses have been created? We need to shift our focus and look for ways to capitalize on the new dynamics of the position.","312":"That's great, the E file opens up a lot of possibilities for you. What else did you notice about the position?","313":"Harmony is really the glue that holds a piece of music together. It's the layers of sound that create a sense of movement and emotion.","314":"That's a great idea. What do you think we should do next?","315":"That's right, gravity is what keeps us grounded to the Earth. It's the force that attracts objects with mass towards each other. The Earth's gravity is what keeps us from floating off into space.","316":"Exactly! The Moon's gravity causes the ocean tides on Earth, as you mentioned. The Moon's pull is what creates the rise and fall of the tides.","317":"No, if gravity was too strong, we wouldn't be able to get up at all. Gravity is what keeps us grounded and gives us a sense of weight. If gravity was significantly stronger, it would be incredibly difficult for us to move around or even stand up. The reason we can get up and move around is that the Earth's gravity is just the right strength to allow us to function, but not so strong that it overwhelms us.","318":"Okay, so you're around four feet tall. On the Moon, you'd be able to jump much higher than you can on Earth, because the gravity is weaker. But on a really dense star that's collapsed in on itself, the gravity would be so strong that you wouldn't be able to lift your arms or even take a step.","319":"That's the effect of microgravity on the human body. When astronauts are in space, without the constant pull of gravity, their spine can actually grow up to 2 inches longer.","320":"The reason for this is that in the microgravity environment of space, the discs in the spine are not compressed by the force of gravity. This allows the spine to elongate, making the astronaut appear taller. When they return to Earth, the discs compress back to their normal size, and the astronaut returns to their original height.","321":"Okay, so the story goes that Isaac Newton was hit on the head by an apple that fell from a tree, and that made him realize that there had to be some force pulling that apple down. And that's how he discovered gravity.","322":"The key insight that Isaac Newton had was that there is a force that pulls objects towards the Earth's surface, which we now call gravity. This force acts on all objects, regardless of their mass or composition.","323":"That's right, the heavy object that Newton discovered was the apple that fell on his head, leading to his groundbreaking work on the theory of gravity.","324":"That's a great question. Fusion is a very interesting and complex topic. There are many different types of plasmas found in nature and in various scientific and technological applications.","325":"The process of creating and maintaining this plasma is actually quite complex and requires advanced technology.","326":"So you're right, the behavior of plasmas can get quite complex, especially when you start considering the different types and the various factors that can influence them, like temperature, density, magnetic fields, and turbulence. It really highlights how much we have to take into account to fully understand the dynamics of these states of matter.","327":"Exactly, that's where the complexity comes in. When you have a plasma confined in this donut shape, the collective behavior of the charged particles starts to dominate. You get all sorts of plasma waves and instabilities that can develop, and these are incredibly difficult to model and predict. The turbulence and chaotic behavior that arises is a major challenge for fusion researchers.","328":"The model I'm talking about is called the gyrokinetic model. It's a way of simulating the behavior of charged particles in a strong magnetic field, like what you'd find in a fusion reactor.","329":"Gyrokinetic refers to the way we model the motion of charged particles in a strong magnetic field. The idea is that the particles are gyrating, or spinning, around the magnetic field lines at a very high frequency.","330":"So the key point is that we're looking at the gyro frequency of the particles as they orbit around the magnetic field lines. This gives us a sense of how fast the turbulent eddies and structures are moving, which is really important for understanding the overall transport dynamics.","331":"Ah, I see. The cerebellum is certainly an important part of the brain, and its role in regulating arousal and sleep is an interesting area of study. Could you tell me a bit more about your research on the cerebellum and how it relates to this flip-flop switch between sleep and wakefulness?","332":"Okay, great. So let's dive into that a bit more. The brain machinery that regulates the sleep-wake cycle is really fascinating and complex. There are a number of neurotransmitters and brain regions involved that work together to help us transition between consciousness and unconsciousness.","333":"Have you ever played with a laser pointer before?","334":"That's right, the laser is just a tiny little dot. And that's because a laser is a very focused, concentrated beam of light. Whereas a flashlight spreads the light out in a wider beam.","335":"The light doesn't just go straight through the glass. It actually bends as it moves through the glass.","336":"That's because the laser beam is able to reflect off the smoke particles and make the path of the light visible, even though it's going around the corner.","337":"Well, let's think about something more tangible that you interact with on a daily basis. What's something in your life that you use frequently?","338":"Ah, I see you've noticed the indicator light. That's a good sign that the device is functioning properly.","339":"Have you seen those intricate origami patterns that look like they're made of multiple pieces, but are actually created from a single sheet of paper?","340":"The amazing thing about tessellations is that they're all created from a single sheet of paper, without any cuts or glue. It's just the strategic folding of the paper that creates these intricate, repeating patterns.","341":"No, they weren't cut. The whole pattern is created by folding a single sheet of paper.","342":"Great, that's exactly the kind of fold I was thinking of. The key is that the folds don't have to run all the way across the paper - you can start and stop them wherever you need to build up the shape. And you're right, all the origami folds are reversible, so you can always unfold them and try a different approach.","343":"Yes, all the folds in origami are reversible. You can always unfold a mountain fold and turn it into a valley fold, and vice versa.","344":"That's really interesting! So you're saying that in origami, there's this underlying pattern where the folds always alternate between mountains and valleys in a specific way. That makes a lot of sense and helps explain how these intricate origami shapes can be created.","345":"Yes, twists! Watch how it rotates as I unfold it. This basic twist pattern is the foundation for many origami tessellations.","346":"Machine learning is a type of artificial intelligence that allows computers to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. It involves using algorithms and statistical models to perform specific tasks effectively without using rule-based programming.","347":"That's a good observation. Some other key differences are that dogs are often more social and loyal, while cats tend to be more independent and self-sufficient. Dogs are also generally more energetic and enjoy activities like running and playing, while cats are often more sedentary and prefer lounging around.","348":"That's not a cat, it's a giraffe.","349":"Have you taken any tests on what you've learned so far?","350":"But what if there are some questions on the test that I haven't seen before?","351":"What if I told you that's exactly how machine learning works? The more examples and practice a machine learning model gets, the better it becomes at making those quick guesses and predictions.","352":"So what kind of things do you typically sell on eBay?","353":"So these middlemen, like banks, are essentially holding onto our money and transactions and controlling the flow of that information. But with blockchain, we can cut out those middlemen.","354":"Well, the idea is to use a decentralized network, like a blockchain, to record all the transactions. That way, instead of having a central authority or middleman managing everything, the network itself verifies and processes the trades, making the system more transparent and secure.","355":"So, as I was saying, the concept is quite fascinating. It really sheds light on the underlying principles at play.","356":"That's a good explanation. Virtual reality uses headsets and motion tracking to create the illusion of being in a different environment. The headset displays images separately to each eye, creating a 3D effect. When you move your head, the image updates accordingly, making it feel like you're really there.","357":"Exactly, that's a great example. VR is kind of like taking the 3D glasses at the movie theater and turning it up to 11.","358":"Well, in a 3D movie, the different images that are sent to your left and right eyes create the illusion of depth and three-dimensionality. The glasses help your brain combine those two slightly different images into one 3D scene. That's one way we can perceive depth and distinguish real objects from flat images or displays.","359":"Blockchain is a type of database that stores information in a digital format. It's used to track and record transactions, and it's decentralized, meaning it's not controlled by any single entity.","360":"You're right, blockchain technology is disrupting a lot of traditional middlemen and intermediaries. But it's also creating opportunities for new business models and ways of facilitating transactions directly between parties. The key is that the blockchain provides a shared, decentralized ledger that everyone can trust without needing a central authority.","361":"The origami crane I showed you earlier is also made from a single uncut square of paper.","362":"Ah, I see what you're getting at! If you fold the paper to create a paper airplane, that would result in one point, instead of the four corners of the original square. Let's explore that further.","363":"So, the key insight here is that each part of the origami model, whether it's a leg, a wing, or the body, can be represented by a circular region on the paper. This allows us to use a technique called circle packing to design the crease pattern in a systematic way.","364":"So, to summarize, the crane has five main circles or points that make up its body. The larger ones are the wings, and the smaller ones in the middle would be the legs and the antenna. Does that make sense?","365":"Let me show you how to create an origami shape from a simple sheet of paper. We'll start by folding the paper into a series of geometric shapes, revealing the hidden potential within.","366":"Okay, let's start with memory. What do you know about memory?","367":"Exactly! Memory is where the computer stores information temporarily, while it's working on a task. Unlike permanent storage like a hard drive or SSD, the memory is volatile - it's cleared when the power is turned off.","368":"Okay, great. To make an algorithm, we need to break down the task into a series of steps or instructions.","369":"I agree, the first priority is to clean up this mess. That's the responsible thing to do.","370":"That's right. You need to be more specific in your search query to find the information you're looking for. Just typing 'Google' won't give you the answers you need. You need to include more details or keywords related to your question.","371":"What do you do for a living, if you don't mind me asking?","372":"That's really interesting. So it sounds like there's a pretty strong association between sleep apnea and increased risk of developing Alzheimer's disease. What about some of the other sleep-related factors - are there links to other aspects of the pathology of Alzheimer's as well?","373":"That's really interesting, so it sounds like there is evidence from animal models that these sleep changes and disruptions may actually be occurring very early on in the disease process, even preceding the onset of the more overt cognitive and neurodegenerative symptoms. That adds a lot of weight to the idea that sleep could be playing a causal role in the development of these conditions, rather than just being a consequence.","374":"Absolutely, that's a really important point. The connection between sleep and cognitive health, particularly in terms of neurodegeneration, is a critical area of sleep research. Understanding how sleep plays a role in clearing out things like beta-amyloid and other waste products in the brain could provide key insights into early detection and prevention of conditions like Alzheimer's disease. Sleep research has the potential to unlock powerful tools for maintaining brain health as we age.","375":"That's really interesting. Can you tell me a bit more about how these first-principle simulations work and how they're helping to inform the reactor design?","376":"That's really fascinating. It sounds like the injection of private funding and the ability to leverage advancements in other fields like materials science and AI are really helping to accelerate the progress in fusion energy. That's great to hear. Do you think the diversity of research approaches across different organizations is going to be key to finding the most viable fusion solution?","377":"So to give you a sense of the contrast we're going for, let me play a bit of each.","378":"The circle of fifths is a way of organizing the 12 notes of the chromatic scale in a way that shows the relationships between the different keys and chords. It can help you understand how different chords and keys are related to each other, and how you can move between them.","379":"Okay, so we're starting in F major. Let's walk through the chord progression step-by-step.","380":"Imagine a deep, rich blue hue enveloping the B flat. It's a color that conveys a sense of calmness and tranquility, yet there's a subtle hint of mystery to it. As you play the B flat, feel the weight and depth of this blue tone resonate within you.","381":"That's exactly right. In a battle, initiative refers to who gets to act first. The player or side that has the initiative gets to make the first move and potentially gain an advantage. It's an important concept in tactical games where timing and positioning are crucial.","382":"You're right, I do have the initiative here. Let me try to capitalize on that and see if I can put some pressure on you.","383":"What do you see that makes you feel that way?","384":"Alright, let's wrap this up then. Go ahead and take your last moves.","385":"A connectome is a comprehensive map of the neural connections in the brain. It's like a wiring diagram for the brain, showing all the connections between the different neurons.","386":"I understand your perspective, but I would argue that the presence of feelings is not necessarily what makes the human race strong. Computers may not have feelings in the same way we do, but they can be incredibly powerful tools that augment and enhance human capabilities. The key is to find ways to integrate technology and human intelligence in a way that leverages the strengths of both.","387":"That's a great start! You're right that black holes are created when a massive star collapses in on itself. As the star collapses, its gravity becomes extremely strong, creating the black hole.","388":"Exactly, that's a perfect analogy. The same thing with a black hole, just because it has a tremendous amount of gravity, doesn't mean everything is just going to get sucked in. You have to get really close to it before you start feeling those effects.","389":"The idea of extra dimensions is a key part of string theory and other theories in physics that try to unify all the fundamental forces of nature. These extra dimensions are thought to exist, but they're incredibly small and curled up.","390":"That is a common way to think about it, but the concept of multiple dimensions or 'parallel universes' is still an active area of research and debate in physics. The leading theories, like string theory, suggest that there may be additional spatial dimensions beyond the three we directly experience, but the exact nature and relationship between these hypothetical dimensions is not fully understood.","391":"Well, string theory, which is a leading candidate for a unified theory of physics, proposes that the universe has extra dimensions beyond the three spatial dimensions and one time dimension that we experience directly. These extra dimensions are very small and curled up, and they're needed in the mathematics of string theory to make it work.","392":"Well, string theory is a theory that attempts to unify all the fundamental forces of nature, including gravity, into a single theoretical framework. The key idea is that the fundamental building blocks of the universe are not point-like particles, but rather one-dimensional objects called strings that vibrate in a multi-dimensional spacetime.","393":"String theory is an attempt to unify all the forces of nature, including gravity, into a single theoretical framework. It proposes that the fundamental building blocks of the universe are not particles, but rather one-dimensional strings that vibrate in multiple spatial dimensions.","394":"The concept of a membrane, or a two-dimensional surface that vibrates, is the basis of membrane theory. This is an alternative to string theory, which proposes the existence of higher dimensional vibrating objects.","395":"And if you take that vibrating string and you join the two ends together to form a loop, then you have a string that represents a particle.","396":"In string theory, the different particles and their properties like mass and charge emerge from the different ways that the strings can vibrate and interact. The vibrations of the strings determine the properties of the particles we observe.","397":"In string theory, we have additional dimensions beyond the three spatial dimensions and one time dimension that we experience. These extra dimensions are compactified, meaning they are curled up very tightly and not directly observable to us.","398":"Well, extra dimensions are additional spatial dimensions beyond the three that we experience directly. The idea is that there may be more dimensions out there, but they're compacted or curled up so small that we can't perceive them. And strings and branes are the fundamental building blocks of this higher-dimensional reality according to string theory. It's a really fascinating and elegant framework for unifying our understanding of the universe.","399":"Knowledge is not just about information or data, but rather the deeper understanding and insights that we gain from that information. It's the ability to make connections, draw meaningful conclusions, and apply that understanding in a way that goes beyond simply reciting facts or figures.","400":"And that's why I think the concept of","401":"That's a good point. The data alone may not always directly translate to clear knowledge or understanding. Sometimes there are gaps or barriers that prevent people from fully grasping the implications of the data.","402":"So the idea is that you can take a computation, say some kind of complex mathematical operation, and you can create a zero-knowledge program that encapsulates that computation.","403":"That's a great point. Proof on the ledger is a fundamental aspect of blockchain technology that provides transparency and security. As the technology matures, it's important that we continue to build upon that foundation.","404":"That's a great question! As a physics student, I'm sure you have a solid understanding of the basic concept of a black hole. Could you share a bit more about your understanding of what a black hole is and how it forms?","405":"Well, if you can't actually measure the length, then how can we talk about the length of something like a coastline or an asteroid? That's where fractals come into play.","406":"No, a planet or an asteroid would not be a fractal. Fractals are self-similar patterns that occur at all scales, meaning they have the same level of complexity or detail regardless of how closely you zoom in or out. Planets and asteroids do not typically exhibit this kind of self-similar structure across scales. They have a more defined, finite shape and size.","407":"Exactly! As you get more and more detailed in measuring the coastline, the length of the coastline keeps increasing. This is because the more detailed you look, the more of those little nooks and crannies you capture. The coastline is a fractal, meaning it has this property of having detail at every scale. No matter how closely you look, you'll see more complexity.","408":"In order for a quantum computer to work, the components inside need to be kept at extremely low temperatures. I'm talking about temperatures close to absolute zero, just a few millikelvins above.","409":"Entanglement is another key quantum property. It's when two or more quantum particles become linked, so that the state of one particle depends on the state of the other, even if they are physically separated. This property can be used in quantum computing and communication.","410":"Okay, I see. So the key thing is that noise-canceling headphones use microphones to detect the ambient noise around you, and then they generate a sound wave that is the exact opposite of that ambient noise. This creates destructive interference, effectively canceling out the ambient noise so you don't hear it.","411":"That's a great observation. You're absolutely right that quantum computers work by leveraging interference to amplify the right solutions and cancel out the wrong ones. The key idea is that we can use the wave-like properties of quantum systems, like superposition and entanglement, to create constructive and destructive interference patterns that guide the computation towards the desired outcome.","412":"Wow, that sounds like so much fun! What else did you do on that day?","413":"Hmm, I see. It's interesting that you're not completely sure about the color of the towel. Sometimes our memories can be a bit fuzzy, especially for small details like that.","414":"That's a really insightful observation. As we get older, our brains have to manage an ever-growing amount of information and experiences. The brain has to make decisions about what to prioritize and what to let go of, which is why we tend to forget certain details over time. The process of consolidating and retaining memories is an active one, and it's fascinating to understand how different parts of the brain work together to shape our memories.","415":"Exactly! Our brains have different regions that specialize in different types of memory. The part of the brain that's responsible for storing and recalling autobiographical memories, like the vacation you mentioned, is called the hippocampus.","416":"Exactly! The amygdala helps encode emotional memories, often those associated with fear or danger, so that we can better remember and avoid those situations in the future. The hippocampus and amygdala work together to create robust memories of events, especially those that are emotionally charged. This helps us learn from our experiences and adapt our behavior accordingly.","417":"Okay, that's a good start. But can you be more specific about what you mean by 'really just something that's infinite'? Do you have a sense of how large or how many things could be considered 'infinite'?","418":"Okay, that's a pretty good guess. But the number of Skittles in this jar is actually a finite number, even if we can't count them all right now. An infinite number of Skittles would fill up the entire universe and more!","419":"But if you can see them all, how could it be an infinite number of jars?","420":"Infinitely many jars would not fit in this room because the concept of infinity is something our finite minds struggle to comprehend. The idea of having an endless, limitless number of things is extremely difficult for us to wrap our heads around.","421":"Ah, I see what you're getting at. You're absolutely right, just because something is described as 'unlimited' doesn't mean it's a simple or straightforward concept. Infinity can take on many different forms and have various properties. Even though it may be infinite, there are often complexities and nuances that can't be fully grasped or experienced.","422":"That's so frustrating! I've had the same experience. My phone is always trying to focus on the wrong thing when I'm trying to take a photo.","423":"Quantum is a term used in physics to describe the smallest possible unit of something. It's a very important concept in quantum mechanics, which is a branch of physics that deals with the behavior of matter and energy at the molecular, atomic, nuclear, and even smaller microscopic levels.","424":"Well, if you just look at the penny, you can't tell whether it's heads or tails. That's the concept of superposition - the penny is in a state of both heads and tails until it is observed or measured.","425":"The particle is actually in a quantum state and it's affecting the other particle, even though they're separated.","426":"Oh yeah, it's really fascinating stuff! Quantum physics and quantum computing are just mind-blowing. The way these quantum systems can exist in superposition and become entangled is just incredible.","427":"That's the really amazing thing about quantum entanglement. Even though the pennies are spatially separated, their measurement outcomes are perfectly correlated. This strange phenomenon, where two quantum systems are linked in a way that defies classical intuition, is at the heart of many quantum computing and communication applications.","428":"Ah, I see. A black hole is a fascinating celestial object. It's an extremely dense region of space-time where the gravitational pull is so strong that nothing, not even light, can escape from it.","429":"Ah, I see. So you're talking about the density or mass of something, not its weight.","430":"If you keep squeezing it, it will eventually become so dense that it becomes what we call a black hole. A black hole is an extremely dense object that has such a strong gravitational pull that not even light can escape from it.","431":"The star's matter gets compressed down to a point where the gravitational force is so strong that nothing, not even light, can escape from it. The star essentially collapses in on itself, becoming infinitely dense at a single point called the singularity. This is what creates the black hole.","432":"Yes, that's exactly right. If the sun were to collapse in on itself, it would form a black hole. The gravitational force would become so strong that nothing, not even light, could escape from it. The point at which the escape velocity exceeds the speed of light is called the event horizon, and that's what defines the boundary of a black hole.","433":"Exactly! The gravity of the black hole is so strong that it's able to pull in even light, which is the fastest thing in the universe. Light can't escape the black hole's gravitational pull.","434":"Yeah, exactly. The idea is that the black hole is so massive that it's actually changing the shape of the space around it. It's not just pulling other things in, but it's actually distorting the fabric of space itself.","435":"That's a really powerful memory. It's amazing how an early experience with science can have such a profound impact on someone's life and career path. I love hearing stories like this, where a simple encounter with a science kit or experiment sparks a lifelong fascination and passion. Those kinds of moments can be so formative, shaping our interests and goals in ways we don't even fully realize at the time.","436":"That's a really powerful memory. It sounds like that experience with the science kit from your aunt really sparked your interest in science and medicine from a young age. Those kinds of formative experiences can have a huge impact on the trajectory of someone's life and career. I'd be curious to hear more about how that memory has continued to shape your interests and goals over the years.","437":"No, that's not what I mean. Your computer represents that 'A' as a series of zeros and ones.","438":"Exactly! That's the essence of how computers work - using a binary system of zeros and ones to represent all the information and instructions they need to carry out their tasks. The simplicity of this digital language is what gives computers their incredible power and versatility. With just those two digits, they can perform the most complex calculations, display the most vivid visuals, and connect us to the vast expanse of the internet.","439":"Sensors are devices that measure or detect physical quantities and convert them into signals that can be recorded or used in a process.","440":"Okay, let me explain how an MRI works. An MRI, or Magnetic Resonance Imaging, is a type of medical imaging that uses strong magnetic fields and radio waves to create detailed images of the inside of the body. Unlike x-rays, which use ionizing radiation, MRIs do not use any kind of radiation.","441":"Each cell has different components and structures that you can observe under a microscope.","442":"Absolutely, that's a great use case for nanodiamonds. They can be used as biosensors to monitor the chemical processes inside living cells during drug trials and new treatment development. The unique properties of nanodiamonds, such as their small size, biocompatibility, and ability to interact with cellular structures, make them valuable tools for researchers studying cellular-level activities.","443":"That's a good point. The orientation of the cups can make a big difference in how easy or difficult it is for the robot to stack them. Let's think through the specific challenges the robot might face in this task.","444":"Exactly, and then have it drop the object it's holding.","445":"And it did that, right?","446":"The key difference is the resolution. With the nitrogen-vacancy center, we can achieve much higher spatial resolution compared to traditional magnetic resonance imaging. The nitrogen-vacancy center allows us to sense and image at the single-defect level, which provides incredible precision and detail.","447":"Yes, that's exactly right. You need to be really close to the nitrogen-vacancy center in order to be able to detect the single electron. This is because the magnetic field from a single electron is very weak, and it falls off very quickly with distance.","448":"One of the key challenges is dealing with the noise and environmental factors that can interfere with the quantum effects we're trying to measure. We need to find ways to isolate the system from things like temperature fluctuations, electromagnetic interference, and other sources of noise that could mask the signals we're trying to detect.","449":"Yeah, that's absolutely right. The quantum systems are very sensitive to any kind of fluctuations or disturbances in the environment. And that can lead to a lot of noise and errors in the quantum computation or measurement process.","450":"So that was a good example of external noise coming in, right? Something that was completely unrelated to the quantum system we were trying to measure, but it was interfering with our signal.","451":"Absolutely, the intrinsic quantum noise is really the interesting part. That's where we can start to probe the fundamental limits of our quantum systems and sensors.","452":"Well, there could be a lot of different types of noise and fluctuations, like external sounds, random thoughts popping into your mind, or even physical sensations that distract you from what you're trying to focus on. The key is finding ways to manage those distractions, whether it's through meditation, mindfulness techniques, or simply creating a quiet and focused environment for yourself.","453":"ARPANET was an early packet-switching network developed by the US Department of Defense in the 1960s. It was one of the first wide-area computer networks and a precursor to the modern internet. The key innovation was packet switching, which allowed for more efficient and robust data transmission compared to traditional circuit-switching.","454":"Packet switching would enable a much more flexible and resilient network. Instead of having a dedicated path from source to destination, the data would be broken up into small chunks called packets and sent across the network independently. The packets could then be reassembled at the destination, even if they took different routes. This made the network more fault-tolerant and able to adapt to changing conditions.","455":"Exactly! The request-response structure is a key design principle of the internet, which is what enables the kind of robustness and fault tolerance you mentioned earlier. The idea of packets finding their own way through the network is really an example of a more general concept called abstraction.","456":"Exactly, abstraction is a key part of what makes the internet so powerful and flexible. By creating a basic infrastructure that hides a lot of the complexity, it empowers people to build all sorts of amazing applications on top of it.","457":"Okay, that means there is no central authority or control over decision-making or outcomes. It's a decentralized system.","458":"So you think they get dropped somewhere along the way, during the travel process?","459":"Have you ever worked with that definition before, or are you just familiar with the general concept?","460":"Okay, great. So the idea of fractal dimension is really interesting. Let me give you an example to illustrate it. Think about a plain sheet of paper. What would you say the dimension of the paper is?","461":"What makes you say three?","462":"Exactly, when you crumpled the paper, it became a three-dimensional object. The paper had depth, width, and height, making it a 3D shape. The key point is that the dimensionality of an object can change depending on how it is manipulated or shaped.","463":"If you cut the box in half again, you would have four boxes.","464":"That's exactly right. As you make the boxes smaller, the number of boxes needed to cover the coastline grows much faster than it would for a straight line. This is because a fractal shape like a coastline has detail at every scale, so there's always more structure to capture as you zoom in. This is a key property of fractals that has important implications for how we represent and generate complex geometry in computer graphics.","465":"Exactly, that's the key insight. The more closely you measure a fractal-like shape, the more detail you uncover and the larger the measured length becomes. This is what's known as the 'coastline paradox' - the measured length of a coastline depends on the scale of measurement. Fractals provide a way to quantify and understand this phenomenon.","466":"Fractals have a wide range of interesting applications beyond computer graphics. They are used to model and understand complex natural phenomena, like the branching patterns of trees, the shapes of coastlines, and the turbulence of fluids. Fractals also have applications in data compression, encryption, and even finance, where they can be used to analyze stock market fluctuations.","467":"Yes, exactly! Perlin noise is a procedural noise function that was developed by Ken Perlin in the 1980s. It's been used extensively in computer graphics and other fields to generate natural-looking textures and patterns.","468":"You're absolutely right. Teaching students about the philosophical and conceptual foundations of mathematics can be really fruitful, even if it's not always the focus of the curriculum. It really opens up interesting discussions about the nature of mathematical objects and the boundaries of what we can know.","469":"Well, it's certainly a fascinating topic. The question of what exists and what doesn't is a deep philosophical one. Personally, I find the idea of actual infinities intriguing, even if they don't have a physical instantiation. The different sizes of infinity, and the challenges around the continuum hypothesis, really get at the limits of what we can know with certainty. It's both humbling and exciting to grapple with these questions.","470":"That sounds really fascinating! I'm curious to hear more about how you plan to approach that topic.","471":"Absolutely, I think memory is a really key part of that. The way we perceive the world and make social judgments is so heavily informed by our past experiences and the memories we have stored up. It's fascinating to think about how those memories shape our current perceptions and reactions.","472":"That's really interesting. It sounds like the way we process and use our memories is a dynamic interplay between our emotional responses and the cognitive processes that shape those responses. And when there are disruptions in that system, it doesn't necessarily mean the individual can't make judgments or decisions, but they may need to find alternative paths or strategies to get there.","473":"You're absolutely right. That's a really important point. When someone has a brain injury or a deficit in a particular cognitive function, it doesn't mean they can't do that thing at all. They often find alternative ways to accomplish the same task or engage in similar cognitive processes. The brain is remarkably adaptable and can reorganize and compensate in really fascinating ways.","474":"Ah, that's a great point. As you get really close to a block in Minecraft, you start to see more and more detail. It's like the block is being subdivided into smaller and smaller pieces. This is a concept called recursion in computer science.","475":"Ah, I see. Well, subdivision surfaces are a technique in computer graphics that uses recursion to create smooth, continuous surfaces from a simple mesh of polygons. The key idea is to repeatedly subdivide the polygons, adding new vertices and edges, to create a more detailed representation of the shape.","476":"The reason we're doing this is that subdivision surface is a way to take those sharp-edged polygons and smooth them out to create a more natural, rounded shape. By repeatedly subdividing the polygons and averaging the vertex positions, we can get a smooth, continuous surface that works well for modeling organic shapes and curved surfaces in computer graphics.","477":"The process of subdividing surfaces into tiny triangles for Pixar movies can take a significant amount of time, depending on the complexity of the scene and the level of detail required. This is because each individual triangle needs to be calculated and rendered, and with millions or even billions of these micro-polygons, the computational load can be immense. The more detailed and realistic the desired outcome, the more time-consuming this process becomes.","478":"Well, I'm curious about how all the networks in your house are connected to the larger internet. Could you tell me a bit more about that?","479":"Well, the key is that your local network in your house is connected to the broader network infrastructure that makes up the internet. Your home network connects to a service provider, like a cable or DSL company, and that connects your local network to the larger network of networks that is the internet. There are all kinds of interconnections and links between these different networks that allow for data to be transmitted globally.","480":"Exactly! Those undersea cables are the key to how the internet can connect people all around the world so quickly. The signals travel through those cables under the oceans at the speed of light, allowing for near-instant communication even across vast distances. Those massive undersea cable networks are the physical infrastructure that enables the global connectivity we all rely on today.","481":"Yes, that's right. There are extensive undersea cable networks that connect different parts of the world and enable global internet connectivity. These cables carry the majority of internet traffic across oceans and continents.","482":"Connecting wirelessly is done through cellular networks or WiFi. The undersea cables I mentioned are used to transmit data and internet traffic between continents, but within a continent or country, the connection is often wireless.","483":"That makes sense. The challenge of handling diverse and deformable foods must be quite tricky. What kinds of approaches have you been exploring to tackle those issues?","484":"That's a great point. Providing the right amount of guidance and structure to the robot's learning process is key. Limiting the task range and curating the training data to focus on relevant interactions can definitely help. I've also found that transfer learning, where the robot can apply skills learned in one task to related tasks, can be a powerful technique to speed up learning.","485":"That's a great question. I think one promising direction is to move away from relying solely on first-principles physics models in our simulators, and instead use machine learning to build more empirical, data-driven simulators. The gap between simulation and reality often comes from the fact that our physics models are imperfect and can't capture all the nuances of real-world interactions.","486":"So, I'm curious to hear your perspective on this. What made you interested in studying child development and cognition in the first place?","487":"That's a really interesting distinction. I think there is a spectrum of cognitive capabilities, from more automatic, sensory-driven processing at the lower end, to more deliberative, language-mediated reasoning at the higher end. The question is how seamless the transition is between those levels, and whether there's a clear divide or it's more of a gradual blending.","488":"That's a good start. Quantum sensing is about using the principles of quantum mechanics to make incredibly precise measurements of things like magnetic fields, gravity, and time. The idea is that by harnessing quantum phenomena like superposition and entanglement, we can build sensors that are much more sensitive than traditional approaches.","489":"I'm studying quantum physics. We're looking at the properties of quantum spin systems, like electron spins in certain materials.","490":"Yes, that's right. We're using nitrogen-vacancy center defects in diamonds as the sensing elements. The diamond's unique quantum properties allow us to detect and measure magnetic fields at the nanoscale, even at room temperature.","491":"Okay, so the idea of superposition is that a quantum bit, or qubit, can exist in a superposition of both 0 and 1 at the same time, unlike a classical bit which can only be 0 or 1. This allows quantum computers to perform certain computations much faster than classical computers.","492":"Exactly, that's a great way to think about it. The quantum computer or quantum sensor is really sensitive to its environment, and by taking it out into the world and observing how the quantum properties change, you can use that to detect and measure things that would be very difficult or impossible to do with classical systems.","493":"Yes, an atomic clock is a type of quantum sensor. Atomic clocks use the precise oscillations of atoms to measure time, and they rely on quantum mechanical principles to achieve their high accuracy.","494":"And what are the five senses that humans have?","495":"And what else did you notice about the object?","496":"To really see what's going on inside, we'd need a tool that can see beyond just the surface. Something that can give us a deeper, more detailed view.","497":"And this is where the technology of ultrasound comes into play. Ultrasound uses high-frequency sound waves to create an image of the interior of an object, without damaging or altering it. This allows us to get a detailed look at what's going on inside the ball without having to break it open.","498":"Have you ever heard of a zero-knowledge proof?","499":"Exactly! The purpose of a zero-knowledge proof is to demonstrate that you know some piece of information, like a password or a secret key, without having to actually reveal that information. This is really useful in cryptography and computer security, where you might need to prove your identity or access rights without exposing sensitive data.","500":"How would you do that?","501":"But it's actually possible to do that in cryptography using something called a zero-knowledge proof.","502":"Does the Large Magellanic Cloud have a supermassive black hole at its center, like the Milky Way galaxy?","503":"Well, it's an interesting question. The prevailing view these days is that yes, supermassive black holes do seem to be present in the centers of most, if not all, large galaxies. The evidence for this has really mounted over the past couple of decades as we've been able to observe the kinematics and dynamics of material very close to the centers of galaxies.","504":"That's a great point. While the collapse of a massive star is the most commonly discussed way black holes form, there are actually other ways they can come into existence as well. Let me tell you a bit more about that.","505":"So the Milky Way and Andromeda are two of the major galaxies in our local group, and they're actually on a collision course. They're going to collide at some point in the future.","506":"Exactly, that's a really fascinating aspect of this potential merger. When the two supermassive black holes at the centers of the Milky Way and Andromeda galaxies collide, it could create an absolutely massive supermassive black hole with incredible power and energy output. The interplay between these two colossal gravitational engines could unlock all sorts of fascinating physics and potentially even new ways to harness their energy.","507":"Ah, yes, that's a good point. Supermassive black holes are indeed a fascinating and often misunderstood phenomenon in the cosmos. They are these incredibly dense and massive objects that can have a profound influence on the galaxies they reside in.","508":"That's a really fascinating area of research, and there have been some exciting developments in our understanding of black holes as potential energy sources. One of the key ideas is the concept of 'black hole batteries,' where the immense gravitational and rotational forces around a black hole can be harnessed to generate tremendous amounts of power. Researchers are exploring how we could potentially tap into this energy for future applications, including interstellar travel as you mentioned.","509":"Absolutely, that's a great way to think about it. The key idea in multi-party computation is that a group of parties can compute some function of their private inputs without revealing anything more than the final output. This allows you to collaborate and accomplish tasks while preserving privacy and confidentiality.","510":"That's an interesting perspective. Can you elaborate on how the bad properties of randomness become good when you flip it on its head? I'd like to understand that point a bit better.","511":"With zero-knowledge proofs, you can verify information without revealing the underlying data. This could be a powerful tool to build trust and overcome issues of mistrust.","512":"That's a really fascinating and insightful way to think about the brain's function. It's interesting to consider how the field of network science can provide a new lens for understanding the brain as a dynamic system of interconnected regions, rather than a collection of localized functions. This shift in perspective seems to open up all kinds of new questions and avenues for exploration.","513":"That's a really insightful point about how we construct our own cognitive maps and how those maps can influence our future responses. The way we choose to represent and structure our internal mental models seems to have a profound impact on how we engage with and navigate the world around us. It raises fascinating questions about the interplay between our perceptual experiences, our memories, and our conceptual understandings of space and place.","514":"That's a great point. I think what you're getting at is that memory isn't just a static record of the past, but rather a dynamic process of constructing and reconstructing our experiences to inform our present and future behavior. It's not just a passive repository of information, but an active model that we use to make sense of the world and predict what might happen next.","515":"Zero-knowledge proofs are a fascinating cryptographic technique that allow you to prove the validity of a statement without revealing any additional information. The core idea is that the prover can convince the verifier that a statement is true, without the verifier learning anything else beyond the fact that the statement is true.","516":"Okay, here's what we'll do. I'm going to prove to you that I have at least 0.2 Bitcoins in my account, without revealing the actual address of the account.","517":"So these two colors are different. They are not the same.","518":"Okay, so now let me show you a few more, and you can tell me if I've got the coloring right.","519":"And that's why it's a good idea to double-check with one of the existing colors you've already seen. That way, you can verify that the new color is consistent with the previous ones.","520":"Yes, exactly. The color of this one is different from the ones we looked at before, so the previous solution wouldn't work with these new colors.","521":"The implementations of the concept you mentioned can vary widely depending on the specific context and application. Can you provide more details about the particular implementation you're interested in learning about? That would help me give you a more relevant and helpful explanation.","522":"My research is in set theory, and the concept of infinity comes up a lot there as well. One of the fundamental ideas in set theory is the notion of a choice function, which allows you to select a single element from each non-empty set in a collection.","523":"A choice function is a function that, given a non-empty set, selects one and only one element from that set. It allows us to make a choice from a collection of non-empty sets, which is very useful in mathematics.","524":"So if you believe the axiom of choice, what are some of the consequences or implications of that belief that you find interesting or perhaps even a bit strange?","525":"Well, that's interesting. The axiom of choice is quite a controversial and debated topic in mathematics. Many mathematicians have strong opinions on it, both for and against.","526":"That's a good point. The set of all sets is problematic - it leads to paradoxes like Russell's paradox. So we can't really define a set of all sets in a consistent way. Instead, we can work with Grothendieck universes, which are categories of sets that are bounded by a certain cardinality.","527":"So what was the impact of Hawking's insights about black holes and information loss?","528":"That's a great point. Even though we can't yet directly observe Hawking radiation, the pursuit of understanding quantum gravity has led us to some fascinating insights about the nature of space, time, and information. Just the process of developing these theoretical models has been incredibly illuminating, even if we haven't yet found definitive experimental proof.","529":"That's really fascinating. So the event horizon itself could potentially provide a window into the quantum nature of gravity, if we can observe it in enough detail. That would be an incredible discovery. Do you think we're close to having the technological capabilities to make those kinds of fine-grained observations, or is that still quite a ways off?","530":"Fractals are these really fascinating mathematical structures that are self-similar across different scales. They have this really intricate, detailed pattern that repeats itself over and over again.","531":"One way to do that is to give the computer a set of rules that describe the shape and structure of a tree. For example, you could tell the computer that a tree starts with a single trunk, and that trunk splits into two branches.","532":"That's a really good observation. The branching pattern you see in trees is actually a fractal, which is a pattern that repeats at different scales. So if we zoom in on one of those branches, we'd see that it has its own smaller branches, and those smaller branches have even smaller branches, and so on.","533":"Yeah, that's the thing about fractals. They can be really intricate and time-consuming to create, especially if you want to make a lot of them. But fractals are fascinating, aren't they? What made you interested in learning how to draw them?","534":"Yes, exactly. Fractals are essentially mathematical patterns that can be generated through computer programming. So in order to create and explore fractals, you'll need to have at least some basic coding skills.","535":"That's a really good point. The low data volumes are a key advantage of IoT devices. You're absolutely right that the individual devices tend to only transmit very small amounts of data, often just a few bytes or kilobytes per second.","536":"I see. So the data rates for typical IoT devices are quite low compared to high-speed ethernet. They're more in the range of kilobytes per second or even bytes per second, depending on the specific use case.","537":"That's really fascinating. I'd love to hear more about the challenges you're facing in your research on quantum error correction and fault tolerance. What are some of the key questions or roadblocks you're trying to solve?","538":"That's a really good point. Fault tolerance is one of the key challenges in building a practical quantum computer. It's not just about increasing the number of qubits, but also addressing the inherent fragility of quantum systems. Addressing the noise and environmental effects is critical to achieving reliable quantum computation.","539":"Exactly, you're absolutely right. The difficulty is in maintaining the delicate quantum state long enough to perform the necessary computations. Decoherence is the enemy, and it's a constant battle to shield the qubits from environmental influences that can collapse the quantum state. That's the fundamental challenge that the field of quantum computing is grappling with.","540":"But that's often not the case. Many things that are easy for humans to do can be surprisingly difficult for robots and computers to replicate.","541":"I'm going to ask you to do a simple task, and then we'll see how a robot would do the same task.","542":"Now, I'm going to drop the penny on the ground. Let's see if you can pick it up.","543":"How were you able to do that with your eyes closed?","544":"Ah, that's a great observation. The sound of the object falling is a really important cue that helps us know to pick it up. Robots and AI systems often struggle with those kinds of basic perceptual and motor skills that come so naturally to us as humans.","545":"No, robots don't really know when they've messed up. They don't have the same kind of self-awareness or understanding that humans do. The robot is just trying to complete the task based on the instructions and data it has been given. It doesn't have a sense of failure or an ability to reflect on its own performance. The feedback from humans is what helps the robot learn and improve over time.","546":"Well, the key idea in reinforcement learning is that the robot gets a reward or penalty based on how well it does the task. So it's kind of like trial and error - the robot tries different actions, and it learns which ones lead to the best outcomes.","547":"Robots typically don't have eyes or vision like humans do. Instead, they use sensors and computer vision algorithms to perceive their environment. So they 'see' the world in a very different way, as a set of data and information processed by their software.","548":"Robots are designed to follow their programs and do not have the ability to 'go off' the program on their own. The programs that control robots are carefully designed to ensure they operate within the intended parameters and do not exhibit unpredictable or uncontrolled behavior.","549":"That's a really good point. The ability for these simple programs to generate such intricate and beautiful fractal patterns is really quite remarkable. It just goes to show how a few simple rules can give rise to incredible complexity.","550":"Exactly, that's a great way to think about it. The fractal-like patterns we see in nature, like coastlines, are the result of simple processes repeated at different scales. It's that self-similarity, that repetition of form, that gives us that sense of fractal complexity.","551":"That's a great story! It's amazing how observing a simple natural phenomenon like cream swirling in a cup can inspire such an important breakthrough in computer graphics. Being able to replicate the natural folding and turbulence like that must have been a real game-changer. It just goes to show how taking the time to carefully observe the world around us can lead to innovative solutions.","552":"Ah, I see what you mean. The key is that the processes operating at one scale, like the coffee cup, can lead to complex patterns over time. That's the essence of fractals - self-similarity across scales.","553":"Exactly, scaling is a fundamental concept that has broad applications beyond just computer graphics. It's a way of thinking about patterns and structures that repeat at different scales, which is a key feature of many natural and artificial systems.","554":"That's a really interesting point. I think that's where the potential for these virtual and augmented reality experiences to feel truly immersive and engaging really lies. The ability to capture the emotional resonance and richness of the real world and seamlessly integrate that into these digital landscapes could be the key to creating experiences that feel truly meaningful and captivating.","555":"That's a great point. The entire world is far too complex and vast to be stored and rendered in its entirety on a computer. The solution is to use procedural generation techniques that can create the world dynamically as the player explores it, rather than trying to preload everything.","556":"Absolutely. He really wanted to demystify the artistic process and make it accessible to everyone. That was a huge part of his mission, just like Bob Ross.","557":"That's a great observation. Our memories can be shaped by our experiences and the context in which we encounter things. The memory of something like the taste of orange juice can change over time as our preferences and frame of reference shift.","558":"That's a really good point. Our memories can definitely shape our preferences and how we feel about things, even simple things like the taste of orange juice. Your example of going on vacation and having a different experience with orange juice is a perfect illustration of how our memories can influence our views and decisions.","559":"Ah, I see. So you went with the pixie sticks. That's an interesting choice. What made you decide on the pixie sticks over the other candy?","560":"I can see why you'd find math so engaging. The way it can reveal complex patterns and structures hidden within seemingly simple problems is really fascinating.","561":"I guess you'll just have to trust me on that. But I can prove to you that I know where the puffin is without telling you the actual location.","562":"You see, I was able to prove to you that I know where the puffin is, without actually revealing the location. That's the essence of a zero-knowledge proof - it allows you to verify a claim without exposing the underlying information. This has important applications in security and privacy, where you might want to prove something without disclosing sensitive details.","563":"That's a great question. I study zero-knowledge proofs because they have the potential to solve some really important problems in computer science and cryptography. The basic idea is that you can prove something is true without revealing any additional information. This has a lot of applications, like in online authentication and secure communication. It's a fascinating field that could really change how we think about privacy and security.","564":"That's why zero-knowledge proofs are important. They allow you to prove something without revealing any additional information. The computer can verify that you know the password without actually learning the password itself.","565":"So with a zero-knowledge proof, you could prove your identity without revealing any sensitive information about yourself. The verifier would simply be convinced that you are who you claim to be, without you having to disclose the underlying details.","566":"Well, machine learning is the process of teaching a computer system to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. It's a way to get computers to solve problems by analyzing data rather than relying on pre-programmed rules.","567":"So you're thinking maybe like positional data, joint angles, things like that?","568":"You raise an interesting point about quantum computation. I'm curious to hear more about how you think elements of quantum computation could be applied in this context.","569":"That's really impressive. Being able to control and read out that many individual nuclear spins is a significant technical achievement. What are some of the potential applications that researchers are exploring with this capability?","570":"That's a great point. The increased number of scientists and researchers working on various fields can definitely lead to more breakthroughs and advancements in the coming years. With more minds and perspectives collaborating, the potential for innovation and new discoveries is really exciting.","571":"Well, that's a great question. The idea of infinity is quite profound and counterintuitive in a lot of ways. When we start to think about the mathematical properties of infinity, some very strange and surprising things start to emerge.","572":"Exactly! That's the key insight - adding one to infinity still gives you infinity. The new guest can be accommodated in room number one, because even though we've shifted everyone else down one room, there are still infinitely many rooms available.","573":"Exactly. Two plus infinity is still just infinity. No matter how many guests you add, the total number of guests is always going to be equal to infinity.","574":"No, they can't live together. The two Hilbert's Hotels are separate establishments. We need to find a way to accommodate the guests from the hotel with the plumbing issues in the other Hilbert's Hotel.","575":"Exactly, that's right. If I keep moving the guests up one room at a time, I can create an infinite number of new spaces, even though the hotel is already full. The key insight is that even though the hotel has an infinite number of rooms, each guest can only occupy a finite number of them.","576":"Exactly, so if we have two Hilbert Hotels, each with infinitely many guests, then the total number of guests in both hotels is still just infinity. The size of infinity doesn't change, even when you double it or add more infinities to it. That's one of the strange properties of infinity in mathematics.","577":"Infinity is a fascinating and mind-bending concept in mathematics. It challenges our intuitions about the nature of numbers and the behavior of the universe. Hilbert's Hotel is a thought experiment that really illustrates how infinity can lead to some surprising and counterintuitive results. It's a great way to get a feel for the strange properties of the infinite.","578":"Okay, that's a pretty common view. But the internet is actually much more than just a place to search and watch videos. It's a global network of interconnected computers and devices that allows for the exchange of information and communication on a massive scale. It's fundamentally changed the way we live, work, and access information.","579":"Oh, that's a great movie! What do you like most about it?","580":"That's a good initial guess. The video would typically take a more direct path through the network, rather than going through multiple intermediary steps. The network is designed to find the most efficient route to get the data from one point to another.","581":"Well, that's a great question. The reason the internet doesn't just go directly from one point to another is that it needs to be able to adapt to different circumstances. The internet is designed to be resilient, so if one route is unavailable or congested, the data can take a different path to get to its destination.","582":"Exactly! Having multiple paths can provide redundancy and resilience. If one path is down or congested, you can take an alternative route. This helps ensure the information or data can still reach its destination, even if one of the routes is unavailable.","583":"Lettuce is a type of vegetable that is commonly used in salads and sandwiches. It's a green, leafy plant that is low in calories and high in nutrients.","584":"I was just thinking about the time we worked together at that telecom company. Did you find it as frustrating as I did?","585":"That's a really interesting point. The increasing proximity between end users and major cloud providers does seem to be enabling more software-defined control over the entire network path. It's almost like the internet is becoming more of a closed, vertically-integrated system in some ways, rather than the open, decentralized network it was originally envisioned as.","586":"That's a great point. The internet is really a decentralized system with a lot of autonomy for individual networks. While there are some common standards and protocols, each country or network operator can still have a lot of control over what happens within their own sphere of influence.","587":"So in a sense, each country has a lot of autonomy in how they choose to manage the internet and flow of information within their borders.","588":"That's right. The ability to infer and make guesses is a powerful skill, especially when it comes to understanding complex topics and systems. What areas are you most interested in or excited about when it comes to the convergence of different technologies?","589":"Absolutely, you hit the nail on the head. The combination of wireless, networking, and cloud technologies is enabling a new paradigm where applications can be deployed closer to the end-users, providing lower latency, higher bandwidth, and more responsive interactions. This is critical for applications that need to react in real-time and interface with the physical world, where safety and reliability are paramount.","590":"Absolutely, you've highlighted some really key points there. 5G is not just about faster download speeds, but about enabling a whole new set of applications and use cases that weren't possible before. The low latency and tight integration of compute and connectivity is a game-changer.","591":"Well, black holes are incredibly dense objects with such strong gravitational pull that not even light can escape them. Their properties have led to some fascinating theories about the nature of the universe and space-time.","592":"Okay, great! I'll show you how we can use an electric guitar to simulate the sound of two black holes merging. The idea is that the vibrations of the guitar strings can represent the ripples in spacetime caused by the motion of black holes. Let's start by plucking the strings and see if you can hear the pattern of the black hole merger.","593":"That's a great definition of a function. A function is a special kind of relation that has a unique output for each input. The input and output can be numbers, letters, or other mathematical objects. The key property of a function is that for any given input, there is exactly one corresponding output.","594":"Exactly! We can match negative one with two, negative two with three, negative three with four, and so on. This way, we can create a one-to-one correspondence between the integers and the natural numbers, showing that they have the same size of infinity.","595":"Exactly right! That's a great observation. The positive integers would indeed correspond to the odd rational numbers, and the negative integers would correspond to the even rational numbers. Now, let's think about how we might be able to map all the natural numbers to the rational numbers in a systematic way.","596":"Ah, that's a great observation! You're absolutely right. The key insight is that we can pair up each rational number with a unique pair of integers. This allows us to establish a bijection between the set of rational numbers and the set of natural numbers.","597":"Yes, that's exactly right. Each rational number can be represented by a unique pair of integers, where the first integer represents the numerator and the second integer represents the denominator. This allows us to establish a bijection between the set of rational numbers and the set of ordered pairs of integers, which means that the cardinalities of these two sets are the same.","598":"Exactly! The rational numbers, which can be represented as fractions of integers, can be put in correspondence with the natural numbers using this encoding. It reveals that the size of the rational numbers is the same as the size of the natural numbers, even though we might have thought there were more rationals than naturals.","599":"I'm glad you find it surprising. The fact that the size of infinity of the rational numbers is the same as the size of infinity of the natural numbers is truly counterintuitive. It goes against our usual way of thinking about numbers and infinity.","600":"You're absolutely right, the real numbers are much larger than the previous collections we've discussed. The reason is that the real numbers cannot be put into a one-to-one correspondence with the natural numbers or the integers or the rationals. In other words, the real numbers are a larger infinity than the previous infinities we've seen.","601":"Precisely. That's the key insight. No matter what number I form, it will always differ from at least one number on the list. And that means this new number I've constructed is not on the list. So we've constructed a new number not contained in the original list, which means the list cannot possibly be exhaustive or contain all the real numbers.","602":"This result has some really profound implications. It shows that there is no way to neatly organize all of the real numbers in a one-to-one correspondence with the natural numbers. The real numbers are simply too numerous and too complex to be captured by a simple counting process.","603":"That's a really good point. The training time can vary significantly depending on the size and complexity of the neural network model. Even with powerful hardware, some more advanced models can take days or even weeks to train.","604":"Well, the key idea with quantum computing is that instead of just having a simple binary system of 0 or 1, we can actually take advantage of the quantum properties of particles to create a system that can be in a superposition of multiple states at the same time. This allows us to potentially perform certain computations much more efficiently than classical computers.","605":"In a quantum computer, the fundamental unit of information is the qubit, which is a quantum mechanical system that can exist in a superposition of two states. Unlike classical bits, which can only be in a 0 or 1 state, qubits can be in a superposition of these states, allowing them to represent and process information in a fundamentally different way.","606":"So in a quantum computer, we can take advantage of these quantum states to perform computations in a very different way from a classical computer.","607":"Well, to encode information in a quantum computer, we need to use quantum bits or 'qubits' instead of classical bits. These qubits can be represented by the spin states of individual atoms or the polarization states of photons. We can then manipulate these qubits using various quantum operations, such as applying magnetic fields or using microwave signals, to process information.","608":"Deterministic algorithms are those where the output is guaranteed to be the same for a given input, regardless of the specific execution. This is in contrast to probabilistic algorithms where the output can vary even with the same input.","609":"The algorithms that are being developed for near-term quantum computers tend to be much more specialized and tailored to the specific capabilities of the hardware that's available today. Things like quantum variational algorithms, quantum optimization algorithms, and quantum machine learning algorithms are all examples of the kinds of quantum algorithms that are being explored for these near-term devices.","610":"Absolutely, those are great examples of quantum computing applications.

fascinating! What was it about barbershop quartet and playing the violin that first sparked your interest in music? I'd love to hear more about your musical journey and what inspired you to get involved in those genres.","1":"That's a fascinating observation about the overtone series. It really highlights the hidden complexity and richness of sound. When a chord is perfectly tuned, those unexpected overtones that emerge can create an almost ethereal, additional layer of melody within the harmony. It's a beautiful phenomenon that I think speaks to the incredible depth and nuance of music. Your insights into this concept are really insightful.","2":null,"3":"Absolutely, let me demonstrate what I mean. The F major chord is made up of the notes F, A, and C. If we take those same three notes and rearrange them, we get the inverted chord of A, C, and F. Listen how that changes the sound, even though it's built on the same notes. Let me play through that for you.","4":"That's an interesting chord. It has a rich, full sound that can create a lot of possibilities. As you mentioned, when there are so many options, it's important to focus on what you want to say emotionally with the music. Sometimes it's best to start simple and let the emotional message guide the arrangement.","5":null,"6":"I see what you mean. The way a musical piece is presented can really shape how the listener perceives and feels about it. Changing the instrumentation, tempo, or even the key signature can dramatically alter the emotional impact, even if the underlying melody remains the same. It's interesting how subtle shifts in context can transform the entire mood and meaning of a familiar song or musical passage.","7":null,"8":null,"9":"That's a really insightful way to look at chess. I'm intrigued by how you've highlighted the key elements of time, space, and harmony. The idea of harmony as the ultimate goal is fascinating. Could you expand on that a bit more? It's interesting to think about how harmony can sometimes trump material advantage or tactical superiority.","10":"I see myself as a thoughtful and adaptable player. I try to focus on solid fundamentals and capitalize on opportunities, but I also enjoy mixing things up and keeping my opponent guessing. My goal is always to learn and improve my game. I'm looking forward to our blitz match - I think our contrasting styles will make for an interesting and fun matchup.","11":null,"12":"The Fiancetto is an interesting and underrated opening.

However, I'm curious to hear more about your thoughts on the topic. What makes you think time travel to the future could be a reality?","21":"That's an interesting question about the relationship between the brain and muscles in musical performance. I've always been curious about that myself. As a musician, do you feel like a lot of the learning and dexterity involved comes from the physical connections and muscle memory, or is it more of a cognitive process happening in the brain? I'd be really interested to hear your perspective on that.","22":null,"23":"The dust is located in the outer parts of the accretion disk, further away from the black hole. By observing the time delay between the initial optical\/UV flash and the subsequent infrared emission, we can map out the location of the dust and the overall structure of the accretion disk around the black hole.","24":null,"25":null,"26":"That's a fascinating concept! Can you elaborate on how we should think of the four dimensions of spacetime, and how that differs from the more familiar three-dimensional space and one-dimensional time? I'm really curious to understand this better.","27":null,"28":null,"29":null,"30":null,"31":"Absolutely, that's a great way to think about it. Einstein's theory of relativity shows that our experience and perception of time is not absolute, but rather depends on our motion and position in spacetime. The clock that each individual carries with them is a personal measurement of time that can differ from the 'universal clock' of the universe as a whole. It's a fascinating concept that really challenges our intuitive understanding of time.","32":"That's right, the proper time is the fundamental time that is measured locally by the observer or clock along a particular trajectory. It's the intrinsic time experienced by something moving through spacetime, rather than the time observed from the outside. This helps explain how time can pass differently for two observers in different frames of reference.","33":null,"34":null,"35":"You're absolutely right, the train paradox is a wonderful way to illustrate the core ideas behind relativity. The fact that different observers can have different perceptions of motion and acceleration depending on their frame of reference is really the essence of Einstein's groundbreaking theory. Explaining it through a relatable example like that helps make the complex concepts much more accessible and understandable.","36":null,"37":null,"38":null,"39":null,"40":null,"41":"I agree. Building trust and addressing concerns about security, reliability, and usability will be crucial for wider adoption of blockchain technology. Educating the public and working with enterprises to create a user-friendly experience will be important next steps.","42":null,"43":null,"44":"Okay, let's start folding these rectangles to demonstrate the rigidity you mentioned. This will help us understand the properties of origami mechanisms more clearly.","45":null,"46":"That's right. The folding pattern is engineered to enable the panels to deploy evenly and smoothly once in space, with just a minimal amount of mechanical assistance. The precise angles and design of the folds are critical to ensure the array unfurls at a controlled and uniform rate.","47":null,"48":null,"49":"You're absolutely right. Folding structures like this are really useful for space applications where you need to pack things compactly for launch, but then have them deploy and expand once in space. Being able to fold something up and then unfold it into its full size is a great way to maximize the limited space on a spacecraft. It allows you to send up more capability in a smaller package.","50":"That's a great question! Sleep is so important for our physical and mental well-being. What do you find most interesting or valuable about sleep? I'd love to hear your thoughts.","51":null,"52":null,"53":null,"54":"That's a really good point. Going to bed earlier can help your brain cycle through those deeper levels of sleep, which is so important for things like memory and emotional processing. Having that consistent sleep schedule can make a big difference.","55":null,"56":null,"57":null,"58":"Wonderful, this plasma ball is a fantastic way to see a plasma in action. You'll notice the charged particles within the ball responding to the electric field and creating those mesmerizing tendrils of light. Let me know if you have any other questions about plasmas or this demonstration - I'd be happy to explain further and explore this fascinating state of matter together.","59":null,"60":null,"61":null,"62":null,"63":null,"64":null,"65":null,"66":"You're absolutely right. The deuterium-tritium fusion reaction has a higher probability or cross-section for the reaction to occur compared to just hydrogen fusion. This is a key advantage that allows us to achieve fusion at lower temperatures and energies. The challenge, however, is maintaining that high-temperature, dense plasma state, as the hotter the plasma becomes, the more likely it is for the heat to get extracted from the system.","67":"Maintaining the high temperature and density of the plasma for the required amount of time is a key challenge in fusion energy. Some of the challenges include preventing the plasma from cooling down too quickly, ensuring efficient confinement of the plasma, and managing heat and particle exhaust. Addressing these technical issues is crucial for achieving the sustained high-temperature plasma conditions needed for viable fusion power generation.","68":null,"69":null,"70":null,"71":null,"72":null,"73":null,"74":"Absolutely, this is a field that requires a scientific approach. We've made significant progress in moving past the initial hype and speculation, and now the focus is on rigorous research, experimentation, and developing practical real-world applications. There's still a lot of work to be done, but we're on the right track in terms of solidifying the underlying science and technology.","75":null,"76":null,"77":null,"78":null,"79":"Okay, got it. Add another dimension at a right angle to the first two - let's see if I can wrap my head around that!","80":"I understand it may seem impossible, but try to visualize holding the objects at right angles to each other. Even if you can't physically do it, the thought experiment helps demonstrate the three-dimensional nature of space.","81":"I see what you're getting at. If we have three vectors that are mutually perpendicular, adding a fourth vector that is also perpendicular to the other three would allow us to represent a four-dimensional space. That's an interesting concept - it's hard for me to fully visualize, but I understand the mathematical principle you're describing.","82":null,"83":null,"84":"That's an interesting point about time being considered an extra dimension. Are you familiar with any of the theories that propose the existence of additional spatial dimensions beyond the three we can directly perceive? I'd be curious to hear your thoughts on what kinds of evidence scientists might look for to detect the presence of these hypothetical extra dimensions.","85":"The concept of extra dimensions beyond the three spatial dimensions and one time dimension is an interesting idea in physics. While we don't know for certain how many dimensions there may be, some theories suggest there could be additional microscopic dimensions that are difficult to observe directly. However, the precise number and nature of these extra dimensions is an open question that requires further research and exploration.","86":null,"87":"We have these highly accurate scientific theories, like quantum mechanics and general relativity, that work remarkably well at explaining the physical world. But when we try to reconcile these theories, they seem to break down. And that leaves us with a deep mystery that we're still working to solve.","88":"That's fascinating to hear!

So the choices you make are really the product of your life journey, even if the way they manifest can be quite unexpected or abrupt. Your experiences and perspectives have been steadily shaping the path you're on, even if the turns it takes may surprise you at times. There's a certain harmony to that process, isn't there - a logic to how your choices unfold, even if they don't always follow a predictable pattern.","97":"I can understand why that would have unsettled you. Haunting experiences like that can really stick with you, can't they? Chris Anderson has such a wealth of knowledge on these kinds of topics - I'd be really interested to hear more about what you learned from him and how it relates to your own spooky encounter.","98":"That's really interesting, I'm curious to hear more about the tension and push and pull you're describing. What is it about that dynamic that you find so compelling? I'd love to understand your perspective better.","99":"Yes, that's a great way to put it. The way the music builds and evolves, with that underlying foundation, creates a sense of inevitability and rightness, like it was always meant to be that way. It's almost like a magnetic pull, drawing you in and making you feel like you're right where you're supposed to be.","100":"That's a great choice. Amazing Grace has such a timeless and powerful message. The way it's been covered and adapted by so many different artists over the years really speaks to its universal appeal, don't you think?

But I'm really glad I took the chance and joined the team at the lab. The work has been fascinating, and the change of scenery has been refreshing. How have you been settling in since you started there?","112":"Absolutely, my time there was quite impactful. I was able to make some valuable contributions during my tenure, and I feel I left a meaningful mark on the work being done.

While it can be challenging to discuss change without invoking time, there may be other ways to approach it. For instance, you could focus on the differences in your knowledge, skills, or perspective between two points, without explicitly referencing the time in between. The key is finding alternative ways to convey the evolution without relying solely on temporal language.","150":null,"151":null,"152":null,"153":null,"154":null,"155":null,"156":null,"157":null,"158":null,"159":"That's really interesting that science is your favorite subject!

On Earth, gravity and the curvature of the planet's surface would cause you to start falling downwards if you just kept going in a straight line. The Earth's shape and gravitational pull means that 'going straight' in a global sense isn't actually possible - you'd end up curving back down towards the planet's surface.","189":"Oh, I could tell you really understood what I was saying back there. That's great.","190":"You know, I'm constantly amazed by how quickly technology is evolving and reshaping our world.

So having your contacts organized in a list makes it easier for you to find and connect with the people you know. That makes a lot of sense. What made you decide to structure your contacts that way? Do you find it helps you stay more organized and on top of your communications?","193":"That's a good point. If your friend's name is near the bottom of the list, it could take a while to scroll all the way down to find them. A more efficient approach would be to look for the section where the names starting with your friend's first initial are listed. That way, you can quickly narrow down your search instead of having to go through the whole list.","194":null,"195":null,"196":"That's an interesting idea. Using a mixed approach of scanning pages in batches initially, then switching to single-page checks near the target section, could be an effective way to balance speed and accuracy. It allows you to cover ground quickly at first, then double-check at the end to ensure you don't miss anything important. I think that's a clever compromise that's worth exploring further.","197":"Hmm, good question. Since you're now in the K section, the J section should be just before that, so I imagine John's name would be to the left, towards the beginning of the book. Why don't you take a look and see if you can find it? I'm curious to hear what you discover.","198":null,"199":"Yes, that's exactly right. The key idea is to repeatedly divide the problem in half and discard the half that doesn't contain the information you're looking for. This binary search approach allows you to quickly narrow down to the right page without having to go through all of them individually. It's a very efficient way to find what you need, even in a large set of data.","200":"Okay, so with this divide-and-conquer algorithm, if we started with a thousand pages, how many steps do you think it would take to get down to a single page?","201":null,"202":null,"203":null,"204":"That's a great question!

It's an exciting area of neuroscience that aims to better understand how the complex wiring of our brains enables cognition, memory, and behavior.","218":"That's right, our bodies are made up of tiny cells that work together to form all the different parts and systems. These cells come in many specialized types, like skin cells, muscle cells, and nerve cells, each with its own important functions. It's really amazing how all these microscopic building blocks come together to create a fully-functioning human being!","219":null,"220":"You know, I find it really fascinating how even the simplest of systems can exhibit such surprising and counterintuitive behaviors when you introduce certain topological features. It just goes to show how the combination of simple elements can lead to complex and unexpected dynamics. I'm always amazed by how much we can learn about the world by exploring these kinds of basic systems.","221":"Yeah, it was really surprising that even in this simple setup, you could get that kind of exotic signaling behavior. The ability to send signals backwards in time, or at least receive signals from the future, is just wild. I never would have expected that from such a basic model.","222":"That's right. Einstein's theory of special relativity showed that even without breaking any rules, high-speed travel can lead to some surprising effects. Things like signals being able to travel back in time, from the perspective of the fast-moving observer. It's a really counterintuitive consequence of how space and time get distorted at those extreme speeds.","223":null,"224":null,"225":null,"226":"That's a really insightful example of a side channel vulnerability. The Rowhammer issue you described highlights how unexpected interactions between different components of a system can introduce serious security risks, even when the core functionality is sound. It's a great reminder that we need to look at the whole system, not just individual parts, to really understand and address potential vulnerabilities.","227":"I see what you mean. Wireless connectivity does bring some additional security considerations, but there are ways to mitigate the risks. The most important thing is to make sure you're using a secure network configuration and keeping your devices and software up-to-date. That way you can enjoy the benefits of wireless while still protecting your information.","228":null,"229":"I completely agree. That trend is really concerning to me. Consumers should have the right to inspect and maintain their own property, even if it's something they purchased from a company. Trying to restrict that access seems like an overreach that could set a troubling precedent.","230":null,"231":"That's really interesting!

Can you tell me more about how that shape might relate to the structure and topology of the cosmos? I'd love to understand the parallels you see between a donut and the larger universe.","241":"I can appreciate that approach. Diving deep into the underlying principles and really grasping the fundamentals is so important, especially for subjects like relativity that can seem quite abstract at first. It's great that you're taking the time to truly understand the concepts instead of just trying to memorize the material. That curiosity and drive to learn is admirable.","242":null,"243":"Okay, perfect. I can walk you through the essentials of how to play chess from the beginning.

Sound good?","244":null,"245":null,"246":null,"247":null,"248":null,"249":"The king's position is certainly an important factor to consider. What other tactical ideas or threats might be available to you in this position? Identifying potential checks or captures could be a good starting point for finding a strong move.","250":"Yes, that's the right idea. With your king so far advanced, I can give you a check on e4 with my bishop. That will force your king to move, and then we can consider our next moves from there.","251":"Ah, a bold move taking the rook! I must say, I'm impressed by your tactical thinking. This game is turning out to be quite the challenge. Let me ponder my next step carefully - I have a few ideas brewing that I think you'll find quite intriguing.","252":null,"253":null,"254":null,"255":"You make a good point about the technological advancements enabling more immersive gaming experiences. However, I think it's important to also recognize the creativity and artistry of game developers, as they are the ones who bring those technical capabilities to life in meaningful and engaging ways.

That's a great analogy. Just like the nail needs to be centered and focused to be able to easily go into the wood, the laser beam also needs to be concentrated and focused in order to have enough power to cut through a material like steel. The lens helps concentrate the light into a small, powerful beam that can then effectively cut through the target material.","266":null,"267":"Yes, that's correct. A lens works by bending and focusing the light down to a much smaller, concentrated area, just like a magnifying glass does.","268":null,"269":null,"270":null,"271":"Great, I'm excited to dive in!

The spinning ride at the amusement park is a perfect example of how centrifugal force can counteract gravity, just like what keeps the International Space Station in orbit. As long as the station maintains its high speed, the pull of Earth's gravity keeps it circling around instead of falling back down. It's a really fascinating concept.","286":"That's a great example of how our perception of motion can be relative. It really depends on our frame of reference. Without any fixed external reference points, it can be very difficult to determine whether we are the ones moving or if the other object is moving. It's all about the relative motion between us and the other object.","287":null,"288":null,"289":null,"290":null,"291":null,"292":"The key idea is that if you have a small amount of matter or energy in a localized region, it can cause the space to deform and spontaneously create a compact extra dimension.

So how do the properties of black branes differ from those of more familiar black holes? What unique features or behavior do they exhibit that set them apart?","295":"That's a great observation. The non-singular brane solutions we've been studying can indeed support a variety of transverse geometries, not just anti-de Sitter space. This really expands the range of possible cosmological solutions we can construct by combining the brane with different compactified dimensions. It provides us with a lot more flexibility to model different scenarios.","296":"Well, the idea is that these kinds of configurations, where the universe just keeps going at a fixed size instead of collapsing or expanding, might be especially stable or common. Maybe they have some special property, like the lowest energy or action, that makes them the most likely states for the universe to end up in.","297":"The transverse dimensions can have a variety of cosmological constants - positive, zero, or negative. These configurations with different cosmological constants are not necessarily the ones with the absolute lowest action, but they tend to be the most stable and likely to occur in nature. The ones with the lowest action may be less probable from an observational standpoint.","298":null,"299":"That's a fascinating topic.

I'm eager to find an interesting position we can analyze together in more depth.","306":"I see what you mean. The slight edge for White is probably because their pieces are a bit more developed. So Black's main focus should be finding a good way to get their bishop out without creating any weaknesses. What do you think might be a good plan for Black to try here?","307":"That's a good observation. Before we think about developing the bishop, it would be helpful to first understand your opponent's plans and threats. What do you see in the position that might indicate what your opponent is trying to achieve? Identifying that can help guide our next move.","308":null,"309":null,"310":"You make a good point. By playing that pawn move, I've activated my bishop and created a bit of a skewer on your pieces. However, I don't necessarily have to capture your pawn right away.

The Earth's gravity is a major factor, but the Sun's gravity also plays a significant role in how we and the other planets orbit around it.","316":"That's a good point about the Moon's gravity causing the ocean tides on Earth. The Moon's pull is the primary driver of this regular rise and fall of the tides that we observe along the coasts.","317":null,"318":null,"319":"The lack of gravity in space can have some interesting effects on the human body. Astronauts often report that their spines elongate slightly while in orbit, since the constant pull of gravity is no longer compressing their vertebrae. This temporary increase in height is just one of the physiological adaptations the body undergoes in the microgravity environment.","320":"That's really interesting about the effects of microgravity on the body. I can see how the absence of gravity would allow the spine to expand without being compressed. It's amazing how the human body can adapt to such different environments.

The key idea is that the particles are constantly gyrating, or rotating, around the magnetic field lines at a high frequency. By averaging out this rapid gyration, we can simplify the model and study the overall dynamics of the particle motion more effectively.","330":"The key point is that we're looking at how quickly the charged particles orbit around the magnetic field lines. This 'gyro frequency' gives us a sense of the timescales of the turbulent structures and flows in the plasma. Understanding these turbulent dynamics is crucial for analyzing the overall transport of heat and particles, which is a major challenge in fusion energy research.","331":"That's really interesting that you study the cerebellum.

More complex models with a lot of parameters often take much longer to train, even with high-performance hardware. It's not uncommon for the training process to stretch on for days or even weeks in some cases. The sheer scale of the computations involved can be quite substantial.","604":null,"605":"In a quantum computer, the fundamental unit is the qubit, which can exist in a superposition of 0 and 1 states. This allows qubits to represent and process information differently than classical bits, which can only be in a single state at a time. The ability to exploit quantum phenomena like superposition enables quantum computers to approach certain types of problems in novel ways.","606":"You're absolutely right. In a quantum computer, we can leverage these unique quantum states to perform computations in a fundamentally different way than classical computers. The ability to manipulate and control quantum systems opens up an entirely new frontier in information processing that could lead to breakthroughs we can hardly imagine today.","607":"To encode information in a quantum computer, we use quantum bits or 'qubits' rather than classical bits. These qubits can represent the spin states of individual atoms or the polarization of photons. We can then manipulate the qubits using quantum operations like applying magnetic fields or microwave signals, which allows us to process information in unique ways compared to classical computers.","608":null,"609":null,"610":"That's a great point. Quantum computing is still in its early stages, so there are lots of exciting opportunities for grad students like yourself to get involved. The hardware and algorithms are actively being developed, and there's a lot of room for new ideas and contributions. What sort of areas are you most interested in or curious about? I'd be happy to share some of the current challenges and ways you could potentially get
